        <h3>Discussion: Failed Induction of Labour and options</h3>
        <li>Options:</li>
        <ol>
            <l1>Further induction with Propess or Prostin - risks: increased risk of uterine hyperstimulation, possible fetal distress, benefits: can lead to a successful vaginal delivery, avoiding surgical intervention.</li>
            <li>Rest day: risks: Delay in delivery may increase risk of complications, particularly if there are existing maternal or fetal concerns; benefits: provides time for the cervix to ripen naturally, potentially leading to a more successful subsequent induction.</li>
            <li>Caesarean section. Risks: surgical risks including infection, bleeding, and longer recovery period; benefits: urgent (usually Cat 3) delivery which can be beneficial in certain medical situations.</li>
