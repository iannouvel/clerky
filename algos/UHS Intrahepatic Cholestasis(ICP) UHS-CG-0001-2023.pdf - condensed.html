<h1>UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To provide clinical guidance to obstetric medical staff and midwives on the diagnosis and management of ICP.</p>

<h2>Prevalence and Aetiology</h2>
<p>ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and 1.2% –1.5% of women/people of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian origin. The prevalence is affected by genetics, racial background, and environmental factors.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<ol>
<li>Consider ICP in pregnant women/people with itching in skin of normal appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.</li>
<li>Conduct liver function tests and bile acid measurement in women with persistent itching and no other apparent cause.</li>
<li>Carry out a structured history and examination if ICP is suspected, to exclude other causes of itching and liver dysfunction.</li>
<li>Confirm ICP diagnosis in the postnatal period, with resolution of itching and liver function tests returning to normal.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Management</h2>
<ol>
<li>ICP cases may require consultant led care, weekly BA & LFTs measurements, and regular checks for other conditions that may alter LFTs.</li>
<li>Drug treatment includes topical emollient for relief of pruritus and antihistamine agents. Ursodeoxycholic acid should not be prescribed routinely.</li>
<li>Timing of birth should be planned by a Consultant obstetrician, considering co-morbidities and peak BA concentration.</li>
<li>Intrapartum care: Decision on continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) should be made based on co-morbidities, preferences and peak bile acids.</li>
<li>Postnatal care: Itch usually stops after birth and LFTs and B As should return to normal within a few weeks. BAs and LFTs should be checked at 4 weeks post birth.</li>
<li>Subsequent pregnancies: A baseline liver function test and bile acid concentration should be performed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Audit</h2>
<p>RCOG suggested audit questions include proportion of pregnant women with raised bile acid concentrations offered timing of birth, having additional investigations, offered ursodeoxycholic acid, and offered CEFM during labour.</p>
