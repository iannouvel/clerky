    All women with a twin pregnancy should have an ultrasound examination between 11+0 weeks and 13+6 weeks to assess fetal viability, gestational age, and chorionicity. Chorionicity should be determined based on the number of placental masses and membrane appearance before 14 weeks of gestation. Fetal ultrasound assessments should occur every 2 weeks from 16+0 weeks onwards until delivery. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities should be offered, with additional monitoring for specific complications such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Treatment for conditions like TTTS should be managed in fetal medicine centers with specialist expertise. Delivery of monochorionic twins should be discussed and elective delivery offered from 36+0 weeks. In cases of single twin demise, referral to a fetal medicine center is recommended for assessment and management. Monitoring for fetal anaemia after intrauterine death can be done using Doppler ultrasonography. MCMA twins should be delivered by caesarean section between 32+0 and 34+0 weeks. Higher order multiple pregnancies with monochorionicity have higher fetal loss rates and may require selective reduction. Discordant abnormalities in monochorionic pregnancies should be promptly assessed and managed in fetal medicine centers.
