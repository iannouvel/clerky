            initial: "Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a chronic pain syndrome and the principles of management of chronic pain should be used for the initial assessment of this condition. A thorough medical history should be taken and physical examination performed. A bladder diary should be completed. A food diary may be used to identify if specific foods cause a flare-up of symptoms. Urine should be tested to rule out a urinary tract infection. In those with a suspicion of urological malignancy, urine cytology should be tested. Cystoscopy and referral to urology should be initiated in accordance with local protocols.",
            diagnosis: "BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion and other conditions should be excluded. Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for the diagnosis of BPS. Cystoscopy does not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of BPS, but is required to diagnose/exclude other conditions that mimic BPS. Potassium sensitivity test, urodynamic assessment, and urinary biomarkers should not be used in the diagnosis of BPS. Clinicians should use a validated symptom score to assess baseline severity of BPS. Patients with BPS can have low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life.",
            "initial-management": "Dietary modification can be beneficial and avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and acidic foods and drinks should be considered. Stress management and regular exercise may be recommended. Analgesia is recommended for the symptom of pelvic or bladder pain. Oral amitriptyline or cimetidine may be considered when first-line conservative treatments have failed.",
            "intravesical-treatments": "Options include intravesical lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), heparin, and chondroitin sulfate.",
            "further-treatment": "Further options should only be considered after referral to a pain clinic and discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. Cystoscopic fulguration and laser treatment, neuromodulation, oral cyclosporin A, and major surgery may be considered in refractory BPS.",
            "not-recommended": "Oral hydroxyzine and pentosan polysulfate are not recommended for BPS. Long-term antibiotics, intravesical resiniferatoxin, intravesical Bacillus Calmette â€“Gu/C19erin, high-pressure long-duration hydrodistension, and long-term oral glucocorticoids are therapies that are not recommended for BPS.",
            "further-management": "Patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment should be referred to secondary care. Referral to a physiotherapist and psychological support may be considered for patients with refractory BPS. Patients should be given written information about patient organizations that provide evidence-based information.",
            "long-term": "Patients should be followed up periodically in secondary care with consideration for shared care between the pain team and urogynaecology until symptoms become controlled. BPS is commonly associated with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and autoimmune diseases. Clinical history should include location of pain, relationship to bladder filling and emptying, trigger factors, onset, and description of pain. Physical examination should rule out bladder distension, hernias, and painful trigger points. Baseline investigations include bladder diary, food diary, urine testing for UTI, and consideration of other infections. Differential diagnoses should be excluded, including malignancy, infection, overactive bladder, and pelvic organ prolapse. Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Conservative treatments include dietary modifications, stress management, regular exercise, and analgesia. Pharmacological treatments may include oral amitriptyline or cimetidine if conservative treatments fail."
