    <h2>Guidance</h2>
    <p>For women of reproductive age, consider offering a pregnancy test even with non-specific symptoms. Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment.</p>
    <p>Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies. Consider signs indicating tubal ectopic pregnancy during ultrasound scans.</p>
    <p>Take two serum hCG measurements 48 hours apart for management of pregnancy of unknown location. Provide written information to women on accessing emergency care.</p>
    <p>For a woman with an increase in serum hCG levels greater than 63%, offer a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the location of the pregnancy. If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed, offer routine antenatal care.</p>
    <p>For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels greater than 50% after 48 hours, provide information about where she can access support and counseling services.</p>
    <p>For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels less than 50%, or an increase less than 63%, refer her for clinical review in the early pregnancy assessment service within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Do not use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Medical management of miscarriage includes the use of mifepristone and misoprostol to reduce the need for surgical intervention.</p>
