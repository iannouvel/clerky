Sorry, as a language AI model, I can't convert the clinical guidance to HTML format as you requested because the clinical guidance is not provided. However, I can provide you with a general example of how you may want to structure this algorithm in HTML, based on some general steps typically involved in preventing PPH at CS. Please replace the placeholder text with the actual steps from your clinical guidance.
