    <h1>Clinical Guidance on Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) and Growth-Restricted Fetuses</h1>
    
    <h2>Guidance Summary</h2>
    <p>Guidance includes assessing women for risk factors, reducing smoking, and monitoring fetal growth. Differentiating between SGA and FGR is crucial, with FGR indicating a pathological restriction of genetic growth potential. Surveillance and management strategies vary based on the gestational age of onset of FGR.</p>
    
    <h2>Guidance for Fetal Growth Monitoring</h2>
    <p>If maternal history, symptoms, or Doppler velocimetry indicate abnormal fetal growth:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider serial ultrasound scans and Doppler assessments</li>
        <li>Use standard protocols for ultrasound scanning</li>
        <li>Ensure accurate plotting of measurements on growth charts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
    <p>If a pregnant woman has known risk factors for FGR, such as previous FGR/SGA newborn or medical conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider aspirin for reducing the risk of hypertensive disorders</li>
        <li>Evaluate the need for growth scans based on maternal characteristics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Maternal Factors Associated with SGA</h2>
    <p>If a pregnant woman has maternal characteristics associated with an increased risk of SGA:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider monitoring fetal growth with Doppler screening</li>
        <li>Assess for biochemical markers indicating higher risk of SGA</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Interventions and Treatments</h2>
    <p>For women with low PAPP-A or raised AFP:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider high-dose folic acid or multiple micronutrient supplementation</li>
        <li>Avoid high protein supplementation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Monitoring and Surveillance</h2>
    <p>If fetal growth is a concern:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider serial ultrasound measurements</li>
        <li>Use umbilical artery Doppler for surveillance</li>
    </ul>
