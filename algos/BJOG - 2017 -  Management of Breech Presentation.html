      Management of Breech Presentation:<br>
      If a woman has a breech presentation at term, then she should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) unless there is an absolute contraindication. If ECV is not possible, then she should be informed about the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery. If a woman chooses planned caesarean section, then there is a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. If appropriate pregnancies are selected and skilled intrapartum care is provided, then planned vaginal breech birth can be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. If antenatal assessment and the skill and experience of the birth attendant are considered, then the safety of vaginal breech delivery is increased. If there is evidence of poor fetal condition during delivery, then assistance without traction is required. If simulation equipment is used to rehearse skills, then the risk of complications during vaginal breech birth is reduced. If a strict management protocol is followed and skilled birth attendants are present, then the risk of complications is further minimized.<br><br>
      If a woman with breech presentation at term is counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section, then she can make an informed decision. If planned caesarean section is chosen, then there is a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. If clinicians provide unbiased counselling, then women can properly understand the risks involved. If planned caesarean section is chosen, then there is a small increase in immediate complications for the mother. If caesarean section is performed, then there is an increased risk of complications in future pregnancies. If women are informed about the risks of stillbirth for subsequent babies associated with caesarean section, then they can make an informed decision.<br><br>
      If factors affecting the safety of vaginal breech birth are considered, including antenatal assessment, skill and experience of the birth attendant, and intrapartum management, then the risk of complications is reduced. If skilled personnel are present during vaginal breech birth, then the risk of complications is further minimized. If a protocol for management is followed, then the chances of early neonatal morbidity are reduced. If assistance without traction is provided during the active second stage of vaginal breech birth, then the risk of fetal trauma is avoided. If delivery using the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver or forceps is performed, then the risk of complications is minimized. If a hands-off approach is used, then the risk of complications is further reduced.<br><br>
      If planned vaginal breech birth is supported by adherence to a strict management protocol and the presence of skilled birth attendants, then the risk of complications is minimized. If future research is conducted on topics such as the all-fours position for vaginal breech birth, the role of pelvimetry, and the effect of epidural analgesia, then further insights can be gained. If documentation is kept regarding discussions on mode of delivery and staff undergo training in vaginal breech delivery, then the quality of care is improved.
