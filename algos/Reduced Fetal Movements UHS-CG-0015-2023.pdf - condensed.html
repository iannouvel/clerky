    <h1>Reduced Fetal Movements Guideline</h1>

    <div class="guideline">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This guideline provides evidence-based guidance for managing pregnant women and people experiencing reduced fetal movements. It aims to ensure that pregnant women and people who report reduced fetal movements are referred and managed safely and appropriately.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guideline">
        <h2>Fetal Movements and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Fetal movements are usually absent during fetal ‘sleep’ cycles, which occur regularly throughout the day and night and usually last for 20-40 minutes. Reduced Fetal Movements are associated with key risk factors such as small-for-gestational age fetus, placental insufficiency, congenital malformations and high risk maternal conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, and chronic kidney disease.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guideline">
        <h2>Managing Reduced Fetal Movements</h2>
        <p>Management of reduced fetal movements is based on gestational age and includes assessments, tests and referrals as detailed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before 24+0 weeks: Full antenatal assessment.</li>
            <li>24+0 to 25+6 weeks: Full antenatal assessment and review any risk factors.</li>
            <li>26+0 weeks onwards: Refer to the Day Assessment Unit for a computerised CTG within 2 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a computerised CTG has been performed and is normal and there are no other indications for an ultrasound scan, then a scan is not required for a first presentation of RFM but should be offered for women reporting recurrent RFM.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guideline">
        <h2>Recurrent Episodes of Reduced Fetal Movements</h2>
        <p>For recurrent episodes of reduced fetal movements from 26 weeks onwards within a 3 week period, follow the steps below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirm fetal viability.</li>
            <li>Assess for risk factors for stillbirth and FGR.</li>
            <li>Ensure anomaly scan has been done.</li>
            <li>Arrange serial growth scans if high risk of FGR.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If CTG is abnormal or there are risk factors with normal CTG, arrange for a growth scan and refer for senior obstetrician review.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="guideline">
        <h2>Discharge and Continuous Monitoring</h2>
        <p>On discharge, women should be signposted back to the Tommy’s leaflet and informed to contact the maternity unit should they perceive a further episode of reduced fetal movements. For women who are not reassured despite normal CTG and USS and cannot feel fetal movements, should be referred to a senior obstetrician for ongoing plan.</p>
        <p>Continuous monitoring in labour is recommended for cases where labour is being induced for RFM. The decision for induction of labour following recurrent episodes of RFM should be made by a senior obstetrician. Induction of labour could be discussed where appropriate with women presenting with a single episode of RFM after 38+6 weeks gestation.</p>
