### Explanation:
1. **HTML Structure**: The page is divided into two columns using a flexbox layout. The left column contains a dropdown menu for selecting the clinical context and a button to display the corresponding guidance. The right column shows the guidance text.
2. **CSS Styling**: Basic styles are applied for readability and layout management. The guidance section has a fixed height with scroll enabled for overflow content.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: The `showGuidance` function updates the guidance text based on the selected option from the dropdown menu. This function is triggered by the "Show Guidance" button.

This HTML page provides an interactive way to navigate through different postnatal care contexts and view relevant guidelines dynamically.
