I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have direct access to external databases or files, so I can't extract text from a specific PDF file named "Reduced Fetal Movements UHS-CG-0015-2023.pdf". However, I can help you to create an HTML based algorithm if you can provide the clinical guidance details that you want to include in the algorithm.
