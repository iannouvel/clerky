I'm an AI language model and I'm unable to access external files like PDFs. However, I can provide you with a basic structure of an HTML algorithm. You would need to fill this structure with the necessary steps from your PDF. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: [Title of Step 1]</h2>
    <p>[Description of Step 1]</p>

    <h2>Step 2: [Title of Step 2]</h2>
    <p>[Description of Step 2]</p>

    <h2>Decision Point: [Title of Decision Point]</h2>
    <p>[Description of Decision Point]</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>If [Condition A]:</b> [Action or Step if Condition A is met]</li>
        <li><b>If [Condition B]:</b> [Action or Step if Condition B is met]</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Add more steps and decision points as necessary -->

    <h2>Final Step: [Title of Final Step]</h2>
    <p>[Description of Final Step]</p>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the placeholders (text inside the square brackets `[]`) with the appropriate steps and decision points from your PDF document. This structure presents a clear and concise algorithm based on the clinical guidance.
