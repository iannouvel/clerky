As an AI, I can't generate an HTML directly in this interface, but I can provide you with an HTML format in plain text that you can use to create your algorithm. 

Consider the following algorithm for unexplained Infertility as per ESHRE guidelines:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>ESHRE - Unexplained Infertility Algorithm</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Unexplained Infertility Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Initial Assessment</h2>
    <p>Start with evaluations such as a detailed medical history, physical examination, semen analysis, ovulation assessment, and confirmation of normal uterus and patent fallopian tubes.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>If all evaluations are normal, the diagnosis is 'unexplained infertility'.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Treatment Options</h2>
    <p>Discuss treatment options which may include: Expectant management, ovarian stimulation (OS), intrauterine insemination (IUI), OS + IUI, or in vitro fertilization (IVF).</p>
    <h2>Step 4: Expectant Management</h2>
    <p>If patient chooses expectant management, assess for a period of up to 24 months before considering other treatments.</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Ovarian Stimulation or Intrauterine Insemination</h2>
    <p>If OS or IUI is chosen, perform for a maximum of 4 cycles. If pregnancy does not occur, consider IVF.</p>
    <h2>Step 6: In Vitro Fertilization</h2>
    <p>If IVF is chosen, or if other treatments fail, perform IVF.</p>

```

This is a very basic algorithm and can be extended or made more complex as per the details of the ESHRE guidelines. Remember to replace the placeholder text with the actual content.
