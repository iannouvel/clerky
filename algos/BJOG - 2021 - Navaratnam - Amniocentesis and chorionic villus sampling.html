  <p>Clinical Advice:</p>
  <p>If considering amniocentesis or CVS, ensure gestational age is after 15 weeks for amniocentesis and after 10 weeks for CVS. If pregnant with multiples, be aware of a slightly higher risk of miscarriage. If planning invasive testing, screen for blood-borne viruses beforehand. If support is needed, ensure appropriate support for women and partners is available. If undergoing the procedures, make sure they are performed by operators with Maternal Fetal Medicine subspecialty training. If interpreting results, do so carefully and in consultation with healthcare providers.</p>
