I'm an AI model and I can't read the specific document you referred to (UHS Intrahepatic Cholestasis(ICP) UHS-CG-0001-2023.pdf). However, I can provide a generic example of how you might structure an algorithm based on a hypothetical clinical guidance about Intrahepatic Cholestasis.

<h2>Intrahepatic Cholestasis Clinical Guidance Algorithm</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Patient presents with symptoms suggestive of ICP</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If Yes, proceed to step 2</li>
      <li>If No, consider other diagnoses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conduct Liver Function Tests (LFT) and Full Blood Count (FBC)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If results are abnormal, proceed to step 3</li>
      <li>If results are normal, monitor patient symptoms and repeat tests if symptoms persist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Perform ultrasound examination of liver</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If ultrasound indicates ICP, proceed to step 4</li>
      <li>If ultrasound does not indicate ICP, consider other diagnoses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Begin ICP treatment protocol</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor patient symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

This is just a basic example and the actual steps will depend on the specific ICP clinical guidance from your document. It's also important to remember that this is a simplified version and clinical decision-making should always be based on comprehensive clinical judgement and not just an algorithm.
