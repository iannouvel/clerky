    <h1>UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline</h1>
    
    <h2>Diagnosis of ICP:</h2>
    <p>If itching in skin of normal appearance and peak random total bile acid concentration &ge; 19 micromol/L, then consider ICP.</p>
    
    <h2>Further Investigations:</h2>
    <p>If persistent itching with no other apparent cause, then conduct liver function tests and bile acid measurement.</p>
    
    <h2>Exclusion of Other Causes:</h2>
    <p>If ICP suspected, then carry out structured history and examination to exclude other causes of itching and liver dysfunction.</p>
    
    <h2>Confirmation of ICP:</h2>
    <p>If resolution of itching and normalization of liver function tests postnatally, then confirm ICP diagnosis.</p>
    
    <h2>Management of ICP:</h2>
    <p>If diagnosed with ICP, then receive consultant led care, weekly BA & LFTs measurements, and drug treatment as prescribed.</p>
    
    <h2>Timing of Birth:</h2>
    <p>If moderate ICP, consider birth at 38–39 weeks' gestation; if severe ICP, consider birth at 35–36 weeks' gestation.</p>
    
    <h2>Postnatal Care:</h2>
    <p>If itch persists after birth, and LFTs and B As remain abnormal, then investigate for other causes of abnormal liver function.</p>
    
    <h2>Subsequent Pregnancies:</h2>
    <p>If planning subsequent pregnancy, advise about risk of recurrence and perform baseline liver function test and bile acid concentration.</p>
