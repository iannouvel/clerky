<h2>Clinical Advice:</h2>
<p class="grey">If the success rate of ECV is approximately 50%, then it can reduce the chance of a caesarean section. However, labour after ECV may have a slightly higher rate of caesarean section and instrumental delivery. If predicting the success of ECV can be done to some extent, then models should not be routinely used. If using tocolysis with betamimetics can improve the success rates of ECV, then it should be considered. ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation. If regional analgesia is not routinely recommended, then it may be considered for repeat attempts or for women who cannot tolerate ECV without analgesia.</p>
