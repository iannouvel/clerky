    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
            <p>Assess the woman's body mass index (BMI) at the first antenatal appointment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>If BMI &gt; 30</h3>
            <p>If the woman's BMI is more than 30, provide information about the increased risks associated with obesity during pregnancy, labor, and postnatal period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Nutritional Counselling</h3>
            <p>Refer the woman to a dietitian for personalized nutritional counseling and advice on physical activity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Antenatal Care</h3>
            <p>Provide standard antenatal care, with additional monitoring for potential complications related to obesity such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Labor and Birth</h3>
            <p>Discuss with the woman about the potential need for anesthetic review, early epidural, or ultrasound-guided placement of epidural.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Postnatal Care</h3>
            <p>Offer additional support for breastfeeding and weight management post-pregnancy. Monitor for postnatal complications such as wound infections, thromboembolism, and depression.</p>

This HTML document creates a basic webpage with a title "Care of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy", followed by an ordered list representing the steps or decision points in the care of these women. It covers initial assessment, discussion on risks if BMI is above 30, nutritional counseling, antenatal care, labor and birth considerations, and postnatal care.
