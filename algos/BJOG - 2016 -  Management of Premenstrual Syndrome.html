    <p>Management of Premenstrual Syndrome</p>
    <p>When clinically reviewing women for PMS, symptoms should be recorded prospectively over two cycles using a symptom diary. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues may be used for 3 months for a definitive diagnosis if the completed symptom diary alone is inconclusive. Referral to a gynaecologist should be considered when simple measures have failed and the severity of PMS justifies gynaecological intervention. Women with severe PMS may benefit from being managed by a multidisciplinary team.</p>
    <p>An integrated holistic approach should be used when treating women with PMS. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) may be effective for PMS and should be considered as a first-line pharmaceutical intervention. Percutaneous estradiol combined with cyclical progestogens has been shown to be effective for managing physical and psychological symptoms of severe PMS. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) should be considered routinely as a treatment option for severe PMS. SSRIs should be considered one of the first-line pharmaceutical management options in severe PMS. Spironolactone can be used in women with PMS to treat physical symptoms. Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy can be considered when medical management has failed or other gynaecological conditions indicate surgery. A decision-making algorithm is provided for the treatment of PMS.</p>
