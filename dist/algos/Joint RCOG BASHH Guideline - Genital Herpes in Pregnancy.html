This HTML page will ask the user a series of questions based on the clinical contexts. Once the user has answered the questions and clicked the 'Get Guidance' button, the relevant guidance will be displayed. This code does not yet handle the dynamic updating of guidance based on user input. This would require a more complex solution, possibly involving the use of a JavaScript framework or library.
