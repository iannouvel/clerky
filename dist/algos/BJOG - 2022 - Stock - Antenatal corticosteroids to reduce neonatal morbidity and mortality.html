<div class="clinical-advice">
  <p><em>Antenatal corticosteroids given within seven days prior to preterm birth reduce perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM). Birth should not be delayed for antenatal corticosteroids if the indication for birth is impacting the health of the woman or her baby. Antenatal corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when the first dose is given within 48 hours prior to birth. Benefits are also seen when the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth.</em></p>
