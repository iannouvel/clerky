        <h3>Postnatal Contraception Advice</h3>
        <p>50% of couples are sexually active by 6 weeks postnatal.</p>
        <p>The postnatal period is a high risk time for unintended pregnancy.</p>
        <p>A short interpregnancy interval can increase risks to mum and baby.</p>
        <p>Fertility resumes quickly and contraception is needed from 21 days after birth to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy.</p>
        <p>What can I start straight after delivery?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hormone or copper coil - Can be inserted up to 48hrs after delivery, works for 5-10 years, safe and highly effective</li>
            <li>Implant - Highly effective, Long acting, Safe for most women, can be inserted immediately after birth</li>
            <li>Condoms - Easy and safe to use, slightly less effective than other methods, can be used if waiting to start a long acting method</li>
            <li>Progesterone only pill - Taken daily, safe for most women, >99% effective</li>
            <li>Injection - Highly effective, long acting, repeated every 13 weeks, can be given immediately after birth</li>
            <li>Implant - Highly effective, long-acting, safe for most women, can be inserted immediately after birth</li>
        </ul>
