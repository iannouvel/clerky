In the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-Processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes.</p>
            <p>Where the Processor engages a Sub-Processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the Controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in this DPA shall be imposed on that Sub-Processor by way of a contract, providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR.</p>

                <li>Describe the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach</li>

            <h2>7. Liability and Indemnity</h2>
            <p>The Processor shall be liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations of the GDPR specifically directed to processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the Controller.</p>
            <p>The Processor shall indemnify the Controller for any damages, costs, charges, expenses (including reasonable legal costs) which the Controller suffers or incurs as a result of a breach by the Processor of its obligations under this DPA.</p>
