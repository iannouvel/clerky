A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
Name: Ms. X (fictional)  
Age: 24 years  
Weight: 160 kg | BMI: 61  
Occupation: Office administrator  
Parity: G2P1 (1 previous live birth, 1 miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. X presents with a 6-week history of irregular heavy vaginal bleeding and worsening pelvic pain. She is also concerned about difficulty conceiving again after her miscarriage 18 months ago.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Heavy, irregular bleeding for 6 weeks, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1 pad every 2 hours on worst days).  
- Associated cramping pelvic pain, worse during bleeding episodes.  
- No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 8 weeks ago, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  
- Previous miscarriage at 10 weeks gestation (18 months ago), followed by a dilation and curettage (D&C).  
- Actively trying to conceive for the past year without success.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at age 18.  
- Obesity (BMI 61).  
- Gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy.  
- No known hypertension or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- D&C post-miscarriage (18 months ago).  
- No other surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 13.  
- Previous cycles irregular (every 35–60 days).  
- Previous live birth via vaginal delivery (3 years ago, no complications).  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  
- Current contraception: None (actively trying to conceive).  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 500mg BD (for PCOS).  
- Folic acid supplement.  
- No other regular medications.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker.  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units per month).  
- Works full-time in an office setting.  
- Lives with partner; supportive relationship.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Ms. X is worried that her weight and PCOS are preventing conception.  
- Concerned that her heavy bleeding may indicate a serious problem (e.g., fibroids or endometrial pathology).  
- Hopes to receive treatment to regulate her cycles and improve fertility.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Obese (BMI 61), no signs of anaemia (conjunctivae pink).  
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Speculum exam: Cervix appears closed, no active bleeding at time of exam.  
- Bimanual exam: Uterus slightly enlarged, no adnexal tenderness.  
- No cervical motion tenderness.  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Pelvic ultrasound** – To assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology (PCOS), and rule out fibroids/polyps.  
2. **Hormonal profile** (Day 3 FSH, LH, AMH, testosterone, TSH) – Given PCOS and fertility concerns.  
3. **HbA1c** – Given history of gestational diabetes and obesity.  
4. **Endometrial biopsy** – If ultrasound shows thickened endometrium, to exclude hyperplasia.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Symptom control:**  
   - Tranexamic acid PRN for heavy bleeding.  
   - Consider short-term progesterone to regulate cycles if no immediate conception plans.  
2. **Weight management:**  
   - Referral to a dietitian and weight management clinic.  
   - Encourage gradual weight loss (5–10% to improve fertility and metabolic health).  
3. **Fertility support:**  
   - If investigations confirm anovulation, consider ovulation induction (e.g., clomiphene) under specialist care.  
   - Advise regular intercourse tracking (basal body temperature/ovulation predictor kits).  
4. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review ultrasound and blood results in 2 weeks.  
   - Consider gynaecology referral if endometrial pathology is found.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that PCOS is manageable and fertility can improve with weight loss and medical support.  
- Advised that persistent heavy bleeding needs further evaluation to exclude endometrial hyperplasia.  
- Encouraged to continue folic acid and optimise metabolic health pre-conception.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await investigations.  
- Follow-up in 2 weeks for results and further management planning.
