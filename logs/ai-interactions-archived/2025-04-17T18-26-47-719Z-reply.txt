A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Example for Testing Purposes**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Fictional Name]  
- Age: 30 years  
- Weight: 110 kg | BMI: 39.7 (Class III Obesity)  
- Prior Pregnancies: 3 (G3P3)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 4-week history of persistent lower back pain, worsening with prolonged standing and lifting. She also reports occasional numbness radiating down her left leg.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Pain is dull and aching, localized to the lumbosacral region, with intermittent sharp shooting pain into the left posterior thigh.  
- No recent trauma or injury reported.  
- Symptoms are worse at the end of the day and partially relieved by rest.  
- No associated bowel/bladder dysfunction, fever, or weight loss.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Gestational diabetes (during last pregnancy)  
- Hypertension (diagnosed 2 years ago, managed with lifestyle advice)  
- Depression (on intermittent SSRIs, currently not taking)  

**Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x2 (last one 3 years ago)  
- Appendectomy (age 15)  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, regular cycles  
- Last menstrual period: 2 weeks ago  
- No history of abnormal smears or STIs  
- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception)  

**Drug History:**  
- Occasional paracetamol for back pain (no regular medications)  
- No current antihypertensives or SSRIs  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies  

**Social History:**  
- Occupation: Retail assistant (frequent heavy lifting)  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history)  
- Alcohol: 4-5 units/week  
- Lives with partner and 3 children (ages 7, 5, and 3)  
- Limited physical activity due to pain and fatigue  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Believes pain is due to "overexertion" at work but worries it may be "something serious."  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery or being unable to work.  
- **Expectations:** Hopes for pain relief and guidance on preventing recurrence.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no distress at rest.  
- **Cardiovascular:** BP 138/86 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, regular.  
- **Respiratory:** Clear, no wheeze.  
- **Musculoskeletal:**  
  - Tenderness over L4/L5 vertebrae.  
  - Reduced lumbar flexion due to pain.  
  - Positive straight leg raise test on left at 45° (reproduces radicular pain).  
  - Normal power/sensation in lower limbs, reflexes intact.  

**Impression:**  
Likely **lumbar discogenic pain with left L5/S1 radiculopathy**, exacerbated by occupational strain and obesity. Secondary contributors may include mechanical stress from prior pregnancies and deconditioning.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Immediate:**  
   - Advise relative rest (avoid heavy lifting) and heat application.  
   - Trial of regular paracetamol + short-course NSAIDs (if no contraindications).  
   - Consider physiotherapy referral for core strengthening and posture correction.  

2. **Long-term:**  
   - Weight management: Referral to dietitian and structured exercise program (low-impact activities like swimming).  
   - Smoking cessation support (given association with chronic pain and vascular health).  
   - Workplace ergonomic assessment to modify lifting duties.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review in 4 weeks; if no improvement or worsening neurology, consider MRI for further evaluation.  
   - Monitor BP and consider reinitiating antihypertensives if lifestyle measures fail.  

**Patient Education:**  
- Reassured that serious pathology (e.g., cauda equina) is unlikely but to return if red flags (bowel/bladder issues, progressive weakness) arise.  
- Encouraged gradual weight loss to reduce spinal load.
