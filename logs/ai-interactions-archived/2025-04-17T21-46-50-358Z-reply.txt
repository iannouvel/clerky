- **Prior Pregnancies:** 1 (full-term vaginal delivery)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Mrs. Doe reports a 4-month history of **postmenopausal bleeding**, described as intermittent light spotting. She denies associated pain but expresses concern given her family history of gynecological conditions.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**

- No weight loss, fever, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (well-controlled on medication).  
- Osteopenia (diagnosed 5 years ago, on calcium/vitamin D supplementation).  
- No history of diabetes or thromboembolic disease.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 25).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, menopause at age 55.  
- 1 full-term pregnancy, no miscarriages or terminations.  
- No history of abnormal cervical smears.  
- No prior diagnosis of endometriosis or fibroids.  

**Drug History:**  
- Amlodipine 5 mg OD.

- No recent antibiotics or steroids.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Retired teacher.  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Lives with husband, independent with daily activities.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried this could be "something serious like cancer" due to her aunt’s history of endometrial cancer.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about invasive tests.  
- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on the cause and reassurance.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - Speculum: Small amount of old blood in vault, cervix appears normal.  
  - Bimanual: Uterus normal size, no adnexal masses.  
- **PV Bleeding:** Light, no active bleeding at time of exam.  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Endometrial thickness measured at **9 mm** (abnormal for postmenopausal patient).  
2. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Arranged for histopathological assessment.  

**Provisional Diagnosis:**  
- **Postmenopausal bleeding ? Endometrial hyperplasia** (per GTG 2014 guidelines).  
- Differential includes endometrial polyp or atrophy.  

**Management Plan (GTG 2014-Based):**  
1. **Urgent Referral:** To gynecology for hysteroscopy and biopsy given abnormal endometrial thickness.  
2. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Explained that while hyperplasia is a possibility, malignancy must be excluded.  
   - Reassured that most cases are treatable, especially if detected early.  
3. **Follow-Up:**

   - Advised to report any heavy bleeding or worsening symptoms.

**Safety Netting:**  
- Provided emergency contact details if bleeding becomes heavy or pain develops.  

**Conclusion:**
