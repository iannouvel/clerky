  "prompt": "Read the clinical scenario below\nList the significant issues as brief, single-line statements. \nWhen multiple issues might be related by a clinical entity, combine them into one concise issue. \nEach issue must be 60 characters or fewer. \nPlease ensure the list of issues isn't numbered.\nPlease ensure there isn't a trailing full stop at the end of each issue\nPlease only generate 2-3 issues for most patients.\nFor complex patients, perhaps 5 issues, for very complex patients 7. \nUse medical words where possible. \n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nClinical Summary:\n<p><strong>Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate Concerns</strong> <br><em>For testing purposes only. Fictional scenario. No real medical advice.</em> <br><br><strong>Patient Details:</strong> <br>- Name: Jane Doe (fictional) <br>- Age: 63 <br>- BMI: 24.5 <br>- Gravida: 2, Para: 2 (prior pregnancies) <br>- Gestational Age: 39 weeks + 3 days (current pregnancy) <br><br><strong>History of Presenting Complaint:</strong> <br>Mrs. Doe presents to the labor and delivery unit in active labor at 39+3 weeks gestation. She reports regular contractions every 3 minutes, lasting 60 seconds, with moderate intensity. Rupture of membranes occurred 2 hours prior, with clear amniotic fluid noted. <br><br><em>Incomplete history:</em> <br>- No documentation of fetal movement patterns prior to admission. <br>- Maternal fever or recent infections not asked. <br>- Prior delivery history (e.g., vaginal vs. cesarean, complications) not clarified. <br><br><strong>Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Monitoring Findings:</strong> <br>- Baseline FHR: 150 bpm (normal). <br>- Recurrent late decelerations noted over the past 30 minutes, with minimal variability. <br>- No accelerations documented. <br>- <em>Incomplete examination:</em> Tocodynamometer placement not confirmed; uterine activity pattern not quantified. <br><br><strong>Management Plan:</strong> <br>1. <strong>Immediate Actions:</strong> <br>- Reposition patient to left lateral tilt. <br>- Administer IV fluids (normal saline bolus). <br>- Supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 10L/min. <br>- Discontinue oxytocin if infusing (not documented if in use). <br><br>2. <strong>Further Assessment:</strong> <br>- Perform scalp stimulation for fetal response (not yet done). <br>- Consider fetal blood sampling if decelerations persist (equipment availability not checked). <br><br>3. <strong>Consultation:</strong> <br>- Notify obstetrician and anesthesia team for potential urgent delivery. <br>- <em>Omission:</em> No discussion of patient’s preferences for intervention (e.g., cesarean vs. operative vaginal delivery). <br><br>4. <strong>Monitoring:</strong> <br>- Continuous FHR monitoring; reassess in 15 minutes. <br>- <em>Incomplete:</em> Maternal vital signs (e.g., blood pressure, temperature) not repeated since admission. <br><br><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> <br>Plan for urgent delivery if FHR abnormalities persist or worsen. Documented consent for procedures not yet obtained. <br><br><em>Dictated by: Dr. A. Smith (fictional)</em> <br><em>Date: [Fictional]</em> <br><br><strong>Notes for Testing:</strong> <br>- Intentional gaps in history/exam to simulate real-world documentation inconsistencies. <br>- Management reflects reactive steps; lacks anticipatory guidance (e.g., contingency planning for neonatal resuscitation). <br>- No reference to maternal comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) or medications.</p>"

A: Recurrent late decelerations with minimal variability  
Incomplete maternal and fetal history  
Omission of maternal vitals reassessment  
Lack of documented consent for procedures
