She describes passing small clots and experiencing pelvic discomfort, though no severe pain. She denies fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Bleeding episodes last 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks.  \n- No recent hormonal contraceptive use or HRT.  \n- No prior investigations for abnormal bleeding.  \n- No family history of gynaecological malignancies.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (controlled on lisinopril 10 mg OD).  \n- Type 2 diabetes (metformin 500 mg BD, HbA1c 7.2% last checked).  \n- Obesity (BMI 32.8, no prior weight management referrals).  \n\n**Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 22).  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12, previously regular cycles.  \n- 1 full-term pregnancy, no miscarriages/terminations.  \n- Last menstrual period 2 weeks ago.  \n- No history of cervical dysplasia or STIs.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  \n- Metformin 500 mg BD.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for joint pain (no regular NSAIDs).  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as an office administrator (sedentary role).  \n- Non-smoker, alcohol 2–3 units/week.  \n- Lives with husband, moderately active (walks 2–3x/week).  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Concerned about cancer due to prolonged bleeding.  \n- Wishes to avoid surgery if possible.  \n- Expects clarity on whether this is menopause-related or pathological.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese, no pallor/jaundice.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic:** Speculum exam—no cervical lesions, blood in vault. Bimanual—uterus bulky, non-tender, no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Working Diagnosis:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) with high-risk features for **endometrial hyperplasia** (per GTG 2014 guidelines):  \n  - Age >45.  \n  - Obesity (BMI >30).  \n  - Unopposed oestrogen effect (nulliparity not applicable, but metabolic syndrome risk).  \n- Differential includes endometrial polyp, malignancy (low suspicion but requires exclusion).  \n\n**Investigations Planned:**  \n1. **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness (if >4 mm in postmenopausal bleeding, biopsy indicated—though patient is perimenopausal).  \n2. **Endometrial biopsy:** Pipelle sampling to exclude hyperplasia/malignancy.  \n3. **Hb/HCT:** To assess for anaemia secondary to heavy bleeding.  \n\n**Management Advice:**  \n1. **If biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia (per GTG 2014):**  \n   - First-line: **Progestogen therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUS or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate).  \n   - Weight loss counselling (reduces hyperplasia recurrence risk).  \n   - Repeat biopsy in 6 months to assess response.  \n2. **If atypia present:** Refer to gynaecology oncology for possible hysterectomy.  \n3. **Symptomatic relief:** Tranexamic acid for heavy bleeding (if no contraindications).  \n\n**Patient Counselling:**  \n- Reassured that most hyperplasia is benign but requires treatment to prevent progression.  \n- Advised on weight loss benefits (even 5–10% reduction improves outcomes).  \n- Emergency plan provided if bleeding worsens (e.g., flooding, dizziness).  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review biopsy results in 2 weeks.  \n- Dietitian referral for weight management.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  \n**Date:** [Today’s date]  \n\n---  \n*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
