She reports occasional cramping but denies dizziness, syncope, or symptoms suggestive of anemia. No history of postcoital bleeding. She has not tracked her bleeding patterns.  \n\n**Relevant Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Hypertension (on lisinopril).  \n- Type 2 diabetes (poorly controlled, HbA1c last recorded at 8.5%).  \n- No prior gynecologic surgeries.  \n- Prior pregnancies: 2 uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  \n- Contraception: None currently; used oral contraceptives in the past.  \n- Family history: Mother with endometrial cancer (diagnosed at age 60).  \n\n*Incomplete aspects:*  \n- No detailed menstrual history (e.g., cycle length, duration of bleeding).  \n- Sexual activity status not asked.  \n- Medications (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants) not reviewed.  \n- Thyroid symptoms/screening not addressed.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Obese, no pallor.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Pelvic exam (limited): Vulva normal. Speculum exam reveals minimal old blood in vault. Cervix appears nulliparous, no lesions. Bimanual exam: Uterus bulky, non-tender; adnexa not palpated due to body habitus.  \n\n*Incomplete aspects:*  \n- No documentation of cervical screening history.  \n- Breast exam not performed.  \n- No assessment for hirsutism/acne (PCOS not explored).  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely secondary to perimenopausal hormonal changes or endometrial hyperplasia; malignancy less likely but must be ruled out).  \n2. Obesity and uncontrolled diabetes increase risk for endometrial pathology.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and uterine structure.  \n   - CBC to evaluate for anemia.  \n   - HbA1c recheck given poorly controlled diabetes.  \n   - *Missing:* Thyroid function tests, coagulation screen.  \n\n2. **Management:**  \n   - If TVUS shows thickened endometrium (>4 mm), recommend endometrial biopsy.  \n   - Consider trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progestin-only pill) if biopsy benign, but risks/benefits not yet discussed with patient.  \n   - Lifestyle counseling re: weight loss and diabetes control (not detailed in discussion).  \n\n3. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review results in 2 weeks.  \n   - Urgent re-referral if bleeding worsens or signs of anemia develop.  \n\n*Omissions:*  \n- No discussion of fertility desires (though likely low given age).  \n- No exploration of patient’s preferences for hormonal vs. non-hormonal management.  \n\n**Clinician:** Dr. Smith (fictional)  \n*Date: [Fictional]*  \n\n---  \n*Note: This is a simulated dictation for educational/testing purposes only.
