She reports vomiting 8–10 times per day, with episodes occurring both during the day and night. She has been unable to keep down solid foods and has had minimal oral fluid intake. She denies hematemesis but notes occasional dry heaving. She reports a 5-pound weight loss over the past week. She has tried ginger tea and over-the-counter antacids without relief. No prior history of hyperemesis in previous pregnancies, though she had mild nausea in the first trimester with her last pregnancy. ### Past Medical History: - Obesity (BMI 35.0) - Gestational diabetes (prior pregnancy, diet-controlled) - Anxiety (not currently medicated) ### Past Surgical History: - Cesarean section x 2 ### Medications: - Prenatal vitamins (unable to tolerate recently) - No current antiemetics ### Allergies: - NKDA ### Social History: - No smoking, occasional alcohol prior to pregnancy - Works as a teacher, currently on sick leave due to symptoms ### Review of Systems (Incomplete – Pertinent Negatives&#x2F;Omissions): - General: Fatigue, weight loss - GI: Nausea, vomiting, no diarrhea, no abdominal pain (omitted: presence of ketonuria, signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes, dizziness, or oliguria) - Neuro: No headaches, no visual changes (omitted: assessment for confusion or altered mental status) - Psych: Reports increased stress due to symptoms (omitted: screening for depression or suicidal ideation) ### Physical Examination (Incomplete – Pertinent Findings&#x2F;Omissions): - Vitals: BP 110&#x2F;70, HR 98, RR 16, Temp 37.0°C (omitted: orthostatic vitals, weight trend) - General: Appears fatigued, no acute distress - Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs - Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses (omitted: assessment for hepatomegaly or epigastric tenderness) - Extremities: No edema ### Assessment: 32-year-old female, G4P3, at 10 weeks gestation with hyperemesis gravidarum, likely exacerbated by obesity and prior gestational diabetes. High risk for dehydration and nutritional deficiencies. ### Plan: 1. Labs &amp; Diagnostics: - CBC, CMP, TSH, urine ketones, urine hCG (quantitative if needed) (omitted: consideration of additional tests such as liver function tests or lipase if symptoms persist) 2. Management: - IV Hydration: Admit for IV fluids (normal saline with dextrose and multivitamins) - Antiemetics: Start ondansetron 4mg IV&#x2F;PO q8h PRN nausea, consider adding pyridoxine-doxylamine if symptoms persist - Nutritional Support: Thiamine supplementation due to prolonged vomiting, consider dietitian consult 3. Follow-Up: - Reassess in 24–48 hours for response to therapy - Consider outpatient follow-up with OB if symptoms improve - If no improvement, may require further workup for alternative causes (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, molar pregnancy) ### Counseling: - Advised patient to seek emergency care if unable to tolerate any fluids, if dizziness worsens, or if she develops severe abdominal pain. - Discussed risks of prolonged vomiting (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, weight loss). - Encouraged small, frequent meals if able to tolerate.
