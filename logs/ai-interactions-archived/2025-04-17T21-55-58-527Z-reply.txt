A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Case for Testing Purposes**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 49 years  
- **Weight:** 78 kg  
- **Height:** 168 cm  
- **BMI:** 27.5 (overweight)  
- **Prior Pregnancies:** 1 (full-term vaginal delivery, no complications)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **irregular heavy menstrual bleeding**, with episodes lasting up to 10 days and requiring frequent pad changes. She describes occasional **intermenstrual bleeding** and mild **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began insidiously 6 months ago.  
- Bleeding is heavier than her usual pattern, with occasional clots.  
- No recent changes in contraception (not currently using hormonal contraception).  
- No recent weight fluctuations or stressors identified.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Hypertension** (well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg OD).  
- **Prediabetes** (diet-controlled, last HbA1c 5.9%).  
- **Obesity** (BMI 27.5, advises minimal physical activity due to work demands).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Appendectomy** (age 22).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynecological History:**  
- **Gravida 1, Para 1** (spontaneous vaginal delivery at age 30).  
- **Menarche** at age 12, previously regular 28-day cycles.  
- No history of STIs or abnormal smears (last Pap smear 2 years ago, normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  
- Occasional ibuprofen for menstrual pain (no regular NSAID use).  
- No hormonal therapies.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- **Occupation:** Office manager (sedentary role).  
- **Alcohol:** 5–7 units/week.  
- **Smoking:** Never.  
- **Exercise:** Minimal (walks 1–2x/week).  
- **Diet:** High in processed foods, admits to difficulty maintaining weight.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about "hormonal imbalance" or "early menopause."  
- **Concerns:** Fear of cancer due to family history (mother had breast cancer at 60).  
- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on cause of bleeding and reassurance/management options.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or signs of chronic illness.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal; no lesions or discharge.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender; adnexa clear.  
- **No signs of infection or structural abnormalities.**  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Findings consistent with **endometrial thickening (12 mm)**; no focal lesions.  
2. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Scheduled to exclude atypia (per GTG 2014 guidelines for abnormal bleeding in perimenopausal women with BMI >25).  
3. **Hb:** 11.8 g/dL (mild anemia).  

**Assessment:**  
- **Likely endometrial hyperplasia** (non-atypical suspected given risk factors: age, obesity, anovulatory cycles).  
- Differential includes **polyp, hormonal dysfunction, or (less likely) malignancy**.  

**Management Plan (Per GTG 2014 Guidelines):**  
1. **Progesterone Therapy:**  
   - **Oral progestin (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg OD for 14 days/cycle)** to regulate shedding.  
   - Discuss LNG-IUS (Mirena) as longer-term option if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia.  
2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**  
   - Weight loss counseling (target 5–10% reduction to lower estrogen-driven endometrial stimulation).  
   - Increase physical activity (goal: 150 min/week moderate exercise).  
3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Repeat ultrasound/biopsy in 3–6 months to assess response.  
   - Urgent referral if biopsy shows atypia (would warrant hysterectomy discussion given age).  
4. **Patient Education:**  
   - Reassured that hyperplasia without atypia is manageable but requires monitoring.  
   - Advised to report worsening bleeding/pain.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await biopsy results.  
- Schedule nutritionist consult for weight management.  
- Follow-up in 4 weeks.
