She reports irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks. She describes passing clots and requiring frequent pad changes (every 1–2 hours on heavy days). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports occasional pelvic discomfort. She has no history of dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding.  \n\nShe has no significant past medical history but has not had routine gynecologic care in several years.
