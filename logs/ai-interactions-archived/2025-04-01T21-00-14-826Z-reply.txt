Smith, OB&#x2F;GYN Patient: Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name) Age: 43 Weight: 87 kg | BMI: 32 (Obese Class I) Gravida: 3 | Para: 2 (Previous deliveries: 1 SVD, 1 C-section) | Abortions: 0 ---### History of Presenting Complaint Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns: 1. Recurrent Pelvic Pain: Intermittent left-sided pelvic pain for 6 months, worsening during menstruation and intercourse. Describes it as &quot;sharp and crampy,&quot; rated 7&#x2F;10. No relief with OTC NSAIDs. 2. Postmenopausal Bleeding: Despite prior regular cycles, now reports 3 episodes of vaginal bleeding over 2 months (last menstrual period 14 months ago). Bleeding is light but associated with clots. ### Past Medical&#x2F;Surgical&#x2F;Gynaecological History - Medical: Hypertension (on lisinopril), Type 2 DM (metformin), depression (citalopram). - Surgical: C-section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018). - Gynaecological: History of ovarian cyst (resolved, 2019), HPV-positive (no dysplasia on last Pap smear 2 years ago). ### Drug History &amp; Allergies - Lisinopril 10 mg OD, metformin 1 g BD, citalopram 20 mg OD. - Allergies: Penicillin (rash). ### Social History - Works as a schoolteacher. Married, monogamous. - Smokes 5 cigarettes&#x2F;day (10 pack-years), occasional alcohol. - Exercise: Sedentary. ### Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations - Ideas: Worried about &quot;fibroids or cancer&quot; due to bleeding. - Concerns: Pain affecting intimacy; fears surgical intervention. - Expectations: Wants &quot;answers quickly&quot; and non-hormonal options if possible. ---### Examination Findings - General: Obese, BP 138&#x2F;86, no pallor&#x2F;jaundice. - Abdominal: Soft, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa. No masses. - Pelvic Exam: - Speculum: Atrophic vaginal mucosa; small clot in vault. Cervix appears nulliparous. - Bimanual: Uterus enlarged (~10-week size), fixed, tender left adnexa. No cervical motion tenderness. ---### Differential Diagnoses 1. Postmenopausal Bleeding: Endometrial hyperplasia&#x2F;carcinoma vs. atrophy. 2. Pelvic Pain: Adenomyosis vs. ovarian pathology (e.g., endometrioma). ### Investigations Planned 1. Transvaginal Ultrasound: Assess endometrial thickness, adnexae. 2. Endometrial Biopsy: Rule out malignancy. 3. CA-125: If ovarian pathology suspected. ### Management Advice 1. Immediate: - Expedite ultrasound&#x2F;biopsy. Advise cessation of smoking (counselling offered). - Analgesia: Trial of mefenamic acid for pain. 2. Follow-Up: - Discuss results within 2 weeks. If biopsy abnormal, refer to gynae-oncology. - If benign, consider Mirena IUS (if acceptable) for bleeding&#x2F;pain. 3. Patient Education: - Red flags (e.g., heavy bleeding, syncope). - Weight loss benefits (reduced endometrial cancer risk). Plan: Review with results +&#x2F;− MDT input. --- End of Dictation *(Fictional for testing purposes only. No real medical advice intended.)* --- *Variation Note:* Second complex issue (adenomyosis) embedded in history&#x2F;exam. Age&#x2F;BMI&#x2F;parity tailored to scenario.

A: ### Summary:  
- Age: 43  
- BMI: 32 (Obese Class I)  
- Gravida: 3, Para: 2 (1 SVD, 1 C-section), Abortions: 0  
- Presenting complaints:  
  - Recurrent left-sided pelvic pain (6 months, worsening during menstruation/coitus, sharp/crampy, 7/10, unrelieved by NSAIDs).  
  - Postmenopausal bleeding (3 episodes over 2 months, LMP 14 months ago, light with clots).  
- PMH: Hypertension, Type 2 DM, depression, ovarian cyst (resolved), HPV+ (no dysplasia).  
- Social: Smokes 5 cigarettes/day, sedentary.  

### Detailed Issues & Advice:  
1. **Postmenopausal Bleeding**:  
   - Differential: Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma vs. atrophy.  
   - Advised expedited transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial biopsy to rule out malignancy.  
   - If abnormal biopsy, referral to gynae-oncology; if benign, consider Mirena IUS (if acceptable).  

2. **Recurrent Pelvic Pain**:  
   - Differential: Adenomyosis vs. ovarian pathology (e.g., endometrioma).  
   - Trial of mefenamic acid for pain relief.  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess adnexae; CA-125 if ovarian pathology suspected.  

3. **Modifiable Risk Factors**:  
   - Smoking cessation counselling offered.  
   - Weight loss advised to reduce endometrial cancer risk.  

### Plan:  
1. Expedite transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial biopsy.  
2. CA-125 if ovarian pathology is suspected.  
3. Trial mefenamic acid for pelvic pain.  
4. Smoking cessation counselling.  
5. Review results within 2 weeks; refer to gynae-oncology if biopsy abnormal.  
6. Consider Mirena IUS if findings are benign.  
7. Educate on red flags (heavy bleeding, syncope) and weight loss benefits.
