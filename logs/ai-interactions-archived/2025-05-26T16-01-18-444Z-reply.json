Last Pap smear was 2 years ago, reportedly normal.  \n\n**Past Medical History:** No significant medical conditions. No prior episodes of vaginitis.  \n\n**Medications:** Oral contraceptive pill (no recent changes). No recent antibiotic use.  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.
