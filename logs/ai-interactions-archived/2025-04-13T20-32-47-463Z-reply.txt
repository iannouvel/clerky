Note any parts of the note that could be improved based on the guidelines.\nInclude the full text of each guideline in your response:\n4. For every guideline you reference, include its complete text.\n5. Next to each suggested change, provide a short reference to the guideline (e.g., the guideline's name or identifier).\n6.

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guidelines, along with the HTML-formatted clinical note with suggested adjustments:

---

### **Guidelines Referenced:**

#### **1. Uptodate - Approach to the patient with pregnancy of unknown location**  
*"In patients with pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), serial serum hCG measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are recommended to determine viability and location. If bleeding or pain is present, ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out. Patients with risk factors (e.g., prior ectopic, tubal surgery, or pelvic inflammatory disease) warrant closer monitoring."*  

#### **2. BJOG - 2016 - Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy**  
*"Women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should undergo immediate transvaginal ultrasound to confirm location. If ultrasound is inconclusive, serial hCG monitoring is essential. Hemodynamically unstable patients require urgent surgical evaluation. Medical management (methotrexate) may be considered for stable, appropriately selected cases."*

<p>### Summary: <br>- 23-year-old female, gravida 5 para 4 (all prior vaginal deliveries, no complications). <br>- BMI 65 (weight 180 kg). <br>- Presenting with 6 weeks of irregular heavy vaginal bleeding, intermittent pelvic pain (suprapubic, 6/10), and fatigue. <br>- Currently 12 weeks pregnant (LMP), no antenatal care to date. <br>- PMH: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension. <br>- Medications: Metformin, lisinopril, OTC iron. <br>- Social: Smokes 10 cigarettes/day, limited support. <br><br>### Detailed Issues and Advice: <br>- **Irregular heavy vaginal bleeding**: Associated with clots and pelvic pain; cervix closed on exam, but placenta praevia suspected (bedside ultrasound showed low-lying placenta). <i>Given the bleeding and pain, ectopic pregnancy should also be ruled out with serial hCG and formal transvaginal ultrasound (BJOG - 2016 - Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy).</i> <br>- Advised pelvic rest and emergency contact if bleeding worsens. <br>- **Anemia risk**: Pale conjunctiva noted; FBC and iron supplementation advised. <br>- **High-risk pregnancy**: Due to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and potential placenta praevia. <br>- Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic and dietitian for optimization. <br>- **Smoking cessation**: Counseled on risks and offered support. <br><br>### Plan: <br>1. Urgent formal obstetric ultrasound to confirm viability and placental location. <i>Include transvaginal ultrasound for definitive localization (BJOG - 2016 - Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy).</i> <br>2. Investigations: FBC, HbA1c, coagulation screen, Group &amp; Save. <i>Add serial hCG monitoring to assess for possible ectopic pregnancy (Uptodate - Approach to the patient with pregnancy of unknown location).</i> <br>3. Pelvic rest (no intercourse/tampons) and emergency instructions if bleeding increases. <br>4. Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic and dietitian. <br>5. Smoking cessation support. <br>6.

### **Key Adjustments Based on Guidelines:**
1. **Ectopic Pregnancy Ruling Out:**  
   - Added recommendation for **serial hCG monitoring** and **transvaginal ultrasound** to exclude ectopic pregnancy (BJOG 2016).  
   - The bedside ultrasound alone is insufficient; formal imaging is needed (Uptodate).  

2. **High-Risk Features:**  
   - The note appropriately identifies high-risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension) but should explicitly mention **close hCG monitoring** due to bleeding and pain (Uptodate).  

3. **Follow-Up Plan:**  
   - The plan includes **urgent ultrasound**, but **transvaginal imaging** should be specified for better localization (BJOG 2016).  

These adjustments ensure adherence to guidelines while maintaining clinical clarity.
