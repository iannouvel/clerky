A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Fictional Name – e.g., "Ms. Smith"]  
- Age: 35 years  
- Weight: 68 kg  
- BMI: 25 kg/m²  
- Gravida: 5 (prior pregnancies)  
- Para: 3 (live births), 1 (miscarriage), 1 (termination)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with:  
1. **Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss** (most recent loss at 18 weeks).  
2. **Chronic pelvic pain** (worsening over the past 6 months, particularly during menstruation).  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- **Recurrent pregnancy loss:**  
  - Three prior uncomplicated term deliveries.  
  - One first-trimester miscarriage (managed expectantly).  
  - One second-trimester loss at 18 weeks (no clear cause identified, no signs of infection or trauma).  
  - No history of cervical insufficiency, but no prior cervical length assessments.  
  - No known thrombophilia or autoimmune disorders.  

- **Chronic pelvic pain:**  
  - Dull, aching pain, worse during menses and intercourse (deep dyspareunia).  
  - No associated urinary/bowel symptoms.  
  - No recent weight loss or fever.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Mild asthma (well-controlled, no recent exacerbations).  
- No diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 20).  
- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at 12, cycles regular (28-day intervals).  
- Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with clots, no intermenstrual bleeding.  
- No prior STI diagnoses.  
- Last cervical smear: 2 years ago (normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Salbutamol PRN for asthma.  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic pain (limited relief).  
- No regular contraception (desires future pregnancy).  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Works as a teacher; moderate physical activity.  
- Stable relationship, supportive partner.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about undiagnosed cause for recurrent losses; concerned pelvic pain may indicate endometriosis.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about future pregnancy viability.  
- **Expectations:** Wants investigations for recurrent loss and pain management options.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or distress.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Speculum:** Healthy cervix, no discharge.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus anteverted, mildly tender on cervical motion; no adnexal masses.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss:** Possible cervical insufficiency, thrombophilia, or anatomical factors.  
2. **Chronic pelvic pain:** Suspect endometriosis or adenomyosis given cyclical pain and dyspareunia.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Recurrent loss workup:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (assess uterine anatomy).  
   - Thrombophilia screen (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies).  
   - Preconception counselling; consider cervical cerclage in future pregnancy if cervical insufficiency confirmed.  

2. **Pelvic pain:**  
   - Trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill or GnRH analogue if endometriosis suspected).  
   - Diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist.  

3. **Patient education:**  
   - Discussed lifestyle modifications (e.g., pelvic floor exercises).  
   - Provided reassurance and arranged follow-up in 4 weeks.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review investigation results.  
- Discuss further fertility/pregnancy planning.
