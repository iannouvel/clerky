A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. Jane Doe (fictional name for documentation purposes)  
- Age: 29 years  
- Weight: 60 kg  
- Height: 1.65 m  
- BMI: 22 kg/m²  
- Gravidity: 4 (prior pregnancies)  
- Parity: 3 (3 live births, no miscarriages or terminations)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of intermittent pelvic pain and heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) over the last three cycles. She also reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) for the past two months.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Pelvic pain is described as dull and cramping, radiating to the lower back, worse during menstruation.  
- Menstrual cycles are regular (28-day cycle) but now last 7-8 days with excessive clotting. Previously, her cycles lasted 5 days with moderate flow.  
- Dyspareunia is deep and occurs primarily with deep penetration. No post-coital bleeding reported.  
- No associated urinary or bowel symptoms.  
- No recent weight loss, fever, or vaginal discharge.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Iron deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron supplements, now resolved).  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x 2 (first for fetal distress, second elective due to previous section).  
- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (right ovary, 3 years ago).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12.  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  
- Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  
- Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently. Previously used combined oral contraceptive pill (stopped due to headaches).  

**Drug History:**  
- Paracetamol as needed for pain (no regular use).  
- No current regular medications.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker.  
- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  
- Works as a primary school teacher.  
- Lives with partner and three children.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Ms. Doe is concerned that her symptoms may be due to fibroids or endometriosis, as her sister has a history of the latter.  
- **Concerns:** She is worried about fertility implications if further surgery is needed.  
- **Expectations:** She hopes for symptom relief and reassurance about future pregnancy plans.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Speculum Examination:** Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions or discharge.  
- **Bimanual Examination:** Uterus slightly enlarged (approximately 10-week size), non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild tenderness in the posterior fornix.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Adenomyosis vs. Endometriosis:** Given her history of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, dyspareunia, and tender retroverted uterus, adenomyosis or endometriosis are likely.  
2. **Fibroids:** Uterine enlargement could suggest fibroids, though bimanual exam did not reveal obvious nodules.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred) to assess uterine structure, adenomyosis, fibroids, or endometriomas.  
   - Full blood count (FBC) to check for anaemia.  
   - Consider CA-125 if endometriosis is strongly suspected (though non-specific).  
2. **Medical Management:**  
   - Trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill or Mirena IUD) to reduce bleeding and pain.  
   - NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for dysmenorrhoea.  
3. **Surgical Consideration:**  
   - If symptoms persist, diagnostic laparoscopy may be warranted to assess for endometriosis.  
4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  
   - Discuss long-term contraception if desired.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that her symptoms are manageable and unlikely to affect fertility at this stage.  
- Advised to track symptoms in a pain/bleeding diary.  
- Encouraged to return sooner if pain becomes severe or if new symptoms arise.
