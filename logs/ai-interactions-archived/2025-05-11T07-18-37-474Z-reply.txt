A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. [Fictional Name]  
**Patient:** Ms. [Fictional Last Name]  
**Age:** 37  
**BMI:** 24.4  
**Gravida/Parity:** G5 P4 (5 prior pregnancies, 4 live births)  

---

### **Subjective History:**  
Ms. [Fictional Last Name] is a 37-year-old female presenting with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She reports intermittent heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking through a pad every 2 hours) lasting 7–10 days, accompanied by clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but notes occasional pelvic discomfort.  

**Relevant History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, previously regular cycles (28–30 days).  
- No history of dysmenorrhea.  
- Last menstrual period: [Fictional Date].  
- Contraception: None currently; prior use of oral contraceptive pills (discontinued 2 years ago).  
- Obstetric history: 4 uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, 1 first-trimester miscarriage.  
- Medical history: Mild iron-deficiency anemia (treated with oral iron in the past). No known bleeding disorders.  
- Medications: Occasional ibuprofen for pain.  
- Allergies: NKDA.  
- Family history: Mother with fibroids; no known clotting disorders.  

**Incomplete Aspects of History (Per Testing Instructions):**  
- Sexual history (e.g., recent STI screening, dyspareunia) not elicited.  
- Thyroid symptoms (fatigue, weight changes) not explored.  
- Detailed medication reconciliation (e.g., herbal supplements) omitted.

### **Objective Findings:**  
**Vitals:**  
- BP: 118/76 mmHg | HR: 78 bpm | Temp: 36.8°C  
- Weight: 68 kg | Height: 167 cm | BMI: 24.4  

**Focused Exam:**  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. No palpable masses.  
- Pelvic exam (deferred today due to patient preference).  
- No external lesions or signs of trauma.  

**Incomplete Aspects of Exam (Per Testing Instructions):**  
- Speculum/bimanual exam not performed.  
- Thyroid/breast exam not documented.  

---

### **Assessment:**  
**Working Diagnosis:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), likely secondary to:  
1. **Structural causes:** Fibroids or endometrial polyps (given parity/family history).  
2. **Non-structural:** Anovulation (consider PCOS, thyroid dysfunction—pending further evaluation).  

**Differential Diagnoses:**  
- Endometrial hyperplasia  
- Coagulopathy (less likely, but not ruled out)  
- Iatrogenic (e.g., medication effect)  

---

### **Plan:**  
1. **Diagnostics:**  
   - **Pelvic ultrasound:** Assess for fibroids, polyps, endometrial thickness.  
   - **Labs:** CBC (evaluate anemia), TSH, coagulation panel (if indicated), β-hCG (to rule out pregnancy).  
   - **Endometrial biopsy:** Consider if ultrasound shows thickened endometrium or age >35 with risk factors.  

2. **Management:**  
   - **Symptomatic relief:** Tranexamic acid (if heavy bleeding persists).  
   - **Hormonal options:** Trial of combined oral contraceptives (if no contraindications) or progesterone therapy.  
   - **Iron supplementation:** Reinitiate if anemia confirmed.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 2 weeks for results and further discussion of surgical (e.g., hysteroscopy) vs. medical management.  
   - Counsel on tracking bleeding patterns via diary.  

**Patient Instructions:**  
- Seek urgent care if hemodynamically unstable (e.g., dizziness, syncope).  
- Avoid NSAIDs if bleeding worsens.  

**Clinician Note:**  
*History and exam intentionally incomplete per testing parameters. Additional details (e.g., sexual history, thyroid eval) required for comprehensive care.*
