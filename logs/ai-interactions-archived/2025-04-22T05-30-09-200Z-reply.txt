A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Gynecology Consultation**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  
**Age:** 40  
**BMI:** 20.8  
**Gravida:** 0  
**Date of Encounter:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  

### **Subjective:**  
Ms. Doe presents today reporting a 6-month history of persistent vulvar itching and discomfort. She describes the sensation as intense, often worse at night, and notes occasional sharp pain with intercourse. She denies any vaginal discharge, bleeding, or urinary symptoms. She has tried over-the-counter antifungal creams without relief.  

**Relevant History:**  
- No prior pregnancies.  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  
- No chronic medical conditions.  
- No known allergies.  
- No prior vulvar biopsies or procedures.  

*Incomplete aspects:*  
- Family history of autoimmune or dermatologic conditions not explored.  
- Sexual history (e.g., recent partners, contraception) not fully assessed.  
- Impact on daily activities or emotional well-being not discussed.  

### **Objective:**  
**Physical Examination:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no acute distress.  
- **Vulvar Inspection:** Thin, pale, parchment-like skin with areas of whitish plaques noted on labia minora and perineum. Fissuring present near the posterior fourchette. No active bleeding or ulcerations.  
- **Speculum Exam:** Vaginal mucosa appears normal; cervix without lesions.  
- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa without masses.  

*Incomplete aspects:*  
- No documentation of lymph node assessment.  
- No mention of anal involvement (common in lichen sclerosus).  

### **Assessment:**  
**Working Diagnosis:** Likely lichen sclerosus given classic appearance of vulvar skin changes and symptoms. Differential includes lichen planus or vulvar dysplasia, though less likely.  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Topical Therapy:** Prescribe high-potency corticosteroid ointment (e.g., clobetasol 0.05%) applied thinly to affected areas once daily for 4 weeks, then taper.  
2. **Symptom Management:** Recommend emollients (e.g., plain petroleum jelly) to reduce friction and soothe skin.  
3. **Follow-Up:** Re-evaluate in 6 weeks to assess response. If no improvement, consider biopsy to confirm diagnosis.  
4. **Counseling:** Advised to avoid irritants (e.g., scented soaps, tight clothing). Discussed chronic nature of condition but reassured about benign course with treatment.  

*Omissions in Guidance:*  
- No discussion of long-term monitoring for malignancy risk (rare but increased in lichen sclerosus).  
- No referral to dermatology or vulvar specialty clinic considered.  

**Next Steps:** Patient instructed to call if worsening symptoms or new lesions arise.
