A: **Clinical Dictation: Fictional Patient Encounter**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  
**Age:** 42  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Visit:** October 10, 2023  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  
**Specialty:** Gynecology  

### **Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding, described as heavy and prolonged menstrual periods lasting 10–14 days, occurring every 3 weeks. She reports passing clots and requiring frequent pad changes (every 1–2 hours on heavy days). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports associated fatigue.  

### **History of Present Illness:**  
- **Onset:** Symptoms began approximately 4 months ago without clear precipitating factors.  
- **Frequency:** Cycles occur every 3 weeks (previously regular at 28 days).  
- **Duration:** Bleeding episodes last 10–14 days.  
- **Associated Symptoms:** Fatigue, mild dizziness, no syncope. Denies fever, pelvic pain, or dyspareunia.  
- **Impact on Daily Life:** Reports missing work due to heavy bleeding.  
- **Previous Treatments:** None attempted.  
- **Relevant History:**  
  - **Obstetric:** G3P3, last delivery 10 years ago via C-section.  
  - **Gynecologic:** No prior abnormal Pap smears. No history of fibroids or endometriosis.  
  - **Medical:** Hypertension (on lisinopril), no history of bleeding disorders.  
  - **Surgical:** Appendectomy age 20.  
  - **Family History:** Mother with uterine fibroids. No known bleeding disorders.  
  - **Social:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  

*(Note: Clinician did not inquire about recent weight changes, stress levels, or medication changes that could affect bleeding.)*  

### **Examination Findings:**  
- **Vitals:** BP 130/82, HR 88, Temp 98.4°F, BMI 29.  
- **General:** Mild pallor, no signs of acute distress.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Pelvic (external):** Normal external genitalia, no lesions.  
- **Speculum Exam:** Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding at time of exam.  
- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender, no adnexal masses noted.  

*(Note: No endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound performed at this visit. Thyroid exam not documented.)*  

### **Assessment:**  
- **Primary Concern:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely secondary to hormonal imbalance or structural cause such as fibroids or adenomyosis).  
- **Differential Diagnosis:**  
  1. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory cycles).  
  2. Uterine fibroids.  
  3. Endometrial hyperplasia/polyp.  
  4. Coagulopathy (less likely given no personal/family history).  
- **Contributing Factors:** Age (perimenopausal), obesity (BMI 29), hypertension.  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Initial Workup:**  
   - CBC (to assess for anemia).  
   - TSH (to rule out thyroid dysfunction).  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (to evaluate for structural abnormalities).  
   - Consider endometrial biopsy if ultrasound is inconclusive or high-risk features present.  

2. **Symptomatic Management:**  
   - Start tranexamic acid 1g TID during heavy bleeding days.  
   - Trial of combined oral contraceptive pill (after BP recheck) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  
   - Iron supplementation if anemia confirmed.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks for review of lab/imaging results.  
   - Discuss surgical options (e.g., hysterectomy, endometrial ablation) if medical management fails.  

4. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and seek urgent care if signs of severe anemia (e.g., worsening fatigue, shortness of breath).  
   - Discussed possibility of perimenopausal transition but emphasized need to rule out other causes.  

*(Note: Did not address potential need for DVT prophylaxis with hormonal therapy or explore patient’s reproductive goals.)*  

**Impression:** Abnormal uterine bleeding likely multifactorial; initial conservative management with plan for further investigation.
