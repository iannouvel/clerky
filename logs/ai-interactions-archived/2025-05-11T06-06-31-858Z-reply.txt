A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Gynecology Consultation**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Patient Name:** Jane Doe (Fictional)  
**Age:** 40  
**BMI:** 26.4  
**Gravida:** 2, Para: 2  
**Consultant:** Dr. Smith (Fictional)  

---

**Subjective:**  
Ms. Doe presents today for follow-up regarding recent abnormal cervical screening results. She reports receiving a letter indicating "high-grade changes" (CIN 2/3) on her Pap smear and HPV-positive status (type not specified). She denies current vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pelvic pain but admits to occasional postcoital spotting over the past 6 months, which she attributed to "hormonal changes." She has no history of STIs and has been monogamous with her current partner for 5 years. Her last Pap smear was 3 years ago (reported as normal). She completed the HPV vaccine series in her 20s.  

**Past Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Hypothyroidism (stable on levothyroxine).  
- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  
- No prior cervical procedures.  

**Medications:** Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, occasional ibuprofen for headaches.  
**Allergies:** NKDA.  
**Family History:** Mother with breast cancer (age 60); no cervical/gynecologic cancers.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  
- Works as a teacher; reports moderate stress.  

*(Missing Pertinent Information:* Sexual history details [e.g., age of first intercourse, lifetime partners], contraception use, prior STI testing, or partner’s HPV status.)  

---

**Objective:**  
**Vitals:** BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile.  
**General:** Well-appearing, no distress.  
**Pelvic Exam (Limited Documentation):**  
- External: Normal vulvar anatomy, no lesions.  
- Speculum: Cervix appears grossly normal; no active bleeding.  
- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa without masses.  
*(Missing:* Cervical motion tenderness, detailed description of cervical appearance [e.g., ectropion, scarring], or documentation of whether a colposcopy was performed today.)  

---

**Assessment:**  
1. **Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 2/3)** per recent screening, HPV-associated.  
2. **Postcoital Bleeding** – Likely related to CIN, though other causes (e.g., cervicitis, polyp) not fully ruled out.  

*(Missing Differential:* No consideration of concurrent vaginal atrophy [given age], infection, or other cervical pathology.)  

---

**Plan:**  
1. **Colposcopy with Biopsy:** Scheduled for next week to confirm histologic grade. Discussed potential need for excision (e.g., LEEP) if CIN 3 is confirmed.  
2. **HPV Vaccination:** Reinforced that vaccination does not treat existing infection but advised her daughter (age 15) to complete the series.  
3. **Follow-Up:** Return for results in 2 weeks. If LEEP is needed, will coordinate with gynecologic surgery team.  
4. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Advised abstinence until after colposcopy to reduce bleeding risk.  
   - Emphasized smoking cessation (though she denies smoking) due to HPV progression risks.  
   - No discussion of partner testing or condom use to reduce transmission.  

*(Missing:* No clear plan for investigating postcoital bleeding if biopsies are benign, nor discussion of fertility implications [though patient is parous].)  

**Signed:**  
Dr. Smith

**Key Omissions (Intentional for Testing):**  
- Sexual history gaps.  
- Incomplete exam documentation (e.g., cervical description).  
- No mention of contraception or fertility concerns.  
- Limited differential for bleeding.  
- No partner/STI testing advice.
