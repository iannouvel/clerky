She reports passing small clots and describes the bleeding as significantly heavier than her usual pattern. She also notes occasional pelvic discomfort but denies severe pain.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, initially with slightly prolonged cycles (35–40 days).  \n- Over the last 3 months, bleeding has become heavier, lasting 8–10 days per cycle, with 2–3 days requiring frequent pad changes (soaking a pad every 2 hours).  \n- No associated dizziness, syncope, or symptoms of anemia, though she reports mild fatigue.  \n- No recent weight changes, fever, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at age 28.  \n- Obesity (BMI 26.2, stable over the last year).  \n- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy at age 20.  \n- No prior gynecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12.  \n- Regular cycles until PCOS diagnosis, then irregular (30–60 days).  \n- Last menstrual period: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting).  \n- Gravida 2, Para 2 – both uncomplicated pregnancies.  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  \n- Current contraception: None (seeking pregnancy in the next 1–2 years).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 500 mg twice daily (for PCOS).  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for menstrual pain (no regular NSAID use).  \n- No hormonal therapies currently.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as a schoolteacher (moderate activity level).  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Lives with partner and two children.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Ms. Doe is worried that her bleeding may indicate \"something serious like cancer.\"  \n- She is concerned about fertility implications given her plans for another pregnancy.  \n- She hopes to find a treatment that will regulate her cycles without affecting future conception.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - Speculum: Normal cervix, minimal spotting noted.  \n  - Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal masses or tenderness.  \n- **BMI:** 26.2 (counseled on weight optimization).  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven her history of PCOS, obesity, and abnormal uterine bleeding, **endometrial hyperplasia** is a key concern (aligned with **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include:  \n- Chronic anovulation (PCOS).  \n- BMI > 25.  \n- Prolonged unopposed estrogen exposure.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness (if >4 mm in a premenopausal woman with bleeding, further evaluation is needed).  \n   - **Endometrial biopsy:** To exclude hyperplasia/neoplasia (given her risk factors).  \n   - Full blood count (to check for anemia).  \n\n2. **Management (if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia – per GTG 2014):**  \n   - **First-line:** Progesterone therapy (e.g., cyclical oral progestogens or LNG-IUS).  \n   - Weight loss counseling (BMI 26.2 → aim for BMI <25 to reduce estrogen excess).  \n   - Regular follow-up with repeat biopsy in 3–6 months to assess response.  \n\n3. **Fertility Considerations:**  \n   - If she desires pregnancy, ovulation induction may be needed after ruling out malignancy.  \n   - Discussed referral to reproductive endocrinology if biopsy results are benign.  \n\n4. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Reassured that most hyperplasia without atypia is treatable.  \n   - Advised to report worsening bleeding, pain, or new symptoms.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review biopsy results in 1 week.  \n- Schedule TVUS and blood tests.  \n- Lifestyle modification support offered.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional case for testing purposes only.
