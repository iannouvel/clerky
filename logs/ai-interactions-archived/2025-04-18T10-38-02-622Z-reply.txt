She reports no significant pain or contractions but expresses concern about the implications of the breech position for delivery. History of Presenting Complaint: - First noted at 34-week routine scan. - No prior attempts at external cephalic version (ECV). - No fetal movements reported as reduced or abnormal. - Denies any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid. Past Medical History: - Hypertension (well-controlled on medication). - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine). - No known history of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia in this pregnancy. Past Surgical History: - Appendectomy (age 25). - No prior gynaecological surgeries. Drug History: - Amlodipine 5 mg OD. - Levothyroxine 75 mcg OD. - No current anticoagulants. Allergy History: - NKDA. Social History: - Non-smoker. - Occasional alcohol (1-2 units&#x2F;week). - Works as a schoolteacher. - Lives with partner, no children. Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations: - Concerned about risks of vaginal breech delivery vs. planned caesarean. - Wishes to explore ECV but anxious about discomfort. - Expects clear guidance on safest delivery options. Examination Findings: - General: Well-appearing, no signs of distress. - Abdominal: Fundal height consistent with dates.

Management Plan: 1. Counsel on ECV: - Offer ECV at 37 weeks after confirming fetal wellbeing (CTG, ultrasound). - Explain success rates (~50%) and risks (transient fetal bradycardia, placental abruption). - Advise that ECV is contraindicated if any signs of fetal compromise or ruptured membranes. 2. Delivery Options: - If ECV successful, plan for vaginal delivery with continuous monitoring. - If ECV unsuccessful or declined, discuss elective caesarean section (recommended given nulliparity and maternal age). 3. Next Steps: - Arrange urgent obstetric review for ECV consent and planning. - Schedule follow-up scan to reassess presentation. - Provide patient information leaflet on breech management. Outstanding Information Required: - Cervical status (favorability for ECV). - Detailed anomaly scan to exclude contraindications (e.g., placenta praevia). - Patient’s final decision on ECV after counseling.

- No significant pain, contractions, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage  
- Concerns about delivery risks and interest in ECV  
- PMH: Hypertension (controlled), hypothyroidism  
- No gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia  

**Details:**  
- Breech presentation first noted at 34-week scan, with no prior ECV attempted.  
- Fetal movements normal, no signs of fetal compromise.  
- Patient anxious about ECV discomfort and seeks clarity on delivery options.  
- Examination findings: Fundal height consistent with dates, breech palpable, fetal heart rate normal (140 bpm).  
- Cervical status not yet assessed.  
- ECV counseling includes success rates (~50%) and risks (e.g., transient fetal bradycardia).  
- Vaginal delivery possible if ECV successful; elective caesarean recommended if ECV unsuccessful or declined (given nulliparity and maternal age).  

**Plan:**  
1. Offer ECV at 37 weeks after confirming fetal wellbeing (CTG, ultrasound).  
2. Counsel on ECV risks, success rates, and contraindications.  
3. Arrange obstetric review for ECV consent and planning.  
4. Schedule follow-up scan to reassess presentation.  
5. Provide patient information leaflet on breech management.  
6. Assess cervical status and exclude contraindications (e.g., placenta praevia).  
7. Document patient’s final decision post-counseling.
