A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation â€“ Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
Name: Ms. Jane Doe  
Age: 22 years  
Weight: 125 kg  
BMI: 47 (Class III Obesity)  
Prior Pregnancies: 2 (1 live birth, 1 miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of irregular heavy vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. She is also concerned about recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and possible fertility issues.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Heavy, irregular bleeding for the past 6 weeks, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1 pad every 2 hours on worst days).  
- Associated with cramping lower abdominal pain, rated 6/10.  
- No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  
- Reports 3 UTIs in the past 6 months, with dysuria and frequency.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 8 weeks ago, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  
- Sexual activity: Currently sexually active with one partner, using condoms inconsistently.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at 18.  
- Gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy.  
- Depression (on sertraline 50mg daily).  
- Recurrent UTIs (last treated with nitrofurantoin 3 months ago).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section 2 years ago (emergency for fetal distress).  
- Dilation & Curettage (D&C) 1 year ago for incomplete miscarriage.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, cycles typically irregular (30-60 days).  
- Previous pregnancies:  
  - 1st pregnancy: Live birth via C-section at 38 weeks (baby 3.8kg).  
  - 2nd pregnancy: Miscarriage at 10 weeks (D&C required).  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 6 months ago).  

**Drug History:**  
- Sertraline 50mg daily (depression).  
- Paracetamol PRN for pain.  
- No regular contraception.  

**Allergy History:**  
- Penicillin (rash).  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a retail assistant.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  
- Alcohol: 4-5 units/week.  
- Lives with partner and 2-year-old child.  

**Ideas, Concerns & Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that bleeding may be due to another miscarriage or cancer.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about future fertility given PCOS and prior miscarriage.  
- **Expectations:** Wants investigations to rule out serious causes and advice on contraception/fertility planning.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese (BMI 47), no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, old Pfannenstiel scar well-healed.  
- **Speculum Exam:** Cervix appears closed, minimal bleeding present. No visible lesions.  
- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  
- **Urine Dipstick:** Negative for leukocytes/nitrites (no active UTI today).  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB):** Likely anovulatory due to PCOS, but must exclude endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia) given obesity and irregular bleeding.  
2. **Recurrent UTIs:** Possible contributing factors include obesity, incomplete bladder emptying, or behavioural factors.  
3. **Fertility Concerns:** PCOS and prior obstetric history increase risk of subfertility.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology.  
   - Endometrial biopsy if TVUS shows thickened endometrium (>10mm).  
   - Hb check for anemia due to heavy bleeding.  
   - Renal ultrasound if UTIs persist (to exclude structural abnormalities).  
2. **Medical Management:**  
   - Trial of cyclical progestogens (e.g., norethisterone) to regulate bleeding.  
   - Consider Mirena IUS for long-term endometrial protection and contraception.  
3. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Weight loss support (referral to dietitian/bariatric services).  
   - Smoking cessation counselling.  
4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results.  
   - Discuss fertility options (e.g., ovulation induction if desired).  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  
- Advised on importance of reliable contraception given PCOS-related irregular cycles.  
- Encouraged to seek urgent review if bleeding worsens or signs of infection develop.
