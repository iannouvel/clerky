A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (pseudonym for documentation)  
- **Age:** 32 years  
- **Weight:** 98 kg  
- **Height:** 1.63 m  
- **BMI:** 37 (Class II obesity)  
- **Gestation (if applicable):** Not currently pregnant  
- **Parity:** G2P2 (2 prior term vaginal deliveries)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with:  
1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)** for the past 6 months, associated with clots and fatigue.  
2. **Chronic pelvic pain**, worsening during menstruation and intercourse.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- **HMB:** Reports soaking through a super-absorbent pad every 2 hours during heavy days. Has developed iron-deficiency anaemia (previously diagnosed, not on treatment). No intermenstrual bleeding.  
- **Pelvic pain:** Dull, cramping pain radiating to lower back. No dysuria or bowel symptoms. Pain is cyclical but now persistent.  
- **Attempted treatments:** Over-the-counter NSAIDs provide partial relief.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Iron-deficiency anaemia (secondary to HMB)  
- Gestational diabetes (last pregnancy, resolved postpartum)  
- Depression (well-controlled on sertraline)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendicectomy (age 18)  
- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (2018, 2020)  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, cycles previously regular (28-day cycle) now irregular (21–35 days).  
- No history of STIs. Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  
- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception currently).  

**Drug History:**  
- Sertraline 50 mg OD  
- Ibuprofen PRN (not daily)  

**Allergies:**  
- No known drug allergies  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a school teacher (moderate stress)  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  
- Lives with partner and two children  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations (ICE):**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about fibroids or "hormonal imbalance."  
- **Concerns:** Fear of needing surgery or hysterectomy. Wants to preserve fertility for potential future pregnancy.  
- **Expectations:** Requests "a scan to see what’s wrong" and alternatives to hormonal treatment.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **Abdominal exam:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Speculum exam:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  
- **Bimanual exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged (~10-week size), non-tender. No adnexal masses.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Probable adenomyosis** (given HMB, dysmenorrhoea, and enlarged uterus).  
2. **Secondary dysmenorrhoea** – ?endometriosis (given chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (to assess for adenomyosis/fibroids).  
   - Hb/ferritin (to quantify anaemia).  
   - Consider CA-125 if endometriosis suspected (counselled on limitations).  

2. **Treatment:**  
   - **Medical:**  
     - Trial of tranexamic acid + mefenamic acid for HMB.  
     - Iron supplementation for anaemia.  
     - Discussed LNG-IUS (Mirena) as first-line for adenomyosis (fertility-preserving).  
   - **Surgical (if refractory):**  
     - Hysteroscopic assessment if ultrasound inconclusive.  
     - Laparoscopy if endometriosis suspected.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  
   - Referral to gynaecology clinic if symptoms persist.  

**Counselling:**  
- Reassured that fertility can be preserved with appropriate management.  
- Advised on weight optimisation (BMI 37) to reduce surgical/anesthetic risks if needed.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Patient consented to ultrasound and blood tests.  
- Will contact if symptoms worsen (e.g., syncope due to anaemia).
