A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, along with the HTML-formatted note with suggested adjustments:

### Guideline Reference:
**BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage**  
*Complete text:*  
"Cervical cerclage should be considered in women with a history of second-trimester loss or preterm birth who have a short cervix (<25 mm) on transvaginal ultrasound in the current pregnancy. Routine cerclage is not recommended without cervical length assessment. In women with prior second-trimester loss, cervical length surveillance should begin at 16 weeks in subsequent pregnancies."

### Key Adjustments Based on Guidelines:
1. The note originally suggested considering cerclage if cervical insufficiency is confirmed, but the guideline emphasizes that cervical length assessment should come first. The adjusted text now specifies the need for cervical length surveillance starting at 16 weeks in future pregnancies before considering cerclage.

2. The plan section was updated to reflect that cerclage should not be considered without prior cervical length assessment, in line with the guideline's recommendation against routine cerclage without this evaluation.

Both adjustments reference the BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage guideline to maintain clarity about the evidence-based recommendations driving these changes.
