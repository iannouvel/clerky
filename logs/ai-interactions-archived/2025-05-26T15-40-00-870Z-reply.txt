A: ### Summary:  
- Age: 42  
- BMI: 28  
- Presenting complaint: 4-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding with flooding (pad changes every 1–2 hours), occasional post-coital spotting, and associated fatigue.  
- No history of clotting disorders or bleeding diatheses.  
- Past medical history: Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75 mcg daily).  
- No prior pregnancies mentioned.  
- Examination findings: Pale conjunctiva (possible anemia), soft/non-tender abdomen, no palpable masses. Pelvic exam deferred.  

### Details:  
- Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is likely secondary to ovulatory dysfunction, given age, weight, and thyroid history, though structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps) cannot be excluded.  
- Possible iron-deficiency anemia is suspected due to fatigue and pallor.  
- Investigations advised include FBC, ferritin, TSH, and pelvic ultrasound to assess for structural pathology.  
- Endometrial biopsy may be considered if ultrasound is abnormal or bleeding persists.  
- Symptomatic management includes tranexamic acid 1 g TDS during heavy bleeding days and a potential trial of cyclical progestogens (e.g., norethisterone) if anovulation is confirmed.  

### Plan:  
1. Investigations:  
   - FBC, ferritin, TSH.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound.  
   - Consider endometrial biopsy if indicated.  
2. Symptomatic management:  
   - Tranexamic acid 1 g TDS during heavy bleeding.  
   - Trial of cyclical progestogens if anovulation is suspected.  
3. Follow-up:  
   - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results.  
   - Counsel on red flags (worsening anemia, persistent bleeding).  
   - Address hormonal contraception options at next visit.
