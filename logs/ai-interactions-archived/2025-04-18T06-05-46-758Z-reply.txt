A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 33 years  
- **Weight:** 98 kg  
- **Height:** 165 cm  
- **BMI:** 35.9 (Class II Obesity)  
- **Prior Pregnancies:** 2 (G2P2, both vaginal deliveries)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding**, with episodes lasting up to 10 days and requiring frequent pad changes. She describes occasional **intermenstrual bleeding** and **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia but reports fatigue, likely secondary to anemia.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began gradually, worsening over the past 3 months.  
- No prior investigations for abnormal bleeding.  
- No recent contraceptive use (last hormonal contraception discontinued 2 years ago).  
- No history of bleeding disorders.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Obesity (BMI 35.9)**  
- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** – diagnosed age 25  
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** – diagnosed age 30, managed with metformin  
- **Hypertension** – well-controlled on lisinopril  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Tonsillectomy (age 12)**  
- **Caesarean section (5 years ago)** – for fetal distress  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- **Menarche:** Age 13  
- **Cycle:** Previously irregular (PCOS), now heavier and prolonged  
- **Last Pap Smear:** 2 years ago (normal)  
- **Contraception:** Condoms (no hormonal methods)  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1000 mg BD  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD  
- Ferrous sulfate (recently started for anemia)  

**Allergies:**  
- NKDA  

**Social History:**  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator (sedentary role)  
- **Alcohol:** Occasional (1-2 units/week)  
- **Smoking:** Never  
- **Exercise:** Minimal due to fatigue  
- **Diet:** High processed foods, admits to difficulty with weight management  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that her bleeding is "hormonal" but fears "something more serious."  
- **Concerns:** Anemia affecting her energy levels; potential impact on fertility (considering future pregnancy).  
- **Expectations:** Wants a clear explanation and treatment to regulate bleeding.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, pale conjunctiva (mild anemia).  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal; minimal blood in vault.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly bulky, non-tender; no adnexal masses.  
- **No signs of infection or cervical motion tenderness.**  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Findings consistent with **endometrial hyperplasia** (endometrial thickness 18 mm, heterogeneous echo pattern).  
2. **Hb:** 10.2 g/dL (mild anemia).  
3. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Scheduled to exclude atypia (per **GTG 2014 Endometrial Hyperplasia guidelines**).  

**Management Plan (Based on GTG 2014 Guidelines):**  
1. **Progestin Therapy (First-line for non-atypical hyperplasia):**  
   - **Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg daily for 14 days/cycle** (await biopsy results).  
   - If biopsy confirms **non-atypical hyperplasia**, continue cyclical progestins for 3-6 months with repeat biopsy.  
2. **Weight Management:**  
   - Referral to **diabetes-obesity clinic** for structured weight loss (lifestyle + metformin continued).  
   - Emphasis on **5-10% weight loss to reduce estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation**.  
3. **Anemia:**  
   - Continue iron supplementation; recheck Hb in 6 weeks.  
4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review biopsy results in 2 weeks.  
   - Discuss long-term options (e.g., LNG-IUS if hyperplasia confirmed without atypia).  
   - **If atypia present:** Refer to gynaecology oncology for further management (risk of progression).  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that **endometrial hyperplasia is treatable**, especially without atypia.  
- Advised on **increased malignancy risk with obesity/PCOS** and importance of adherence to therapy.  
- Encouraged to engage with weight-loss support services.  

**Next Steps:**  
- **Biopsy results review.**  
- **3-month follow-up ultrasound to assess endometrial response.**
