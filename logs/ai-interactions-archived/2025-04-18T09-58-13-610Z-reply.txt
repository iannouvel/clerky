A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [REDACTED]  
- Age: 23 years  
- Weight: 110 kg | BMI: 39.3 (Class III Obesity)  
- Gravida: 4 | Para: [Not specified]  
- Occupation: Retail assistant  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient reports a 6-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding, with episodes lasting up to 10 days and requiring frequent pad changes. She describes associated fatigue but denies dizziness or syncope.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Bleeding pattern: Irregular cycles (21–45 days), with prolonged heavy bleeding (soaking 8–10 pads/day).  
- No intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding.  
- No dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain.  
- No recent weight changes, hirsutism, or galactorrhoea.  
- No symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at 18.  
- Gestational diabetes (last pregnancy).  
- No history of thromboembolism or hypertension.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  
- Caesarean section x1 (last delivery).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche: 12 years.  
- Previous pregnancies: 4 (3 vaginal deliveries, 1 Caesarean).  
- Last menstrual period: 3 weeks ago (ongoing bleeding).  
- Contraception: None currently; previously used combined oral contraceptive pill (discontinued due to weight gain).  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 500 mg BD (for PCOS).  
- No anticoagulants or hormonal therapies.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day.  
- Alcohol: Occasional (1–2 units/week).  
- No recreational drug use.  
- Lives with partner and children; limited physical activity due to work demands.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Concerned about cancer risk due to family history (aunt with endometrial cancer).  
- Wants to regulate cycles and reduce bleeding.  
- Hoping to avoid surgery.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Obese, no pallor or signs of hyperandrogenism.  
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- Speculum: Cervix appears normal; minimal bleeding noted.  
- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size; no adnexal masses.  

**Assessment:**  
- Likely **complex endometrial hyperplasia (without atypia)** secondary to chronic anovulation (PCOS) and obesity.  
- High BMI and persistent bleeding warrant further investigation to exclude malignancy.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness.  
   - Endometrial biopsy (pipelle) for histology.  
   - FBC (to exclude anaemia), HbA1c (diabetes monitoring), lipid profile.  

2. **Medical Management:**  
   - First-line: **Progestogen therapy** (e.g., oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10–20 mg/day for 14 days/cycle or LNG-IUS if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia).  
   - Weight loss support: Referral to dietetics and bariatric services.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Repeat endometrial biopsy in 3–6 months if hyperplasia confirmed.  
   - Discuss contraception (LNG-IUS preferred for endometrial protection).  

4. **Patient Education:**  
   - Counsel on cancer risk reduction via weight loss and smoking cessation.  
   - Advise urgent review if bleeding worsens or new symptoms arise.  

**Prognosis:**  
- Good with compliance to progestogen therapy and weight management.
