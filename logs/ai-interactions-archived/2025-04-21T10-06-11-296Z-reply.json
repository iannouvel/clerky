Differential includes:  \n   - Anovulatory cycles (likely given age)  \n   - Endometrial hyperplasia or polyp (higher risk due to nulligravidity, age, BMI)  \n   - Less likely: coagulopathy, malignancy (though family history raises low suspicion for hereditary syndromes).  \n\n2. **Hypertension, hyperlipidemia** – stable.  \n\n---  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - *Incomplete workup:* Ordered transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness but did not schedule endometrial biopsy despite AUB in a high-risk age group.  \n   - No CBC or thyroid studies initiated.  \n\n2. **Management:**  \n   - Initiated oral progestin (medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily for 14 days) to regulate bleeding. *Did not discuss risks/benefits of hormonal therapy.*  \n   - Advised patient to track bleeding patterns and return if symptoms worsen. *No clear follow-up timeline provided.*  \n   - Recommended weight loss for metabolic health but no specific resources/referrals offered.  \n\n3. **Patient counseling:**  \n   - Discussed possibility of endometrial pathology but minimized concerns without biopsy.  \n   - *Did not address contraception needs (if sexually active) or bone health post-menopause.*  \n\n---  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \nPlan for patient to return in 3 months or sooner if bleeding persists. *No contingency plan for failed medical management.*  \n\n---  \n*This dictation is fictional for testing purposes only.
