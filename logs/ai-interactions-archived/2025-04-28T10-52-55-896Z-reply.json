Contractions began 6 hours prior, increasing in intensity. Membranes ruptured spontaneously 2 hours ago with clear fluid. Patient reports normal fetal movements prior to labor but notes decreased perception of movement in the last hour. Incomplete History: - No documentation of prenatal care attendance or prior ultrasound findings. - Social history (e.g., smoking, substance use) not elicited. - Family history of obstetric complications not asked. Examination Findings: - Vitals: BP 120&#x2F;78, HR 88, Temp 37.1°C - Abdomen: Fundal height 38 cm, vertex presentation, longitudinal lie. - Contractions: Regular, every 3 minutes, lasting 60 seconds, moderate intensity. - Cervical Exam: 5 cm dilated, 80% effaced, -1 station. - Fetal Heart Rate (FHR): - Baseline 150 bpm. - Recurrent late decelerations noted over 30-minute tracing. - Variability: Minimal (absent accelerations). - No documentation of tocodynamometer placement or contraction correlation. Incomplete Examination: - No Leopold’s maneuvers performed to confirm presentation. - No documentation of amniotic fluid volume or meconium presence. - Maternal pulse not checked to rule out superimposition on FHR tracing. Impression: - Intrapartum fetal heart rate tracing concerning for recurrent late decelerations with minimal variability in an 18-year-old primigravida at 39 weeks. - Differential includes uteroplacental insufficiency, cord compression, or maternal hemodynamic instability (e.g., dehydration, hypotension). Management Plan: 1. Immediate Actions: - Maternal repositioning (left lateral tilt). - IV fluid bolus (500 mL normal saline) to optimize perfusion. - Supplemental O2 via non-rebreather mask at 10 L&#x2F;min. - Discontinue oxytocin if infusing (not documented in history). 2. Monitoring: - Continuous FHR monitoring; consider fetal scalp electrode for direct assessment if tracing remains indeterminate. - Repeat cervical exam in 1 hour to assess labor progress. 3. Escalation: - Notify obstetric team for potential expedited delivery (e.g., operative vaginal or cesarean delivery) if tracing does not improve. - Anesthesia consult for epidural placement (if not already in place) or surgical prep. 4. Patient Counseling: - Explained concerns regarding fetal tolerance of labor. - Patient verbalized understanding and consented to possible interventions. Plan for Follow-Up: - Reassess FHR tracing after interventions. - Document decision-to-delivery interval if intervention required.
