She describes passing small clots and experiencing fatigue, which she attributes to blood loss. No associated pelvic pain or dyspareunia.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago with progressively heavier periods.  \n- Bleeding duration has increased from 5 to 10 days per cycle, with cycles varying from 21 to 45 days.  \n- Denies post-coital bleeding or discharge.  \n- No weight loss, fever, or systemic symptoms.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg OD).  \n- No history of diabetes or thyroid dysfunction.  \n- No prior thromboembolic events.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 22).  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12.  \n- Regular cycles until symptom onset.  \n- Last menstrual period: 2 weeks ago (heavy, prolonged).  \n- No history of cervical screening abnormalities (last smear 2 years ago, normal).  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  \n- Contraception: Barrier methods only (no hormonal contraception).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for menstrual pain (no regular NSAID use).  \n- No herbal supplements.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Mother: Type 2 diabetes.  \n- No known family history of gynaecological cancers.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Alcohol: 2-3 units/week.  \n- Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary role).  \n- Lives with husband and two teenage children.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- The patient is worried that her symptoms may indicate \"something serious like cancer.\"  \n- She is concerned about the impact of heavy bleeding on her daily life and work.  \n- She hopes to explore treatment options that avoid surgery if possible.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General inspection: Mild pallor (no overt signs of anaemia).  \n- Abdominal examination: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Speculum examination: No vulval/vaginal lesions. Cervix appears healthy.  \n- Bimanual examination: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal masses or tenderness.  \n\n**Investigations:**  \n- Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) arranged: Endometrial thickness measured at 12 mm (abnormal for this patient’s age and post-menopausal status).  \n- Pipelle endometrial biopsy performed in clinic (awaiting histology).  \n- FBC: Hb 105 g/L (mild anaemia).  \n\n**Management Plan (Based on GTG 2014 Endometrial Hyperplasia Guidelines):**  \n1. **Provisional Diagnosis:** Likely endometrial hyperplasia (await biopsy confirmation). Given her BMI 22.9 and absence of atypia risk factors (e.g., diabetes), non-atypical hyperplasia is suspected.  \n2. **Medical Management:**  \n   - First-line: Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for endometrial protection and bleeding control.  \n   - Oral progestogens (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate) offered if LNG-IUS declined.  \n   - Iron supplementation for anaemia.  \n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat endometrial biopsy in 6 months to assess response.  \n   - TVUS for endometrial surveillance if LNG-IUS is used.  \n4. **Lifestyle Advice:**  \n   - Reassurance regarding low malignancy risk but emphasis on adherence to follow-up.  \n   - Weight maintenance (BMI 22.9 is protective).  \n5. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Discussed red flags (e.g., worsening bleeding, pain) requiring urgent review.  \n   - Provided GTG 2014 patient information leaflet on endometrial hyperplasia.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis 47-year-old woman presents with symptoms and findings consistent with endometrial hyperplasia. Management aligns with GTG 2014 guidelines, prioritising hormonal treatment and surveillance. Histology will guide further decisions.
