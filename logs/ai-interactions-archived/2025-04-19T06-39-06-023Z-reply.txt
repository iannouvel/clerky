She presents today for preconception counseling as she and her partner are considering another pregnancy. She reports good seizure control on lamotrigine, with her last seizure 18 months ago. History of Presenting Complaint: - Epilepsy: Well-controlled on lamotrigine. No recent seizures. - Previous pregnancies: - First pregnancy (age 28): Uncomplicated, vaginal delivery at term. No seizures during pregnancy. - Second pregnancy (age 31): Miscarriage at 10 weeks (no known cause). - Third pregnancy (age 34): Uncomplicated, vaginal delivery at term. Seizure-free throughout. - No history of status epilepticus. - No recent medication changes. *(Missing pertinent information: Frequency of breakthrough seizures in past, compliance with medication, any prior fetal anomalies, or complications in previous pregnancies.)* Examination Findings: - General appearance: Well, no signs of distress. - Neurological examination: No focal deficits. - Blood pressure: 122&#x2F;78 mmHg - Weight: 82 kg, Height: 165 cm (BMI 29.9) *(Missing pertinent information: Neurological exam details such as gait assessment, cognitive screening, or signs of medication side effects.)* Management Plan: 1. Preconception Counseling: - Advised that lamotrigine is a preferred antiepileptic drug (AED) in pregnancy but requires close monitoring due to altered pharmacokinetics. - Recommended referral to a neurologist for preconception AED review. - Discussed importance of folic acid (5mg daily) starting at least 3 months prior to conception. 2. Pregnancy Monitoring: - Advised that lamotrigine levels may fluctuate in pregnancy, requiring dose adjustments. - Will need regular neurology and obstetric reviews. - Discussed potential risks of seizures in pregnancy (e.g., trauma, fetal hypoxia). 3. Lifestyle Advice: - Encouraged good sleep hygiene and stress management to reduce seizure triggers. - Advised against abrupt medication changes. 4. Follow-Up: - Booked for neurology review in 4 weeks. - Advised to return if pregnancy is confirmed for early obstetric input. *(Missing pertinent advice: Discussion of alternative contraception if pregnancy not immediate, risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), or detailed birth plan considerations.)* Impression: Well-controlled epilepsy on lamotrigine, planning pregnancy.

- History of focal epilepsy, well-controlled on lamotrigine (last seizure 18 months ago).  
- No seizures during prior pregnancies.  

**Details:**  
- Epilepsy is stable on lamotrigine 200mg BD, with no recent seizures or medication changes.  
- Previous pregnancies: uncomplicated term deliveries (ages 28 and 34) and one miscarriage (age 31).  
- Neurological exam unremarkable; blood pressure normal.  
- Advised lamotrigine is preferred in pregnancy but requires close monitoring due to pharmacokinetic changes.  
- Recommended high-dose folic acid (5mg daily) starting 3 months preconception.  
- Stressed need for regular neurology and obstetric reviews during pregnancy.  
- Encouraged sleep hygiene and stress management to minimize seizure triggers.  

**Plan:**  
1. Refer to neurologist for preconception AED review.  
2. Start folic acid 5mg daily at least 3 months preconception.  
3. Schedule neurology follow-up in 4 weeks.  
4. Early obstetric referral if pregnancy confirmed.  
5. Monitor lamotrigine levels closely during pregnancy with dose adjustments as needed.  
6. Reinforce avoidance of abrupt medication changes.
