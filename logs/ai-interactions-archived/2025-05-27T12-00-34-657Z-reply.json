She reports irregular menstrual cycles with episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, requiring frequent pad changes (every 1–2 hours on heavy days). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but notes occasional clotting. She has associated mild pelvic discomfort but no severe pain, dyspareunia, or postcoital bleeding.  \n\nShe has no history of bleeding disorders, prior gynecologic surgeries, or hormonal contraceptive use. She has two prior uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with one partner and uses condoms inconsistently. She has no known drug allergies.  \n\n*[Missing Pertinent Questions: Family history of gynecologic cancers, recent weight changes, thyroid symptoms, medication review (e.g., anticoagulants), and screening for anemia symptoms (fatigue, dizziness).]*  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Hypertension, well-controlled on lisinopril  \n- No prior surgeries  \n- No known history of fibroids, polyps, or endometriosis  \n\n### **Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use  \n- Works as a teacher, moderately active  \n\n### **Review of Systems:**  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss  \n- **Cardiovascular:** No palpitations or syncope  \n- **Gastrointestinal:** No nausea/vomiting, normal bowel habits  \n- **Genitourinary:** No dysuria or urinary frequency  \n\n### **Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 128/78, HR 78, BMI 28  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses  \n- **Pelvic:** External genitalia normal; speculum exam reveals minimal blood in vaginal vault; cervix appears normal.
