Smith, OB/GYN <br><strong>Patient:</strong> Ms. J. Doe (Fictional Name) <br><strong>Age:</strong> 26 <br><strong>Weight:</strong> 136 kg | <strong>BMI:</strong> 52 <br><strong>Prior Pregnancies:</strong> 2 (1 term vaginal delivery, 1 first-trimester miscarriage) <br><br>---<br><br>### <strong>History of Presenting Complaint</strong> <br>Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns: <br>1. <strong>Recurrent Pelvic Pain</strong>: Intermittent sharp pain in the left lower quadrant, worsening over the past 3 months. Pain is non-cyclical, exacerbated by prolonged standing, and associated with occasional post-coital bleeding. No fever or urinary symptoms. <br>2. <strong>Irregular Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB)</strong>: Cycles vary from 21–45 days, with flooding/clotting lasting 7–10 days. Reports fatigue and dizziness consistent with anemia. <br><br>### <strong>Past Medical/Surgical History</strong> <br>- <strong>Medical</strong>: PCOS (diagnosed age 18), insulin resistance, depression. <br>- <strong>Surgical</strong>: Appendectomy (age 12), cesarean section (age 23 for fetal distress). <br>- <strong>Gynecological</strong>: <br>- Miscarriage (age 25, managed medically). <br>- History of bacterial vaginosis (recurrent). <br><br>### <strong>Medications &amp; Allergies</strong> <br>- Metformin 500 mg BD, Sertraline 50 mg OD, OCP (previously, discontinued due to HMB). <br>- <strong>Allergies</strong>: NKDA. <br><br>### <strong>Social History</strong> <br>- Works as a childcare assistant; limited physical activity due to pain/fatigue. <br>- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history). Occasional alcohol. <br>- Lives with partner; uses condoms inconsistently. <br><br>### <strong>Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations</strong> <br>- <strong>Ideas</strong>: Worried pain may be \"cysts or endometriosis.\" Anxious about fertility due to irregular cycles. <br>- <strong>Concerns</strong>: Fear of cancer due to family history (aunt with ovarian cancer). <br>- <strong>Expectations</strong>: Requests \"scan to check everything\" and options to regulate bleeding. <br><br>---<br><br>### <strong>Examination Findings</strong> <br>- <strong>General</strong>: Obese (BMI 52), acanthosis nigricans noted. Pale conjunctiva. <br>- <strong>Abdominal</strong>: Soft, non-distended. Tenderness in left iliac fossa; no palpable mass. <br>- <strong>Pelvic Exam</strong>: <br>- <strong>Speculum</strong>: Cervix appears healthy; minimal old blood in vault. <br>- <strong>Bimanual</strong>: Uterus bulky, non-tender. Left adnexal fullness (+/- complex cyst). No cervical motion tenderness. <br><br>---<br><br>### <strong>Differential Diagnoses</strong> <br>1. <strong>Complex Adnexal Mass</strong>: Likely hemorrhagic ovarian cyst vs. endometrioma (given history of PCOS/pain). <br>2. <strong>AUB-O (Ovulatory Dysfunction)</strong>: Secondary to PCOS/obesity. <br><br>---<br><br>### <strong>Management Plan</strong> <br>1. <strong>Investigations</strong>: <br>- <strong>Pelvic USS</strong>: To characterize adnexal mass and endometrial thickness. <br>- <strong>Bloods</strong>: FBC (anemia workup), HbA1c (diabetes screening), CA-125 (cautiously, given family history). <br>2. <strong>Symptomatic Relief</strong>: <br>- Tranexamic acid for HMB; iron supplementation if anemic. <br>- Trial of NSAIDs for pain (avoid opioids given depression history). <br>3. <strong>Long-Term</strong>: <br>- Weight loss support (bariatric referral if interested). <br>- Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD vs. cyclical progestins) post-imaging. <br>4. <strong>Follow-Up</strong>: <br>- Review USS results in 2 weeks. If cyst &gt;5 cm/persistent, consider laparoscopy. <br>- Screen for depression exacerbation (link to counselor). <br><br><strong>Patient Counseled</strong>: Reassured no immediate red flags for malignancy but emphasized need for further evaluation. Advised smoking cessation support. <br><br><strong>Signed:</strong> Dr. A. Smith <br>*For fictional testing purposes only. No real medical advice.* <br><br>--- <br>*Note: This scenario includes intentional complexity (e.g., obesity compounding PCOS, adnexal mass in context of cancer anxiety) for training purposes.*</p>"
