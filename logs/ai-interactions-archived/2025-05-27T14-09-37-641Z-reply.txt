A: **Clinical Dictation: Fictional Patient Encounter**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe (fictional)  
**Age:** 64  
**BMI:** 32.1  
**Gravida/Parity:** G3P3  
**Date of Encounter:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith (fictional)  

### **Subjective:**  
Ms. Doe presents today reporting a 6-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She describes intermittent heavy bleeding, sometimes with clots, occurring unpredictably. She denies associated pain but reports fatigue, which she attributes to blood loss. She has no history of gynecologic malignancies. Her last menstrual period was approximately 8 months ago, but she has since experienced irregular spotting and episodes of heavier bleeding.  

She has a history of hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril) and type 2 diabetes (on metformin). She denies any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. She has had three prior vaginal deliveries without complications. She is sexually active with one partner and uses barrier contraception inconsistently. She has never had an abnormal Pap smear.  

*[Note: Clinician did not inquire about recent weight changes, medication adherence, or family history of gynecologic cancers.]*  

### **Objective:**  
**Vitals:** BP 128/78, HR 76, Temp 98.4°F, SpO2 98% RA  
**General:** Well-appearing, no acute distress  
**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, obese, no palpable masses  
**Pelvic Exam:** External genitalia normal. Speculum exam reveals a small amount of dark blood in the vaginal vault. Cervix appears normal. Bimanual exam demonstrates a mildly enlarged, non-tender uterus without adnexal masses.  

*[Note: Clinician did not perform an endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound at this visit.]*  

### **Assessment:**  
**Primary Concern:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely postmenopausal given prior amenorrhea)  
**Differential Diagnosis:**  
1. Endometrial hyperplasia  
2. Endometrial polyp  
3. Hormonal imbalance (e.g., unopposed estrogen effect)  
4. Less likely: Endometrial carcinoma (risk factors include age, obesity)  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Diagnostics:**  
   - Order transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness.  
   - Schedule outpatient endometrial biopsy for further evaluation.  
   - Basic labs: CBC (to evaluate for anemia), HbA1c (given diabetes history).  
   - *[Note: Clinician did not order coagulation studies or thyroid function tests.]*  

2. **Management:**  
   - If bleeding becomes heavy or symptomatic, consider short-course progestin therapy pending biopsy results.  
   - Recommend iron supplementation if anemia is confirmed.  
   - Advise patient to track bleeding episodes and return if worsening symptoms occur.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 2 weeks for biopsy results and further management.  
   - If endometrial thickness >4mm on ultrasound, biopsy is strongly indicated.  

*[Note: Clinician did not discuss weight management or long-term risks of unopposed estrogen exposure.]*  

**Impression:** Abnormal uterine bleeding in a postmenopausal patient with obesity—requires further workup to rule out malignancy or hyperplasia.  

**End of Dictation.**  

*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is given or implied.*
