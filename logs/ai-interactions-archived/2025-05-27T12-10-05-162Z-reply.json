She reports irregular, heavy menstrual periods lasting 8–10 days, with passage of clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but admits to occasional spotting. She has no dysmenorrhea or postcoital bleeding. She has not tracked her cycles but estimates they occur every 3–6 weeks.  \n\n**Relevant Medical History:**  \n- Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily).  \n- No history of bleeding disorders or prior gynecologic surgery.  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for headaches.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Mother with hypertension.  \n- No known family history of gynecologic malignancies or bleeding disorders.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- Sexually active with one partner, using condoms inconsistently.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well, no pallor.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal; no visible lesions.  \n- Bimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size; no adnexal tenderness.  \n*(Incomplete: No documentation of vital signs, BMI, or thyroid exam.)*  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nAbnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a perimenopausal patient. Differential includes:  \n1. Anovulatory cycles (likely given age/irregularity).  \n2. Structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps—though none palpated).  \n3.
