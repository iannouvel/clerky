She reports heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding for the past six months, with episodes lasting 10–14 days and requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 6–8 pads per day). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but notes occasional clots. She reports associated fatigue but denies dizziness, syncope, or significant pain.  \n\nShe has a history of four uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. She has no known medical conditions and takes no medications. She denies a family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies. She has no known drug allergies.  \n\n*Social History:* Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Sexually active with one partner, using condoms inconsistently for contraception.  \n\n*Review of Systems:* Positive for fatigue. Denies weight changes, hair loss, or skin changes.
