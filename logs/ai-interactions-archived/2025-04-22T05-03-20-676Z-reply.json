She describes the pain as a constant, dull ache in the suprapubic region, radiating to her lower back, with sharp exacerbations during menses. Bleeding lasts 7–8 days, requiring hourly pad changes on heavy days, with frequent clots. She reports fatigue but denies syncope or dizziness. She has tried over-the-counter NSAIDs with partial relief. No documentation of prior hormonal therapy or imaging.  \n\n*[Missing Pertinent Questions:]*  \n- Sexual activity and dyspareunia not explored.  \n- No inquiry about intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding.  \n- Family history of endometriosis/adenomyosis not obtained.  \n- Current contraception use not discussed.  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Cesarean delivery x2 (ages 22 and 24).  \n- Spontaneous vaginal delivery at 26 weeks (neonatal demise; cause not documented).  \n- Miscarriage at 20 weeks (no further details).  \n- No known chronic illnesses.  \n\n### **Medications/Allergies:**  \n- Ibuprofen PRN (no allergies reported).  \n\n### **Physical Examination:**  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, mild suprapubic tenderness.
