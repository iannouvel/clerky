She is currently 10 weeks pregnant (by last menstrual period) and is concerned about recurrent miscarriage.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - The patient reports intermittent dark-brown vaginal bleeding, occasionally mixed with fresh red blood, for the past 2 weeks.  - She describes cramping lower abdominal pain, worse on the left side, but no fever or foul-smelling discharge.  - No history of trauma or recent intercourse preceding symptoms.  - She has had 3 prior pregnancies:    - First pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery at age 16 (no complications).    - Second pregnancy: Miscarriage at 8 weeks (spontaneous, no intervention).    - Third pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery 6 months ago (no complications).  - She has not used contraception since her last delivery.  Past Medical History:  - No known chronic medical conditions.  - No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  - No previous hospital admissions (other than deliveries).  Past Surgical History:  - No prior surgeries.  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12.  - Regular cycles (28-day cycle, 5-day duration) prior to current pregnancy.  - No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 1 year ago).  - No abnormal cervical screening history.  Drug History:  - No regular medications.  - Takes over-the-counter paracetamol occasionally for headaches.  - No current use of folic acid or prenatal vitamins.  Allergy History:  - No known drug allergies.  Social History:  - Works part-time in retail.  - Lives with her partner and 2 children.  - Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  - Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  - Denies recreational drug use.  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - She is worried this may be another miscarriage and fears complications due to her rapid repeat pregnancies.  - She wants to know if the pregnancy is viable and if she needs any treatment.  - She is also concerned about the impact of smoking on her pregnancy.  Examination Findings:  - General appearance: Well, no pallor or distress.  - Abdomen: Soft, mild suprapubic tenderness, no guarding/rigidity.  - Speculum exam: Small amount of dark blood in vaginal vault, closed cervical os.  - Bimanual exam: Uterus slightly enlarged (consistent with 10 weeks), mild left adnexal tenderness, no palpable masses.  Assessment:  1. Threatened miscarriage – Given history of bleeding and pain but closed os, pregnancy may still be viable.  2. Possible subchorionic haemorrhage – Could explain intermittent bleeding.  3. Risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome – Rapid repeat pregnancy, smoking, lack of prenatal vitamins.  Management Plan:  1. Urgent ultrasound – To confirm viability, rule out ectopic pregnancy, and assess for subchorionic haemorrhage.  2. Serial beta-hCG monitoring – If ultrasound is inconclusive.  3. Advice:     - Pelvic rest (avoid intercourse/tampons).     - Start folic acid and prenatal vitamins.     - Smoking cessation support (referral to cessation program).     - Close follow-up in early pregnancy clinic.  4. Emotional support – Counselling regarding recurrent pregnancy loss risks and contraception options post-recovery.  Follow-Up:  - Review ultrasound results within 48 hours.  - Return if bleeding worsens or severe pain develops.  ---  Second Scenario – Complex Gynaecological Issue  Patient Details:  Name: [Fictional Name – e.g., \"Ms. Y\"]  Age: 18 years  Weight: 52 kg  BMI: 20  Number of prior pregnancies: 3 (G3P1A2 – 1 live birth, 2 miscarriages)  Presenting Complaint:  Severe dysmenorrhea and heavy menstrual bleeding for 6 months, worsening in the last 2 cycles.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Periods last 7-8 days, with flooding/clots.  - Pain starts 2 days before bleeding, radiates to back/thighs, not relieved by NSAIDs.  - Associated fatigue and dizziness (possible anaemia).  - No intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding.  Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:  - Anaemia (treated with iron supplements in past).  - No surgeries.  - Previous copper IUD inserted 1 year ago (removed 3 months ago due to pain).  Drug/Allergy/Social History:  - Takes ibuprofen for pain (limited relief).  - No allergies.  - Student, single, sexually active (1 partner, uses condoms inconsistently).  - Non-smoker, no alcohol/drugs.  Examination Findings:  - Mild pallor.  - Abdomen: Soft, tender suprapubically.  - PV exam: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; no adnexal masses.  Assessment:  1. Secondary dysmenorrhea – Possible adenomyosis/endometriosis given refractory pain.  2. Menorrhagia with iron deficiency anaemia – Needs haemoglobin check.  Management Plan:  1. Bloods – FBC, ferritin, coagulation screen.  2. Pelvic ultrasound – Rule out structural causes.  3. Trial of hormonal therapy – Combined oral contraceptive pill or progesterone-only options.  4. Gynaecology referral – If symptoms persist for laparoscopy.  Follow-Up:  - Review blood results and ultrasound.  - Discuss long-term contraception if desired.  ---  Note: This dictation is entirely fictional for testing purposes.
