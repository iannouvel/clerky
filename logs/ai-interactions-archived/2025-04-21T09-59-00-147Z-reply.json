She reports intermittent spotting between cycles. No associated fever, dizziness, or syncope. Denies dyspareunia but notes mild pelvic discomfort.  \n\n**Relevant Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (last delivery 3 years ago).  \n- No prior gynecologic surgeries.  \n- No known bleeding disorders.  \n- No history of STIs (last screening 2 years ago, negative).  \n- Medications: Occasional ibuprofen for cramps. No hormonal contraception.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks/week).  \n- Works as a teacher; moderate stress levels.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well-nourished, no pallor.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Pelvic exam: Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding at time of exam. Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size. Adnexa without masses. *(Note: No speculum exam documented; endometrial sampling not performed.)*  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects of History/Exam:**  \n- Family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic cancers not elicited.  \n- Thyroid symptoms (fatigue, weight changes) not explored.  \n- Sexual history (e.g., new partners, contraceptive needs) not addressed.  \n- No documentation of hemoglobin/iron studies despite reported heavy bleeding.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nAbnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial polyps, or leiomyoma. Less likely: coagulopathy or malignancy.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Initial Workup:**  \n   - CBC, ferritin, TSH, and coagulation studies if indicated.  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound to assess for structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps).  \n   - Consider outpatient endometrial biopsy if ultrasound abnormal or risk factors present *(though not yet discussed with patient)*.  \n\n2. **Symptomatic Relief:**  \n   - Trial of NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for heavy bleeding.  \n   - If bleeding persists, consider short-course progesterone or combined oral contraceptives *(patient’s preference not yet assessed)*.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Return in 4 weeks for results and reassessment.  \n   - Counsel on iron-rich diet given potential anemia *(no formal anemia screening done yet)*.  \n\n**Patient Counseling:**  \nDiscussed likely benign causes but emphasized need to rule out serious conditions. Advised to seek urgent care if severe bleeding (e.g., dizziness, soaking >1 pad/hour). Patient agreed to labs and ultrasound but declined same-day biopsy due to anxiety.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await test results.  \n- Address contraceptive preferences and sexual health at next visit.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional)  \n**Date:** [Today’s date]  \n\n---  \n*Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
