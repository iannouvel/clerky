A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. Jane Doe  
- Age: 24  
- Weight: 58 kg  
- Height: 1.71 m  
- BMI: 19.7 (normal range)  
- Gravida: 3, Para: 2 (previous term vaginal delivery x2, no miscarriages)  
- Gestation: 36+2 weeks  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents to the antenatal clinic concerned about her baby’s position. She reports feeling "hard kicks low in the pelvis" and a "rounded lump under the ribs," which she suspects may indicate a breech presentation.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Noticed unusual fetal movements over the past 2 weeks.  
- No associated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or reduced fetal movements.  
- No history of trauma or recent illness.  
- No leakage of fluid per vagina.  
- Previous pregnancies were cephalic presentations with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- No significant medical conditions.  
- No history of gestational diabetes or hypertension.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 16).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Regular menstrual cycles prior to pregnancy.  
- No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis.  

**Drug History:**  
- Pregnancy multivitamins (folic acid, vitamin D).  
- No regular medications.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use.  
- Works as a primary school teacher.  
- Lives with partner, supportive home environment.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that breech presentation may require a caesarean section, which she wishes to avoid if possible.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about risks to the baby if vaginal breech delivery is attempted.  
- **Expectations:** Hopes for guidance on options to turn the baby or safely deliver vaginally.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **Abdominal examination:** Fundal height consistent with dates. Fetal head palpated in the upper abdomen (fundus), with breech engaged in the pelvis.  
- **Auscultation:** Fetal heart rate 142 bpm, normal variability.  
- **Speculum/cervical examination (deferred unless indicated):** Not performed at this stage.  
- **Ultrasound confirmation:** Arranged and confirmed frank breech presentation with flexed legs, normal amniotic fluid volume, and estimated fetal weight ~2.8 kg (50th centile).  

**Discussion & Management Plan (Based on *BJOG 2017 – Management of Breech Presentation*):**  
1. **Counseling on options:**  
   - **External Cephalic Version (ECV):** Offered as first-line management given her favourable factors (adequate fluid, normal BMI, no contraindications). Success rate ~50%, with low complication risk.  
   - **Vaginal breech delivery:** Discussed as a potential option if ECV fails, provided she meets criteria (experienced team, favourable fetal size/position).  
   - **Elective caesarean section:** Alternative if ECV unsuccessful or if she declines vaginal breech delivery.  

2. **Next steps:**  
   - Scheduled ECV at 37 weeks with pre-procedure CTG.  
   - Post-ECV ultrasound to confirm position.  
   - If unsuccessful, detailed discussion on delivery preferences and referral to a consultant obstetrician for further counselling.  

3. **Safety netting:**  
   - Advised to report any reduced fetal movements, abdominal pain, or contractions urgently.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review in clinic post-ECV to reassess and finalise birth plan.
