A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 35 years  
- **Weight:** 68 kg  
- **Height:** 1.65 m  
- **BMI:** 25 kg/m²  
- **Gravida:** 5 (prior pregnancies)  
- **Para:** 3 (live births), 1 (miscarriage), 1 (termination)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of **heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)** and **intermenstrual bleeding**, as well as **chronic pelvic pain** worsening over the past 3 months. She also reports **dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)**.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Heavy bleeding: Soaking through a pad every 2 hours for the first 2 days of her cycle.  
- Intermenstrual bleeding: Occurs mid-cycle and is dark brown.  
- Pelvic pain: Dull, constant ache in the lower abdomen, radiating to the lower back.  
- Dyspareunia: Deep pain, particularly in certain positions.  
- No fever, nausea, or vomiting.  
- No urinary or bowel symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Iron deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron supplements).  
- Depression (on sertraline 50 mg daily).  
- No known diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x 2 (last one 4 years ago).  
- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (right ovary, 8 years ago).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche: Age 12.  
- Cycles: Previously regular (28-day cycle), now irregular (21–35 days).  
- Contraception: Copper IUD inserted 3 years ago (no complications at insertion).  
- Last cervical smear: 2 years ago (normal).  
- STI screening: Last tested 1 year ago (negative).  

**Drug History:**  
- Sertraline 50 mg OD.  
- Ferrous sulfate 200 mg BD (as needed for anaemia).  
- Paracetamol PRN for pain.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Occupation: Office administrator.  
- Smokes: 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-years).  
- Alcohol: 5–7 units/week.  
- Recreational drugs: None.  
- Relationship status: Married, sexually active with one partner.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about fibroids or endometriosis given her symptoms.  
- **Concerns:** Fears she may need a hysterectomy if the bleeding doesn’t improve.  
- **Expectations:** Wants a clear diagnosis and non-surgical options if possible.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses palpable.  
- **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions, IUD strings present.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged (~10-week size), non-tender. Right adnexal tenderness but no palpable mass.  

**Impression:**  
1. **Adenomyosis** (given heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhoea, and slightly enlarged uterus).  
2. **Possible endometriosis** (given dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (to assess for adenomyosis, fibroids, ovarian pathology).  
   - Hb check (given history of anaemia).  
   - Consider hysteroscopy if ultrasound inconclusive.  
2. **Medical Management:**  
   - Trial of **progestogen-only pill** or **Mirena IUD** (if willing to switch from copper IUD).  
   - NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for pain.  
3. **Surgical Options (if medical management fails):**  
   - Hysteroscopic assessment +/- endometrial ablation.  
   - Discuss laparoscopic evaluation for endometriosis if symptoms persist.  
4. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Smoking cessation counselling (given impact on pelvic pain and bleeding).  
   - Iron-rich diet to support anaemia management.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  
- Advised to seek urgent review if bleeding worsens or new symptoms arise.
