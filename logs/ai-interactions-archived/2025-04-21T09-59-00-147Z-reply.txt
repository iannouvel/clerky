A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 32  
- BMI: 26.5  
- Gravida: 2, Para: 2  
- Last Menstrual Period (LMP): 2 weeks ago (reports prolonged bleeding)  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding, characterized by prolonged menstrual periods lasting up to 10 days with heavy flow (soaking through pads every 2 hours on heavy days). She reports intermittent spotting between cycles. No associated fever, dizziness, or syncope. Denies dyspareunia but notes mild pelvic discomfort.  

**Relevant Past Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (last delivery 3 years ago).  
- No prior gynecologic surgeries.  
- No known bleeding disorders.  
- No history of STIs (last screening 2 years ago, negative).  
- Medications: Occasional ibuprofen for cramps. No hormonal contraception.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks/week).  
- Works as a teacher; moderate stress levels.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General appearance: Well-nourished, no pallor.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Pelvic exam: Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding at time of exam. Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size. Adnexa without masses. *(Note: No speculum exam documented; endometrial sampling not performed.)*  

**Incomplete Aspects of History/Exam:**  
- Family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic cancers not elicited.  
- Thyroid symptoms (fatigue, weight changes) not explored.  
- Sexual history (e.g., new partners, contraceptive needs) not addressed.  
- No documentation of hemoglobin/iron studies despite reported heavy bleeding.  

**Impression:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial polyps, or leiomyoma. Less likely: coagulopathy or malignancy.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Initial Workup:**  
   - CBC, ferritin, TSH, and coagulation studies if indicated.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to assess for structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps).  
   - Consider outpatient endometrial biopsy if ultrasound abnormal or risk factors present *(though not yet discussed with patient)*.  

2. **Symptomatic Relief:**  
   - Trial of NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for heavy bleeding.  
   - If bleeding persists, consider short-course progesterone or combined oral contraceptives *(patient’s preference not yet assessed)*.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks for results and reassessment.  
   - Counsel on iron-rich diet given potential anemia *(no formal anemia screening done yet)*.  

**Patient Counseling:**  
Discussed likely benign causes but emphasized need to rule out serious conditions. Advised to seek urgent care if severe bleeding (e.g., dizziness, soaking >1 pad/hour). Patient agreed to labs and ultrasound but declined same-day biopsy due to anxiety.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await test results.  
- Address contraceptive preferences and sexual health at next visit.
