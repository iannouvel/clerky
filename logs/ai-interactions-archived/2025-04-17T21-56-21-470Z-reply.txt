A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Case for Testing Purposes**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe (fictional)

- **Prior Pregnancies:** 1 (full-term vaginal delivery, no complications)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **irregular heavy menstrual bleeding**, including episodes of prolonged bleeding lasting up to 10 days. She describes occasional **intermenstrual spotting** and **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, initially with slightly heavier periods.  
- Over the past 3 months, bleeding has become unpredictable, with cycles ranging from 21 to 45 days.  
- No recent hormonal contraceptive use.  
- No recent trauma or significant stress.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Hypertension** (well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg OD)  
- **Prediabetes** (diet-controlled)  
- **Obesity (BMI 27.5)**  
- No history of thromboembolism or liver disease.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Appendectomy** (age 22)  
- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- **Gravida 1, Para 1** (spontaneous vaginal delivery at age 31)  
- **Menarche:** Age 12  
- **Last menstrual period:** 2 weeks ago (prolonged bleeding episode)  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  
- No cervical screening abnormalities (last smear 2 years ago, normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Lisinopril 10mg OD  
- No hormonal medications  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic discomfort (no excessive use)  

**Allergy History:**  
- **Penicillin** (rash)  
- No other known allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator (sedentary role)  
- **Smoking:** Never  
- **Alcohol:** Occasional (1-2 units/week)  
- **Exercise:** Minimal due to work demands.  

**Family History:**  
- Mother: **Endometrial cancer (diagnosed age 58)**  
- Father: Type 2 diabetes  
- No known Lynch syndrome or other hereditary cancers.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that her symptoms may be due to "hormonal changes" or "something more serious" given her family history.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about the possibility of cancer due to her mother’s history.  
- **Expectations:** Wants a clear explanation of her symptoms and reassurance or further investigations if needed.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or signs of chronic illness.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly bulky, no adnexal tenderness or masses.  
- **No abnormal vaginal discharge.**  

**Assessment:**  
Given Ms. Doe’s **age (49), BMI (27.5), irregular heavy bleeding, and family history of endometrial cancer**, she meets criteria for **investigation of possible endometrial hyperplasia** (as per **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include:  
- **Unopposed oestrogen exposure** (obesity → peripheral aromatisation of androgens)  
- **Chronic anovulation** (irregular cycles)  
- **Family history of endometrial cancer.**  

**Differential Diagnoses:**  
1. **Endometrial hyperplasia (with/without atypia)**  
2. **Endometrial polyp**  
3. **Early endometrial cancer** (lower likelihood but must exclude)  
4. **Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (perimenopausal)**  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Urgent Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS):** To assess endometrial thickness.  
   - If **≥4mm in a postmenopausal patient** (though she is perimenopausal), further investigation is warranted.  
2. **Endometrial Biopsy (Pipelle or hysteroscopy-guided):** Gold standard for diagnosing hyperplasia/cancer.  
3. **If hyperplasia confirmed:**  
   - **Non-atypical:** Consider **progestogen therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUS or oral progestins).  
   - **Atypical:** Refer to gynaecology oncology for possible hysterectomy (given age and family history).  
4. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Weight loss (even 5-10% reduction can lower risk).  
   - Encourage regular exercise to improve insulin sensitivity.  
5. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review biopsy results within 2 weeks.  
   - Discuss long-term surveillance if hyperplasia confirmed.  

**Patient Reassurance & Counselling:**  
- Explained that while her symptoms are concerning, **most cases of endometrial hyperplasia are treatable**.  
- Emphasised the importance of biopsy for accurate diagnosis.  
- Addressed anxiety regarding cancer risk with a balanced discussion of next steps.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Scheduled for **TVUS and endometrial biopsy** next week.  
- Advised to present to ED if any acute severe bleeding or pain.
