A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 37  
- BMI: 35.4  
- Gravida: 5, Para: 4, Abortions: 1 (spontaneous)  
- Last Menstrual Period (LMP): 2 weeks ago (reports prolonged bleeding)  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), characterized by heavy menstrual flow (soaking through pads every 2 hours) and intermittent spotting between cycles. She reports occasional cramping but denies fever, dizziness, or syncope. She has not recently traveled or had any known bleeding disorders in the family.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril)  
- Type 2 diabetes (poorly controlled, last HbA1c 8.2%)  
- No prior surgeries  
- No known allergies  

**Medications:**  
- Lisinopril 10mg daily  
- Metformin 1000mg BID  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (not regularly)  

**Social History:**  
- Smokes ½ pack per day  
- Rare alcohol use  
- Works as a teacher, reports high stress  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Obese, no pallor or signs of acute distress  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- Pelvic exam (limited): Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding at time of exam  
- No speculum or bimanual exam performed today due to patient discomfort  

**Incomplete Aspects of History/Exam:**  
- No detailed menstrual cycle history (cycle length, regularity prior to changes)  
- No assessment for signs of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor, tachycardia)  
- No transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy performed  
- Sexual history and contraception use not explored  
- Family history of gynecologic cancers not obtained  

**Impression:**  
37-year-old female with obesity, hypertension, and poorly controlled diabetes presenting with AUB (likely secondary to anovulation or structural etiology such as fibroids/polyps, though malignancy not ruled out).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Initial Workup:**  
   - CBC to assess for anemia  
   - TSH to evaluate thyroid dysfunction  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred if tolerated) to assess for structural abnormalities  
   - Consider endometrial biopsy if persistent bleeding or risk factors for hyperplasia  

2. **Symptomatic Management:**  
   - Trial of progestin therapy (e.g., norethindrone) to regulate bleeding  
   - Iron supplementation if anemia present  

3. **Lifestyle & Comorbidity Optimization:**  
   - Strongly encourage smoking cessation  
   - Referral to diabetes educator for glycemic control  
   - Weight loss counseling given BMI 35.4  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks for reassessment and review of imaging/labs  
   - Urgent follow-up if bleeding worsens (e.g., syncope, severe anemia)  

**Note:** This dictation is for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is implied. Further evaluation required for definitive diagnosis.
