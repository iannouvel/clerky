A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Example for Testing Purposes**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  
**Age:** 58  
**Date of Visit:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  
**Chief Complaint:** "My doctor said my platelets are low during this pregnancy."  

### **History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Doe is a 58-year-old G2P1 (prior term delivery, one miscarriage) currently at 32 weeks gestation. She reports being informed of low platelet counts during routine prenatal labs, with her most recent platelet count at 98 x10³/μL (previously 112 x10³/μL at 28 weeks). She denies any bleeding symptoms, including easy bruising, petechiae, gum bleeding, or heavy menstrual bleeding prior to pregnancy. No prior history of thrombocytopenia outside of pregnancy. She has no personal or family history of clotting disorders or autoimmune disease.  

*[Missing Pertinent Information: No inquiry about medications (e.g., heparin, NSAIDs), recent infections, or dietary habits that may affect platelets.]*  

### **Past Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine)  
- No prior surgeries  
- No known drug allergies  

### **Obstetric History:**  
- G2P1 (1 term vaginal delivery 20 years ago, 1 first-trimester miscarriage)  
- No complications in prior pregnancy  

### **Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks/month)  
- Works as a teacher, moderate activity level  

### **Review of Systems:**  
- No headaches, visual changes, or epigastric pain (no symptoms of preeclampsia)  
- No recent fevers or infections  
- No bone pain or fatigue beyond typical pregnancy symptoms  

### **Physical Examination:**  
- **Vitals:** BP 118/74, HR 72, afebrile  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no distress  
- **Skin:** No petechiae or ecchymoses  
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, gravid uterus consistent with dates  
- **Extremities:** No edema  
- **Neurologic:** No focal deficits  

*[Missing Pertinent Exam: No fundoscopic exam for hemorrhages, no lymph node assessment.]*  

### **Assessment:**  
58-year-old primigravida (late pregnancy) with incidentally noted mild thrombocytopenia (98 x10³/μL), likely **gestational thrombocytopenia** given:  
- Asymptomatic presentation  
- No prior history of low platelets  
- Gradual, mild decline in counts  
- Absence of features suggesting ITP (e.g., no bleeding, no prior episodes)  

*[Missing Differential Considerations: No discussion of preeclampsia labs (e.g., LFTs, creatinine), ITP workup (e.g., antiplatelet antibodies), or other causes like nutritional deficiencies.]*  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Monitoring:** Repeat CBC in 2 weeks to assess trend. If platelets drop below 80 x10³/μL, consider hematology referral.  
2. **Preeclampsia Surveillance:** Monitor BP and symptoms at each visit (though no current signs).  
3. **Delivery Planning:** If platelets remain >70 x10³/μL, vaginal delivery is acceptable. If lower, anesthesia consultation for neuraxial contraindications.  
4. **Patient Counseling:** Reassure that gestational thrombocytopenia typically resolves postpartum and does not affect fetal platelets. Advise to report any bleeding/bruising.  

*[Missing Guidance: No advice on avoiding NSAIDs or other antiplatelet agents, no discussion of postpartum follow-up timing.]*  

**Next Visit:** 2 weeks for repeat labs and BP check.
