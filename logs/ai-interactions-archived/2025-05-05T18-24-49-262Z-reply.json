She had an uncomplicated prenatal course with no significant past medical history. During the second stage of labor, she suddenly developed acute respiratory distress, profound hypotension (BP 70&#x2F;40 mmHg), and altered mental status. The fetal heart tracing showed prolonged decelerations. No prior history of clotting disorders or allergies was noted. Missing Pertinent Information: - Family history of thrombophilia or adverse pregnancy outcomes - Recent infections or illnesses - Medications taken during pregnancy (e.g., anticoagulants) - Detailed labor progression prior to the event Examination Findings: - General: Distressed, cyanotic, diaphoretic - Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (HR 130 bpm), weak peripheral pulses - Respiratory: Tachypneic (RR 32), oxygen saturation 82% on room air - Abdomen: Fundal height consistent with dates, no uterine tenderness - Neurologic: Confused, sluggish pupillary response - No documented assessment for DIC (e.g., bleeding from IV sites, petechiae) Missing Pertinent Information: - Full coagulation profile (e.g., PT&#x2F;INR, fibrinogen, platelets) - Detailed fetal assessment post-event - Urine output assessment (sign of renal perfusion) Impression: High suspicion for amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) given acute cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy in a laboring patient. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, or hemorrhage, but clinical presentation strongly favors AFE. Management Plan: 1. Immediate Resuscitation: - Call for multidisciplinary team (OB, anesthesia, critical care). - Secure airway (intubation if needed), high-flow oxygen. - Aggressive IV fluids + vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) for hypotension. - Blood products (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) if DIC suspected (not yet confirmed). 2. Delivery: - Expedited delivery via cesarean section due to maternal instability and non-reassuring fetal status. 3. Monitoring: - Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line if available). - Serial labs (CBC, coagulation panel, ABG). 4. Patient Counseling: - Explained critical nature of AFE to family (fictional surrogate decision-maker). - Discussed high mortality&#x2F;morbidity risk. Missing Pertinent Management Steps: - No mention of echocardiogram to assess right heart strain. - No documentation of consent process for emergency surgery. - No discussion of long-term follow-up (e.g., neurologic outcomes). Next Steps: - Transfer to ICU post-delivery. - Hematology consult for coagulopathy management. - Social work support for family.
