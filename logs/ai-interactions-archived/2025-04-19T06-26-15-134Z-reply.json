She presents today for preconception counseling as she and her partner are considering another pregnancy. She reports good seizure control on lamotrigine, with her last seizure 18 months ago.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Epilepsy: Well-controlled on lamotrigine. No recent seizures.  \n- Previous pregnancies:  \n  - First pregnancy (age 28): Uncomplicated, vaginal delivery at term. No seizures during pregnancy.  \n  - Second pregnancy (age 31): Miscarriage at 10 weeks (no known cause).  \n  - Third pregnancy (age 34): Uncomplicated, vaginal delivery at term.
