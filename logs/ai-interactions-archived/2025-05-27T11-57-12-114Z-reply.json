She reports passing clots and requiring frequent pad changes (every 1–2 hours on heavy days). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports associated fatigue.  \n\n### **History of Present Illness:**  \n- **Onset:** Symptoms began approximately 4 months ago without clear precipitating factors.  \n- **Frequency:** Cycles occur every 3 weeks (previously regular at 28 days).  \n- **Duration:** Bleeding episodes last 10–14 days.  \n- **Associated Symptoms:** Fatigue, mild dizziness, no syncope. Denies fever, pelvic pain, or dyspareunia.  \n- **Impact on Daily Life:** Reports missing work due to heavy bleeding.  \n- **Previous Treatments:** None attempted.  \n- **Relevant History:**  \n  - **Obstetric:** G3P3, last delivery 10 years ago via C-section.  \n  - **Gynecologic:** No prior abnormal Pap smears. No history of fibroids or endometriosis.  \n  - **Medical:** Hypertension (on lisinopril), no history of bleeding disorders.  \n  - **Surgical:** Appendectomy age 20.  \n  - **Family History:** Mother with uterine fibroids. No known bleeding disorders.  \n  - **Social:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  \n\n*(Note: Clinician did not inquire about recent weight changes, stress levels, or medication changes that could affect bleeding.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 130/82, HR 88, Temp 98.4°F, BMI 29.  \n- **General:** Mild pallor, no signs of acute distress.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic (external):** Normal external genitalia, no lesions.  \n- **Speculum Exam:** Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding at time of exam.  \n- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender, no adnexal masses noted.  \n\n*(Note: No endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound performed at this visit. Thyroid exam not documented.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \n- **Primary Concern:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely secondary to hormonal imbalance or structural cause such as fibroids or adenomyosis).  \n- **Differential Diagnosis:**  \n  1. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory cycles).  \n  2. Uterine fibroids.  \n  3. Endometrial hyperplasia/polyp.  \n  4. Coagulopathy (less likely given no personal/family history).  \n- **Contributing Factors:** Age (perimenopausal), obesity (BMI 29), hypertension.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Initial Workup:**  \n   - CBC (to assess for anemia).  \n   - TSH (to rule out thyroid dysfunction).  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound (to evaluate for structural abnormalities).  \n   - Consider endometrial biopsy if ultrasound is inconclusive or high-risk features present.  \n\n2. **Symptomatic Management:**  \n   - Start tranexamic acid 1g TID during heavy bleeding days.  \n   - Trial of combined oral contraceptive pill (after BP recheck) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  \n   - Iron supplementation if anemia confirmed.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Return in 4 weeks for review of lab/imaging results.  \n   - Discuss surgical options (e.g., hysterectomy, endometrial ablation) if medical management fails.  \n\n4. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and seek urgent care if signs of severe anemia (e.g., worsening fatigue, shortness of breath).  \n   - Discussed possibility of perimenopausal transition but emphasized need to rule out other causes.  \n\n*(Note: Did not address potential need for DVT prophylaxis with hormonal therapy or explore patient’s reproductive goals.)*  \n\n**Impression:** Abnormal uterine bleeding likely multifactorial; initial conservative management with plan for further investigation.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith  \n**Date:** October 10, 2023  \n\n---  \n*This dictation is entirely fictional for testing purposes only.
