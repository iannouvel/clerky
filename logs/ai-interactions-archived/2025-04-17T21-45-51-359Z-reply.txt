A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Endometrial Hyperplasia (Based on GTG 2014 Guidelines)**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Fictional Name]  
- Age: 56 years  
- Weight: 82 kg  
- BMI: 29.9 (overweight)  
- Parity: G2P2 (2 prior pregnancies)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient reports a 6-month history of irregular postmenopausal bleeding, described as intermittent light-to-moderate vaginal bleeding occurring approximately every 2–3 weeks. She denies associated pain but reports occasional bloating.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Bleeding began spontaneously after 4 years of amenorrhea post-menopause.  
- No recent hormonal therapy or new medications.  
- No history of trauma or recent sexual activity precipitating bleeding.  
- No weight loss, fever, or systemic symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril).  
- Type 2 diabetes (diet-controlled, HbA1c 6.5% last checked).  
- No history of thrombosis or bleeding disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 24).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, regular cycles until menopause at age 52.  
- No history of abnormal cervical screening (last Pap smear 2 years ago, normal).  
- No prior diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia or polyps.  

**Drug History:**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  
- Metformin 500 mg BD (recently discontinued due to GI intolerance).  
- No HRT or anticoagulants.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Works as a school administrator (sedentary role).  
- Lives with spouse, moderately active (walks 3x/week).  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Concerned about cancer due to family history (mother had breast cancer).  
- Wants to "rule out anything serious" and explore treatment options.  
- Prefers non-surgical management if possible.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Well-appearing, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Pelvic Exam:  
  - External genitalia normal.  
  - Speculum: Small amount of old blood in vault; cervix appears normal.  
  - Bimanual: Uterus normal size, mobile, non-tender; adnexae clear.  

**Investigations:**  
- Transvaginal ultrasound (arranged): To assess endometrial thickness.  
- Endometrial biopsy (planned if thickness ≥4 mm per GTG 2014).  
- Hb/HCT (to exclude anemia).  

**Management Plan (Per GTG 2014 Guidelines for Endometrial Hyperplasia):**  
1. **Risk Stratification:**  
   - Postmenopausal bleeding + BMI 29.9 → increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia/cancer.  
   - Diabetes further elevates risk (explained to patient).  

2. **Next Steps:**  
   - Await ultrasound results; if endometrial thickness ≥4 mm, proceed to Pipelle biopsy.  
   - If biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia:  
     - First-line: Progesterone therapy (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral progestins).  
     - Lifestyle advice: Weight loss to reduce estrogen excess (BMI target <25).  
   - If atypia present: Refer to gynecology oncology for hysterectomy discussion.  

3. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Reassured that most cases are benign but emphasized importance of biopsy.  
   - Advised on bleeding red flags (e.g., heavy/prolonged bleeding, pain).  
   - Scheduled follow-up in 2 weeks for results and further planning.  

**Impression:**  
Postmenopausal bleeding likely secondary to endometrial hyperplasia (await histology). High suspicion due to obesity and diabetes. Patient engaged and agreeable to investigations.
