Abdominal: - Soft, non-tender gravid uterus palpable at symphysis-fundal height of 14 weeks (larger than dates). - No palpable masses or organomegaly. Speculum&#x2F;Bimanual (consent obtained): - Cervix appears closed, no active bleeding at time of exam. - Uterus enlarged, non-tender; no adnexal masses. Bedside Ultrasound (if available): - Single intrauterine pregnancy, fetal heartbeat detected. - Placenta appears low-lying (potential placenta praevia? Requires formal scan). ---### Management Plan 1. Investigations: - Urgent formal obstetric ultrasound (confirm viability, placental location). - FBC (assess for anemia), HbA1c (diabetes control), coagulation screen. - Group &amp; Save (given bleeding history). 2. Immediate Advice: - Pelvic rest (no intercourse&#x2F;tampons). - Emergency contact instructions if bleeding worsens. 3. Long-Term: - Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic (maternal BMI, diabetes, hypertension). - Dietitian review for weight&#x2F;diabetes optimization. - Smoking cessation support. 4. Patient Education: - Counseled on risks of obesity in pregnancy (gestational diabetes exacerbation, macrosomia). - Discussed importance of antenatal attendance.

- Social: Smokes 10 cigarettes/day, limited support.  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Irregular heavy vaginal bleeding**: Associated with clots and pelvic pain; cervix closed on exam, but placenta praevia suspected (bedside ultrasound showed low-lying placenta).  
- Advised pelvic rest and emergency contact if bleeding worsens.  
- **Anemia risk**: Pale conjunctiva noted; FBC and iron supplementation advised.  
- **High-risk pregnancy**: Due to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and potential placenta praevia.  
- Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic and dietitian for optimization.  
- **Smoking cessation**: Counseled on risks and offered support.  

### Plan:  
1. Urgent formal obstetric ultrasound to confirm viability and placental location.  
2. Investigations: FBC, HbA1c, coagulation screen, Group & Save.  
3. Pelvic rest (no intercourse/tampons) and emergency instructions if bleeding increases.  
4. Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic and dietitian.  
5. Smoking cessation support.  
6. Patient counseling on risks of obesity in pregnancy and importance of antenatal care.  
7. Follow-up: Ultrasound results within 48 hours; high-risk clinic in 1 week.
