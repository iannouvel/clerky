A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. A. Smith, OB/GYN  
**Patient:** Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  
**Age:** 43  
**Weight:** 87 kg | **BMI:** 32 (Obese Class I)  
**Gravida:** 3 | **Para:** 2 (Previous deliveries: 1 SVD, 1 C-section) | **Abortions:** 0  

---

### **History of Presenting Complaint**  
Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns:  
1. **Recurrent Pelvic Pain:** Intermittent left-sided pelvic pain for 6 months, worsening during menstruation and intercourse. Describes it as "sharp and crampy," rated 7/10. No relief with OTC NSAIDs.  
2. **Postmenopausal Bleeding:** Despite prior regular cycles, now reports 3 episodes of vaginal bleeding over 2 months (last menstrual period 14 months ago). Bleeding is light but associated with clots.  

### **Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History**  
- **Medical:** Hypertension (on lisinopril), Type 2 DM (metformin), depression (citalopram).  
- **Surgical:** C-section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018).  
- **Gynaecological:** History of ovarian cyst (resolved, 2019), HPV-positive (no dysplasia on last Pap smear 2 years ago).  

### **Drug History & Allergies**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD, metformin 1 g BD, citalopram 20 mg OD.  
- Allergies: Penicillin (rash).  

### **Social History**  
- Works as a schoolteacher. Married, monogamous.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-years), occasional alcohol.  
- Exercise: Sedentary.  

### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about "fibroids or cancer" due to bleeding.  
- **Concerns:** Pain affecting intimacy; fears surgical intervention.  
- **Expectations:** Wants "answers quickly" and non-hormonal options if possible.  

---

### **Examination Findings**  
- **General:** Obese, BP 138/86, no pallor/jaundice.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa. No masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Atrophic vaginal mucosa; small clot in vault. Cervix appears nulliparous.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus enlarged (~10-week size), fixed, tender left adnexa. No cervical motion tenderness.  

---

### **Differential Diagnoses**  
1. **Postmenopausal Bleeding:** Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma vs. atrophy.  
2. **Pelvic Pain:** Adenomyosis vs. ovarian pathology (e.g., endometrioma).  

### **Investigations Planned**  
1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Assess endometrial thickness, adnexae.  
2. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Rule out malignancy.  
3. **CA-125:** If ovarian pathology suspected.  

### **Management Advice**  
1. **Immediate:**  
   - Expedite ultrasound/biopsy. Advise cessation of smoking (counselling offered).  
   - Analgesia: Trial of mefenamic acid for pain.  
2. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Discuss results within 2 weeks. If biopsy abnormal, refer to gynae-oncology.  
   - If benign, consider Mirena IUS (if acceptable) for bleeding/pain.  
3. **Patient Education:**  
   - Red flags (e.g., heavy bleeding, syncope).  
   - Weight loss benefits (reduced endometrial cancer risk).  

**Plan:** Review with results +/− MDT input.
