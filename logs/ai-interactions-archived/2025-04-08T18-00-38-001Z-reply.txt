A: **Summary:**  
- 14-year-old female  
- Presenting complaint: Dysmenorrhea (painful periods)  
- Menstrual cycle: 5-6/28-30 days  
- Pain severity: 5-6/10, maximal on day 1, lasts 3 days  
- Pain relief: Improved with heat (water bottle) and TENS machine  
- Menarche: 12 years old  
- Pregnancy history: Nulligravida  
- No intermenstrual bleeding  
- Not sexually active  
- PMH: Fit and well  
- PSH: Finger surgery post partial amputation  
- Allergies: NKDA  
- Drug history: NSAIDs and paracetamol PRN for dysmenorrhea  

**Details:**  
- The patient reports primary dysmenorrhea with cyclical pain peaking on day 1 of menses, rated 5-6/10 in severity.  
- Symptoms are alleviated with conservative measures (heat therapy, TENS) and over-the-counter analgesics (NSAIDs, paracetamol).  
- No red flags (e.g., intermenstrual bleeding, dyspareunia) are present.  
- Menstrual history is unremarkable (menarche at 12, regular cycles).  
- No sexual activity or risk of pregnancy.  
- Past medical and surgical histories are non-contributory.  

**Plan:**  
1. Reassure patient regarding benign nature of primary dysmenorrhea.  
2. Continue current analgesia regimen (NSAIDs, paracetamol PRN).  
3. Encourage ongoing use of non-pharmacological measures (heat, TENS).  
4. Advise to monitor for red flags (e.g., worsening pain, irregular bleeding).  
5. Consider hormonal therapy (e.g., COCP) if symptoms persist or worsen despite current management.
