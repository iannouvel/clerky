A: **Clinical Dictation: Fictional Patient Encounter – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  
**Age:** 42  
**Date of Visit:** October 10, 2023  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  
**Setting:** Outpatient Gynecology Clinic  

### **History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Doe is a 42-year-old female presenting with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She reports irregular menstrual cycles with episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, requiring frequent pad changes (every 1–2 hours on heavy days). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but notes occasional clotting. She has associated mild pelvic discomfort but no severe pain, dyspareunia, or postcoital bleeding.  

She has no history of bleeding disorders, prior gynecologic surgeries, or hormonal contraceptive use. She has two prior uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with one partner and uses condoms inconsistently. She has no known drug allergies.  

*[Missing Pertinent Questions: Family history of gynecologic cancers, recent weight changes, thyroid symptoms, medication review (e.g., anticoagulants), and screening for anemia symptoms (fatigue, dizziness).]*  

### **Past Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Hypertension, well-controlled on lisinopril  
- No prior surgeries  
- No known history of fibroids, polyps, or endometriosis  

### **Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use  
- Works as a teacher, moderately active  

### **Review of Systems:**  
- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss  
- **Cardiovascular:** No palpitations or syncope  
- **Gastrointestinal:** No nausea/vomiting, normal bowel habits  
- **Genitourinary:** No dysuria or urinary frequency  

### **Physical Examination:**  
- **Vitals:** BP 128/78, HR 78, BMI 28  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses  
- **Pelvic:** External genitalia normal; speculum exam reveals minimal blood in vaginal vault; cervix appears normal. Bimanual exam: uterus slightly enlarged, no adnexal tenderness or masses.  

*[Missing Pertinent Exam Findings: No documentation of cervical motion tenderness, uterine mobility, or assessment for structural abnormalities like fibroids via imaging.]*  

### **Assessment:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a perimenopausal patient, likely secondary to anovulatory cycles or structural causes (e.g., fibroids). Differential includes endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, or hormonal imbalance.  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Diagnostics:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for fibroids, polyps, or endometrial thickening.  
   - CBC to assess for anemia (despite no documented symptoms).  
   - Consider endometrial biopsy if ultrasound is inconclusive or high-risk features present (not yet discussed with patient).  

2. **Management:**  
   - Trial of oral progestin therapy (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate) for 10 days to regulate bleeding.  
   - Iron supplementation if anemia is confirmed.  
   - Follow-up in 4 weeks to review results and adjust plan.  

3. **Counseling:**  
   - Advised patient to track bleeding patterns.  
   - Discussed red flags (e.g., syncope, severe fatigue) prompting urgent reevaluation.  
   - No discussion of long-term options (e.g., hormonal IUD, surgical interventions) at this time.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await ultrasound and lab results.  
- Reassess need for further workup (e.g., biopsy) based on findings.
