A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  
*Date: [Fictional Date] | Clinician: Dr. [Fictional Name] | Patient: Ms. [Fictional Name]*  

**Subjective:**  
Ms. X, a 41-year-old female (BMI 25.2, G2P2), presents with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She reports intermittent heavy menstrual bleeding (changing pads every 2 hours on heavy days) and intermenstrual spotting. Bleeding is occasionally associated with mild pelvic cramping but no fever, dizziness, or syncope. She denies dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding. Her last Pap smear was 2 years ago (reported as normal). She has no personal or family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies.  

*Incomplete history:*  
- No documentation of contraceptive use (e.g., hormonal IUD, pills).  
- Menstrual cycle regularity prior to symptoms not explored.  
- Thyroid symptoms (fatigue, weight changes) not asked.  
- Medications (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants) not reviewed.  

**Objective:**  
- Vitals: BP 118/76, HR 78, afebrile.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Pelvic exam (limited): Cervix appears normal; no active bleeding at time of exam. Uterus midline, non-tender. Adnexa not palpated due to patient discomfort.  
*Incomplete exam:*  
- No speculum exam performed to visualize cervical os.  
- Uterine size not assessed (e.g., fibroids).  
- No labs drawn (e.g., CBC, TSH, pregnancy test).  

**Assessment:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a perimenopausal patient. Differential includes:  
1. Hormonal imbalance (anovulatory cycles).  
2. Structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps – not ruled out).  
3. Endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia – risk factors like obesity not fully explored).  

**Plan:**  
1. *Diagnostics:*  
   - Order CBC, TSH, and serum hCG to rule out anemia, thyroid dysfunction, pregnancy.  
   - Schedule pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for structural abnormalities.  
   - Endometrial biopsy deferred pending ultrasound results (incomplete risk stratification).  
2. *Symptomatic management:*  
   - Trial of tranexamic acid for heavy bleeding (no contraindications reviewed).  
   - Consider progesterone therapy if bleeding persists (not discussed in detail).  
3. *Follow-up:*  
   - Return in 4 weeks for results and reassessment. Counseled to seek care sooner if bleeding worsens (e.g., syncope, severe anemia).  

*Omissions:*  
- No discussion of lifestyle impact (e.g., work limitations).  
- Contraceptive needs/preferences not addressed.  
- Family planning goals not explored.  

**Impression:**  
Initial evaluation incomplete but initiated workup for AUB. Patient advised to monitor symptoms.

**Note for Testing:** This fictional scenario includes intentional gaps in history/exam and management decisions for educational purposes only. No real clinical guidance is implied.
