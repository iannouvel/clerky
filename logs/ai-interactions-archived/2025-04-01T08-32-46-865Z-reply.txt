A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
Name: [Fictional Name – e.g., "Ms. X"]  
Age: 18 years  
Weight: 55 kg  
BMI: 20  
Number of prior pregnancies: 3 (G3P2A1 – 2 live births, 1 miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 2-week history of irregular vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant (by last menstrual period) and is concerned about recurrent miscarriage.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- The patient reports intermittent dark-brown vaginal bleeding, occasionally mixed with fresh red blood, for the past 2 weeks.  
- She describes cramping lower abdominal pain, worse on the left side, but no fever or foul-smelling discharge.  
- No history of trauma or recent intercourse preceding symptoms.  
- She has had 3 prior pregnancies:  
  - First pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery at age 16 (no complications).  
  - Second pregnancy: Miscarriage at 8 weeks (spontaneous, no intervention).  
  - Third pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery 6 months ago (no complications).  
- She has not used contraception since her last delivery.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- No known chronic medical conditions.  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  
- No previous hospital admissions (other than deliveries).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- No prior surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12.  
- Regular cycles (28-day cycle, 5-day duration) prior to current pregnancy.  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 1 year ago).  
- No abnormal cervical screening history.  

**Drug History:**  
- No regular medications.  
- Takes over-the-counter paracetamol occasionally for headaches.  
- No current use of folic acid or prenatal vitamins.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Works part-time in retail.  
- Lives with her partner and 2 children.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  
- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  
- Denies recreational drug use.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- She is worried this may be another miscarriage and fears complications due to her rapid repeat pregnancies.  
- She wants to know if the pregnancy is viable and if she needs any treatment.  
- She is also concerned about the impact of smoking on her pregnancy.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General appearance: Well, no pallor or distress.  
- Abdomen: Soft, mild suprapubic tenderness, no guarding/rigidity.  
- Speculum exam: Small amount of dark blood in vaginal vault, closed cervical os.  
- Bimanual exam: Uterus slightly enlarged (consistent with 10 weeks), mild left adnexal tenderness, no palpable masses.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Threatened miscarriage** – Given history of bleeding and pain but closed os, pregnancy may still be viable.  
2. **Possible subchorionic haemorrhage** – Could explain intermittent bleeding.  
3. **Risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome** – Rapid repeat pregnancy, smoking, lack of prenatal vitamins.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Urgent ultrasound** – To confirm viability, rule out ectopic pregnancy, and assess for subchorionic haemorrhage.  
2. **Serial beta-hCG monitoring** – If ultrasound is inconclusive.  
3. **Advice:**  
   - Pelvic rest (avoid intercourse/tampons).  
   - Start folic acid and prenatal vitamins.  
   - Smoking cessation support (referral to cessation program).  
   - Close follow-up in early pregnancy clinic.  
4. **Emotional support** – Counselling regarding recurrent pregnancy loss risks and contraception options post-recovery.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review ultrasound results within 48 hours.  
- Return if bleeding worsens or severe pain develops.
