A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Case for Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 30 years  
- **Weight:** 102 kg  
- **Height:** 1.65 m  
- **BMI:** 37.4 (Class II Obesity)  
- **Number of Prior Pregnancies:** 4 (G4P3A1 – 3 live births, 1 miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding**, including episodes of intermenstrual spotting. She reports passing **large clots** and describes the bleeding as significantly heavier than her usual pattern. She also complains of **pelvic pressure discomfort** but denies dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, initially intermittent but now occurring almost continuously.  
- No associated fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  
- She has tried over-the-counter pain relief (ibuprofen) with minimal improvement.  
- No recent contraceptive use (last hormonal contraception discontinued 2 years ago).  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Obesity (BMI 37.4)**  
- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** – diagnosed age 22  
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** – diagnosed age 28, managed with metformin  
- **Hypertension** – on lisinopril  
- **Previous miscarriage** (spontaneous at 10 weeks, 5 years ago)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Cesarean section x2** (last 4 years ago)  
- **Dilation & Curettage (D&C)** post-miscarriage  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, cycles previously irregular (PCOS-related) but now heavier and unpredictable.  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  
- Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1000 mg BD  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD  
- Ibuprofen PRN (for menstrual pain)  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a receptionist (sedentary role).  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  
- Alcohol: 4-5 units/week.  
- Lives with partner and 3 children.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that her symptoms may be due to "hormonal imbalance" or "something more serious like cancer."  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about the impact of prolonged bleeding on her daily life and fertility.  
- **Expectations:** Hopes for a clear diagnosis and effective treatment to regulate bleeding.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of endocrine abnormality.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - Speculum – **bulky uterus**, no visible cervical lesions.  
  - Bimanual – **uterus slightly enlarged**, no adnexal tenderness/masses.  
- **No evidence of active infection or cervical motion tenderness.**  

**Assessment:**  
Given her **obesity, PCOS, and persistent abnormal uterine bleeding**, **endometrial hyperplasia** is a significant concern (aligned with **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include:  
- Chronic anovulation (PCOS)  
- Obesity (unopposed estrogen effect)  
- Hypertension  
- Nulliparity (despite 4 pregnancies, she has not carried to term without intervention)  

**Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS):** Assess endometrial thickness (if >4mm in postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal in premenopausal, biopsy indicated).  
   - **Endometrial Biopsy:** To exclude hyperplasia/neoplasia.  
   - **Hb/HCT:** Check for anemia secondary to heavy bleeding.  
   - **HbA1c & BP Review:** Optimize diabetic/hypertensive control.  

2. **Management (if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia – GTG 2014):**  
   - **First-line:** **Progesterone therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUD or cyclical oral progestins).  
   - **Weight loss support:** Referral to dietetics, encourage lifestyle changes (weight loss reduces estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation).  
   - **Smoking cessation:** Advised due to cardiovascular risks.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Repeat biopsy in 3-6 months to assess treatment response.  
   - If hyperplasia with atypia detected, discuss surgical options (hysterectomy preferred if family complete).  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that while endometrial hyperplasia is a concern, early intervention reduces cancer risk.  
- Advised on importance of adherence to hormonal therapy and weight management.  
- Emergency plan provided if bleeding worsens (e.g., saturating a pad hourly).  

**Next Steps:**  
- Schedule TVUS and biopsy.  
- Review in clinic with results.
