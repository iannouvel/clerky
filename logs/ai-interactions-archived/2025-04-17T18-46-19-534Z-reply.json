She describes passing occasional small clots and notes that her periods now last 8–10 days, compared to her usual 5–6 days. She denies dysmenorrhea but reports mild pelvic discomfort.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began gradually 4 months ago with no clear precipitant.  \n- No recent weight changes, stress, or new medications.  \n- No post-coital bleeding or dyspareunia.  \n- No urinary or bowel symptoms.  \n- She has not yet sought treatment for this issue.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed aged 25 (managed with lifestyle advice).  \n- Gestational diabetes (second pregnancy, resolved postpartum).  \n- No history of hypertension, diabetes, or thyroid disorders.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 12).  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche aged 13.  \n- Regular cycles prior to this episode (28–30 days).  \n- Last menstrual period: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting).  \n- Sexual history: Married, monogamous, uses barrier contraception.  \n- Cervical screening: Up to date (last smear 1 year ago, normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Paracetamol PRN for headaches.  \n- No hormonal contraception or HRT.  \n- No regular medications.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Alcohol: 4–6 units/week.  \n- Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary role).  \n- Lives with husband and two children.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Concerned about possible \"hormonal imbalance\" or \"early menopause.\"  \n- Worried about the impact of prolonged bleeding on daily life.  \n- Hoping for reassurance and a clear management plan.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well, no pallor.  \n- Abdominal exam: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions. Minimal old blood in vault.  \n- Bimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness/masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven the history of irregular heavy bleeding, PCOS, and BMI 26.2, the most likely diagnosis is **endometrial hyperplasia** (in line with **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include:  \n- Unopposed oestrogen exposure (PCOS, anovulatory cycles).  \n- Obesity (BMI >25).  \n- Prolonged menstrual irregularities.  \n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**  \n1. Endometrial hyperplasia (likely).  \n2. Endometrial polyp.  \n3. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness.  \n   - Endometrial biopsy (pipelle) if endometrial thickness >4mm (given persistent symptoms).  \n   - FBC to exclude anaemia.  \n\n2. **Lifestyle Advice:**  \n   - Weight management (BMI reduction to <25 may improve symptoms).  \n   - Regular exercise to reduce insulin resistance (relevant to PCOS).  \n\n3. **Medical Management (if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia):**  \n   - First-line: Progestogen therapy (e.g., cyclical oral medroxyprogesterone acetate per GTG 2014).  \n   - Review in 3 months for symptom response and repeat biopsy if indicated.  \n\n4. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Urgent referral to gynaecology if atypia detected.  \n   - Counselling on long-term risks (e.g., endometrial cancer) and importance of adherence to treatment.  \n\n**Patient Counselling:**  \n- Reassured that endometrial hyperplasia is treatable, especially without atypia.  \n- Advised to seek urgent review if symptoms worsen (e.g., flooding, dizziness).  \n- Encouraged to discuss fertility plans if considering future pregnancy.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await TVUS and biopsy results.  \n- Schedule follow-up in 1 week.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Fictional Clinician]  \n**Date:** [Fictional Date]  \n\n---  \n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
