A: **Dictation: Fictional Clinical Interaction â€“ Obstetrics Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 30  
- BMI: 36.3  
- Gravida: 2, Para: 1 (1 prior pregnancy, vaginal delivery)  
- Gestational Age: 39 weeks + 2 days  
- Chief Complaint: Acute onset of severe dyspnea and hypotension during labor  

**History of Presenting Illness:**  
Ms. Doe is a 30-year-old G2P1 at 39+2 weeks gestation who presented in active labor. She had an uncomplicated prenatal course with no significant past medical history. During the second stage of labor, she suddenly developed acute respiratory distress, profound hypotension (BP 70/40 mmHg), and altered mental status. The fetal heart tracing showed prolonged decelerations. No prior history of clotting disorders or allergies was noted.  

*Missing Pertinent Information:*  
- Family history of thrombophilia or adverse pregnancy outcomes  
- Recent infections or illnesses  
- Medications taken during pregnancy (e.g., anticoagulants)  
- Detailed labor progression prior to the event  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Distressed, cyanotic, diaphoretic  
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (HR 130 bpm), weak peripheral pulses  
- Respiratory: Tachypneic (RR 32), oxygen saturation 82% on room air  
- Abdomen: Fundal height consistent with dates, no uterine tenderness  
- Neurologic: Confused, sluggish pupillary response  
- No documented assessment for DIC (e.g., bleeding from IV sites, petechiae)  

*Missing Pertinent Information:*  
- Full coagulation profile (e.g., PT/INR, fibrinogen, platelets)  
- Detailed fetal assessment post-event  
- Urine output assessment (sign of renal perfusion)  

**Impression:**  
High suspicion for **amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)** given acute cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy in a laboring patient. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, or hemorrhage, but clinical presentation strongly favors AFE.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Immediate Resuscitation:**  
   - Call for multidisciplinary team (OB, anesthesia, critical care).  
   - Secure airway (intubation if needed), high-flow oxygen.  
   - Aggressive IV fluids + vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) for hypotension.  
   - Blood products (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) if DIC suspected (not yet confirmed).  

2. **Delivery:**  
   - Expedited delivery via cesarean section due to maternal instability and non-reassuring fetal status.  

3. **Monitoring:**  
   - Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line if available).  
   - Serial labs (CBC, coagulation panel, ABG).  

4. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Explained critical nature of AFE to family (fictional surrogate decision-maker).  
   - Discussed high mortality/morbidity risk.  

*Missing Pertinent Management Steps:*  
- No mention of echocardiogram to assess right heart strain.  
- No documentation of consent process for emergency surgery.  
- No discussion of long-term follow-up (e.g., neurologic outcomes).  

**Next Steps:**  
- Transfer to ICU post-delivery.  
- Hematology consult for coagulopathy management.  
- Social work support for family.
