She reports recent episodes of postprandial hyperglycemia (self-monitored readings between 180–220 mg&#x2F;dL) despite adherence to her current regimen. She denies symptoms of hypoglycemia but describes occasional fatigue and blurred vision. No recent infections or hospitalizations. *[Incomplete: Duration of current symptoms? Any changes in diet&#x2F;exercise? Any new stressors?]* ### Past Medical History - Preexisting T2DM (12 years) – last HbA1c 8.2% (3 months ago) - Hypertension (10 years) – on lisinopril - Hyperlipidemia – on atorvastatin - Gestational diabetes during all four pregnancies (last pregnancy 20 years ago) - Obesity (BMI 36.4) *[Incomplete: Any prior diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy)? Any prior DKA&#x2F;HHS?]* ### Surgical History - Cesarean section x2 (for macrosomia in prior pregnancies) - Cholecystectomy (8 years ago) *[Incomplete: Any other surgeries?]* ### Gynecological History - Menopause at age 51 - No abnormal Pap smears - No history of PCOS ### Drug History - Metformin 1000 mg BID - Lisinopril 20 mg daily - Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly - Aspirin 81 mg daily (primary prevention) *[Incomplete: Any OTC&#x2F;supplements? Adherence concerns?]* ### Allergy History - NKDA ### Social History - Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary) - Alcohol: Occasional glass of wine (1–2&#x2F;week) - Tobacco: Never - Diet: Carbohydrate-heavy, admits difficulty with portion control - Exercise: Minimal (walks 1–2x&#x2F;week) *[Incomplete: Any family support? Stressors? Sleep habits?]* ### Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations - Ideas: Believes her diabetes is &quot;getting worse&quot; due to aging. - Concerns: Worried about needing insulin. - Expectations: Hopes to avoid injections and &quot;get back on track&quot; with oral meds. ### Examination Findings - Vitals: BP 138&#x2F;86, HR 78, RR 16, SpO2 98% RA - General: Obese, no acute distress - CV: Regular rate, no murmurs - Resp: Clear to auscultation - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, obese habitus - Extremities: No edema, intact peripheral pulses - Neurological: Intact sensation to monofilament (limited assessment) *[Incomplete: Fundoscopy findings? Foot exam for ulcers? Full neuropathy screen?]* ### Assessment &amp; Management Plan 1. Glycemic Control: - Current regimen insufficient. Consider: - SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., empagliflozin) – benefits for weight&#x2F;CV risk but caution if eGFR &lt;45. - GLP-1 RA (e.g., semaglutide) – weight loss benefits, but assess cost&#x2F;tolerance. - Basal insulin (if oral agents fail) – address patient’s concerns with education. - Labs: Repeat HbA1c, renal function, fasting lipid panel. 2. Lifestyle Modifications: - Referral to diabetes educator + dietitian for carb counting. - Encourage structured exercise (150 min&#x2F;week). 3. Monitoring: - Continue home glucose logs (fasting + 2-hr postprandial). - Annual diabetic eye&#x2F;foot exams pending. 4. Follow-Up: - Re-evaluate in 4 weeks for medication adjustment. *[Incomplete: Further counseling on weight loss options?

A: ### Summary:  
- **Age**: 54 years  
- **BMI**: 36.4 (obesity)  
- **Prior pregnancies**: G4P4, gestational diabetes in all  
- **Presenting complaint**: Poorly controlled T2DM (HbA1c 8.2%), postprandial hyperglycemia (180–220 mg/dL), fatigue, blurred vision  
- **Current medications**: Metformin 1000 mg BID, lisinopril 20 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, aspirin 81 mg daily  
- **Social history**: Sedentary occupation, minimal exercise, carbohydrate-heavy diet  

### Detailed Assessment:  
- **Glycemic control**: Persistent postprandial hyperglycemia despite metformin adherence.  
No hypoglycemia but reports fatigue and blurred vision.  
Last HbA1c 8.2% (3 months ago), indicating suboptimal control.  
- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity.  
No documented diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy).  
- **Lifestyle factors**: Sedentary, minimal exercise, carbohydrate-heavy diet with portion control challenges.  
- **Patient concerns**: Fear of insulin therapy, desire to optimize oral medications.  

### Plan:  
1. **Glycemic control intensification**:  
   - Consider SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., empagliflozin) or GLP-1 RA (e.g., semaglutide) for added glycemic control and weight benefits.  
   - If oral agents fail, discuss basal insulin with patient education.  
2. **Labs**: Repeat HbA1c, renal function, fasting lipid panel.  
3. **Lifestyle modifications**:  
   - Referral to diabetes educator and dietitian for carbohydrate management.  
   - Encourage structured exercise (150 min/week).  
4. **Monitoring**:  
   - Continue home glucose logs (fasting + postprandial).  
   - Schedule annual diabetic eye and foot exams.  
5. **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate in 4 weeks for medication adjustment and adherence assessment.
