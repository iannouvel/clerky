### Key Adjustments Based on Guidelines:  
1. The note originally suggested considering cerclage if cervical insufficiency is confirmed, but the guideline emphasizes that cervical length assessment should come first. The adjusted text now specifies the need for cervical length surveillance starting at 16 weeks in future pregnancies before considering cerclage.  
2. The plan section was updated to reflect that cerclage should not be considered without prior cervical length assessment, in line with the guideline's recommendation against routine cerclage without this evaluation.  

Both adjustments reference the **BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage** guideline to maintain clarity about the evidence-based recommendations driving these changes.
