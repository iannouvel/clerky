A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  
**Age:** 32 years  
**Sex:** Female  
**Weight:** 68 kg  
**Date of Visit:** October 10, 2023  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  

### **Subjective:**  
Ms. Doe presents today reporting a 2-week history of abnormal vaginal discharge. She describes the discharge as thin, grayish-white, and with a noticeable "fishy" odor, particularly after intercourse. She denies any associated itching, burning, or dysuria. She has had no recent fever, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.  

**Sexual History:** Sexually active with one male partner in the last 6 months. Uses condoms inconsistently. No history of STIs. Last Pap smear was 2 years ago, reportedly normal.  

**Past Medical History:** No significant medical conditions. No prior episodes of vaginitis.  

**Medications:** Oral contraceptive pill (no recent changes). No recent antibiotic use.  

**Allergies:** NKDA  

**Social History:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol. Works as a teacher.  

*(Missing Pertinent Questions: No inquiry about recent douching, new soaps/body washes, or partner symptoms. No detailed menstrual history.)*  

### **Objective:**  
**Vital Signs:** BP 118/72, HR 72, Temp 36.8°C, RR 14.  

**Genitourinary Exam:**  
- External genitalia: No erythema, lesions, or swelling.  
- Vaginal discharge: Thin, homogenous, grayish-white, adherent to vaginal walls. Mild "fishy" odor noted on speculum exam.  
- Cervix: No erythema, no friability. No cervical motion tenderness on bimanual exam.  
- No vulvar or vaginal erythema or excoriations.  

*(Missing Pertinent Findings: No pH testing or whiff test performed. No microscopy or wet prep ordered.)*  

### **Assessment:**  
**Working Diagnosis:** Bacterial vaginosis (based on clinical presentation—Amsel criteria not fully assessed).  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Empiric Treatment:** Given the characteristic discharge and odor, will treat empirically for bacterial vaginosis.  
   - **Metronidazole 500 mg PO BID x 7 days** (alternative: vaginal clindamycin cream if preferred).  
2. **Counseling:**  
   - Avoid douching and scented soaps.  
   - Use condoms consistently to reduce risk of recurrence.  
   - Return if symptoms persist or worsen.  
3. **Follow-Up:** No routine follow-up needed if symptoms resolve. If recurrent BV (>3 episodes/year), consider further workup.  

*(Missing Pertinent Guidance: No discussion of partner treatment, no recommendation for STI screening despite inconsistent condom use.)*
