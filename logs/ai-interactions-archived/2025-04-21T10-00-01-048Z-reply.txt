A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 19  
- BMI: 38.1 (obesity class II)  
- Gravida: 5 (prior pregnancies)  
- Para: 3 (live births), 2 (miscarriages)  
- Last Menstrual Period (LMP): Ongoing, irregular for 6 weeks  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 6-week history of prolonged, heavy menstrual bleeding, associated with fatigue and mild dizziness. She reports passing clots and soaking through multiple pads per day.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
- Bleeding pattern: Continuous for 6 weeks, heavier than usual menses.  
- Associated symptoms: Fatigue, mild lightheadedness, no syncope.  
- Pain: Mild cramping, no severe pelvic pain.  
- Sexual activity: Sexually active, inconsistent condom use.  
- Contraception: None currently.  
- Prior pregnancies: 5 (3 live births, 2 first-trimester losses).  
- No history of gynecologic procedures (e.g., D&C, hysteroscopy).  
- No known bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use.  

*(Missing pertinent questions: Family history of bleeding disorders, medication history including OTC/herbal supplements, prior STI screening, detailed menstrual history before this episode.)*  

**Past Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Obesity (BMI 38.1)  
- No chronic medical conditions reported.  
- No prior surgeries.  

**Medications/Allergies:**  
- No regular medications.  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Smokes ½ pack cigarettes/day.  
- Occasional alcohol use.  
- No illicit drug use.  

**Review of Systems:**  
- Constitutional: Fatigue, no fever/chills.  
- Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations.  
- Respiratory: No dyspnea.  
- GI: No nausea/vomiting, normal bowel habits.  
- GU: No dysuria, hematuria.  

*(Missing pertinent exam: No speculum/bimanual exam documented, no assessment for pallor/signs of anemia.)*  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)** – Likely ovulatory dysfunction given obesity and irregular cycles, though structural causes (e.g., polyps, fibroids) or pregnancy-related complications (e.g., incomplete miscarriage) cannot be excluded without further workup.  
2. **Risk for anemia** – Given prolonged bleeding and fatigue.  
3. **Obesity** – Contributing factor to hormonal dysregulation.  

**Plan:**  
1. **Labs:**  
   - CBC (assess for anemia).  
   - TSH (rule out thyroid dysfunction).  
   - Pregnancy test (despite no reported missed period, given sexual activity).  
   - Consider coagulation studies if personal/family history suggests bleeding disorder *(not yet elicited)*.  

2. **Imaging:**  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal/transvaginal) to evaluate for structural abnormalities.  

3. **Management:**  
   - **Acute bleeding control:**  
     - Start oral progestin (e.g., norethindrone) for short-term bleeding control.  
     - NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain and bleeding reduction.  
   - **Long-term:**  
     - Discuss hormonal contraception (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill or progestin-only options) for cycle regulation after ruling out contraindications.  
     - Weight loss counseling – Referral to nutritionist if interested.  
   - **Follow-up:**  
     - Return in 1 week for lab results and symptom reassessment.  
     - Emergency instructions if bleeding worsens (e.g., soaking >1 pad/hour, syncope).  

*(Missing elements: No discussion of endometrial biopsy despite risk factors [obesity, prolonged anovulation], no STI screening offered.)*  

**Counseling Points:**  
- Advised on iron-rich diet due to risk of anemia.  
- Encouraged smoking cessation.  
- Discussed importance of consistent contraception given high parity and irregular cycles.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await lab/imaging results.  
- Consider referral to gynecology if bleeding persists or structural abnormality found.
