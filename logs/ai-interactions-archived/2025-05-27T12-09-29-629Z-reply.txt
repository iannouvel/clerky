A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. A. Smith  
**Patient:** Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  
**Age:** 38 years  
**Weight:** 72 kg  
**Setting:** Outpatient Gynecology Clinic  

---

### **Subjective History:**  
Ms. Doe presents today reporting a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She describes her periods as "unpredictable," occurring every 2–3 weeks, with heavy flow lasting 7–10 days, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 6–8 pads/day). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports occasional clots. She has associated fatigue but denies dizziness, syncope, or severe pelvic pain.  

**Relevant History:**  
- Gravida 2, Para 2 (vaginal deliveries).  
- No history of gynecologic surgeries.  
- Last Pap smear: 2 years ago (reported as normal).  
- No personal or family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies.  
- Medications: Over-the-counter iron supplements; no hormonal contraception.  
- Allergies: NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  
- Works as a teacher; reports stress but denies significant life changes.  

**Missed Questions:**  
- Sexual history (e.g., new partners, STI risk) not explored.  
- No detailed family history of fibroids or endometriosis.  
- Did not ask about weight changes, hirsutism, or acne (possible PCOS).  

---

### **Objective Findings:**  
**Vitals:**  
- BP: 118/76 mmHg  
- HR: 82 bpm  
- BMI: 26  

**Abdominal Exam:**  
- Soft, non-tender; no palpable masses.  

**Pelvic Exam (Limited):**  
- External: No lesions.  
- Speculum: Active bleeding noted; cervix appears normal.  
- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa not palpated due to patient discomfort.  

**Missed Examinations:**  
- No cervical motion tenderness assessed.  
- No documentation of uterine size or irregularities (fibroids?).  
- No breast exam (to assess for galactorrhea).  

---

### **Assessment:**  
**Working Diagnosis:**  
- Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), likely due to ovulatory dysfunction (given irregular cycles).  
- Differential includes fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, or coagulopathy (though no history suggests this).  

**Unaddressed Concerns:**  
- Endometrial pathology (no transvaginal ultrasound ordered yet).  
- Thyroid dysfunction or PCOS not ruled out.  

---

### **Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - CBC, TSH, ferritin, coagulation screen (to rule out anemia/thrombocytopenia).  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred) to assess endometrial thickness/structural causes.  
   - *Consider adding progesterone level if PCOS suspected (not mentioned today).*  

2. **Empirical Management:**  
   - Start norethisterone 5 mg TID for 21 days to regulate bleeding.  
   - Iron supplementation continued.  
   - Advised to track bleeding patterns using a diary.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks for ultrasound results and symptom review.  
   - *No discussion of long-term options (e.g., IUD, hormonal therapy) yet.*  

**Patient Counseling:**  
- Educated on alarm symptoms (e.g., hemorrhage, severe pain).  
- Encouraged to seek care if worsening fatigue or dizziness.  

**Disposition:**  
Stable for outpatient management.
