She reports no associated vaginal bleeding or discharge but notes mild bloating.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago, occurring 2–3 times per week.  \n- No clear link to meals, bowel movements, or physical activity.  \n- Denies fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in urinary habits.  \n- Last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago, regular cycle (28–30 days).  \n- Sexual activity: Monogamous relationship, using oral contraceptive pills for contraception.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Gestational diabetes during prior pregnancy (resolved postpartum).  \n- No other chronic medical conditions.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Caesarean section 3 years ago (emergency delivery for fetal distress).  \n- No other surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Gravida 1, Para 1 (1 prior pregnancy, 1 live birth).  \n- No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or abnormal smears.  \n- Regular periods, moderate flow, no dysmenorrhea.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Combined oral contraceptive pill (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel).  \n- No other regular medications.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Alcohol: 5–6 units per week.  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Lives with partner and child.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Concerned about possible ovarian cysts or adhesions from prior C-section.  \n- Wants reassurance that symptoms are not serious.  \n- Expects further investigations if needed.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well, no distress.  \n- Abdominal exam: Soft, mild tenderness in lower quadrants, no guarding or rebound. No palpable masses.  \n- Pelvic exam (performed with consent): No cervical motion tenderness, uterus non-tender, no adnexal masses.  \n- Vital signs: BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nLikely musculoskeletal or functional abdominal pain, possibly related to mild adhesions from prior C-section. Low suspicion for ovarian pathology or infection.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Reassurance:** No red flags identified; likely benign cause.  \n2. **Conservative measures:** Heat pack, gentle stretching, monitor symptoms.  \n3. **Safety netting:** Return if pain worsens, becomes constant, or if new symptoms (e.g., fever, vomiting) develop.  \n4. **Consider ultrasound** if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks.  \n5. **Review contraceptive method** if bloating persists (possible pill-related side effect).  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \nAdvised to schedule a routine follow-up in 4 weeks if no improvement.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [Fictional Date]  \n\n*Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
