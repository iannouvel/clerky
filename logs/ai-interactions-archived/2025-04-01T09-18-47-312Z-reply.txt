She is also concerned about recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and possible fertility issues.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Heavy, irregular bleeding for the past 6 weeks, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1 pad every 2 hours on worst days).  - Associated with cramping lower abdominal pain, rated 6&#x2F;10.  - No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  - Reports 3 UTIs in the past 6 months, with dysuria and frequency.  - Last menstrual period (LMP) was 8 weeks ago, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  - Sexual activity: Currently sexually active with one partner, using condoms inconsistently.  Past Medical History:  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at 18.  - Gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy.  - Depression (on sertraline 50mg daily).  - Recurrent UTIs (last treated with nitrofurantoin 3 months ago).  Past Surgical History:  - Caesarean section 2 years ago (emergency for fetal distress).  - Dilation &amp; Curettage (D&amp;C) 1 year ago for incomplete miscarriage.  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12, cycles typically irregular (30-60 days).  - Previous pregnancies:    - 1st pregnancy: Live birth via C-section at 38 weeks (baby 3.8kg).    - 2nd pregnancy: Miscarriage at 10 weeks (D&amp;C required).  - No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 6 months ago).  Drug History:  - Sertraline 50mg daily (depression).  - Paracetamol PRN for pain.  - No regular contraception.  Allergy History:  - Penicillin (rash).  Social History:  - Works as a retail assistant.  - Smokes 5 cigarettes&#x2F;day (10 pack-year history).  - Alcohol: 4-5 units&#x2F;week.  - Lives with partner and 2-year-old child.  Ideas, Concerns &amp; Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried that bleeding may be due to another miscarriage or cancer.  - Concerns: Anxious about future fertility given PCOS and prior miscarriage.  - Expectations: Wants investigations to rule out serious causes and advice on contraception&#x2F;fertility planning.  Examination Findings:  - General: Obese (BMI 47), no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, old Pfannenstiel scar well-healed.  - Speculum Exam: Cervix appears closed, minimal bleeding present. No visible lesions.  - Bimanual Exam: Uterus bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  - Urine Dipstick: Negative for leukocytes&#x2F;nitrites (no active UTI today).  Assessment:  1. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB): Likely anovulatory due to PCOS, but must exclude endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia) given obesity and irregular bleeding.  2. Recurrent UTIs: Possible contributing factors include obesity, incomplete bladder emptying, or behavioural factors.  3. Fertility Concerns: PCOS and prior obstetric history increase risk of subfertility.  Management Plan:  1. Investigations:     - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology.     - Endometrial biopsy if TVUS shows thickened endometrium (&gt;10mm).     - Hb check for anemia due to heavy bleeding.     - Renal ultrasound if UTIs persist (to exclude structural abnormalities).  2. Medical Management:     - Trial of cyclical progestogens (e.g., norethisterone) to regulate bleeding.     - Consider Mirena IUS for long-term endometrial protection and contraception.  3. Lifestyle Advice:     - Weight loss support (referral to dietitian&#x2F;bariatric services).     - Smoking cessation counselling.  4. Follow-Up:     - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results.     - Discuss fertility options (e.g., ovulation induction if desired).  Patient Counselling:  - Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  - Advised on importance of reliable contraception given PCOS-related irregular cycles.  - Encouraged to seek urgent review if bleeding worsens or signs of infection develop.

- Recurrent UTIs (3 episodes in past 6 months).  
- PCOS, gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy, depression (on sertraline).  
- Sexually active, inconsistent condom use, no regular contraception.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day, alcohol 4–5 units/week.  

### Detailed Assessment:  
1. **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB)**: Likely anovulatory due to PCOS, but endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia) must be excluded given obesity and irregular bleeding.  
   - TVUS planned to assess endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology.  
   - Endometrial biopsy if endometrium >10mm.  
   - Hb check for anemia secondary to heavy bleeding.  

2. **Recurrent UTIs**: Possible contributors include obesity, incomplete bladder emptying, or behavioral factors.  
   - Renal ultrasound if UTIs persist to exclude structural abnormalities.  
   - Urine dipstick today negative for active UTI.  

3. **Fertility Concerns**: PCOS and prior miscarriage increase subfertility risk.  
   - Patient anxious about future fertility; advised on ovulation induction options if desired.  

### Plan:  
1. Investigations:  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology.  
   - Endometrial biopsy if endometrium >10mm.  
   - Hb level to assess for anemia.  
   - Renal ultrasound if recurrent UTIs persist.  

2. Medical Management:  
   - Trial of cyclical progestogens (e.g., norethisterone) to regulate bleeding.  
   - Consider Mirena IUS for endometrial protection and contraception.  

3. Lifestyle Modifications:  
   - Referral to dietitian/bariatric services for weight loss support.  
   - Smoking cessation counselling.  

4. Follow-Up:  
   - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results.  
   - Discuss fertility options (e.g., ovulation induction) if desired.  

5. Patient Counselling:  
   - Reassured about low cancer likelihood but need for exclusion.  
   - Advised on reliable contraception due to PCOS-related irregular cycles.  
   - Urgent review if bleeding worsens or signs of infection develop.
