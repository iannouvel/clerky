She describes episodes of heavy menstrual bleeding lasting 8–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with associated passage of small clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports occasional postcoital spotting. She has mild fatigue but no dizziness, syncope, or symptoms of anemia.  \n\nShe has no significant pelvic pain or dyspareunia. Her last Pap smear was 2 years ago (normal). She has no personal or family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies. She is sexually active with one partner and uses condoms inconsistently for contraception. She has one prior full-term vaginal delivery without complications.  \n\n*Incomplete history:*  \n- No documentation of prior contraceptive use (e.g., hormonal methods).  \n- No inquiry about weight changes, hirsutism, or acne (to assess for PCOS).  \n- Thyroid symptoms (e.g., heat/cold intolerance, hair loss) not explored.  \n- Medications/supplements not reviewed (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants).  \n\n**Objective:**  \n- Vitals: BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile.  \n- BMI: 22.4 (normal range).  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- Pelvic exam: Cervix appears normal; no visible lesions. Uterus midline, normal size, no adnexal tenderness.  \n- *Incomplete exam:* No speculum exam performed today to evaluate for cervical polyps/lesions.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n47-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding (likely AUB-O given age and pattern, but structural causes like polyps or fibroids not excluded). Differential includes perimenopausal hormonal changes, endometrial hyperplasia, or thyroid dysfunction.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound to assess for fibroids/polyps/endometrial thickness.  \n   - CBC to evaluate for anemia (despite no overt symptoms).  \n   - TSH to rule out thyroid dysfunction.  \n   - *Missing:* Endometrial biopsy (highly recommended in age >45 with AUB).  \n\n2. **Management:**  \n   - Start empiric tranexamic acid for heavy bleeding (no contraindications per history).  \n   - Consider trial of low-dose combined oral contraceptive pill if no HTN/smoking (not yet discussed with patient).  \n   - Advise iron supplementation if CBC confirms anemia.  \n\n3. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Return in 4 weeks for results and reassessment.  \n   - Counsel on urgency if bleeding worsens (e.g., soaking pad hourly).  \n\n**Patient Instructions:**  \nMs. Doe verbalized understanding and will schedule ultrasound/labs.
