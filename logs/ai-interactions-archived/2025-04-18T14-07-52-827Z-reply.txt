She reports occasional palpitations but denies chest pain or syncope. <br><br><strong>History of Presenting Complaint:</strong> <br>- Symptoms began insidiously, worsening over the past two weeks. <br>- No recent febrile illness or overt bleeding reported. <br>- Denies melaena or haematochezia. <br>- Reports heavy menstrual bleeding over the last three cycles (further quantification needed). <br>- No history of recent trauma or surgery. <br><br><strong>Past Medical History:</strong> <br>- Iron deficiency anaemia (previously treated with oral iron, adherence unclear). <br>- [Incomplete – any other medical conditions?] <br><br><strong>Past Surgical History:</strong> <br>- Caesarean section x2 (dates and indications unclear). <br>- [Incomplete – any other surgeries?] <br><br><strong>Gynaecological History:</strong> <br>- Menarche age 12, cycles previously regular but now heavy/prolonged. <br>- No history of intermenstrual bleeding or post-coital bleeding. <br>- Contraception: Currently using condoms (previous methods unclear). <br>- Last cervical smear: [Incomplete – to be clarified]. <br><br><strong>Drug History:</strong> <br>- Oral ferrous sulfate (adherence uncertain). <br>- [Incomplete – any other medications?] <br><br><strong>Allergy History:</strong> <br>- NKDA (no known drug allergies). <br><br><strong>Social History:</strong> <br>- Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary role). <br>- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history). <br>- Alcohol: Occasional social drinking. <br>- Lives with partner and two children. <br><br><strong>Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:</strong> <br>- Concerned about persistent fatigue affecting work and childcare. <br>- Worried about needing a blood transfusion. <br>- Expects investigation and treatment for her symptoms. <br><br><strong>Examination Findings:</strong> <br>- General: Pale conjunctivae, no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. <br>- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (HR 102 bpm), BP 110/70 mmHg, no murmurs. <br>- Respiratory: Clear lung fields, mild tachypnoea (RR 18/min). <br>- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. <br>- [Incomplete – further examination required, e.g., signs of fluid overload, neurological assessment for anaemia-related symptoms]. <br><br><strong>Investigations (Pending/Required):</strong> <br>- Full blood count (FBC) – likely to show anaemia. <br>- Ferritin, B12, folate. <br>- Coagulation screen if heavy menstrual bleeding persists. <br>- Group and save/crossmatch if transfusion likely. <br>- Pelvic ultrasound if fibroids/suspected structural cause of menorrhagia. <br><br><strong>Management Plan (Based on GTG 2015 – Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics):</strong> <br>1. <strong>Immediate:</strong> <br>- If Hb &lt;70 g/L with symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, dyspnoea), consider transfusion per obstetric guidelines. <br>- If Hb 70-100 g/L, assess for functional impairment; oral iron +/- transfusion if symptomatic. <br>2. <strong>Long-term:</strong> <br>- Optimise iron therapy (consider IV iron if poor absorption/non-adherence). <br>- Investigate cause of menorrhagia (e.g., fibroids, coagulopathy). <br>- Lifestyle advice: Smoking cessation, dietary iron optimisation. <br>3. <strong>Follow-up:</strong> <br>- Repeat Hb in 2 weeks. <br>- Gynaecology referral if bleeding persists. <br><br><strong>Outstanding Information Needed:</strong> <br>- Full obstetric history (parity, gestational ages of prior pregnancies). <br>- Detailed menstrual history (cycle length, clot passage, flooding). <br>- Confirmation of adherence to iron therapy. <br>- Further examination findings (e.g., signs of chronic anaemia). <br><br><strong>Impression:</strong> <br>Symptomatic anaemia, likely secondary to menorrhagia, with possible iron deficiency. Requires further workup to guide transfusion need and long-term management. <br><br><strong>End of Dictation – For Testing Purposes Only.</strong> <br><br>*Note: This is a fictional scenario and does not constitute medical advice.
