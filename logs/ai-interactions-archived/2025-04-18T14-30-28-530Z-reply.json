Reports mild lower abdominal discomfort but no severe pain. Denies fever, dizziness, or syncope.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Bleeding started spontaneously, no obvious trigger.  \n- No recent trauma or intercourse prior to onset.  \n- No history of similar episodes in prior pregnancies.  \n- Urine pregnancy test (home) was positive 3 weeks ago.  \n- No documented prior ultrasound in this pregnancy.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- 3 full-term vaginal deliveries (no complications reported).  \n- 2 first-trimester miscarriages (both spontaneous, no intervention required).  \n- No known history of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD).  \n\n**Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- No significant medical conditions.  \n- No prior surgeries.  \n- No known allergies.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- None currently.  \n- Denies recent hormonal contraception use.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Lives with partner and children.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well, no pallor or distress.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Speculum exam: Moderate fresh blood in vault, no obvious cervical lesions.  \n- Bimanual exam: Uterus slightly enlarged (8-week size), no adnexal tenderness/masses.  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects (for testing purposes):**  \n- No documented blood pressure or pulse.  \n- No serum hCG levels checked.  \n- No ultrasound performed yet.  \n- No enquiry about symptoms of hyperemesis or hyperthyroidism (possible GTD associations).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- ? Early pregnancy complication (threatened miscarriage vs. GTD).  \n- Given gravidity, age, and bleeding, GTD must be considered.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent serum hCG** – baseline level and repeat in 48 hours to assess trend.  \n2. **Pelvic ultrasound** – to assess for intrauterine pregnancy vs. molar changes.  \n3. **If ultrasound suggests molar pregnancy:**  \n   - Refer to specialist GTD centre for suction evacuation.  \n   - Send products of conception for histology.  \n   - Weekly hCG monitoring until normalisation.  \n4. **If hCG rises abnormally or plateaus post-evacuation:**  \n   - Staging investigations (CXR, pelvic MRI if indicated).  \n   - Consider chemotherapy per GTD protocol.  \n5. **Contraception counselling:**  \n   - Avoid pregnancy until hCG normal for 6 months (oral contraception permitted).  \n6. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Arrange GTD registry enrolment if confirmed.  \n\n**Clinician’s Note:**  \n*This dictation is incomplete for testing purposes.
