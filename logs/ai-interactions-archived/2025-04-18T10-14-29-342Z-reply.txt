A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [REDACTED]  
- Age: 50  
- Weight: 80 kg  
- BMI: 28.8  
- Gravida: 1 (currently pregnant)  
- Para: 0 (no prior deliveries)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents at 36 weeks gestation with a confirmed breech presentation on recent ultrasound. She reports no significant pain or contractions but expresses concern about the implications of the breech position for delivery.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- First noted at 34-week routine scan.  
- No prior attempts at external cephalic version (ECV).  
- No fetal movements reported as reduced or abnormal.  
- Denies any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (well-controlled on medication).  
- Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine).  
- No known history of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia in this pregnancy.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 25).  
- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  

**Drug History:**  
- Amlodipine 5 mg OD.  
- Levothyroxine 75 mcg OD.  
- No current anticoagulants.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker.  
- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  
- Works as a schoolteacher.  
- Lives with partner, no children.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Concerned about risks of vaginal breech delivery vs. planned caesarean.  
- Wishes to explore ECV but anxious about discomfort.  
- Expects clear guidance on safest delivery options.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Well-appearing, no signs of distress.  
- Abdominal: Fundal height consistent with dates. Breech palpable in lower uterus, cephalic pole not engaged.  
- Fetal heart rate: Normal (140 bpm), no decelerations.  
- (Incomplete – Speculum/Pelvic exam not yet performed to assess cervix.)  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Counsel on ECV:**  
   - Offer ECV at 37 weeks after confirming fetal wellbeing (CTG, ultrasound).  
   - Explain success rates (~50%) and risks (transient fetal bradycardia, placental abruption).  
   - Advise that ECV is contraindicated if any signs of fetal compromise or ruptured membranes.  

2. **Delivery Options:**  
   - If ECV successful, plan for vaginal delivery with continuous monitoring.  
   - If ECV unsuccessful or declined, discuss elective caesarean section (recommended given nulliparity and maternal age).  

3. **Next Steps:**  
   - Arrange urgent obstetric review for ECV consent and planning.  
   - Schedule follow-up scan to reassess presentation.  
   - Provide patient information leaflet on breech management.  

**Outstanding Information Required:**  
- Cervical status (favorability for ECV).  
- Detailed anomaly scan to exclude contraindications (e.g., placenta praevia).  
- Patient’s final decision on ECV after counseling.
