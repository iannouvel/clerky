She is also concerned about recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and possible fertility issues.  <br><br><strong>History of Presenting Complaint:</strong>  <br>- Heavy, irregular bleeding for the past 6 weeks, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1 pad every 2 hours on worst days).  <br>- Associated with cramping lower abdominal pain, rated 6/10.  <br>- No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  <br>- Reports 3 UTIs in the past 6 months, with dysuria and frequency.  <br>- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 8 weeks ago, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  <br>- Sexual activity: Currently sexually active with one partner, using condoms inconsistently.  <br><br><strong>Past Medical History:</strong>  <br>- Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at 18.  <br>- Gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy.  <br>- Depression (on sertraline 50mg daily).  <br>- Recurrent UTIs (last treated with nitrofurantoin 3 months ago).  <br><br><strong>Past Surgical History:</strong>  <br>- Caesarean section 2 years ago (emergency for fetal distress).  <br>- Dilation &amp; Curettage (D&amp;C) 1 year ago for incomplete miscarriage.  <br><br><strong>Gynaecological History:</strong>  <br>- Menarche at age 12, cycles typically irregular (30-60 days).  <br>- Previous pregnancies:  <br>  - 1st pregnancy: Live birth via C-section at 38 weeks (baby 3.8kg).  <br>  - 2nd pregnancy: Miscarriage at 10 weeks (D&amp;C required).  <br>- No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 6 months ago).  <br><br><strong>Drug History:</strong>  <br>- Sertraline 50mg daily (depression).  <br>- Paracetamol PRN for pain.  <br>- No regular contraception.  <br><br><strong>Allergy History:</strong>  <br>- Penicillin (rash).  <br><br><strong>Social History:</strong>  <br>- Works as a retail assistant.  <br>- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  <br>- Alcohol: 4-5 units/week.  <br>- Lives with partner and 2-year-old child.  <br><br><strong>Ideas, Concerns &amp; Expectations:</strong>  <br>- <strong>Ideas:</strong> Worried that bleeding may be due to another miscarriage or cancer.  <br>- <strong>Concerns:</strong> Anxious about future fertility given PCOS and prior miscarriage.  <br>- <strong>Expectations:</strong> Wants investigations to rule out serious causes and advice on contraception/fertility planning.  <br><br><strong>Examination Findings:</strong>  <br>- <strong>General:</strong> Obese (BMI 47), no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  <br>- <strong>Abdominal:</strong> Soft, non-tender, old Pfannenstiel scar well-healed.  <br>- <strong>Speculum Exam:</strong> Cervix appears closed, minimal bleeding present. No visible lesions.  <br>- <strong>Bimanual Exam:</strong> Uterus bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  <br>- <strong>Urine Dipstick:</strong> Negative for leukocytes/nitrites (no active UTI today).  <br><br><strong>Assessment:</strong>  <br>1. <strong>Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB):</strong> Likely anovulatory due to PCOS, but must exclude endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia) given obesity and irregular bleeding.  <br>2. <strong>Recurrent UTIs:</strong> Possible contributing factors include obesity, incomplete bladder emptying, or behavioural factors.  <br>3. <strong>Fertility Concerns:</strong> PCOS and prior obstetric history increase risk of subfertility.  <br><br><strong>Management Plan:</strong>  <br>1. <strong>Investigations:</strong>  <br>   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology.  <br>   - Endometrial biopsy if TVUS shows thickened endometrium (&gt;10mm).  <br>   - Hb check for anemia due to heavy bleeding.  <br>   - Renal ultrasound if UTIs persist (to exclude structural abnormalities).  <br>2. <strong>Medical Management:</strong>  <br>   - Trial of cyclical progestogens (e.g., norethisterone) to regulate bleeding.  <br>   - Consider Mirena IUS for long-term endometrial protection and contraception.  <br>3. <strong>Lifestyle Advice:</strong>  <br>   - Weight loss support (referral to dietitian/bariatric services).  <br>   - Smoking cessation counselling.  <br>4. <strong>Follow-Up:</strong>  <br>   - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results.  <br>   - Discuss fertility options (e.g., ovulation induction if desired).  <br><br><strong>Patient Counselling:</strong>  <br>- Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  <br>- Advised on importance of reliable contraception given PCOS-related irregular cycles.  <br>- Encouraged to seek urgent review if bleeding worsens or signs of infection develop.  <br><br><strong>Dictated by:</strong> Dr. Smith (Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology)  <br><strong>Date:</strong> [Fictional date]  <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This is a fictional case for educational purposes only.
