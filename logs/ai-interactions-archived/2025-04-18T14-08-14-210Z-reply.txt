Long-term: - Optimise iron therapy (consider IV iron if poor absorption&#x2F;non-adherence). - Investigate cause of menorrhagia (e.g., fibroids, coagulopathy). - Lifestyle advice: Smoking cessation, dietary iron optimisation. 3. Follow-up: - Repeat Hb in 2 weeks. - Gynaecology referral if bleeding persists. Outstanding Information Needed: - Full obstetric history (parity, gestational ages of prior pregnancies). - Detailed menstrual history (cycle length, clot passage, flooding). - Confirmation of adherence to iron therapy. - Further examination findings (e.g., signs of chronic anaemia).

A: ### Summary:  
- Age: 32 years  
- BMI: 35.2 (obese class II)  
- Gravida: 4, Para: [Incomplete]  
- Presenting complaints: Fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath on exertion, occasional palpitations (2 weeks duration)  
- Heavy menstrual bleeding (last 3 cycles)  
- Past medical history: Iron deficiency anemia (previously treated, adherence unclear)  
- Past surgical history: Caesarean section x2  
- Social history: Smokes 5 cigarettes/day, sedentary occupation  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Fatigue, dizziness, SOB, palpitations**: Likely secondary to anemia; requires FBC, ferritin, B12, folate to confirm etiology.  
- **Heavy menstrual bleeding**: Possible contributor to anemia; needs pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural causes (e.g., fibroids) and coagulation screen if bleeding persists.  
- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Adherence to oral iron unclear; consider IV iron if poor absorption or non-adherence.  
- **Smoking**: Advised cessation due to cardiovascular and general health risks.  
- **Transfusion consideration**: If Hb <70 g/L with symptoms, transfuse per obstetric guidelines; if Hb 70-100 g/L, assess functional impairment.  

### Plan:  
1. Immediate investigations: FBC, ferritin, B12, folate, coagulation screen, group and save/crossmatch if transfusion likely.  
2. Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate menorrhagia etiology.  
3. If Hb <70 g/L with symptoms, arrange transfusion per guidelines; if Hb 70-100 g/L, optimize oral iron ± transfusion based on symptoms.  
4. Consider IV iron if poor adherence or absorption to oral iron.  
5. Smoking cessation counseling and dietary iron optimization advice.  
6. Repeat Hb in 2 weeks.  
7. Refer to gynecology if heavy menstrual bleeding persists.  
8. Clarify obstetric history, menstrual details, and iron therapy adherence.
