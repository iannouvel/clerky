- No intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding.  
- Not sexually active in the past year.  
- Pale conjunctivae on exam (possible anemia).

### Details:  
- Ms. Doe reports heavy menstrual bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with fatigue and occasional cramping.  
- No intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding noted.  
- Examination reveals pale conjunctivae (suggestive of anemia), but no abdominal tenderness or palpable masses.  
- Cervix appears normal on speculum exam; uterus is anteverted and normal-sized on bimanual exam.  
- Differential diagnoses include ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  
- Doctor advises FBC to assess anemia, TSH/prolactin for endocrine evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural causes.  
- Tranexamic acid is recommended for symptomatic relief during heavy bleeding, with COCP considered for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  
- Reassurance provided regarding the common nature of AUB, with instructions to monitor for worsening symptoms (e.g., syncope, severe fatigue).  

### Plan:  
1. Investigations:  
   - Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.  
2. Symptomatic relief:  
   - Trial of tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding.  
   - Consider COCP for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  
3. Follow-up:  
   - Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.  
   - Escalate to gynecology referral if bleeding worsens or anemia is confirmed.
