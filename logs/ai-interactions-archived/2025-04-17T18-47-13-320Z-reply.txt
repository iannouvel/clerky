A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 39 years  
- **Weight:** 72 kg  
- **Height:** 1.66 m  
- **BMI:** 26.2 (overweight)  
- **Gravida:** 2, Para: 2 (two prior pregnancies, both vaginal deliveries)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding** with episodes lasting up to 10 days. She describes passing **clots** and experiencing **intermenstrual spotting**. She also reports **pelvic discomfort** but denies dyspareunia.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began gradually, worsening over the last 3 months.  
- No associated fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  
- She has tried over-the-counter NSAIDs with partial relief.  
- No recent contraceptive use (last hormonal contraception 5 years ago).  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **PCOS** (diagnosed age 25) – irregular cycles since menarche.  
- **Obesity** (BMI previously 30, now improved to 26.2).  
- **Gestational diabetes** (second pregnancy, resolved postpartum).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Tubal ligation** (age 35, post-second child).  
- No prior hysteroscopy or endometrial sampling.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, cycles previously irregular (30–60 days), now heavier and unpredictable.  
- No history of STIs.  
- Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Paracetamol PRN (no regular medications).  
- No current hormonal therapy.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a school teacher.  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Married, monogamous.  

**Family History:**  
- Mother: **endometrial cancer** (diagnosed age 58).  
- No other significant malignancies.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried symptoms may indicate "early menopause" or "something like my mum had."  
- **Concerns:** Anxiety about cancer risk given family history.  
- **Expectations:** Wants "answers quickly" and prefers "non-hormonal options if possible."  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness/masses.  
- **No evidence of acute bleeding at time of exam.**  

**Assessment:**  
- **Suspected endometrial hyperplasia** (given AUB, PCOS, obesity, and family history of endometrial cancer).  
- Differential includes **anovulatory bleeding** (PCOS-related) or **endometrial polyp**.  

**Management Plan (aligned with GTG 2014 – Endometrial Hyperplasia):**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Transvaginal ultrasound** to assess endometrial thickness (if >4mm in postmenopausal equivalent symptoms, biopsy indicated).  
   - **Endometrial biopsy** (pipelle or hysteroscopy-guided) for histology.  
2. **Risk Reduction:**  
   - Weight management counselling (BMI 26.2 → aim for <25).  
   - Discuss **progestin therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral progestins) if hyperplasia confirmed, given cancer risk.  
3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Urgent 2-week-wait referral if biopsy shows atypia.  
   - Routine gynaecology follow-up if non-atypical hyperplasia.  
4. **Patient Education:**  
   - Reassurance that most hyperplasia is treatable.  
   - Emphasize importance of biopsy for definitive diagnosis.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Schedule USS and biopsy.  
- Provide leaflet on endometrial hyperplasia.  
- Advise to return if bleeding worsens (e.g., flooding, dizziness).
