A: **Summary:**  
- 24-year-old primigravida (P0), 37+3 weeks gestation.  
- BMI 18, Rh-positive.  
- Presenting complaint: Idiopathic abdominal pain (cramping, lower abdomen and bilateral flanks), onset over the weekend.  
- No vaginal bleeding, ruptured membranes, abnormal discharge, or urinary/gastrointestinal/infective symptoms.  
- Normal fetal movements.  
- Significant background: Perinatal mental health history, victim of sexual violence.  
- Observations normal, urine normal.  
- Abdomen soft, non-tender; uterus soft, non-tender; no renal angle tenderness.  
- CTG: Baseline 168 bpm, short-term variability (STV) 3.8, reactive with no decelerations.  

**Details:**  
- The patient reports diffuse lower abdominal cramping without associated symptoms suggestive of labor, infection, or other pathology.  
- Abdominal and renal examinations are unremarkable, ruling out overt tenderness or organ-specific involvement.  
- CTG meets Dawes-Redmond criteria but shows borderline STV (3.8), prompting repeat testing per fetal monitoring guidelines.  
- The patient’s psychosocial history (perinatal mental health, sexual violence) is noted but does not directly influence acute management.  

**Plan:**  
1. Repeat CTG within 4 hours due to STV 3.8 (borderline).  
2. Maintain NBM status pending further review.  
3. If persistent CTG abnormalities (e.g., STV <3 or decelerations), admit for:  
   - Consultant discussion.  
   - Consider category 3 delivery ± antenatal corticosteroids.
