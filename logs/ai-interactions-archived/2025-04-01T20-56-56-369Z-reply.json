Describes it as \"sharp and crampy,\" rated 7/10. No relief with OTC NSAIDs.  \n2. **Postmenopausal Bleeding:** Despite prior regular cycles, now reports 3 episodes of vaginal bleeding over 2 months (last menstrual period 14 months ago). Bleeding is light but associated with clots.  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History**  \n- **Medical:** Hypertension (on lisinopril), Type 2 DM (metformin), depression (citalopram).  \n- **Surgical:** C-section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018).  \n- **Gynaecological:** History of ovarian cyst (resolved, 2019), HPV-positive (no dysplasia on last Pap smear 2 years ago).  \n\n### **Drug History & Allergies**  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD, metformin 1 g BD, citalopram 20 mg OD.  \n- Allergies: Penicillin (rash).  \n\n### **Social History**  \n- Works as a schoolteacher. Married, monogamous.  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-years), occasional alcohol.  \n- Exercise: Sedentary.  \n\n### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about \"fibroids or cancer\" due to bleeding.  \n- **Concerns:** Pain affecting intimacy; fears surgical intervention.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"answers quickly\" and non-hormonal options if possible.  \n\n---\n\n### **Examination Findings**  \n- **General:** Obese, BP 138/86, no pallor/jaundice.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa. No masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - **Speculum:** Atrophic vaginal mucosa; small clot in vault. Cervix appears nulliparous.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus enlarged (~10-week size), fixed, tender left adnexa. No cervical motion tenderness.  \n\n---\n\n### **Differential Diagnoses**  \n1. **Postmenopausal Bleeding:** Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma vs. atrophy.  \n2. **Pelvic Pain:** Adenomyosis vs. ovarian pathology (e.g., endometrioma).  \n\n### **Investigations Planned**  \n1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Assess endometrial thickness, adnexae.  \n2. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Rule out malignancy.  \n3. **CA-125:** If ovarian pathology suspected.  \n\n### **Management Advice**  \n1. **Immediate:**  \n   - Expedite ultrasound/biopsy. Advise cessation of smoking (counselling offered).  \n   - Analgesia: Trial of mefenamic acid for pain.  \n2. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Discuss results within 2 weeks. If biopsy abnormal, refer to gynae-oncology.  \n   - If benign, consider Mirena IUS (if acceptable) for bleeding/pain.  \n3. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Red flags (e.g., heavy bleeding, syncope).  \n   - Weight loss benefits (reduced endometrial cancer risk).  \n\n**Plan:** Review with results +/− MDT input.  \n\n---  \n**End of Dictation** *(Fictional for testing purposes only.
