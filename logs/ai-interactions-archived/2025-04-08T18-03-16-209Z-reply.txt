A: **Summary:**  
- 14-year-old female  
- Presenting complaint: Primary dysmenorrhea (painful periods)  
- Menarche at 12 years  
- Nulligravida (pregnancy history: 0)  
- No intermenstrual bleeding  
- Not sexually active  
- BMI not mentioned  
- Past medical history: Fit and well  
- Past surgical history: Finger operation after partial amputation  
- Allergy history: NKDA  
- Drug history: NSAIDs and paracetamol for dysmenorrhea  
- Examination: Normal, no masses, no abdominal scars, normal pelvic exam  

**Details:**  
- Reports dysmenorrhea with pain scoring 5-6/10, maximal on day 1 of menstruation, lasting 3 days.  
- Pain improves with heat (water bottle) and TENS machine.  
- No intermenstrual bleeding or features suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea.  
- Not sexually active, ruling out pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections as contributors.  
- Examination findings are unremarkable, supporting a diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea.  
- Doctor advised reassurance and continuation of current non-hormonal management (NSAIDs, paracetamol).  
- Hormonal adjuncts (oral, vaginal, or LNG-IUS) may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.  
- If symptoms of anemia develop, further investigations (FBC ± iron studies, coagulation profile) should be pursued.  

**Plan:**  
1. Reassurance regarding primary dysmenorrhea.  
2. Continue NSAIDs and paracetamol for pain management.  
3. Consider hormonal therapy (oral, vaginal, or LNG-IUS) if symptoms remain uncontrolled.  
4. Monitor for anemia; if suspected, perform FBC ± iron studies and coagulation profile as indicated.
