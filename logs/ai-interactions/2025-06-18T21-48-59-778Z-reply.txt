Regular checks of equipment functionality (e.g., oxygen supply, suction) are mandatory. - **Drug Dosing**: Weight-based dosing for adrenaline (0.2 ml/kg IV/IO), bicarbonate (2–4 ml/kg of 4.2%), glucose 10% (2.5 ml/kg), and 0.9% sodium chloride (10 ml/kg). ETT sizes and lengths are specified by weight/gestation. - **Preterm Infants (<26 weeks)**: Individualized decision-making with parental involvement; options include resuscitation, comfort care, or survival-focused care based on gestational age and viability. - **Resuscitation Protocol**: Follow Resuscitation Council UK’s Newborn Life Support (NLS) flowchart. Initial steps include warmth, airway clearance, and ventilation with 21–30% oxygen (adjusted for preterm infants). - **Documentation**: Checklists for Resuscitaire contents (e.g., masks, suction catheters, ETTs) and pre-use verification are provided. - **Training**: Staff must undergo regular neonatal life support training and competency assessments. *(Focused on clinical recommendations; excludes governance/background details.)*",
