Key recommendations include: - **Encourage staying home** during early labor, engaging in normal activities. - **Pain management options**: breathing exercises, water immersion, massage, aromatherapy, yoga, acupressure, TENS machines, heat packs, and positional changes. - **Pharmacological relief** (if needed): Paracetamol, codeine, or opiates in hospital, with counseling on opioid side effects. Sedatives (e.g., Temazepam) may be used for sleep deprivation. - **Advise symptoms requiring urgent care** and provide clear antenatal education. - **Supportive measures**: active movement, distractions (music/TV), and sensitive communication. Midwives should assess fetal heart rate and offer tailored advice while ensuring women feel heard and supported",
