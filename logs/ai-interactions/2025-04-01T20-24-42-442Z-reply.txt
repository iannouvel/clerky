A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. A. Smith, OB/GYN  
**Patient:** Ms. J. Doe (Fictional Name)  
**Age:** 26  
**Weight:** 136 kg | **BMI:** 52  
**Prior Pregnancies:** 2 (1 term vaginal delivery, 1 first-trimester miscarriage)  

---

### **History of Presenting Complaint**  
Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns:  
1. **Recurrent Pelvic Pain**: Intermittent sharp pain in the left lower quadrant, worsening over the past 3 months. Pain is non-cyclical, exacerbated by prolonged standing, and associated with occasional post-coital bleeding. No fever or urinary symptoms.  
2. **Irregular Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB)**: Cycles vary from 21–45 days, with flooding/clotting lasting 7–10 days. Reports fatigue and dizziness consistent with anemia.  

### **Past Medical/Surgical History**  
- **Medical**: PCOS (diagnosed age 18), insulin resistance, depression.  
- **Surgical**: Appendectomy (age 12), cesarean section (age 23 for fetal distress).  
- **Gynecological**:  
  - Miscarriage (age 25, managed medically).  
  - History of bacterial vaginosis (recurrent).  

### **Medications & Allergies**  
- Metformin 500 mg BD, Sertraline 50 mg OD, OCP (previously, discontinued due to HMB).  
- **Allergies**: NKDA.  

### **Social History**  
- Works as a childcare assistant; limited physical activity due to pain/fatigue.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history). Occasional alcohol.  
- Lives with partner; uses condoms inconsistently.  

### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations**  
- **Ideas**: Worried pain may be "cysts or endometriosis." Anxious about fertility due to irregular cycles.  
- **Concerns**: Fear of cancer due to family history (aunt with ovarian cancer).  
- **Expectations**: Requests "scan to check everything" and options to regulate bleeding.  

---

### **Examination Findings**  
- **General**: Obese (BMI 52), acanthosis nigricans noted. Pale conjunctiva.  
- **Abdominal**: Soft, non-distended. Tenderness in left iliac fossa; no palpable mass.  
- **Pelvic Exam**:  
  - **Speculum**: Cervix appears healthy; minimal old blood in vault.  
  - **Bimanual**: Uterus bulky, non-tender. Left adnexal fullness (+/- complex cyst). No cervical motion tenderness.  

---

### **Differential Diagnoses**  
1. **Complex Adnexal Mass**: Likely hemorrhagic ovarian cyst vs. endometrioma (given history of PCOS/pain).  
2. **AUB-O (Ovulatory Dysfunction)**: Secondary to PCOS/obesity.  

---

### **Management Plan**  
1. **Investigations**:  
   - **Pelvic USS**: To characterize adnexal mass and endometrial thickness.  
   - **Bloods**: FBC (anemia workup), HbA1c (diabetes screening), CA-125 (cautiously, given family history).  
2. **Symptomatic Relief**:  
   - Tranexamic acid for HMB; iron supplementation if anemic.  
   - Trial of NSAIDs for pain (avoid opioids given depression history).  
3. **Long-Term**:  
   - Weight loss support (bariatric referral if interested).  
   - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD vs. cyclical progestins) post-imaging.  
4. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Review USS results in 2 weeks. If cyst >5 cm/persistent, consider laparoscopy.  
   - Screen for depression exacerbation (link to counselor).  

**Patient Counseled**: Reassured no immediate red flags for malignancy but emphasized need for further evaluation. Advised smoking cessation support.
