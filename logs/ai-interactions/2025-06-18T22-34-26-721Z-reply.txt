      "newValue": "**Summary of Guidelines for the Management of HIV in Pregnancy and Neonatal Period** - **Preconception**: Advise on lifestyle, folic acid, and vitamin D. Aim for undetectable viral load before conception. - **ART**: Start and continue lifelong ART. Modify regimens if needed; avoid zidovudine monotherapy. Resistance testing is essential. - **Pregnancy screening**: Monitor viral load, CD4, STIs, and mental health. Defer invasive testing until viral load is undetectable. - **Delivery**: Mode depends on viral load—elective vaginal delivery or C-section if VL ≥50 copies/mL. Manage SROM promptly. - **Neonatal PEP**: Start within 4 hours; regimen depends on maternal VL and ART duration. Formula feeding is recommended in high-income settings; breastfeeding permitted if VL undetectable with strict monitoring. - **Postpartum**: Continue ART, screen for depression, and plan contraception. Test infants for HIV at intervals. - **Co-infections**: HBV-exposed infants need PEP. HCV treatment is not advised in pregnancy. - **Partner/child testing**: Test partners and other children if mother is newly diagnosed. Offer annual cervical screening. (Word count: 200)",
