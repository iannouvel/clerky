Random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion. - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Glucose >11.0mmol/L or fasting ≥5.6mmol/L requires urgent referral. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Insulin adjustments may be needed for those on corticosteroids or during labor. - **Monitoring**: Regular blood glucose checks, especially postpartum and while breastfeeding. Hospital admission may be needed for hyperemesis or unstable glucose. - **Fetal care**: Include 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidelines; prioritize those with GDM. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure guideline adherence and optimal care",
