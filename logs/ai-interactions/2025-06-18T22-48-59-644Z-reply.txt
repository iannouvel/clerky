Other exclusions include bony fractures or certain medical conditions. - **Prerequisites:** Experienced clinician, proper assessment, and instrument choice. Rotational births require expertise. - **Risks:** Ventouse has higher failure but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks. - **Consent:** Verbal consent in delivery room; written consent in theatre. Document discussions. - **Location:** Birth room if low risk; theatre for higher risk (immediate cesarean access). - **Analgesia:** Options include epidural/spinal or pudendal block. - **Procedure:** Bladder emptied pre-delivery; neonatal resuscitation team present. Follow specific techniques for ventouse, non-rotational/rotational forceps. - **Episiotomy:** Mediolateral if needed, with analgesia. - **Aftercare:** Inspect trauma, give antibiotics, monitor bladder (record first void), and provide analgesia. - **Documentation:** Record consent, procedure details, instruments, perineal repair, and birth interval. - **Debriefing:** Review complications, advise on future births, address trauma, and offer postnatal support. *Focus: Safe, informed, and individualized care with clear documentation and follow-up.*",
