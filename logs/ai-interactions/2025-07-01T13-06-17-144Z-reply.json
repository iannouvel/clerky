Recommended Regimen: Ultrapotent topical steroids like Clobetasol proprionate. Maintenance treatment may be required with weaker steroid preparations. Vaginal corticosteroids may be used in more severe cases. Alternative regimens may include ultra-potent topical steroids with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Topical steroids are safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Referral to a vulval clinic is recommended for erosive disease or recalcitrant cases. Follow-up at 2-3 months is advised. Biopsy should be performed in non-responsive cases. \n\nVulval eczema: Avoidance of precipitating factors is recommended. Use of emollient soap substitute and topical corticosteroids are advised. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nLichen simplex: Avoidance of precipitating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and anxiolytic antihistamines may be used. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nVulval psoriasis: Avoidance of irritating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and coal-tar preparations may be used. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): Referral for colposcopy is recommended. Treatment options include local excision, imiquimod cream, or vulvectomy. Follow-up is mandatory. \n\nVulval pain: Vulvodynia is defined as vulvar discomfort without visible findings. Treatment depends on the type of vulvodynia.\n\nAetiology: Likely multifactorial, with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis as a common feature.\n\nClinical Features: Vulval pain, focal tenderness, no signs of acute inflammation.\n\nComplications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.\n\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis based on history and examination.\n\nManagement: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.\n\nTreatment: Avoid irritating factors, use emollient soap substitute, consider topical local anaesthetics with caution. Physical therapies, cognitive behaviour therapy, pain modifiers, and surgery may be options.\n\nFollow-up: As clinically required, long-term follow-up and psychological support may be necessary.\n\nUnprovoked Vulvodynia: Aetiology unknown, managed as a chronic pain syndrome.\n\nClinical Features: Longstanding unexplained pain, may be associated with urinary symptoms.\n\nComplications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.\n\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis after excluding other causes.\n\nManagement: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.\n\nTreatment: Use emollient soap substitute, consider pain modifiers like tricyclic antidepressants. Referral to a pain clinic may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases.\n\nFollow-up: As clinically required.\n\nGuidelines for the management of Vulvodynia. Long-term results of therapeutic approach to provoked vestibulodynia. Pelvic floor muscle assessment outcomes in women with and without provoked vestibulodynia. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to treat vestibulodynia. Use of Amielle Vaginal Trainers in the treatment of Vestibulodynia. Psychological predictors of treatment outcome for provoked vestibulodynia. Long-term follow up of posterior vestibulectomy for treating vulvar vestibulitis. Treatment of vulvodynia with tricyclic antidepressants. Evaluation of gabapentin in the treatment of generalized vulvodynia. Pregabalin-induced remission in a woman with vulvodynia. A randomized clinical trial for women with vulvodynia: Cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. supportive psychotherapy.
