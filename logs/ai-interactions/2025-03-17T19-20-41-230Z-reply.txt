</ul>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Mrs. Smith, a 39-year-old female with a BMI of 61, presents with <i>heavy menstrual bleeding</i> and <i>worsening pelvic pain</i>, impacting her daily life. She has a history of <i>fibroids</i>, <i>hypertension</i>, and <i>type 2 diabetes</i>, with surgical history significant for <i>appendectomy</i>. The clinician recommends a <i>pelvic ultrasound</i> to assess the fibroids' size and location, considering a <i>myomectomy</i> or <i>endometrial ablation</i> due to the severity of symptoms and previous cesarean sections. A <i>physical examination</i> will be performed to rule out other gynecological issues.</p>

<p><strong>Plan:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Schedule <i>pelvic ultrasound</i> to evaluate fibroids.</li>
  <li>Consider <i>myomectomy</i> or <i>endometrial ablation</i> based on ultrasound findings.</li>
  <li>Refer to a <i>nutritionist</i> for weight management.</li>
  <li>Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and address any questions or concerns.</li>
</ol>
