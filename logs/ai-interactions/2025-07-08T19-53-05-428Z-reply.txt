  "transcript": "[SINGLENAMES]’s a professional medical clerking in SBAR format for a fictional patient with **adenomyosis**, incorporating obstetric/gynecological terminology, abbreviations, and [HOSPITALNAMES]al detail:  \n\n---\n\n### **SITUATION:**  \n**[SINGLENAMES]:** [FULLNAMES] 38-year-old **G3P2** (2 SVD, 1 TOP) female, BMI 28, presented to [FULLNAMES] at **1000 hours** with a **6-month history of worsening secondary dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia (soaking >6 pads/day), and chronic pelvic pain (VAS 8/10)**. [SINGLENAMES] refractory to **PO NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400mg TDS PRN)** and **COCP ([SINGLENAMES] 30)**. [SINGLENAMES] menstrual period (LMP): **7 days ago**. No PV bleeding currently. **USS (transvaginal) 2/52 prior reported heterogeneous myometrium with cystic striations, junctional zone >12mm**, suggestive of adenomyosis.  \n\n---\n\n### **BACKGROUND:**  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] SVD x2 (2015, 2018), 1 TOP (2012). No GDM/PE.  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] excision of **endometrioma (L ovary, 2017)**. [SINGLENAMES] dysmenorrhea since menarche ([AGE]).  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES]-deficiency anemia (Hb **98 g/L** 3/12 ago, on **ferrous sulfate 200mg OD**). No HTN/DM.  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] (2009).  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** As above + **tranexamic acid 1g TDS PRN menstruation**.  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** NKDA.  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] with hysterectomy ([AGE] for \"fibroids\").  \n- **[FULLNAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES], prior uterine surgery (TOP), endometriosis.  \n\n---\n\n### **ASSESSMENT:**  \n**[SINGLENAMES]:**  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] (36.8°C), BP **128/82 mmHg**, HR **88 bpm**, SpO2 **99% RA**.  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES], non-distended. **[SINGLENAMES] suprapubically**, no guarding/rebound. [SINGLENAMES] **bulky, non-mobile** on bimanual palpation. No adnexal masses. [SINGLENAMES] nulliparous, os closed.  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** No active bleeding, cervix appears normal.  \n\n**[SINGLENAMES]:**  \n- **[SINGLENAMES] bloods (2/52 prior):** Hb **102 g/L**, MCV **78 fL** (microcytic), CRP **5 mg/L**, normal **U&Es/LFTs**.  \n- **TV USS (2/52 prior):** [SINGLENAMES] **12x9x8 cm**, **globular morphology**, **asymmetric myometrial thickening (JZ 15mm posteriorly)**, no focal fibroids. [SINGLENAMES] **6mm**. [SINGLENAMES] normal.  \n- **MRI pelvis (pending):** [SINGLENAMES] to assess extent of adenomyosis (focal vs. diffuse) and exclude deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).  \n\n**[FULLNAMES]:**  \n1. **[SINGLENAMES] (likely, given USS + [HOSPITALNAMES]al picture)**  \n2. **[SINGLENAMES] (given prior endometrioma)**  \n3. **[SINGLENAMES] (though USS negative)**  \n4. **[SINGLENAMES] pelvic inflammatory disease (unlikely, no fever/CRP elevation)**  \n\n---\n\n### **RECOMMENDATION:**  \n**[FULLNAMES]:**  \n- **[SINGLENAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] to **mefenamic acid 500mg TDS + paracetamol 1g QDS** for pain. [SINGLENAMES] **levonorgestrel-IUS ([SINGLENAMES])** for menorrhagia if cavity normal on MRI.  \n- **[SINGLENAMES] repletion:** [SINGLENAMES] **ferrous sulfate**, recheck Hb in **4/52**.  \n\n**[FULLNAMES]:**  \n1. **[SINGLENAMES]:** [SINGLENAMES] of **GnRH analogues (e.g., goserelin 3.6mg SC monthly)** for 3/12 if MRI confirms adenomyosis, with **add-back therapy (HRT)** to prevent bone loss.  \n2. **[SINGLENAMES]:**  \n   - If fertility desired: [SINGLENAMES] **uterine-sparing resection (if focal disease)**.  \n   - If family complete: **[SINGLENAMES] laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) + BSO** (if severe symptoms refractory to medical therapy).  \n\n**[SINGLENAMES]/[SINGLENAMES]-up:**  \n- **MRI pelvis** to guide surgical planning.  \n- **GYN MDT discussion** for complex case.  \n- **[SINGLENAMES] review in 4/52** with MRI results to finalize plan.  \n\n**[FULLNAMES]:**  \n- [SINGLENAMES] **hysterectomy as curative option** vs. medical management for symptom control.  \n- [SINGLENAMES] on **fertility implications** (if relevant).  \n\n--- \n\n**[SINGLENAMES] by:** [[FULLNAMES]], [[SINGLENAMES]], [[SINGLENAMES]]  \n**[SINGLENAMES]:** [DD/MM/YYYY, 1430 hours]  \n\n---  \n*[SINGLENAMES] is a fictional scenario for educational purposes only.*",
