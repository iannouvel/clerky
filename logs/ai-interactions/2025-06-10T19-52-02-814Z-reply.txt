If unable to perform full surgical procedures for ectopic pregnancy, support must be available. Virtual reality simulators can aid in training for salpingectomy. Ectopic pregnancies include various types, but not pregnancy of unknown location. Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking. Ultrasound is the primary tool for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy, with specific criteria for identification. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are useful for management planning. Cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies have defined ultrasound criteria for diagnosis. Interstitial pregnancy occurs in the fallopian tube and has specific ultrasound criteria for diagnosis.\n\nA single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. At presentation, based on clinical symptoms and ultrasound scan, if there is suspicion of interstitial pregnancy, a single serum b-hCG should be carried out. The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy: visualization of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body, gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus and completely surrounded by myometrium, and a vascular pedicle adjoining the gestational sac to the unicornuate uterus. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. Ovarian ectopic pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose with certainty preoperatively, so the diagnosis should be considered whenever ultrasound findings are suspicious. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. A heterotopic pregnancy is diagnosed when the ultrasound findings demonstrate an intrauterine pregnancy and a coexisting ectopic pregnancy. Heterotopic pregnancy should be considered in all women presenting after assisted reproductive technologies, in women with an intrauterine pregnancy complaining of persistent pelvic pain, and in those women with a persistently raised b-hCG level following miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.\n\nCG levels greater than 5000 iu/l are significant predictors of failure in ectopic pregnancies. Methotrexate treatment success is higher with smaller increases in b-hCG levels prior to administration. A decrease in b-hCG levels from day 1 to day 4 after methotrexate administration is associated with higher success rates. Methotrexate should be the first-line management for women with specific criteria. Expectant management is a reasonable option for selected women with minimal pain and low b-hCG levels. Success rates for expectant management are dependent on case selection and lower initial b-hCG levels are associated with higher success rates. Management options for cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies should be tailored based on individual factors and gestational age. Surgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options are available for different types of ectopic pregnancies.\n\nInic acid rescue regimen was successful with a 91% success rate. Various methods for treatment include transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration followed by methotrexate injection, endoscopic approaches, and hysteroscopic resection. Selective UAE with methotrexate has been used for reducing hemorrhage. Laparoscopic removal is recommended for cornual pregnancies. Definitive surgical treatment is preferred for ovarian pregnancies. Laparoscopic removal is an option for early abdominal pregnancy, while advanced cases require laparotomy. Management of heterotopic pregnancies should consider the prognosis of the intrauterine pregnancy. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy. Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy show no difference in fertility rates between management methods. Support and counseling should be offered to women undergoing treatment, including access to patient support groups and local bereavement counseling services. Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial for women undergoing treatment with methotrexate. It is recommended to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again after methotrexate treatment. Plans for follow-up should be clearly recorded, and written information on treatment options and support services should be provided.\n\nThe manufacturers of methotrexate recommend a 3-month window after use before conception due to the length of time that it may remain present in some organs and because of concern for subsequent pregnancy and fetal development. A small cohort study showed a higher than expected major malformation rate in women who conceived within 3 months of methotrexate exposure. However, conception within 3 months of methotrexate should not be considered an indication for termination. Providers of early pregnancy care should offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service with direct access for women referred by general practitioners and accident and emergency departments. Women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be managed in dedicated early pregnancy clinics with access to all appropriate management options. Laparoscopic salpingotomy is not part of the core training of gynaecologists, and appropriate support from senior staff trained in all surgical techniques should be available. Clinicians managing women with ectopic pregnancy must have received appropriate training in surgical, ultrasound, and medical management techniques. Virtual reality simulators can be used as a training tool for surgical procedures. The need for anti-D in women with nontubal ectopic pregnancies, methotrexate for the treatment of ovarian ectopic pregnancy, long-term fertility following management of nontubal ectopic pregnancies, and other research topics are recommended for future studies. Auditable topics include the proportion of women offered all relevant management options for ectopic pregnancy and the percentage of women provided with information containing support group details. Useful links and support groups are listed for further information and guidance.\n\nFirst-trimester diagnosis and management of pregnancies implanted into the lower uterine segment Cesarean section scar.

A: ### Very Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status of the patient.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends anti-D immunoglobulin for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy (Section: "Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy").  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss long-term fertility prospects and desire for future fertility with the patient.  
   Reason: The guideline emphasizes discussing long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy (Section: "Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy should be discussed with patients").  

3. **Different management plan** - Include a single serum b-hCG level at diagnosis and consider a repeat in 48 hours if needed.  
   Reason: The guideline states that a single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management, and a repeat in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management (Section: "A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management").  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Explore sexual history and recent partner details.  
   Reason: The guideline implies comprehensive history-taking for risk factors (e.g., tubal damage, smoking), though not explicitly stated.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on treatment options and support services, including patient support groups.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends offering support and counseling, including access to patient support groups (Section: "Support and counseling should be offered to women undergoing treatment, including access to patient support groups and local bereavement counseling services").  

3. **Different management plan** - Document uterine size and further characterize adnexal masses during examination.  
   Reason: The guideline emphasizes detailed ultrasound criteria for diagnosing ectopic pregnancies (Section: "Ultrasound is the primary diagnostic modality... with specific criteria for identification").  

### Less Important Recommendations  
1. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss the 3-month waiting period before trying to conceive after methotrexate treatment.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends waiting at least 3 months post-methotrexate due to fetal development concerns (Section: "It is recommended to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again after methotrexate treatment").  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document if the patient has any risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (e.g., smoking, prior tubal surgery).  
   Reason: The guideline notes smoking as a risk factor, though this is less critical for immediate management (Section: "Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking").  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest muscle relaxation training if methotrexate is chosen.  
   Reason: The guideline mentions this as a potential benefit but is not critical (Section: "Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial for women undergoing treatment with methotrexate").  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document if the patient has access to a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends such services but does not impact immediate care (Section: "Providers of early pregnancy care should offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service").
