Midwives should recognize risk factors, maintain a warm environment, and promote skin-to-skin contact. Immediately after birth, dry the baby, ensure skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding. For low temperatures, use skin-to-skin contact, monitoring, and a hot cot if needed. Skin-to-skin contact stabilizes heart rate, temperature, and supports feeding. When using a hot cot, keep it switched on, monitor temperature closely, and gradually reduce heat once stable.
