She also reports occasional urinary incontinence when coughing or sneezing.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- The back pain is dull and localized to the lumbar region, radiating occasionally to the right buttock.  \n- No history of trauma or recent heavy lifting.  \n- The urinary leakage has been present for ~6 months but has recently become more frequent.  \n- No dysuria, hematuria, or fever.  \n- Pain is partially relieved by rest and over-the-counter ibuprofen.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Gestational diabetes (during third pregnancy, resolved postpartum)  \n- Mild asthma (well-controlled, uses salbutamol PRN)  \n- Depression (on sertraline 50 mg OD, stable)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Caesarean section x2 (last one 3 years ago)  \n- Appendectomy (age 12)  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Gravida 3, Para 3 (all live births)  \n- Last menstrual period: 2 weeks ago, regular cycles  \n- No history of STIs or abnormal smears  \n- Uses combined oral contraceptive pill  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Sertraline 50 mg OD  \n- Salbutamol inhaler PRN  \n- Combined oral contraceptive pill  \n- Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN (recently self-medicating for back pain)  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week)  \n- No recreational drug use  \n- Works full-time in an office (sedentary role)  \n- Lives with partner and three children (ages 7, 5, and 3)  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Concerned that her back pain may be due to \"weak muscles\" after pregnancies or a \"slipped disc.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Worried that urinary leakage may worsen and affect her work. Anxious about needing surgery.  \n- **Expectations:** Hopes for pain relief and strategies to manage incontinence without invasive treatment.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no acute distress.  \n- **Cardiovascular/Respiratory:** Normal heart sounds, clear lungs.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:**  \n  - Reduced lumbar flexion due to pain.  \n  - Tenderness over L4/L5 paraspinal muscles.  \n  - No neurological deficits in lower limbs (normal power, reflexes, sensation).  \n- **Pelvic Exam (if indicated):** (Not performed today—patient declined unless necessary.)  \n- **Bladder Stress Test:** Positive for stress incontinence with coughing.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. **Mechanical low back pain** likely due to deconditioning and obesity-related strain.  \n2. **Stress urinary incontinence**, probable pelvic floor dysfunction post-pregnancies.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Back Pain:**  \n   - Advised graded physiotherapy (core strengthening, posture correction).  \n   - Recommended weight loss (discussed dietitian referral).  \n   - Avoid prolonged sitting; use lumbar support at work.  \n   - Switch from ibuprofen to regular paracetamol due to mild gastric discomfort.  \n\n2. **Urinary Incontinence:**  \n   - Referral to pelvic floor physiotherapy.  \n   - Bladder diary for 1 week to assess patterns.  \n   - Trial of pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) with follow-up in 6 weeks.  \n\n3. **Lifestyle:**  \n   - Encouraged low-impact exercise (swimming, walking).  \n   - Discussed weight management strategies.  \n\n4. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Review in 6 weeks to assess progress.  \n   - If no improvement, consider urodynamics or specialist referral.  \n\n**Patient Education:**  \n- Reassured that symptoms are common post-pregnancy and often improve with conservative measures.  \n- Advised to return sooner if worsening pain, leg weakness, or urinary retention.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Fictional Clinician]  \n**Date:** [Fictional Date]  \n\n**Note:** This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
