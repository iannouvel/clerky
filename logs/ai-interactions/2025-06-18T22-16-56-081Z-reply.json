Use tables for recommended volumes per feed (first 96 hours) and per kg/24 hours. - **Top-Up Feeds:** Prioritize expressed breast milk (EBM); document all feeds. Reduce supplementation once milk supply increases, weight improves, and blood tests normalize. - **Support:** Involve Infant Feeding Team for breastfeeding assistance. Ensure follow-up in community; discharge only if weight gain exceeds **20g/day**. - **Medical Concerns:** Consider septic screen if clinical concerns arise. Protect breastfeeding and monitor glucose/electrolytes as needed. - **Audit:** Review maternity notes after re-admissions for weight loss/feeding issues. **Target Groups:** Midwives, neonatal nurses, paediatricians, and obstetricians.
