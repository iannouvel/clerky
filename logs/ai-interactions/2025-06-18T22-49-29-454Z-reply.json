Prefer sutures over staples for skin closure. - **Special Considerations:** Negative pressure wound therapy for BMI ≥35 kg/m²; forceps only for difficult head delivery. - **Cord Management:** Delayed clamping is routine; cord milking if clamping isn’t feasible. Take cord blood samples for Category 1/2 cases, Rh-negative patients, or abnormal antibodies. - **Medication:** Oxytocin 5 units IV post-clamping; avoid routine 40-unit infusion. - **Pre-Operative Care:** Antenatal corticosteroids for elective CS before 38+6 weeks; pre-op assessment 24-48 hours prior. - **Post-Operative Care:** Regular analgesia; remove urinary catheter after mobility (≥6 hours post-epidural). Assess for UTIs, retention, or injury if symptoms arise. - **Recovery & Counseling:** Discuss future pregnancy implications (e.g., VBAC); resume activities as tolerated. Provide complete discharge summaries. - **VTE Risk:** Thromboprophylaxis based on assessment. - **Complications:** Heavy bleeding may indicate endometritis; manage accordingly. - **Risks:** Caesarean reduces urinary/fecal incontinence and OASIS risk vs. vaginal birth. Similar risks for VTE, hemorrhage, and neonatal outcomes. (Word count: 200)\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
