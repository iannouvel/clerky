This is particularly important for this patient with persistent AUB where hysteroscopy may be needed if bleeding persists or biopsy is inconclusive. Providing information improves patient preparedness and satisfaction.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Consider hysteroscopy if USS/biopsy inconclusive\" with \"If hysteroscopy is required, use vaginoscopic approach with miniaturised hysteroscope (≤3.5mm) and saline distension at lowest effective pressure\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'Vaginoscopy should be the standard technique for outpatient hysteroscopy unless a vaginal speculum is required' and 'Miniature hysteroscopes of 3.5mm or less in outer diameter should be used for diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy to reduce pain.' For this patient with possible endometrial pathology, this approach would minimize discomfort while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. 'Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view' is also recommended to reduce patient discomfort.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: discussion of pain management options for potential hysteroscopy\" with \"If hysteroscopy is planned, recommend pre-procedure NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid 500mg 1 hour prior) and consider TENS as first-line analgesia options\" (Reason: The guideline notes: 'A statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, and antispasmodics given prior to hysteroscopy. NSAIDs and TENS showed no significant difference in side effects.' For this patient already using mefenamic acid PRN, this would be a logical extension of her current regimen. The guideline specifically recommends against routine conscious sedation for outpatient procedures.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52 (consider hysteroscopy if bleeding persists)\" with \"GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52 with hysteroscopy planning including: safety checklist (pregnancy exclusion), consent discussion about potential pain, and arrangement of dedicated recovery area\" (Reason: The guideline requires: 'Women should be given verbal and/or written informed consent prior to hysteroscopy, and should be informed of the potential pain and distress during the procedure. A safety checklist should be considered before hysteroscopy, including exclusion of pregnancy.' For this patient of reproductive age, these elements are essential for safe procedure planning. 'Care after hysteroscopy should include discussing clinical findings, providing contact information, and offering a dedicated recovery area' is also recommended.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: documentation standards for any future hysteroscopy\" with \"Ensure standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings if procedure is performed, including: scope size, approach (vaginoscopic), distension medium (saline), pressure, and any interventions\" (Reason: The guideline emphasizes: 'Standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings is essential.' For quality assurance and continuity of care, this is particularly important for this patient who may require ongoing management of her AUB. The documentation should align with BSGE Surgical Information Collection System requirements.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

### **SITUATION:**  
**Patient Demographics:**  
- **Name:** Ms. X (DOB: 15/05/1985, 39yo)  
- **Gestation:** N/A (G4P2, previous SVD x2, LSCS x1)  
- **Presenting Complaint:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) – heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) for 3/12, worsening over last 2/52.  
- **Key Clinical Issue:** Persistent AUB with associated fatigue (likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia). No hemodynamic instability at present.  

### **BACKGROUND:**  
**Relevant PMHx:**  
- **OBGYN Hx:**  
  - G4P2 (2x SVD, 1x LSCS for FTP, 1x TOP)  
  - Previous IUD (Mirena®) removed 6/12 ago due to expulsion  
  - No known fibroids or endometriosis  
- **Medical Hx:**  
  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD)  
  - Obesity (BMI 32)  
  - No known coagulopathy  
- **Surgical Hx:**  
  - LSCS (2018)  
  - Appendicectomy (2005)  
- **Medications:**  
  - Levothyroxine 75mcg OD  
  - NSAIDs PRN for dysmenorrhea (no recent use)  
- **Allergies:** NKDA  
- **Social Hx:**  
  - Non-smoker, occasional ETOH  
  - Works as a teacher, moderately active  

**Risk Factors for AUB:**  
- Obesity (↑ endometrial hyperplasia risk)  
- Hypothyroidism (may exacerbate HMB)  
- Previous IUD expulsion (possible structural cause)  

### **ASSESSMENT:**  
**Clinical Findings (0800 hours):**  
- **Vitals:**  
  - BP: 128/78 mmHg  
  - HR: 88 bpm (regular)  
  - Temp: 36.7°C  
  - SpO₂: 98% RA  
  - RR: 14/min  
- **General Exam:**  
  - Pale conjunctivae (clinical anemia)  
  - No signs of hemodynamic compromise  
- **Abdo Exam:**  
  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- **PV Exam (consented & chaperoned):**  
  - No active bleeding at time of exam  
  - Cervix appears normal, no cervical excitation  
  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size  
  - No adnexal masses  

**Investigations:**  
- **Bloods (FBC, LFTs, U&Es, CRP, TFTs, coagulation screen):**  
  - Hb: 98 g/L (↓ from 112 g/L 6/12 ago)  
  - MCV: 78 fL (microcytic)  
  - Ferritin: 12 μg/L (↓)  
  - TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (well-controlled)  
  - Platelets: 220 x10⁹/L  
  - INR/APTT: Normal  
- **Imaging:**  
  - **TV USS:**  
    - Endometrial thickness: 12mm (heterogeneous)  
    - No fibroids/polyps seen  
    - Normal adnexa  
  - **Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology)**  

**Differential Diagnosis (PALM-COEIN):**  
1. **Polyp/Adenomyosis** (USS inconclusive, biopsy pending)  
2. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (↑ risk due to obesity)  
3. **Coagulopathy** (unlikely given normal coagulation)  
4. **Ovulatory dysfunction** (secondary to hypothyroidism?)  
5. **Iatrogenic** (none identified)  

### **RECOMMENDATION:**  
**Immediate Management:**  
- **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulfate 200mg BD + vitamin C (monitor Hb in 4/52)  
- **Hormonal therapy:**  
  - Start norethisterone 5mg TDS for 21/7 (to regulate bleeding)  
  - Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion if biopsy normal  
- **Analgesia:** Mefenamic acid 500mg TDS PRN (if dysmenorrhea)  

**Monitoring & Follow-Up:**  
- **Repeat Hb in 4/52** (target >110 g/L)  
- **Await endometrial biopsy results** (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy)  
- **GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52 with hysteroscopy planning including: safety checklist (pregnancy exclusion), consent discussion about potential pain, and arrangement of dedicated recovery area**  

**Further Investigations if Needed:**  
- **If hysteroscopy is required, use vaginoscopic approach with miniaturised hysteroscope (≤3.5mm) and saline distension at lowest effective pressure**  
- **Thyroid antibody testing** if TFTs fluctuate  

**Contingencies:**  
- If hemodynamically unstable → admit for IV iron/transfusion  
- If biopsy shows hyperplasia → consider progestogens/hysterectomy (if completed family)  

**Additional Considerations:**  
- **Provide written information to the patient prior to hysteroscopy appointment, including details about the procedure, benefits and risks, advice regarding pre-operative analgesia, and contact details for the hysteroscopy unit**  
- **If hysteroscopy is planned, recommend pre-procedure NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid 500mg 1 hour prior) and consider TENS as first-line analgesia options**  
- **Ensure standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings if procedure is performed, including: scope size, approach (vaginoscopic), distension medium (saline), pressure, and any interventions**
