Avoid induction in cases of precipitate labor or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Check Bishop Score, maternal/fetal wellbeing, and gestation. - **Cervical Ripening:** Balloon catheter (outpatient/inpatient) or dinoprostone gel (individualized). Monitor for complications. - **Oxytocin Use:** Start only after obstetric review; titrate to achieve adequate contractions. Monitor maternal/fetal observations closely. - **Special Circumstances:** Preterm labor, fetal demise, previous cesarean, diabetes, obesity, or pre-labor rupture of membranes (PROM). For PROM at term, offer induction after 24 hours of expectant management. - **Complications:** Manage uterine hyperstimulation with tocolysis; immediate cesarean if rupture suspected. - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24–48 hours; options include further attempts or cesarean. - **Monitoring:** Regular CTG, temperature checks (if PROM), and fetal movement reporting. - **Documentation:** Record all procedures, consent, and outcomes (e.g., CRB audit). **Key Points:** - Individualize counseling on risks/benefits of induction. - Use reduced-volume oxytocin regime for safety. - Prioritize neonatal unit access if labor hasn’t started 24 hours post-PROM. - Respect patient autonomy if induction declined but offer monitoring from 42 weeks.
