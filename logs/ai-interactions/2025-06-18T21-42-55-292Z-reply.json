Escalate concerns promptly for abnormal traces. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders, prematurity <34 weeks). Avoid if expedited birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Perform if fetal concerns arise during labor or birth, especially for SGA/FGR cases. Paired samples (artery/vein) should be analyzed promptly; document results. - **Poor CTG Quality:** Address transducer issues, reposition, or switch to fetal scalp electrode (FSE). For telemetry loss, check battery/antenna or switch to wired monitoring. - **Documentation & Storage:** Record CTG findings, interventions, and store traces for 25 years. - **Human Factors & Communication:** Ensure team collaboration and consider clinical context in CTG interpretation. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; requires 10 minutes of quality data. Not diagnostic—follow local protocols. *Key: Prioritize patient preferences, clinical context, and timely intervention.* (Word count: 200)\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
