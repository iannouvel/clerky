A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe (pseudonym)  
- **Age:** 30 years  
- **Weight:** 105 kg  
- **BMI:** 37.4 (obese class II)  
- **Prior Pregnancies:** 4 (G4P3A1 – 3 live births, 1 miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding** with episodes lasting up to 10 days, associated with **intermenstrual spotting** and occasional **pelvic discomfort**. She describes passing **clots** and needing to change sanitary products every 2 hours during heavy flow days. She denies fever, dizziness, or weight loss but reports fatigue, which she attributes to blood loss.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began gradually 6 months ago, worsening over time.  
- No recent hormonal contraceptive use.  
- No history of bleeding disorders.  
- No recent trauma or intrauterine device (IUD) placement.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Obesity (BMI 37.4)**  
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**, diagnosed age 22  
- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**, diagnosed age 28 (on metformin)  
- **Hypertension**, diagnosed age 29 (on lisinopril)  
- **Previous miscarriage** (spontaneous, 8 weeks gestation, 5 years ago)  

**Surgical History:**  
- **Cesarean section x2** (last 3 years ago)  
- **Dilation and curettage (D&C)** post-miscarriage  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- **Menarche:** Age 12  
- **Cycle:** Previously irregular (consistent with PCOS), now heavier and more unpredictable  
- **Last menstrual period (LMP):** 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting)  
- **Contraception:** Condoms (no hormonal methods)  
- **Cervical screening:** Last smear 1 year ago (normal)  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1000 mg BD  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD  
- Over-the-counter iron supplements (self-initiated for fatigue)  

**Allergy History:**  
- **NKDA**  

**Social History:**  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator (sedentary role)  
- **Smoking:** Never  
- **Alcohol:** Occasional (1–2 units/week)  
- **Exercise:** Minimal due to fatigue and joint pain  
- **Diet:** High in processed foods, admits to frequent sugary snacks  

**Family History:**  
- Mother: **Endometrial cancer (diagnosed age 50)**  
- Father: **Type 2 diabetes**  
- Sister: **PCOS**  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried her symptoms are due to "hormonal imbalance" or "something like what my mother had."  
- **Concerns:** Fears cancer risk given family history. Anxious about fertility implications.  
- **Expectations:** Wants "answers quickly" and hopes for non-surgical treatment if possible.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no pallor, no signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism).  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic (speculum + bimanual):**  
  - **Speculum:** Small amount of dark blood in vault, cervix appears normal.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender, no adnexal masses.  
- **Blood pressure:** 138/86 mmHg  

**Assessment:**  
- **Likely endometrial hyperplasia** (given obesity, PCOS, abnormal bleeding, and family history of endometrial cancer).  
- High-risk features per **GTG 2014 (Green-top Guideline on Endometrial Hyperplasia)**:  
  - Persistent abnormal bleeding  
  - BMI >35  
  - PCOS + anovulation  
  - Strong family history  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Urgent endometrial biopsy** (pipelle or hysteroscopy-guided) to assess for hyperplasia +/- atypia.  
2. **Transvaginal ultrasound** to measure endometrial thickness (if biopsy delayed).  
3. **Weight management referral** (bariatric specialist + dietitian) – critical for reducing estrogen-driven proliferation.  
4. **Diabetes/Hypertension optimization** (HbA1c and BP review).  
5. **Progestogen therapy** (if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia, per GTG 2014):  
   - First-line: **Levonorgestrel-IUS (Mirena)** OR oral progestogens (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate).  
6. **Fertility counseling** (if future pregnancy desired, given PCOS and metabolic risks).  
7. **Safety-netting:** Advised to return if worsening bleeding, pain, or systemic symptoms.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review biopsy results in 2 weeks.  
- If atypia found, discuss hysterectomy (definitive treatment per guidelines).  

**Prognosis:**  
- Good if hyperplasia without atypia (regression likely with progestogens + weight loss).  
- Higher risk if atypia (15–30% progression to cancer).
