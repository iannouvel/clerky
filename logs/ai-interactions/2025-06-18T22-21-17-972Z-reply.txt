      "newValue": "**Summary of Emergency Gynaecology Admissions & GAU Protocol GP005, May 2020** - **Key Principles**: Guidelines support but do not replace clinical judgement; senior input is advised. - **Scope**: Applies to all Womenâ€™s Directorate staff, including ED clinicians and management. - **Responsibilities**: Staff must follow protocols while using professional judgement; management ensures accessibility and review. - **General Approach**: Prompt assessment (history, observations) for acute gynaecological conditions (e.g., pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding, hyperemesis). Refer to registrar if needed. - **Early Pregnancy (<14 weeks)**: Structured assessment/referral; ectopic pregnancy requires urgent management. - **Clinical Management**: - Ovarian torsion demands surgery within 6 hours. - Stable patients referred to Gynaecology Assessment Unit (GAU); unstable/surgical cases go to CEPOD/emergency pathways. - **Hospital-Specific Protocols**: - **RSCH**: GAU accepts stable patients; emergency surgery via CEPOD. - **PRH**: Transfer unstable/surgical patients to RSCH after stabilization. - **GAU Details**: - 24/7 service with ultrasound and specialist access. - Excludes unstable/immediate surgical cases. - **Other Departments**: Gynaecology patients admitted elsewhere must be reviewed daily and logged on the whiteboard. - **Referral Pathways**: Clear routes for ED/GP referrals; contact details for obstetric/gynaecology teams provided. - **After-Hours Care**: SHO/SPR cover; EPU bookings via GAU after hours.
