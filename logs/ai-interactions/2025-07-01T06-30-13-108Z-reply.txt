This analysis focuses on identifying areas where the clinical documentation can be improved according to the specific guideline requirements.\n\nGuideline: The Initial Management of Chronic Pelvic Pain\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nThe Initial Management of Chronic Pelvic Pain \nThis guideline provides an evidence-based summary for appropriate investigation and management of women with chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain can significantly impact a woman's ability to function and may have multiple contributing factors. Pain is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and may be influenced by physical, psychological, and social factors. The initial assessment aims to identify factors contributing to the pain and develop a management plan. Adequate time should be allowed for the initial assessment, and a partnership between the clinician and the woman should be established to plan a management program. Referral to a specialist may be considered if the pain is not adequately controlled. The history should include questions about the pattern of pain, association with other symptoms, and the effect of movement and posture on the pain. Red flag symptoms should be noted for further investigation. Additionally, asking about past or present sexual assault may be helpful. Completing a daily pain diary may help identify provoking factors or associations.\n\nEstablishing the woman's level of function at the start of treatment is important for monitoring progress and setting functional goals. Symptom-based diagnostic criteria can confidently diagnose IBS. Referral to relevant healthcare professionals should be considered if a non-gynaecological component to the pain is suspected. Examination should include abdominal and pelvic examination. Screening for infection, particularly STIs, should be offered to sexually active women with chronic pelvic pain. TVS and MRI are useful for identifying structural abnormalities. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered as a second-line investigation. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatment for cyclical pain and antispasmodics for IBS. Other treatments such as analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications may also be beneficial. Self-management techniques and support from organizations can be valuable for patients. Chronic pelvic pain should be seen as a symptom with multiple contributing factors, and a comprehensive management plan should be developed in partnership with the woman.\n\nGastroenterol 2009;23:593–610.
