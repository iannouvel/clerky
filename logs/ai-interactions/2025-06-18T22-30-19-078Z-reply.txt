If unsuccessful, perform **reverse breech extraction**. - **First-stage LSCS:** First-line **reverse breech extraction**; if unsuccessful, use the **push technique**. **Fetal Pillow Criteria:** - Failed instrumental delivery. - Full dilatation LSCS with head at/below ischial spines or severe caput/moulding (3+). **Procedure Notes:** - Requires pre-use training (hands-on/online). - Document vaginal/abdominal findings pre-insertion. - Monitor delivery difficulty, time, mode, and neonatal outcomes (Apgar, injuries, SCBU admission). - Record maternal complications (uterine extensions, bladder injury, EBL, ICU admission). **Audit:** Proforma tracks compliance and outcomes.
