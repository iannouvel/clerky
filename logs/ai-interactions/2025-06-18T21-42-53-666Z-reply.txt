      "newValue": "**Summary of Fetal Heart Monitoring Guidelines:** - **Monitoring Methods:** Use intermittent auscultation (Pinardâ€™s stethoscope) for low-risk pregnancies and continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) for high-risk cases (e.g., hypertension, breech, antepartum hemorrhage). - **Antenatal Monitoring:** Apply Dawes-Redman Criteria from 26 weeks; discontinue after 10 minutes if met; seek obstetric review if not met by 60 minutes. - **Intrapartum Monitoring:** Regular CTG review, considering maternal/fetal risk factors. Escalate concerns promptly for abnormal traces. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders, prematurity <34 weeks). Avoid if expedited birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Perform if fetal concerns arise during labor or birth, especially for SGA/FGR cases. Paired samples (artery/vein) should be analyzed promptly; document results. - **CTG Troubleshooting:** Address poor signal by repositioning transducers, using fetal scalp electrodes, or switching machines. - **Human Factors & Documentation:** Ensure clear communication, document CTG findings, and store traces for 25 years. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; requires 10 minutes of quality data. Results guide but do not replace clinical judgment. *Key: Prioritize maternal preferences, clinical context, and timely intervention.* (200 words)",
