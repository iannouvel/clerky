Types include clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation, and other harmful procedures. UK healthcare professionals must report FGM cases in girls under 18 to police and safeguard at-risk individuals. **Key Recommendations:** - **Mandatory Reporting:** Immediate reporting required for under-18 cases. - **Documentation:** Record assessments, risks, and actions in patient records. - **Risk Assessment:** Use indicators to evaluate risk; refer to safeguarding leads if uncertain. - **Immediate Risk:** Refer to Social Services/Police if harm is imminent. - **Information Sharing:** Notify GP, provide FGM leaflets, and discuss health/legal implications. - **Prevalence & Risk Factors:** Higher in certain regions; assess family risks. - **Support & Referrals:** Offer defibrillation at 20 and 30 weeks (if declined); involve safeguarding teams as needed. - **Data Collection:** Mandatory recording in FGM datasets; respect patient objections. - **Maternity Care:** Follow specific guidance for identifying and managing FGM cases. Professionals should consult safeguarding leads and use available resources for support",
