She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] uhsussex-mp053-obstetric-haemorrhage-pdf\nTitle: UHSussex - MP053 - Obstetric Haemorrhage.pdf\nContent: University Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East\n\nObstetric Haemorrhage Protocol: MP053\n\nDate agreed: April 2022\nAmendment: December 2023\nv3.1\n\nThis protocol includes:\n- Antepartum Hemorrhage\n- Placental Abruption\n- Placenta Praevia\n- Postpartum Hemorrhage\n- Women who decline blood products\n\nKey Principles:\nA protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.\n\nScope:\nThis protocol applies to all women who experience antepartum and/or postpartum hemorrhage, any women with Placenta Praevia, any woman with a diagnosis of placental abruption, and any woman who declines blood or blood products.\n\nResponsibilities:\nMidwives, Anaesthetists & Obstetricians:\n- To access, read, understand and follow this guidance\n- To use their professional judgment in application of this protocol\n\nManagement:\n- To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations\n- To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff\n- To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request\n\nAgreed Definitions of Obstetric Hemorrhage:\n- Minor Antepartum Hemorrhage\n- Major Antepartum Hemorrhage\n- Minor Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage\n- Major Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage\n- Massive Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage\n- Secondary Postpartum Hemorrhage\n- Volume is a guide\n\nAntepartum Hemorrhage (APH):\nCauses include normal physiological changes to the cervix, local conditions of the cervix, vagina, and vulva, mild trauma, placental abruption, placenta praevia, and vasa praevia. Management includes clinical review and assessment.\n\nPlacenta Praevia:\nAntenatal and day of delivery considerations for women with placenta praevia, including referral to a Consultant Obstetrician, documentation of placenta location, counseling on risks, and management of delivery.\n\nPostpartum Hemorrhage (PPH):\nRisk assessment and care planning during antenatal and intrapartum stages, including identification of risk factors, documentation, and communication of care plans. Effective communication and responsibilities are crucial for management.\n\nClear communication between medical staff is vital in managing obstetric hemorrhage. The labor ward coordinator should ensure important information is communicated clearly. In cases of major hemorrhage, the Obstetric Registrar and Anaesthetic Registrar should be contacted for immediate management. For home births, midwives should initiate emergency management and call for urgent transfer if needed. In cases of primary hemorrhage, basic measures should be taken to facilitate resuscitation. For major and massive hemorrhage, specific protocols should be followed, including summoning the correct team and initiating emergency management. Communication with the hematology department and regular monitoring of blood components are essential. In cases of secondary hemorrhage, antibiotics may be indicated, and surgical measures may be necessary if bleeding persists. Postnatal care for women who have had a hemorrhage should include close monitoring and follow-up. Women who decline blood products should be informed of the risks and have a plan in place. Antenatal care should involve developing a care plan with medical staff and religious advisors if needed. Each woman's individual choices regarding interventions should be respected. Regular monitoring of blood levels and iron stores is important throughout pregnancy.\n\nAn ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site. There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s Witness, and if any complication is noted during the antenatal period, the Consultant Obstetrician must be informed. A clear individual management plan should be documented in the maternal notes where blood products will be declined. All women who wish not to receive blood products should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist. It is important for experienced staff to provide care during labor and birth. Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered, and an FBC should be performed before discharge home. Accurate documentation is essential, and thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is arrested and coagulopathy is corrected. Debriefing is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team, and a 6-week follow-up appointment should be offered to discuss the events in more detail. A datix needs to be completed for all MOHs >1500ml.",
