Recurrent episodes of pelvic pain over the past 6 months.  \n2. Difficulty conceiving for the past 18 months despite regular unprotected intercourse.  \n\n---\n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n1. **Pelvic Pain:**  \n   - The pain is described as a dull ache, localized to the lower abdomen, radiating to the lower back.  \n   - It occurs intermittently, lasting 2-3 days at a time, and is not consistently related to her menstrual cycle.  \n   - The pain is exacerbated by physical activity and sexual intercourse.  \n   - She denies any associated fever, nausea, vomiting, or abnormal vaginal discharge.  \n\n2. **Difficulty Conceiving:**  \n   - Ms. Doe has been trying to conceive for 18 months without success.  \n   - She has a history of one prior pregnancy, which resulted in a full-term vaginal delivery 4 years ago.  \n   - She reports regular menstrual cycles (28-30 days) with moderate flow and no significant dysmenorrhea.  \n   - She denies any history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or abnormal Pap smears.  \n\n---\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  \n- No known history of endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy at age 18.  \n- No history of pelvic or abdominal surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12.  \n- Regular menstrual cycles.  \n- Gravida 1, Para 1 (1 full-term vaginal delivery).  \n- No history of miscarriages or terminations.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Occasional paracetamol for headaches.  \n- No current use of hormonal contraceptives or fertility medications.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Consumes alcohol socially (1-2 units per week).  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Works as a graphic designer, which involves prolonged sitting.  \n- Lives with her partner, who is in good health.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Ms. Doe is concerned that her pelvic pain may be related to endometriosis or another underlying condition affecting her fertility.  \n- She is anxious about her inability to conceive and is seeking guidance on potential investigations and treatments.  \n- She hopes to explore both medical and lifestyle interventions to improve her chances of conception.  \n\n---\n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General Examination:**  \n  - Well-appearing, no pallor or jaundice.  \n  - Vital signs: BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 16/min, afebrile.  \n\n- **Abdominal Examination:**  \n  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n  - No organomegaly.  \n\n- **Pelvic Examination:**  \n  - Speculum examination: Cervix appears healthy, no abnormal discharge.  \n  - Bimanual examination: Mild tenderness in the left adnexa, no palpable masses. Uterus is anteverted and normal in size.  \n\n---\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. **Possible Endometriosis:** Given the history of chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and difficulty conceiving, endometriosis is a likely differential diagnosis.  \n2. **Unexplained Infertility:** The patient meets the criteria for infertility (trying to conceive for >12 months without success), and further investigations are warranted.  \n\n---\n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess for endometriomas, ovarian cysts, or other pelvic pathology.  \n   - Hysterosalpingography (HSG) to evaluate tubal patency.  \n   - Day 3 serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and AMH levels to assess ovarian reserve.  \n   - Semen analysis for her partner.  \n\n2. **Pain Management:**  \n   - Trial of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain relief during episodes of pelvic pain.  \n   - Consideration of hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill) if endometriosis is confirmed.  \n\n3. **Fertility Support:**  \n   - Referral to a fertility specialist for further evaluation and potential interventions, such as ovulation induction or assisted reproductive technologies (ART).",
