Confirm via transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and serum hCG. TVS findings may include empty uterus, adnexal mass, or free fluid. - **Management Options:** - **Expectant:** For stable, asymptomatic patients with declining hCG. - **Medical:** Methotrexate if hCG <1500–5000 IU/L, no fetal cardiac activity, and patient meets criteria (e.g., no contraindications, agrees to avoid pregnancy for 3 months). - **Surgical:** Laparoscopy preferred (salpingectomy/salpingotomy) unless hemodynamically unstable (requires urgent laparotomy). - **Ruptured Ectopic:** Immediate ABCDE assessment, IV access, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion if needed, and urgent surgery. - **PUL:** Monitor hCG trends (48-hour intervals). Declining hCG suggests failing pregnancy; rising/plateauing hCG warrants further evaluation. - **Follow-Up:** Post-treatment hCG monitoring until negative. Early scan (6–7 weeks) in future pregnancies. Offer anti-D prophylaxis to Rh-negative patients. - **Patient Counseling:** Discuss future fertility risks, contraception, and emotional support. **Audit:** Ensure adherence to protocols and track outcomes\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
