### Summary:  
- **Ms. X (32yo, BMI 41, G5 P3)**:  
  - Presents with 6-week history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain.  
  - Associated symptoms: 3-month fatigue, occasional dizziness.  
  - No post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding.  
  - PMH: T2DM, HTN, iron deficiency anaemia, previous gestational diabetes.  
  - Surgical history: 2x C-section, ovarian cystectomy.  
  - Current medications: Metformin, lisinopril, PRN ferrous sulfate (non-compliant).  
  - Smokes 5 cigarettes/day.  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding**:  
  - Prolonged cycles (10â€“14 days) with flooding/clots, dull central pelvic pain radiating to lower back.  
  - Uterus bulky on exam (~12-week size).  
  - Plan: Tranexamic acid trial, Mirena IUD if endometrial biopsy normal.  
- **Anaemia**:  
  - Symptomatic fatigue, pale conjunctiva, poor oral iron tolerance.  
  - Plan: High-dose IV iron infusion, monitor Hb.  
- **Pelvic Pain/Structural Causes**:  
  - TVUS to assess fibroids/polyps; if found, discuss embolisation/myomectomy.  
  - Hysteroscopy + biopsy if endometrial pathology suspected.  
- **Lifestyle**:  
  - Weight loss referral (dietitian/bariatric team), smoking cessation counselling.  

### Plan:  
1. **Investigations**:  
   - FBC (anaemia), TVUS (endometrial/fibroid assessment), HbA1c (diabetes control).  
2. **Anaemia Management**:  
   - IV iron infusion, post-infusion Hb monitoring.  
3. **Bleeding/Pain Control**:  
   - Trial tranexamic acid during menses.  
   - Mirena IUD if biopsy normal.  
4. **Structural Evaluation**:  
   - Hysteroscopy + biopsy if TVUS suggests pathology.  
   - Fibroid management (embolisation/myomectomy) if confirmed.  
5. **Lifestyle**:  
   - Dietitian/bariatric referral, smoking cessation support.  
6. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Review in 2 weeks with results.  
   - Counsel on pregnancy risks (obesity, diabetes, prior CS).

### Summary (Ms. Y, 32yo, BMI 41, G5 P3, 18wks IVF pregnancy):  
- Presents with 2-day worsening right-sided abdominal pain (7/10) and dark red spotting.  
- Reduced fetal movements (subjective).  
- PMH: Preterm birth (32wks), placenta praevia, cervical incompetence (prior cerclage).  
- Ultrasound: Viable fetus, low-lying placenta, 5cm right adnexal cyst.  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Abdominal Pain/Spotting**:  
  - Exclude abruption/preterm labour: monitor contractions, fibronectin if indicated.  
  - Adnexal cyst: MRI for characterisation, surgical review if pain worsens.  
- **Placental Surveillance**:  
  - Repeat growth scan at 28wks (high-risk for FGR).  
  - Continue low-dose aspirin (preeclampsia prophylaxis).  
- **Patient Advice**:  
  - Pelvic rest, avoid lifting.  
  - Emergency presentation if bleeding/pain worsens.  

### Plan:  
1. **Acute Concerns**:  
   - Monitor for abruption/preterm labour (observations, fibronectin if needed).  
2. **Adnexal Cyst**:  
   - MRI for further evaluation.  
3. **Placental Monitoring**:  
   - Growth scan at 28wks, continue aspirin.  
4. **Patient Guidance**:  
   - Pelvic rest, emergency warning signs.  
5. **Follow-Up**:  
   - MDT planning (obstetrics/anaesthetics/neonatology).  
   - Growth scan in 4wks.
