A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter**  
**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. [Fictional Name], OB/GYN  
**Patient:** Ms. [Fictional Surname], 43-year-old female  

### **History of Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. [Surname] is a 43-year-old woman (BMI 21, weight 58 kg) with a history of two prior pregnancies (both vaginal deliveries, no complications) presenting with two primary concerns:  
1. **Recurrent postmenopausal bleeding** (last menstrual period 18 months ago, now experiencing intermittent spotting for 3 months).  
2. **Chronic pelvic pain** (dull, bilateral, worsening over the past 6 months, unrelated to activity or bowel movements).  

No associated weight loss, fever, or urinary/bowel symptoms. Denies dyspareunia but reports reduced libido.  

### **Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:**  
- **Medical:** Hypothyroidism (well-controlled on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily), no diabetes/hypertension.  
- **Surgical:** Appendectomy (age 20), bilateral breast reduction (age 35).  
- **Gynaecological:** Regular cycles prior to menopause, no history of STIs or abnormal smears.  
- **Obstetric:** G2P2 (both term deliveries, birth weights 3.2 kg and 3.5 kg).  

### **Drug History:**  
- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic pain (no regular analgesia).  
- No hormonal therapy.  

### **Allergies:**  
- Penicillin (rash).  

### **Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Works as a schoolteacher; married with two teenage children.  
- Exercises 3x/week (yoga and swimming).  

### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about "cancer" due to postmenopausal bleeding and family history (mother had endometrial cancer at 60).  
- **Concerns:** Anxiety about invasive tests.  
- **Expectations:** Wants "clear answers" and prefers "minimally invasive options if possible."  

---

### **Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor/jaundice.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic Exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Small amount of dark blood in vault; cervix appears normal.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged (8–10 weeks size), non-tender; no adnexal masses.  
- **PR Exam:** No rectal masses, blood-stained glove.  

---

### **Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Transvaginal ultrasound:** Assess endometrial thickness and uterine morphology.  
   - **Endometrial biopsy:** Rule out hyperplasia/malignancy given postmenopausal bleeding and family history.  
   - **CA-125:** If pelvic pain persists (low threshold for further imaging).  

2. **Interim Advice:**  
   - Avoid NSAIDs until biopsy results (risk of masking inflammation).  
   - Pelvic floor physiotherapy referral for chronic pain component.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review results in 2 weeks. If biopsy abnormal, discuss hysteroscopy ± hysterectomy.  
   - Counselling on HRT risks/benefits if symptoms suggest genitourinary syndrome of menopause.  

**Prognosis:** Reassured that most causes of postmenopausal bleeding are benign but emphasized importance of exclusionary testing.
