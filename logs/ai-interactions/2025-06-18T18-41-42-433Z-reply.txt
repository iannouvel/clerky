After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless new concerns arise (random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion). - **Diagnosis without GTT:** Urgent referral if glucose >11.0mmol/L (any time) or fasting ≥5.6mmol/L. - **Management:** For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Insulin adjustment and close monitoring are required for those on corticosteroids or during labor (VRIII may be needed). - **Postpartum care:** Adjust insulin doses post-birth; monitor glucose closely, especially when breastfeeding. - **Monitoring & emergencies:** Regular ultrasounds, fetal heart exams, and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Diabetic emergencies require immediate attention. - **Vaccination:** Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidelines; prioritize GDM patients. - **Audit:** Ensure regular audits to maintain care standards",
