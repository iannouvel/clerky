  "transcript": "Here’s a fictional but clinically authentic SBAR clerking for an advanced maternal age pregnancy, using British medical terminology and abbreviations:  \n\n---  \n\n### **SBAR CLERKING – ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE PREGNANCY**  \n\n#### **SITUATION:**  \n- **Patient:** 42yo G2P1 (previous SVD, no complications)  \n- **Gestation:** 32+4 weeks  \n- **Presenting concern:** Reduced fetal movements (RFM) x 24hrs, no contractions/PROM.  \n- **Key issue:** AMA (advanced maternal age) pregnancy, now with RFM – requires urgent assessment.  \n\n#### **BACKGROUND:**  \n- **PMH:** Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 50mcg OD), diet-controlled GDM (OGTT 28w: Fasting 5.2, 2hr 8.1).  \n- **Obstetric Hx:**  \n  - Previous delivery: SVD at 39w, live male (3.6kg), no PPH/PP complications.  \n  - Current pregnancy: Booked at 10w, USS confirmed EDD.  \n  - Anomaly scan (20w): Normal. Growth scan (28w): EFW 50th centile, normal Dopplers.  \n- **Medications:** Levothyroxine 50mcg OD, folic acid 5mg OD, vitamin D 1000IU OD.  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA.  \n- **Social:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (stopped in pregnancy), works as teacher.  \n\n#### **ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **Observations:**  \n  - BP 128/76, HR 82, afebrile, SpO₂ 98% RA.  \n  - Urine dip: No protein/glucose.  \n- **Abdominal exam:**  \n  - SFH 32cm (consistent with dates), longitudinal lie, cephalic presentation.  \n  - FM palpated x1 during exam but subjectively reduced.  \n  - No uterine tenderness/irritability.  \n- **CTG:** Baseline 140, variability 5-10, no decelerations, accelerations present (reassuring).  \n- **USS (urgent bedside):**  \n  - EFW ~2.1kg (~60th centile), normal AFI, UA Dopplers normal.  \n  - Placenta posterior, no retroplacental clot.  \n- **Differential:**  \n  1. Normal variant (reduced maternal perception).  \n  2. Early placental insufficiency (low risk given normal scans/Dopplers).  \n  3. Maternal anxiety/stress contributing.  \n\n#### **RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Immediate:**  \n   - Admit for FM monitoring + repeat CTG in 4/24.  \n   - Consider steroids (Betamethasone 12mg IM x2 doses 24h apart) if concerns re: preterm delivery (not currently indicated).  \n2. **Monitoring:**  \n   - Daily CTG + FM chart.  \n   - Repeat growth scan in 2/52 if ongoing concerns.  \n3. **Investigations:**  \n   - FBC, U&Es, LFTs, TFTs (routine in AMA/GDM).  \n   - HbA1c (GDM monitoring).  \n4. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Consultant-led antenatal clinic (next appt booked at 34w).  \n   - Discussed AMA risks (↑PTL, PET, GDM, fetal growth restriction) – patient aware.  \n5. **Patient counselling:**  \n   - Advised to report any further RFM immediately.  \n   - Reassured re: current reassuring findings.  \n\n---  \n\n**Notes:**  \n- Abbreviations: SVD (spontaneous vaginal delivery), PROM (premature rupture of membranes), OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), EFW (estimated fetal weight), UA (umbilical artery), AFI (amniotic fluid index), PET (pre-eclampsia), PTL (preterm labour).  \n- Reflects realistic UK hospital workflow (CTG/USS for RFM, AMA protocols).  \n- Adjust as needed for educational purposes.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like any refinements!",
