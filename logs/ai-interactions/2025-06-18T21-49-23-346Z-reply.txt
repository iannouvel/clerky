Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact post-birth, and early milk expression for separated mothers. Assess feeding within the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger or cup feeding for supplementation to avoid teat confusion. Formula supplementation should be limited and medically justified. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide instructions on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is preferred in hospitals. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, and safe sleeping practices (e.g., cot by the bed). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments and refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). Breastfed babies should feed 8â€“12 times daily, with early feeding cues prioritized. Formula use may reduce milk supply and increase infection/allergy risks. Medical supplementation requires careful management to maintain breastfeeding",
