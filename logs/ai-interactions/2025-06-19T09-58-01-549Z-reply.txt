  "transcript": "SITUATION: 41-year-old G3P2 at 41+5 weeks gestation requiring assessment for post-term pregnancy management\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Kowalski is now 5 days past her expected delivery date based on accurate dating from early pregnancy scan at 8 weeks. She has experienced irregular Braxton Hicks contractions but no established labor. Baby movements remain good but she reports they feel different - less frequent rolling movements, more sharp jabs. She is anxious about going overdue and worried about stillbirth risk which she has read about online. Previous pregnancies were uncomplicated - first delivered spontaneously at 40+2 weeks (3.6kg), second at 39+6 weeks (3.4kg). This pregnancy has been straightforward with normal anomaly scan, negative glucose tolerance test, and normal growth scans. She is keen to avoid induction if possible but understands risks of prolonged pregnancy. Partner is supportive but also anxious.\n\nASSESSMENT: Maternal vital signs normal: BP 125/78 mmHg, no proteinuria. Abdominal examination reveals cephalic presentation, 4/5 palpable per abdomen, estimated fetal weight 3.8kg. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 142 bpm, good variability, acceleration with movements. Cervical assessment shows Bishop score 4 (cervix 1cm dilated, 50% effaced, firm, posterior position, head -2 station). Amniotic fluid volume appears adequate clinically. Recent bloods including FBC normal. Fetal movements chart shows reassuring pattern over past week.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Post-term pregnancy requiring surveillance and delivery planning. Options discussed including expectant management with increased monitoring versus induction of labor. Given favorable obstetric history and current reassuring fetal condition, membrane sweeping performed to encourage spontaneous labor. If no spontaneous labor by 42+0 weeks, induction recommended given increased perinatal risks. Twice-weekly CTG monitoring and amniotic fluid assessment arranged. Patient counseled about when to seek urgent review (reduced movements, bleeding, rupture of membranes, contractions). Induction booked for 42+0 weeks with prostaglandin gel given unfavorable cervix. Return in 2 days for further assessment.",
