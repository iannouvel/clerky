  "transcript": "SITUATION: 35-year-old G4P2+1 at 28+5 weeks gestation with major placenta previa and recent bleeding episode requiring management\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Ahmed has known complete placenta previa diagnosed at 20-week anomaly scan, where placenta was noted to completely cover the cervical os. She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6Â°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.",
