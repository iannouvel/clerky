They are not \ndesigned to be prescriptive and you are not expected to use them in exclusion of \ndiscussions with senior colleagues. \n Evidence used to inform these guidelines had been drawn from published clinical \nreviews. Where applicable other references are quoted. \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 5 of 19 \n1 Definition, Presentation & Management Of Bartholin’s Cyst/Abscess \n1.1 Definition \n Bartholin’s cyst is the accumulation of sterile mucous within the 1.1.1\nBartholin’s gland following blockage of the gland duct. These are a pair \nof glands located at the lower third of the vulva at the entrance of the \nvagina.   \n Bartholin’s abscess is infection of the sterile mucous that leads to an 1.1.2\nacute inflammatory reaction and abscess formation within the gland.   \n1.2 Presentation \n Bartholin’s cyst is soft, fluctuant painless mass that could have been 1.2.1\npresent for a variable length time, usually between 1-3cm in size.   \n Bartholin’s abscess present with acute onset of pain, inflammation and 1.2.2\nswelling of the Bartholin’s gland.   \n Examination findings may include one or all of the following: warm, 1.2.3\ntender, soft or fluctuant mass in the lower medial labia majora or lower \nvestibular area.   \n There may be occasional surrounding erythema or purulent discharge. 1.2.4\n Presenting women may find it difficult to walk, sit and experience 1.2.5\ndyspareunia. \n\n  Source: Best Practice and Research Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology (2009) \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 6 of 19 \n1.3 Management of Bartholin’s cyst \n Management of a Bartholin’s cyst is not essential unless there is a risk 1.3.1\nof it becoming an abscess. \n For some women seen in GAU or GOPD where the cyst is persistent it 1.3.2\nmay be necessary to have surgical intervention. \n Outpatient management with the WORD catheter maybe appropriate 1.3.3\nin woman aged less than 40. If for marsupialisation book onto a \nsubsequent day case list via admissions. Bartholin’s cysts are not an \nemergency and should rarely need treatment on a CEPOD list. \n Women over the age of 40 should have marsupialisation and biopsy of 1.3.4\nthe gland under G.A due to the increased risk of adenocarcinorma. \n1.4 Management of Bartholin’s abscess \n \n Surgical intervention will be required for women with a Bartholin’s 1.4.1\nabscess. \n These women should be seen and assessed in GAU (RSCH) using the 1.4.2\nSIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) assessment on the \ngynaecology CEPOD pathway (Appendix A) which must be completed. \n Providing the woman does not score on the SIRS assessment, they are 1.4.3\nsuitable for outpatient management. \n Outpatient Management with WORD catheter using local anaesthetic 1.4.4\nor marsuplisation under general anaesthetic should only be offered to \nwoman under 40. The Registrar on call /consultant should be involved \nin the discussion process (see proforma Appendix B). \n Should the patient choose outpatient management, this may be 1.4.5\nperformed as soon as possible by a clinician experienced in the Word \nprocedure. \n Should the patient choose marsupialisation, this should be booked 1.4.6\nusing the gynaecology CEPOD pathway. \n For similar patients seen in A&E at PRH once a full assessment has been 1.4.7\ncarried out, it is the registrar’s responsibility to complete the following: \n Liaise with the GAU at RSCH ext 4013 to arrange CEPOD booking \n Complete consent form and complete CEPOD pathway  \n Transfer patient notes to GAU (L11 Tower Block) o \n Provide the patient with adequate information regarding \nprocedure and admission times  \n Patient to be discharged from A&E  \n Inform on call gynae registrar at RSCH on bleep 8618 \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 19 \n For women showing signs of cellulitis admission for IV antibiotics 1.4.8\nshould be considered and the patient should be put on the regular \nCEPOD list prescribe Co-amoxiclav 1.2g IV TDS or Clindamycin 300mg IV \nQDS (if penicillin allergic)   \n \n2 Outpatient Management \n2.1 The Word Bartholin’s Gland Catheter is made of medical grade silicone. The \n catheter provides an accessory duct to permanently drain an obstructed gland. \n2.2 Method for insertion of WORD Bartholin’s Catheter \n Clean and prepare area over the cyst or abscess (chlohexidine can be 2.2.1\nused if desired \n Infiltrate skin over the cyst or abscess with local anaesthetic at the 2.2.2\nintroitus at or behind the hymenal ring. \n Use 1% lidocaine plain- 20mls or alternatively 5mls Lidocaine +_ 2.2.3\nPudendal Block. \n Use number 11 blade to make a 5mm stab incision into the abscess of 2.2.4\nanaesthetised skin. \n Insert the sterile catheter into the incision and inflate the bulb with 2-2.2.5\n3cc of sterile water. Use minimal amount of water to ensure catheter \nwill be expelled or fall out by normal activity. Do not inflate with air. \n Tuck the stem of the catheter into the vagina, allowing freedom of 2.2.6\nmovement and activity. \n Leave the catheter in place for 4-6 weeks, until epithelialization of new 2.2.7\norifice is complete. \n Patient should expect discharge around the stem. 2.2.8\n If catheter falls out before 2 weeks consider re-assessment, if prior to 2.2.9\nepithelisation –treatment may be considered, if after epithelisation – \nno need for treatment. \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 19 \n \n2.3 Discharge Planning and Follow up Care \n A discharge letter is to be formulated for direct discharge from L11- 2.3.1\nGynaecology Assessment Unit. \n Patients should be given the patient information leaflet regarding 2.3.2\nprocedure and a follow up appointment. \n At the 4 to 6 week appointment (in the Gynae Assessment Unit) 2.3.3\nremove catheter by inserting a needle into the catheter and \nwithdrawing the water. Gently withdraw the catheter from the incision \nand dispose of catheter in clinical waste bin. \n If there is any concern then the patient should be discussed with the \n2.3.4\non-call registrar or consultant \n3 Marsupialisation of Bartholins cyst (inpatient) \n \n3.1 The recommended method of treatment is incision, drainage and  \n marsupialisation of the gland by a trained clinician.   \n \n3.2 Microbiology swab of the abscess must be taken at time of procedure.   \n \n3.3 For post-menopausal women drainage and biopsy of the gland must be  \n considered to exclude carcinoma of the gland.   \n \n3.4 Wound packs/wicks should not be used. In exceptional circumstances where a \n clinician decides a pack is necessary the rationale should be clearly \n documented in the operation notes with instruction of its removal. \n \n3.5 Surgical intervention must not be attempted on an already discharged \n Bartholin’s abscess. \n \n3.6 Routine antibiotics are not indicated in the management of Bartholin’s abscess, \n unless in the presence of cellulitis or suspected co-existing PID/STI. If clinically \n indicated prescribe: Co-amoxiclav 625mg PO TDS  or Clindamycin 300mg QDS \n (if penicillin allergic)   \n \n3.7 Patient that present with recurrent Bartholin’s abscess (3 or more) after \n treatment should be should be screened for diabetes mellitus and operated on \n by senior clinician.   \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 9 of 19 \n3.8 Excision of the gland should only be attempted by a consultant and is very \n rarely indicated   \n\nSource: Best Practice and Research \nClinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology \n(2009) \n\n4 Definition, Presentation & Management Of Vulval Abscess \n \n4.1 Definition Vulval abscesses commonly originate as simple infections that \n develop in the vulval skin or subcutaneous tissues superficial to the fascia.   \n4.2 Presentation \n Painful vulval mass or fullness, difficulty in mobilisation and sexual 4.2.1\nintercourse, very occasionally fever.   \n Findings include a tender often fluctuant vulval mass with surrounding 4.2.2\nerythema.   \n4.3 Management \n Conservative Management: Small vulval abscesses less than 2cm that 4.3.1\nhave yet to point to the skin surface can be treated conservatively with \nanalgesia and warm compress on an outpatient basis. Antibiotics are \nnot recommended for these women.   \n Surgical Management: Abscesses > 2cm should be managed by incision 4.3.2\nand drainage. These women should be seen and assessed in GAU as per \nthe Bartholin’s abscess guidance ئج \n5 Monitoring Compliance \n \nPlease refer to the Monitoring and Auditing document for details on monitoring compliance \nfor this protocol \n \n1.4.10 Wound packs/wicks should not be used. In exceptional circumstances \nwhere a clinician decides a pack is necessary the rationale should be \nclearly documented in the operation notes with instruction of its \nremoval. \n1.4.11 Surgical intervention must not be attempted on an already discharged \nBartholin’s abscess. \n1.4.12 Routine antibiotics are not indicated in the management of Bartholin’s \nabscess, unless in the presence of cellulitis or suspected co-existing \nPID/STI. If clinically indicated prescribe: \no Augmentin 625mg PO TDS \no Clindamycin 300mg QDS (if penicillin allergic) \n1.4.13 Patient that present with recurrent Bartholin’s abscess (3 or more) \nshould be should be screened for diabetes mellitus and operated on by \na senior clinician. \n1.4.14 Excision of the gland should only be attempted by a consultant. \n\nSource: Best Practice and Research Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology (2009) \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust 7 \nGynaecology Protocol: GP006 Bartholin’s cyst/abscess & vulval abscess \nDate Agreed: May 2012 Review Date: May 2014 \n\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 10 of 19 \nGAU database can be used to evaluate the Fast-track CEPOD service \n6 References \n \n1.

These are a pair \\nof glands located at the lower third of the vulva at the entrance of the \\nvagina.   \\n Bartholin’s abscess is infection of the sterile mucous that leads to an 1.1.2\\nacute inflammatory reaction and abscess formation within the gland.   \\n1.2 Presentation \\n Bartholin’s cyst is soft, fluctuant painless mass that could have been 1.2.1\\npresent for a variable length time, usually between 1-3cm in size.   \\n Bartholin’s abscess present with acute onset of pain, inflammation and 1.2.2\\nswelling of the Bartholin’s gland.   \\n Examination findings may include one or all of the following: warm, 1.2.3\\ntender, soft or fluctuant mass in the lower medial labia majora or lower \\nvestibular area.   \\n There may be occasional surrounding erythema or purulent discharge. 1.2.4\\n Presenting women may find it difficult to walk, sit and experience 1.2.5\\ndyspareunia. \\n\\n  Source: Best Practice and Research Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology (2009) \\n\\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 6 of 19 \\n1.3 Management of Bartholin’s cyst \\n Management of a Bartholin’s cyst is not essential unless there is a risk 1.3.1\\nof it becoming an abscess. \\n For some women seen in GAU or GOPD where the cyst is persistent it 1.3.2\\nmay be necessary to have surgical intervention. \\n Outpatient management with the WORD catheter maybe appropriate 1.3.3\\nin woman aged less than 40. If for marsupialisation book onto a \\nsubsequent day case list via admissions. Bartholin’s cysts are not an \\nemergency and should rarely need treatment on a CEPOD list. \\n Women over the age of 40 should have marsupialisation and biopsy of 1.3.4\\nthe gland under G.A due to the increased risk of adenocarcinorma. \\n1.4 Management of Bartholin’s abscess \\n \\n Surgical intervention will be required for women with a Bartholin’s 1.4.1\\nabscess. \\n These women should be seen and assessed in GAU (RSCH) using the 1.4.2\\nSIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) assessment on the \\ngynaecology CEPOD pathway (Appendix A) which must be completed. \\n Providing the woman does not score on the SIRS assessment, they are 1.4.3\\nsuitable for outpatient management. \\n Outpatient Management with WORD catheter using local anaesthetic 1.4.4\\nor marsuplisation under general anaesthetic should only be offered to \\nwoman under 40. The Registrar on call /consultant should be involved \\nin the discussion process (see proforma Appendix B). \\n Should the patient choose outpatient management, this may be 1.4.5\\nperformed as soon as possible by a clinician experienced in the Word \\nprocedure. \\n Should the patient choose marsupialisation, this should be booked 1.4.6\\nusing the gynaecology CEPOD pathway. \\n For similar patients seen in A&E at PRH once a full assessment has been 1.4.7\\ncarried out, it is the registrar’s responsibility to complete the following: \\n Liaise with the GAU at RSCH ext 4013 to arrange CEPOD booking \\n Complete consent form and complete CEPOD pathway  \\n Transfer patient notes to GAU (L11 Tower Block) o \\n Provide the patient with adequate information regarding \\nprocedure and admission times  \\n Patient to be discharged from A&E  \\n Inform on call gynae registrar at RSCH on bleep 8618 \\n\\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 19 \\n For women showing signs of cellulitis admission for IV antibiotics 1.4.8\\nshould be considered and the patient should be put on the regular \\nCEPOD list prescribe Co-amoxiclav 1.2g IV TDS or Clindamycin 300mg IV \\nQDS (if penicillin allergic)   \\n \\n2 Outpatient Management \\n2.1 The Word Bartholin’s Gland Catheter is made of medical grade silicone. The \\n catheter provides an accessory duct to permanently drain an obstructed gland. \\n2.2 Method for insertion of WORD Bartholin’s Catheter \\n Clean and prepare area over the cyst or abscess (chlohexidine can be 2.2.1\\nused if desired \\n Infiltrate skin over the cyst or abscess with local anaesthetic at the 2.2.2\\nintroitus at or behind the hymenal ring. \\n Use 1% lidocaine plain- 20mls or alternatively 5mls Lidocaine +_ 2.2.3\\nPudendal Block. \\n Use number 11 blade to make a 5mm stab incision into the abscess of 2.2.4\\nanaesthetised skin. \\n Insert the sterile catheter into the incision and inflate the bulb with 2-2.2.5\\n3cc of sterile water. Use minimal amount of water to ensure catheter \\nwill be expelled or fall out by normal activity. Do not inflate with air. \\n Tuck the stem of the catheter into the vagina, allowing freedom of 2.2.6\\nmovement and activity. \\n Leave the catheter in place for 4-6 weeks, until epithelialization of new 2.2.7\\norifice is complete. \\n Patient should expect discharge around the stem. 2.2.8\\n If catheter falls out before 2 weeks consider re-assessment, if prior to 2.2.9\\nepithelisation –treatment may be considered, if after epithelisation – \\nno need for treatment. \\n\\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 19 \\n \\n2.3 Discharge Planning and Follow up Care \\n A discharge letter is to be formulated for direct discharge from L11- 2.3.1\\nGynaecology Assessment Unit. \\n Patients should be given the patient information leaflet regarding 2.3.2\\nprocedure and a follow up appointment. \\n At the 4 to 6 week appointment (in the Gynae Assessment Unit) 2.3.3\\nremove catheter by inserting a needle into the catheter and \\nwithdrawing the water. Gently withdraw the catheter from the incision \\nand dispose of catheter in clinical waste bin. \\n If there is any concern then the patient should be discussed with the \\n2.3.4\\non-call registrar or consultant \\n3 Marsupialisation of Bartholins cyst (inpatient) \\n \\n3.1 The recommended method of treatment is incision, drainage and  \\n marsupialisation of the gland by a trained clinician.   \\n \\n3.2 Microbiology swab of the abscess must be taken at time of procedure.   \\n \\n3.3 For post-menopausal women drainage and biopsy of the gland must be  \\n considered to exclude carcinoma of the gland.   \\n \\n3.4 Wound packs/wicks should not be used. In exceptional circumstances where a \\n clinician decides a pack is necessary the rationale should be clearly \\n documented in the operation notes with instruction of its removal. \\n \\n3.5 Surgical intervention must not be attempted on an already discharged \\n Bartholin’s abscess. \\n \\n3.6 Routine antibiotics are not indicated in the management of Bartholin’s abscess, \\n unless in the presence of cellulitis or suspected co-existing PID/STI. If clinically \\n indicated prescribe: Co-amoxiclav 625mg PO TDS  or Clindamycin 300mg QDS \\n (if penicillin allergic)   \\n \\n3.7 Patient that present with recurrent Bartholin’s abscess (3 or more) after \\n treatment should be should be screened for diabetes mellitus and operated on \\n by senior clinician.   \\n\\nManagement of Bartholin’s cyst/abscess GP006 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 9 of 19 \\n3.8 Excision of the gland should only be attempted by a consultant and is very \\n rarely indicated   \\n\\nSource: Best Practice and Research \\nClinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology \\n(2009) \\n\\n4 Definition, Presentation & Management Of Vulval Abscess \\n \\n4.1 Definition Vulval abscesses commonly originate as simple infections that \\n develop in the vulval skin or subcutaneous tissues superficial to the fascia.   \\n4.2 Presentation \\n Painful vulval mass or fullness, difficulty in mobilisation and sexual 4.2.1\\nintercourse, very occasionally fever.   \\n Findings include a tender often fluctuant vulval mass with surrounding 4.2.2\\nerythema.   \\n4.3 Management \\n Conservative Management: Small vulval abscesses less than 2cm that 4.3.1\\nhave yet to point to the skin surface can be treated conservatively with \\nanalgesia and warm compress on an outpatient basis. Antibiotics are \\nnot recommended for these women.   \\n Surgical Management: Abscesses > 2cm should be managed by incision 4.3.2\\nand drainage. These women should be seen and assessed in GAU as per \\nthe Bartholin’s abscess guidance ئج \\n5 Monitoring Compliance \\n \\nPlease refer to the Monitoring and Auditing document for details on monitoring compliance \\nfor this protocol \\n \\n1.4.10 Wound packs/wicks should not be used.
