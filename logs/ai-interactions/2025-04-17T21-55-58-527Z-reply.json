She describes occasional **intermenstrual bleeding** and mild **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began insidiously 6 months ago.  \n- Bleeding is heavier than her usual pattern, with occasional clots.  \n- No recent changes in contraception (not currently using hormonal contraception).  \n- No recent weight fluctuations or stressors identified.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Hypertension** (well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg OD).  \n- **Prediabetes** (diet-controlled, last HbA1c 5.9%).  \n- **Obesity** (BMI 27.5, advises minimal physical activity due to work demands).  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Appendectomy** (age 22).  \n- No prior gynecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynecological History:**  \n- **Gravida 1, Para 1** (spontaneous vaginal delivery at age 30).  \n- **Menarche** at age 12, previously regular 28-day cycles.  \n- No history of STIs or abnormal smears (last Pap smear 2 years ago, normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for menstrual pain (no regular NSAID use).  \n- No hormonal therapies.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- **Occupation:** Office manager (sedentary role).  \n- **Alcohol:** 5–7 units/week.  \n- **Smoking:** Never.  \n- **Exercise:** Minimal (walks 1–2x/week).  \n- **Diet:** High in processed foods, admits to difficulty maintaining weight.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about \"hormonal imbalance\" or \"early menopause.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Fear of cancer due to family history (mother had breast cancer at 60).  \n- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on cause of bleeding and reassurance/management options.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or signs of chronic illness.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal; no lesions or discharge.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender; adnexa clear.  \n- **No signs of infection or structural abnormalities.**  \n\n**Investigations Ordered:**  \n1. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Findings consistent with **endometrial thickening (12 mm)**; no focal lesions.  \n2. **Endometrial Biopsy:** Scheduled to exclude atypia (per GTG 2014 guidelines for abnormal bleeding in perimenopausal women with BMI >25).  \n3. **Hb:** 11.8 g/dL (mild anemia).  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Likely endometrial hyperplasia** (non-atypical suspected given risk factors: age, obesity, anovulatory cycles).  \n- Differential includes **polyp, hormonal dysfunction, or (less likely) malignancy**.  \n\n**Management Plan (Per GTG 2014 Guidelines):**  \n1. **Progesterone Therapy:**  \n   - **Oral progestin (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg OD for 14 days/cycle)** to regulate shedding.  \n   - Discuss LNG-IUS (Mirena) as longer-term option if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia.  \n2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**  \n   - Weight loss counseling (target 5–10% reduction to lower estrogen-driven endometrial stimulation).  \n   - Increase physical activity (goal: 150 min/week moderate exercise).  \n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat ultrasound/biopsy in 3–6 months to assess response.  \n   - Urgent referral if biopsy shows atypia (would warrant hysterectomy discussion given age).  \n4. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Reassured that hyperplasia without atypia is manageable but requires monitoring.  \n   - Advised to report worsening bleeding/pain.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await biopsy results.  \n- Schedule nutritionist consult for weight management.  \n- Follow-up in 4 weeks.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional), OB/GYN.  \n**Date:** [Fictional date].  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional case for testing purposes only.
