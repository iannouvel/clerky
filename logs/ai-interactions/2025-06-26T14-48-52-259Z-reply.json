She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] mp053-obstetric-haemorrhage-pdf\nTitle: MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage\nContent: University Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East

\n• Any women with Placenta Praevia \n• Any woman with a diagnosis of placental abruption \n• Any woman who declines blood or blood products \n \nResponsibilities \n \nMidwives, Anaesthetists & Obstetricians: \n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \n• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol \nManagement: \n• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations \n• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \n• To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 5 of 23 \n\n Agreed Definitions of Obstetric Haemorrhage \n \n1.1 Minor Antepartum Haemorrhage \nEpisode of bleeding of less than 50mls from the genital tract during pregnancy \n(after 24 weeks gestation) and prior to birth of the baby \n1.2 Major Antepartum Haemorrhage \nEpisode of bleeding of more than 50mls from the genital tract during \npregnancy (after 24 weeks gestation) and prior to birth of the baby or when \nclinical signs are suggestive of significant concealed bleeding (see below for \nsigns and symptoms) \n1.3 Minor Primary Postpartum Haemorrhage \nThe loss of 500-1000mls of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the \nbirth of a baby \n1.4 Major Primary Postpartum Haemorrhage \nThe loss of over 1000mls of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the \nbirth of a baby \n1.5 Massive Primary Postpartum haemorrhage \nThe sudden and continuing blood loss of 2 litres or more \nOr \n50% blood volume loss within 3 hours or at a rate of 150ml/min \n1.6 Secondary Postpartum Haemorrhage \nAbnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and up \nto 12 weeks post-delivery. \n1.7 Volume is a guide: \nThe mother’s individual weight and clinical situation, signs and symptoms will \nneed to be taken into consideration as to when to escalate for more \nassistance, actions and procedures \n1.8 Requirement to document fluid balance \nAll women who have an antenatal or postpartum haemorrhage must have fluid \nbalance monitoring commenced and documented on a chart which is secured \nin the maternal notes. See individual charts below for details \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 6 of 23 \n\n Antepartum Haemorrhage (APH) \n2.1 Causes \n2.1.1 Normal physiological changes to cervix \n2.1.2 Local conditions of cervix, vagina and vulva including polyps and \nerosions \n2.1.3 Mild trauma caused by \nSexual intercourse \nCervical sweeps \n2.1.4 Placental abruption \n2.1.5 Placenta praevia \n2.1.6 Vasa Praevia \n2.2 Minor APH \nA minor APH will usually present as mild bleeding from the genital tract with \nno other clinical symptoms \n2.3 Management \nIf a pregnant person experiences vaginal bleeding then they should be invited \ninto MAU for a clinical review which should include maternal observations, \nfetal heart auscultation and abdominal palpation and an assessment of the \nvolume and appearance of the vaginal loss. Consider a CTG after 26 weeks as \nper protocol. \n2.4 Minor APH \n \n2.4.1 Women presenting with spotting who are no longer bleeding and \nwhere placenta praevia has been excluded can go home after a \nreassuring initial clinical assessment. All women with APH heavier \nthan spotting and women with ongoing bleeding should be admitted \nfor observations \n2.4.2 Tocolysis is contraindicated in placental abruption and is ‘relatively \ncontraindicated’ in ‘mild haemorrhage’ due to placenta praevia. \n2.4.3 Anti-D Ig should be given to all non-sensitised RhD-negative women \nafter any presentation with APH, independent of whether routine \nantenatal prophylactic anti-D has been administered. In the non- \nsensitised RhD-negative woman in the event of recurrent vaginal \nbleeding after 20+0 weeks of gestation, anti-D Ig should be given at a \nminimum of 6-weekly intervals. \n2.5 Major APH \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 7 of 23 \n\nActions: \nRunner to take bloods to \nlab \nCommence MEOWS chart \nReview placental site \nCommence CTG \nAssess fetal presentation \n2.5.1 Placental abruption \nThe diagnosis is clinical and ultrasound is poor at confirming or \nexcluding the presence of a retro-placental clot. \n2.5.2 Symptoms include severe abdominal pain and bleeding which is \nvariable in amount. The uterus is hard and tender on palpation with \nno relaxation between contractions and may be large for dates. Pulse \nand BP may suggest hidden blood loss, or remain normal. \n \n2.5.3 The fetal heart should be electronically monitored – typically the CTG \nwill be abnormal, with signs of hyperstimulation and in some cases a \nsinusoidal pattern. \n2.6 Management of Major APH \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 8 of 23 \n\n2.6.1 Oxytocin (10iu/IM) should be given for the third stage of labour, \nfollowed by a Oxytocin infusion. \n2.6.2 If the abruption has been severe, postnatal management should be \nas described in the major haemorrhage protocol. \n \n Placenta Praevia \n \n3.1 Antenatal \n3.1.1 All women with placenta praevia confirmed at the 32 week scan \nshould be referred to the next available Consultant Obstetrician \nAntenatal Clinic, or their named consultant if already under the care \nof a Consultant. \n3.1.2 The grade of placenta praevia or the distance between the leading \nedge of the placenta to the internal os should be documented on the \nUSS report confirming the placenta praevia, the position of the \nplacenta should also be clearly stated e.g. anterior / posterior. \n3.1.3 Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia or a low-lying \nplacenta in the third trimester should be counselled about the \nrisks of preterm delivery and obstetric haemorrhage. \n3.1.4 Women with a known placenta praevia who experience any bleeding, \nincluding spotting, contractions or pain should attend hospital for an \nobstetric review. \n3.1.5 Women with a history of previous caesarean section seen to \nhave an anterior Placenta praevia at 32 weeks should be \ndiscussed with a consultant radiologist and obstetrician to \nevaluate the risk of placenta accreta and to decide on the \nneed for an MRI. If there is a high risk of placenta accreta then \nthe responsible consultant obstetrician will initiate and \ncoordinate the multi disciplinary plans for delivery. \n3.1.6 Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia should be offered an \nelective caesarean at 38 weeks to avoid the spontaneous onset of \nlabour and subsequent risk of bleeding. \n3.1.7 Women with placenta praevia with repeated episodes of bleeding \nshould be admitted and timing of delivery offered earlier than 38 to \navoid the risk of a major antenatal obstetric haemorrhage and \nemergency caesarean section. Decisions on timing of delivery should \ninvolve the wider MDT and include anaesthetics and neonatology. \n3.1.8 Whilst an in-patient, regular* Group and Save samples should be \ntaken in case of acute bleed. \n*For women who have never had a blood / blood product transfusion - every 7 \ndays. For women with unusual antibodies in her blood or who has ever \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 9 of 23 \n\nhad a blood / blood product transfusion - seek advice from the \ntransfusion department (the sample can be valid for as little as 24 \nhours) \n \n3.1.9 Caesarean sections for placenta praevia should be discussed with the \nwider MDT including anaesthetics and neonatology, and should \nconsider whether the case should be on Level 13 or Level 5 theatres. If \nthe case requires Level 5 theatres then it should be booked using the \nComplex Obstetric Delivery booking form in MP050 LSCS \n \n3.2 Day of Delivery \n3.2.1 For all LSCS for all major placenta praevia the Consultant Obstetrician \nmust be present in theatre, as the primary or secondary surgeon. \n \n3.2.1.1 The Anaesthetist will ensure good venous access, cell salvage \nand preparations for conversion to general anaesthetic. A \nNeonatology Registrar should be present for delivery \n3.2.1.2 Immediate bolus of oxytocin at delivery and oxytocin infusion \npost-delivery. All other uterotonics to be readily available. \n \n3.3 Emergency delivery \n3.3.1 For emergency delivery of known placenta praevia cases the \nConsultant Obstetrician covering labour ward should attend. . The \nmethod of anaesthesia should be decided by the LW anaesthetist \nafter discussion with the on-call Consultant Anaesthetist. \n3.3.2 A Neonatology Registrar should be present for delivery \n Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) \n \n4.1 Antenatal risk assessment and care planning \nRisk factors may present antenatally or intrapartum: care plans must be \nmodified when risk factors are present. Clinicians must be aware of the risk \nfactors for PPH and should take these into account when counselling women \nabout place of delivery. \n4.2 At Booking: \nCommunity midwives should be aware of the risk factors associated with a PPH: \n4.2.1 Previous PPH (ascertain cause and EBL) \n4.2.2 Previous LSCS \n4.2.3 Parity >3 \n4.2.4 Obesity (>30BMI) \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 10 of 23 \n\n4.3 Document any identified risks clearly in the maternal notes and offer a referral \nfor an appointment with a Consultant Obstetrician during pregnancy. An \nindividualised care plan should be made following discussion with the woman \nincluding recommendation for an actively managed 3\nrd\n stage of labour. \n \n4.4 During pregnancy: \nClinicians should be aware of the following that are associated risk factors for a PPH: \n4.4.1 Multiple pregnancy \n4.4.2 Pre eclampsia \n4.4.3 Placenta Praevia \n4.4.4 Previous PPH \n4.4.5 Should these occur during pregnancy this should be clearly \ndocumented in the maternal notes and a referral made for an \nappointment with a Consultant Obstetrician. An individualised care \nplan should be made following discussion with the woman including \nrecommendation for an actively managed 3\nrd\n stage of labour. \n4.5 Intrapartum: \nClinicians should be aware of the following that are associated risk factors for a PPH: \n4.5.1 Emergency LSCS \n4.5.2 Elective LSCS \n4.5.3 Augmented labour \n4.5.4 Prolonged / arrested labour (any stage) \n4.5.5 Retained placenta \n4.5.6 Episiotomy / Lacerations \n4.5.7 Instrumental delivery \n4.5.8 Should these occur during labour / birth a review by the on call \nRegistrar should be requested. An individualised care plan should be \nmade following discussion with the woman including \nrecommendation for an actively managed 3\nrd\n stage of labour. \n \n4.6 Communication & Responsibilities \nEffective communication is the key to management of an obstetric haemorrhage. \nClear lines of communication between the Consultant Obstetrician, Consultant \nAnaesthetist, haematologist, blood transfusion personnel and Labour Ward co- \nordinator are vital; and all discussions should be documented in the maternal \nnotes. the PPH proforma on badgernet should be filled in with times ,people \npresent in attendance communication with team members ,events, drugs used, \nuse of cell saver and procedures undertaken to arrest bleeding \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 11 of 23 \n\n4.7 The labour ward co-ordinator is responsible for ensuring basic information \nabout the relevant medical, social and obstetric history and events prior to the \nhaemorrhage are communicated clearly to the midwifery, obstetric and \nanaesthetic staff arriving (use SBAR). \n \n4.8 Once an initial assessment of major PPH has been made: \n• The Obstetric Registrar is responsible for ensuring the Consultant \nObstetrician has been contacted, communicating with haematology/ \nblood transfusion as required and commencing immediate emergency \nresuscitative management \n• The Anaesthetic Registrar is responsible for ensuring the Consultant \nAnaesthetist has been contacted, communicating with haematology/ \nblood transfusion as required and commencing immediate emergency \nresuscitative management. When a haemorrhage is continuing the \nanaesthetic team should request additional equipment from the main \ntheatre suite (via: RSCH ODP bleep 8180; PRH ODP bleep118); HEMAQ, \nadditional fluid warmer/rapid infuser {level I}, cell saver, USS (Sonosite) as \nrequired \n• The Labour Ward Co-ordinator is responsible for co-ordinating staff, \ncalling the blood transfusion lab with woman’s details (RSCH ext 4577 \nbleep 8286 & PRH ext 8218 bleep 103 with a summary of the clinical \nscenario, woman’s name, DOB, Hospital number and woman’s weight), \nensuring blood samples are sent and considering needs of the partner \nand relatives of the woman. This can be delegated to an appropriate \nmember of the team but the overall responsibility lies with the LW \ncoordinator. \n4.9 Home birth & Haemorrhage: The Midwife is expected to: \n4.9.1 Initiate immediate emergency resuscitative management and assess \nthe cause of the bleeding. \n4.9.2 Call for help by phoning 999 asking for a cat 1 transfer with paramedic \nambulance. \n4.9.3 Inform labour ward of events and ETA. \n4.9.4 Use emergency drugs to stop bleeding in event of uterine atony and \nconsider bimanual compression \n4.9.5 Cannulate using wide bore cannula and commence IV fluids \nwhere/when possible \n4.9.6 Transfer to maternity unit as soon as possible \n \n Primary PPH \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 12 of 23 \n\n5.1 Primary PPH involving an estimated blood loss of 500–1000 ml (and in the \nabsence of clinical signs of shock) should prompt basic measures (close \nmonitoring, intravenous access, full blood count, group and screen) to \nfacilitate resuscitation should it become necessary. \n5.2 Management of a woman with a Primary PPH: \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 13 of 23 \n\n MAJOR and MASSIVE Obstetric Haemorrhage (trigger phrases) \n \nManagement of a woman with a Major Primary Postpartum haemorrhage \nIf a woman with primary PPH is continuing to bleed after an estimated blood loss of \n1000ml (or has clinical signs of shock or tachycardia associated with a smaller \nestimated loss), the emergency call should be made with the trigger phrase: ‘Major \nObstetric Haemorrhage’ which will summon the correct assistance and prompt a full \nprotocol of measures to achieve resuscitation and haemostasis. \n6.1 Team summoned: Obstetric Registrar, obstetric anaesthetist, OPA on for \nlabour ward, LW coordinator, CCA / porter. Haematology department and \nblood transfusion department will be made aware and on standby to provide \nsupport. \n6.2 When blood loss exceeds 1500mls and haemorrhage is continuing a blood loss \nof over 2000mls may be anticipated and the massive haemorrhage protocol \nmay be triggered. \n6.3 THE MOH CALL (Management of a woman with a Massive Primary Postpartum \nhaemorrhage)- \nIf a woman has a sudden and continuing blood loss of 2000mls or more \nor 50% blood volume loss within 3 hours or at a rate of 150ml/min the \nemergency call should be made with the trigger phrase: ‘Massive Obstetric \nHaemorrhage’ \n6.4 Call 2222 and state “Major Obstetric Haemorrhage” giving location. \nSwitchboard will then generate a call out to the following: \nObstetric Consultant*(by telephone/LWC) \nAnaesthetic Consultant* (by telephone/LWC) \nObstetric Registrars \nObstetric SHO \nAnaesthetic Registrar* \nODA \nSenior midwife (labour ward coordinator)* \nHaematology BMS \nPorter \nNeonatal SHO \nOn call Haematologist \n\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 14 of 23 \n\n6.5 Flowchart to show management of Major and Massive Obstetric Haemorrhage \nErgometrine \nCarboprost \nConsider initial drugs: \nOxytocin \nTranexamic Acid \n\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 15 of 23 \n\n6.6 Haematological targets whilst bleeding continues \n \n6.6.1 Haemoglobin > 8 g/dl \n6.6.2 PT and APTT (INR and KCR) <1.5 x control mean \n6.6.3 Platelets >50 x 10\n9\n/l or >100 x 10\n9\n/l for multiple/CNS trauma \nFibrinogen greater than 2g/l \n6.6.4 Blood can be sent for ROTEM (if available) analysis which will give a \nquicker more accurate estimate of the need for clotting products \n \n6.7 Procedure for urgent access to blood and blood products including portering \narrangements: \n6.7.1 Senior team (Registrar, Anaesthetist or LW co-ordinator) should \ncommunicate with each other about the need for requesting blood. \n6.7.2 The labour ward coordinator is responsible for contacting the \nTransfusion Laboratory/on-call haematologist informing that there is \na major (obstetric) haemorrhage, and providing the following \ninformation \n6.7.3 Women’s identity /approximate weight \n6.7.4 Degree of urgency for red cells \n• stat (2 units of O neg blood) \n• 10 minutes (group specific) \n• 40 minutes (cross matched) \n \n7.4 Continue repeating FBC and coagulation hourly whilst blood loss is ongoing and always \nfollowing the transfusion of plasma components and/or platelets. ABG should be sent \nevery 45mins \n7.5 Platelets will be issued after 12 units of red cells (or approximately 1.5 x blood volume) \nhave been transfused. Further FFP, cryoprecipitate and platelets will be issued in \naccordance with coagulation results: \n7.7.1 FFP (12-15ml/kg) if PT or APTT/INR or KCR >1.5 \n7.7.2 cryoprecipitate (1.5 unit/10kg) if fibrinogen <1.0g/l \n7.7.3 platelets, 1 or 2 pools, depending on count and target \n \n7.8 Consider tranexamic acid \n7.9 Recombinant factor VII a therapy should be based on the results of coagulation (90mcg/kg \nresponds within 15 – 30minutes provided there is fibrinogen) \n \n7.10 Note: Good communication between the clinical team and the haematology staff and regular \nhaematological monitoring provides the basis for timely blood component support. All \ncommunication must be documented in the maternal notes \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 16 of 23 \n\n Management of secondary PPH: \n \n7.1 Secondary PPH is often associated with endometritis and antibiotics are \nclinically indicated: \n• Cefuroxime 1.5g IV TDS and metronidazole 500mg IV TDS switching to \noral, when able to co-amoxiclav 625mg PO TDs \n• If penicillin allergic use: clindamycin 900mg IV TDS and gentamicin 5mg \n/kg stat IV (maximum dose 450mg) \n7.2 Surgical measures will be undertaken if there is excessive or continuing \nbleeding despite antibiotic treatment, or if there are obvious retained \nproducts. \n7.3 A senior obstetrician will be involved in decisions and performance of any \nevacuation of retained products of conception as these women have a high risk \nof uterine perforation. Ultrasound directed removal of retained products can \nbe helpful. \n Postnatal Care of Women who have had an Obstetric Haemorrhage \n \n8.1 Women who have had a PPH of 500-1000mls \n \n8.1.1 Transfer to postnatal ward only when woman is stable \n8.1.2 If a woman reports symptoms of bleeding or being unwell \nobservations (PV loss, uterine tone, temperature, blood pressure and \npulse) should be undertaken immediately. These should be \ndocumented in the maternal notes. If observations are abnormal the \nobstetric team should be asked to review the woman urgently. \n8.1.3 If a woman has been commenced on a fluid balance chart this should \nbe continued 24 hours post-delivery. If output is abnormal the \nobstetric team should be asked to review the woman urgently. \n8.1.4 Women should have an FBC on day 2 or prior to discharge if discharge \nbefore day 2. \n8.1.5 Midwifery review and plan of care prior to discharge documented in \nthe maternal notes \n8.2 Women who have had a PPH of over 1000mls (or are symptomatic) \n \n8.2.1 Transfer to postnatal ward only when woman is stable and transfer is \nagreed with the obstetric team \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 17 of 23 \n\n8.2.2 On postnatal ward women should have daily observations of PV loss, \nuterine tone, temperature, blood pressure and pulse. If a woman \nreports symptoms of bleeding or being unwell these observations \nshould be undertaken immediately. These should be documented in \nthe maternal notes. If observations are abnormal the obstetric team \nshould be asked to review the woman urgently. \n8.2.3 A fluid balance chart should be continued for 24 hours post delivery. If \noutput is abnormal the obstetric team should be asked to review the \nwoman urgently. \n8.2.4 Women should be informed about signs of bleeding, expected \namount of PV bleeding in the postnatal period and when they should \ninform the midwife of concerns. \n8.2.5 Women should have an FBC on day 2 or prior to discharge if discharge \nbefore day 2. \n8.2.6 Women should be given an opportunity to discuss their labour and \nbirth and events around their haemorrhage. Ideally the obstetrician or \nmidwife providing care during the haemorrhage should see the \nwoman prior to her discharge. If this is not possible the discussion can \nbe with a senior obstetrician or midwife familiar with the events (from \nthe documentation at the time). Implications for future pregnancies \nand births should be discussed. All discussions should be documented \nin the maternal notes. Women should be offered the ‘Birth Stories’ \nservice and this should be documented in the maternal postnatal \nnotes. \n8.2.7 Women should be reviewed and plan of care prior to discharge; if \nwomen’s observations are normal (and FBC within normal limits) this \ncan be undertaken by a midwife. If observations are abnormal, Hb \nlevels are under 10 or the woman remains symptomatic this review \nshould be undertaken by a member of the obstetric team. All reviews \nand plan of care should be documented in the maternal notes \n \n Women Who Decline Blood Products \n \n9.1 Please refer to Trust Policy on ‘Administration of Blood and Blood Products’ \nfor further guidance. \n9.2 Major obstetric haemorrhage is often unpredictable and can become life \nthreatening in a short time. In most cases blood transfusion can save the \nwoman’s life and very few women refuse blood transfusion in these \ncircumstances. If it is thought likely that a woman may do so, the management \nof major haemorrhage should be considered in advance. \n \n9.3 Booking \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 18 of 23 \n\n9.3.1 All women are normally asked their religious beliefs, and should also \nbe asked if they have any objections to blood transfusion. If a woman \nis a Jehovah’s Witness or likely to refuse blood transfusion for other \nreasons, this should be noted in the case notes \n9.3.2 All women who are likely to refuse a blood transfusion should make \nan informed choice with the risks clearly discussed and documented. \nAdvice should be that if major haemorrhage occurs there is an \nincreased risk that hysterectomy will be required. The woman should \nunderstand other non blood products are often accepted by \nJehovah’s Witnesses but it is imperative that they understand, if all \nelse fails, and blood is needed, refusal at this stage could cost them \ntheir life \n9.3.3 Women making an informed choice to refuse a blood transfusion in \nany circumstances should be advised to deliver in a unit which has all \nfacilities for prompt management of haemorrhage, including \nhysterectomy \n9.3.4 Women and their partners should be given written information about \nrefusing a blood transfusion \n \n9.4 Antenatal Care \n9.4.1 Consultant obstetric and anaesthetic involvement is necessary during \nthe antenatal period in order to develop an individualised care plan \ntogether with the woman, her husband and family, and, if necessary, \nreligious advisors, should any difficulty occur \n9.4.2 ALL WOMEN REFUSING BLOOD TRANSFUSION AT BOOKING MUST \nBE REFERRED TO SEE A CONSULTANT OBSTETRICIAN AND \nANAESTHETIST \n9.4.3 No absolute rules regarding blood products exist. Each woman / \nJehovah's Witness decides whether she wishes to accept the following \ninterventions as a matter of individual choice. It is therefore \nimportant to discuss with each woman whether or not any of these \nare acceptable: \n9.4.3.1 Blood Cell salvage (intra and post-operative) \n9.4.3.2 Blood ‘fractions’ of plasma or cellular components (e.g. \nalbumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, novoseven) \n9.4.3.3 Epidural blood patch \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 19 of 23 \n\n9.4.4 The woman’s blood group and antibody status should be checked in \nthe usual way and the haemoglobin and serum ferritin should be \nchecked regularly. Haematinics should be given throughout pregnancy \nto maximise iron stores \n9.4.5 An ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site \n9.4.6 There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s \nWitness: some Witnesses will donate blood before surgery for \nsubsequent auto-transfusion if necessary though others consider that \nthis too is forbidden by their religion. Blood storage should not be \nsuggested to pregnant women, as the amounts of blood required to \ntreat major obstetric haemorrhage are far in excess of the amount \nthat could be donated during pregnancy \n9.4.7 If any complication is noted during the antenatal period the \nConsultant Obstetrician must be informed \n9.4.8 A clear individual management plan should be documented in the \nmaternal notes where blood products will be declined. This should be \nfollowing a discussion with the consultant obstetrician and \nanaesthetist (and senior midwife as required) where a fully informed \ndecision has been made by the woman. The woman must be \nsupported in her informed choice. \n \n9.5 Labour and Birth \n \n9.5.1 All women who are known to have stated a wish not to receive blood \nproducts should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist \n9.5.2 It is therefore important that, whenever possible, each woman in \nlabour should have a Consultant Obstetrician as the lead professional, \nand that they are informed of and be involved in their care. Should an \nelective caesarean section or other operative delivery be required, \nthis should be conducted by a Consultant Obstetrician and \nAnaesthetist \n9.5.3 Experienced staff should provide care as per for all labour and births \n9.5.4 Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered (stat dose and \nsubsequent infusion). The woman should not be left alone for at least \nan hour after delivery \n \n9.6 Postnatal \n9.6.1 An FBC should be performed prior to discharge home \n9.6.2 When the mother is discharged from hospital, she should be advised \nto report promptly if she has any concerns about bleeding during the \npuerperium. \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 20 of 23 \n\n Intraoperative Cell Salvage \n \n10.1 Early warning is required for set up and use during operative delivery. It can \nusually be organised for elective delivery but is more difficult for emergency \nprocedures out of hours. \n10.2 Cell salvage has a place for cases where major haemorrhage is predicted, when \nthere is time to set up the kit and staffs (familiar with its use) are at hand. \n10.3 If cell salvage is being considered the senior anaesthetist should contact the \nODP on call or main theatre manager to discuss feasibility and availability of \ntrained staff. \n10.4 Suction is used until baby and placenta are delivered The suction from the cell \nsaver is used for the rest of the procedure. Cell saved blood should be re- \ninfused through a leucocyte filter which minimises the risk of adverse reactions \ndue to fetal cells (almost all will be filtered out) \n10.5 In an Rh negative mother, if the cell salvaged blood has been transfused \n1500iu of anti D needs to be administered and a Kleihauer test needs to be \nperformed 1 hour post transfusion to confirm if further dosses are required. \nPlease document on blood request form that cell salvage has been used. \n \n Interventional Radiology \n11.1 When it is used \nInterventional radiology (IR) is used electively for women with suspected placenta \naccreta or multiple previous CS and an anterior placenta. On an emergency basis the \ncases would usually be PPH, peripartum hysterectomy and ongoing bleeding, or \nperineal haematomas. There are also numerous other rarer scenarios of ongoing \nbleeding where there is scope for using interventional radiology. This is always on a \ncase by case decision between the obstetrician and the interventional radiologists and \nalways at consultant level. \n11.2 The process \nIt will always be consultant led decision and process and as there is no formal on call \nservice for obstetrics from the radiologists it is limited by availability. Consultant \nobstetrician and interventional radiologist (via radiology dpt) must discuss each case \non an individual basis and agree a management plan. \n11.3 Where it will happen \nIR is only available at RSCH and can be carried out in the interventional \nradiology suite in the Barry Building or in main theatre or in obstetric theatre \ndepending on the case. If it can be anticipated that IR may be used then PRH \nwomen should ideally be delivered at RSCH with a multidisciplinary plan. In \nsome emergencies there may be scope to transfer a woman from PRH (if \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 21 of 23 \n\nwoman is stable and after discussion with consultant obstetrician and \ninterventional radiologist) \n11.4 Interventional radiology management flow chart: \n\n Documentation \n \nAccurate documentation is essential. All staff involved should provide written \ndocumentation of actions undertaken within the maternity notes. The Obstetric \nhaemorrhage form within the maternity notes should be used as a summary of events. \n12.1 It is important to record: \n12.1.1 The staff in attendance and the time they arrived \n12.1.2 The sequence of events \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 22 of 23 \n\n12.1.3 The time of administration of different pharmacological agents given, \ntheir timing and sequence \n12.1.4 The time of surgical intervention, where relevant \n12.1.5 The condition of the mother throughout the different steps \n12.1.6 The timing of the fluid and blood products given \n12.1.7 Fluid balance chart \n12.2 Use the MEOWs chart to document maternal observations \n\n Thromboprophylaxis \n \nOnce the bleeding is arrested and the coagulopathy corrected, thromboprophylaxis is \nessential due to the high risk of thrombosis. The timing of thromboprophylaxis \nadministration should be considered in conjunction with the anaesthetic team, with \nconsideration of the timing of removal of an epidural/spinal. Pneumatic compression \ndevices should be used in addition in the HDU/ITU setting, and where \nthromboprophylaxis is contraindicated. \n \n Debriefing \n \nThis is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team who was \ninvolved at the time of events at the earliest opportunity. \nWomen should routinely be offered a 6 week follow-up appointment to discuss the \nevents in more detail, and to discuss any implications for future pregnancies. \n \n DATIX \nA datix needs to be completed for all MOHs >1500ml \n \n References \n\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 23 of 23 \n\n Appendix A – Refusal of Blood or Blood Products for any reason \n(Including Jehovah’s Witness) \n \nUnit Number: \nPatient Surname: \nFirst Names: \nDate of Birth: \nAddress: \nPostcode: \n\nThe following form is to be read and signed by the Woman (Patient): \n1 The clinician is here to help you.

  "response": "Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been referred to a Consultant Obstetrician Antenatal Clinic as per guideline 3.1.1 (all women with placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks should be referred).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.1 requires referral to a Consultant Obstetrician for placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing the need for MRI to evaluate placenta accreta given the patient's history of two previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa (if applicable).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.5 states that women with previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa should be evaluated for placenta accreta with MRI.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on the risks of preterm delivery and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the rationale for elective cesarean at 36-37 weeks.  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.3 recommends counseling women with placenta previa about risks and delivery planning.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a Group and Save sample has been taken every 7 days (if no prior transfusion) or more frequently (if prior transfusion or unusual antibodies).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.8 specifies regular Group and Save monitoring for inpatients with placenta previa.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the Consultant Obstetrician is present in theater for the planned cesarean section (if not already planned).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.2.1 mandates Consultant Obstetrician presence for major placenta previa cesarean sections.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about blood transfusion risks/benefits and discuss cell salvage options (if applicable).  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.4.3 discusses patient counseling on blood product alternatives.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a MEOWS chart has been commenced for fluid balance monitoring.  \n   Reason: Guideline 1.8 requires fluid balance documentation for all women with obstetric hemorrhage.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer a postnatal debriefing and follow-up appointment to discuss the hemorrhage and implications for future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: Guideline 8.2.6 recommends postnatal discussions and Birth Stories service referral.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting whether the anesthetic team has discussed cell salvage availability for the planned cesarean.  \n   Reason: Guideline 10.1 mentions cell salvage for predicted major hemorrhage but is not critical in this case.  \n\nOverall, the clinical note is well-aligned with the guideline, but the above adjustments would further improve compliance and patient care. The most critical gaps are the Consultant referral, placenta accreta evaluation, and patient counseling.",

She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\\n\\nGuideline:\\n[ID] mp053-obstetric-haemorrhage-pdf\\nTitle: MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage\\nContent: University Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust

Consider a CTG after 26 weeks as \\nper protocol. \\n2.4 Minor APH \\n \\n2.4.1 Women presenting with spotting who are no longer bleeding and \\nwhere placenta praevia has been excluded can go home after a \\nreassuring initial clinical assessment. All women with APH heavier \\nthan spotting and women with ongoing bleeding should be admitted \\nfor observations \\n2.4.2 Tocolysis is contraindicated in placental abruption and is ‘relatively \\ncontraindicated’ in ‘mild haemorrhage’ due to placenta praevia. \\n2.4.3 Anti-D Ig should be given to all non-sensitised RhD-negative women \\nafter any presentation with APH, independent of whether routine \\nantenatal prophylactic anti-D has been administered. In the non- \\nsensitised RhD-negative woman in the event of recurrent vaginal \\nbleeding after 20+0 weeks of gestation, anti-D Ig should be given at a \\nminimum of 6-weekly intervals. \\n2.5 Major APH \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 7 of 23 \\n\\nActions: \\nRunner to take bloods to \\nlab \\nCommence MEOWS chart \\nReview placental site \\nCommence CTG \\nAssess fetal presentation \\n2.5.1 Placental abruption \\nThe diagnosis is clinical and ultrasound is poor at confirming or \\nexcluding the presence of a retro-placental clot. \\n2.5.2 Symptoms include severe abdominal pain and bleeding which is \\nvariable in amount. The uterus is hard and tender on palpation with \\nno relaxation between contractions and may be large for dates. Pulse \\nand BP may suggest hidden blood loss, or remain normal. \\n \\n2.5.3 The fetal heart should be electronically monitored – typically the CTG \\nwill be abnormal, with signs of hyperstimulation and in some cases a \\nsinusoidal pattern. \\n2.6 Management of Major APH \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 8 of 23 \\n\\n2.6.1 Oxytocin (10iu/IM) should be given for the third stage of labour, \\nfollowed by a Oxytocin infusion. \\n2.6.2 If the abruption has been severe, postnatal management should be \\nas described in the major haemorrhage protocol. \\n \\n Placenta Praevia \\n \\n3.1 Antenatal \\n3.1.1 All women with placenta praevia confirmed at the 32 week scan \\nshould be referred to the next available Consultant Obstetrician \\nAntenatal Clinic, or their named consultant if already under the care \\nof a Consultant. \\n3.1.2 The grade of placenta praevia or the distance between the leading \\nedge of the placenta to the internal os should be documented on the \\nUSS report confirming the placenta praevia, the position of the \\nplacenta should also be clearly stated e.g. anterior / posterior. \\n3.1.3 Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia or a low-lying \\nplacenta in the third trimester should be counselled about the \\nrisks of preterm delivery and obstetric haemorrhage. \\n3.1.4 Women with a known placenta praevia who experience any bleeding, \\nincluding spotting, contractions or pain should attend hospital for an \\nobstetric review. \\n3.1.5 Women with a history of previous caesarean section seen to \\nhave an anterior Placenta praevia at 32 weeks should be \\ndiscussed with a consultant radiologist and obstetrician to \\nevaluate the risk of placenta accreta and to decide on the \\nneed for an MRI. If there is a high risk of placenta accreta then \\nthe responsible consultant obstetrician will initiate and \\ncoordinate the multi disciplinary plans for delivery. \\n3.1.6 Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia should be offered an \\nelective caesarean at 38 weeks to avoid the spontaneous onset of \\nlabour and subsequent risk of bleeding. \\n3.1.7 Women with placenta praevia with repeated episodes of bleeding \\nshould be admitted and timing of delivery offered earlier than 38 to \\navoid the risk of a major antenatal obstetric haemorrhage and \\nemergency caesarean section. Decisions on timing of delivery should \\ninvolve the wider MDT and include anaesthetics and neonatology. \\n3.1.8 Whilst an in-patient, regular* Group and Save samples should be \\ntaken in case of acute bleed. \\n*For women who have never had a blood / blood product transfusion - every 7 \\ndays. For women with unusual antibodies in her blood or who has ever \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 9 of 23 \\n\\nhad a blood / blood product transfusion - seek advice from the \\ntransfusion department (the sample can be valid for as little as 24 \\nhours) \\n \\n3.1.9 Caesarean sections for placenta praevia should be discussed with the \\nwider MDT including anaesthetics and neonatology, and should \\nconsider whether the case should be on Level 13 or Level 5 theatres.

When a haemorrhage is continuing the \\nanaesthetic team should request additional equipment from the main \\ntheatre suite (via: RSCH ODP bleep 8180; PRH ODP bleep118); HEMAQ, \\nadditional fluid warmer/rapid infuser {level I}, cell saver, USS (Sonosite) as \\nrequired \\n• The Labour Ward Co-ordinator is responsible for co-ordinating staff, \\ncalling the blood transfusion lab with woman’s details (RSCH ext 4577 \\nbleep 8286 & PRH ext 8218 bleep 103 with a summary of the clinical \\nscenario, woman’s name, DOB, Hospital number and woman’s weight), \\nensuring blood samples are sent and considering needs of the partner \\nand relatives of the woman. This can be delegated to an appropriate \\nmember of the team but the overall responsibility lies with the LW \\ncoordinator. \\n4.9 Home birth & Haemorrhage: The Midwife is expected to: \\n4.9.1 Initiate immediate emergency resuscitative management and assess \\nthe cause of the bleeding. \\n4.9.2 Call for help by phoning 999 asking for a cat 1 transfer with paramedic \\nambulance. \\n4.9.3 Inform labour ward of events and ETA. \\n4.9.4 Use emergency drugs to stop bleeding in event of uterine atony and \\nconsider bimanual compression \\n4.9.5 Cannulate using wide bore cannula and commence IV fluids \\nwhere/when possible \\n4.9.6 Transfer to maternity unit as soon as possible \\n \\n Primary PPH \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 12 of 23 \\n\\n5.1 Primary PPH involving an estimated blood loss of 500–1000 ml (and in the \\nabsence of clinical signs of shock) should prompt basic measures (close \\nmonitoring, intravenous access, full blood count, group and screen) to \\nfacilitate resuscitation should it become necessary. \\n5.2 Management of a woman with a Primary PPH: \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage (RSCH PRH only) MP053 \\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 13 of 23 \\n\\n MAJOR and MASSIVE Obstetric Haemorrhage (trigger phrases) \\n \\nManagement of a woman with a Major Primary Postpartum haemorrhage \\nIf a woman with primary PPH is continuing to bleed after an estimated blood loss of \\n1000ml (or has clinical signs of shock or tachycardia associated with a smaller \\nestimated loss), the emergency call should be made with the trigger phrase: ‘Major \\nObstetric Haemorrhage’ which will summon the correct assistance and prompt a full \\nprotocol of measures to achieve resuscitation and haemostasis. \\n6.1 Team summoned: Obstetric Registrar, obstetric anaesthetist, OPA on for \\nlabour ward, LW coordinator, CCA / porter. Haematology department and \\nblood transfusion department will be made aware and on standby to provide \\nsupport. \\n6.2 When blood loss exceeds 1500mls and haemorrhage is continuing a blood loss \\nof over 2000mls may be anticipated and the massive haemorrhage protocol \\nmay be triggered. \\n6.3 THE MOH CALL (Management of a woman with a Massive Primary Postpartum \\nhaemorrhage)- \\nIf a woman has a sudden and continuing blood loss of 2000mls or more \\nor 50% blood volume loss within 3 hours or at a rate of 150ml/min the \\nemergency call should be made with the trigger phrase: ‘Massive Obstetric \\nHaemorrhage’ \\n6.4 Call 2222 and state “Major Obstetric Haemorrhage” giving location. \\nSwitchboard will then generate a call out to the following: \\nObstetric Consultant*(by telephone/LWC) \\nAnaesthetic Consultant* (by telephone/LWC) \\nObstetric Registrars \\nObstetric SHO \\nAnaesthetic Registrar* \\nODA \\nSenior midwife (labour ward coordinator)* \\nHaematology BMS \\nPorter \\nNeonatal SHO \\nOn call Haematologist \\n\\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 14 of 23 \\n\\n6.5 Flowchart to show management of Major and Massive Obstetric Haemorrhage \\nErgometrine \\nCarboprost \\nConsider initial drugs: \\nOxytocin \\nTranexamic Acid \\n\\nUniversity Sussex Hospital’s NHS Trust East Page 15 of 23 \\n\\n6.6 Haematological targets whilst bleeding continues \\n \\n6.6.1 Haemoglobin > 8 g/dl \\n6.6.2 PT and APTT (INR and KCR) <1.5 x control mean \\n6.6.3 Platelets >50 x 10\\n9\\n/l or >100 x 10\\n9\\n/l for multiple/CNS trauma \\nFibrinogen greater than 2g/l \\n6.6.4 Blood can be sent for ROTEM (if available) analysis which will give a \\nquicker more accurate estimate of the need for clotting products \\n \\n6.7 Procedure for urgent access to blood and blood products including portering \\narrangements: \\n6.7.1 Senior team (Registrar, Anaesthetist or LW co-ordinator) should \\ncommunicate with each other about the need for requesting blood. \\n6.7.2 The labour ward coordinator is responsible for contacting the \\nTransfusion Laboratory/on-call haematologist informing that there is \\na major (obstetric) haemorrhage, and providing the following \\ninformation \\n6.7.3 Women’s identity /approximate weight \\n6.7.4 Degree of urgency for red cells \\n• stat (2 units of O neg blood) \\n• 10 minutes (group specific) \\n• 40 minutes (cross matched) \\n \\n7.4 Continue repeating FBC and coagulation hourly whilst blood loss is ongoing and always \\nfollowing the transfusion of plasma components and/or platelets.

Ultrasound directed removal of retained products can \\nbe helpful. \\n Postnatal Care of Women who have had an Obstetric Haemorrhage \\n \\n8.1 Women who have had a PPH of 500-1000mls \\n \\n8.1.1 Transfer to postnatal ward only when woman is stable \\n8.1.2 If a woman reports symptoms of bleeding or being unwell \\nobservations (PV loss, uterine tone, temperature, blood pressure and \\npulse) should be undertaken immediately. These should be \\ndocumented in the maternal notes. If observations are abnormal the \\nobstetric team should be asked to review the woman urgently. \\n8.1.3 If a woman has been commenced on a fluid balance chart this should \\nbe continued 24 hours post-delivery. If output is abnormal the \\nobstetric team should be asked to review the woman urgently. \\n8.1.4 Women should have an FBC on day 2 or prior to discharge if discharge \\nbefore day 2. \\n8.1.5 Midwifery review and plan of care prior to discharge documented in \\nthe maternal notes \\n8.2 Women who have had a PPH of over 1000mls (or are symptomatic) \\n \\n8.2.1 Transfer to postnatal ward only when woman is stable and transfer is \\nagreed with the obstetric team \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 17 of 23 \\n\\n8.2.2 On postnatal ward women should have daily observations of PV loss, \\nuterine tone, temperature, blood pressure and pulse. If a woman \\nreports symptoms of bleeding or being unwell these observations \\nshould be undertaken immediately. These should be documented in \\nthe maternal notes. If observations are abnormal the obstetric team \\nshould be asked to review the woman urgently. \\n8.2.3 A fluid balance chart should be continued for 24 hours post delivery. If \\noutput is abnormal the obstetric team should be asked to review the \\nwoman urgently. \\n8.2.4 Women should be informed about signs of bleeding, expected \\namount of PV bleeding in the postnatal period and when they should \\ninform the midwife of concerns. \\n8.2.5 Women should have an FBC on day 2 or prior to discharge if discharge \\nbefore day 2. \\n8.2.6 Women should be given an opportunity to discuss their labour and \\nbirth and events around their haemorrhage. Ideally the obstetrician or \\nmidwife providing care during the haemorrhage should see the \\nwoman prior to her discharge. If this is not possible the discussion can \\nbe with a senior obstetrician or midwife familiar with the events (from \\nthe documentation at the time). Implications for future pregnancies \\nand births should be discussed. All discussions should be documented \\nin the maternal notes. Women should be offered the ‘Birth Stories’ \\nservice and this should be documented in the maternal postnatal \\nnotes. \\n8.2.7 Women should be reviewed and plan of care prior to discharge; if \\nwomen’s observations are normal (and FBC within normal limits) this \\ncan be undertaken by a midwife. If observations are abnormal, Hb \\nlevels are under 10 or the woman remains symptomatic this review \\nshould be undertaken by a member of the obstetric team. All reviews \\nand plan of care should be documented in the maternal notes \\n \\n Women Who Decline Blood Products \\n \\n9.1 Please refer to Trust Policy on ‘Administration of Blood and Blood Products’ \\nfor further guidance. \\n9.2 Major obstetric haemorrhage is often unpredictable and can become life \\nthreatening in a short time. In most cases blood transfusion can save the \\nwoman’s life and very few women refuse blood transfusion in these \\ncircumstances. If it is thought likely that a woman may do so, the management \\nof major haemorrhage should be considered in advance. \\n \\n9.3 Booking \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 18 of 23 \\n\\n9.3.1 All women are normally asked their religious beliefs, and should also \\nbe asked if they have any objections to blood transfusion. If a woman \\nis a Jehovah’s Witness or likely to refuse blood transfusion for other \\nreasons, this should be noted in the case notes \\n9.3.2 All women who are likely to refuse a blood transfusion should make \\nan informed choice with the risks clearly discussed and documented. \\nAdvice should be that if major haemorrhage occurs there is an \\nincreased risk that hysterectomy will be required. The woman should \\nunderstand other non blood products are often accepted by \\nJehovah’s Witnesses but it is imperative that they understand, if all \\nelse fails, and blood is needed, refusal at this stage could cost them \\ntheir life \\n9.3.3 Women making an informed choice to refuse a blood transfusion in \\nany circumstances should be advised to deliver in a unit which has all \\nfacilities for prompt management of haemorrhage, including \\nhysterectomy \\n9.3.4 Women and their partners should be given written information about \\nrefusing a blood transfusion \\n \\n9.4 Antenatal Care \\n9.4.1 Consultant obstetric and anaesthetic involvement is necessary during \\nthe antenatal period in order to develop an individualised care plan \\ntogether with the woman, her husband and family, and, if necessary, \\nreligious advisors, should any difficulty occur \\n9.4.2 ALL WOMEN REFUSING BLOOD TRANSFUSION AT BOOKING MUST \\nBE REFERRED TO SEE A CONSULTANT OBSTETRICIAN AND \\nANAESTHETIST \\n9.4.3 No absolute rules regarding blood products exist. Each woman / \\nJehovah's Witness decides whether she wishes to accept the following \\ninterventions as a matter of individual choice. It is therefore \\nimportant to discuss with each woman whether or not any of these \\nare acceptable: \\n9.4.3.1 Blood Cell salvage (intra and post-operative) \\n9.4.3.2 Blood ‘fractions’ of plasma or cellular components (e.g. \\nalbumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, novoseven) \\n9.4.3.3 Epidural blood patch \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 19 of 23 \\n\\n9.4.4 The woman’s blood group and antibody status should be checked in \\nthe usual way and the haemoglobin and serum ferritin should be \\nchecked regularly. Haematinics should be given throughout pregnancy \\nto maximise iron stores \\n9.4.5 An ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site \\n9.4.6 There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s \\nWitness: some Witnesses will donate blood before surgery for \\nsubsequent auto-transfusion if necessary though others consider that \\nthis too is forbidden by their religion. Blood storage should not be \\nsuggested to pregnant women, as the amounts of blood required to \\ntreat major obstetric haemorrhage are far in excess of the amount \\nthat could be donated during pregnancy \\n9.4.7 If any complication is noted during the antenatal period the \\nConsultant Obstetrician must be informed \\n9.4.8 A clear individual management plan should be documented in the \\nmaternal notes where blood products will be declined. This should be \\nfollowing a discussion with the consultant obstetrician and \\nanaesthetist (and senior midwife as required) where a fully informed \\ndecision has been made by the woman. The woman must be \\nsupported in her informed choice. \\n \\n9.5 Labour and Birth \\n \\n9.5.1 All women who are known to have stated a wish not to receive blood \\nproducts should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist \\n9.5.2 It is therefore important that, whenever possible, each woman in \\nlabour should have a Consultant Obstetrician as the lead professional, \\nand that they are informed of and be involved in their care. Should an \\nelective caesarean section or other operative delivery be required, \\nthis should be conducted by a Consultant Obstetrician and \\nAnaesthetist \\n9.5.3 Experienced staff should provide care as per for all labour and births \\n9.5.4 Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered (stat dose and \\nsubsequent infusion). The woman should not be left alone for at least \\nan hour after delivery \\n \\n9.6 Postnatal \\n9.6.1 An FBC should be performed prior to discharge home \\n9.6.2 When the mother is discharged from hospital, she should be advised \\nto report promptly if she has any concerns about bleeding during the \\npuerperium. \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 20 of 23 \\n\\n Intraoperative Cell Salvage \\n \\n10.1 Early warning is required for set up and use during operative delivery. It can \\nusually be organised for elective delivery but is more difficult for emergency \\nprocedures out of hours. \\n10.2 Cell salvage has a place for cases where major haemorrhage is predicted, when \\nthere is time to set up the kit and staffs (familiar with its use) are at hand. \\n10.3 If cell salvage is being considered the senior anaesthetist should contact the \\nODP on call or main theatre manager to discuss feasibility and availability of \\ntrained staff. \\n10.4 Suction is used until baby and placenta are delivered The suction from the cell \\nsaver is used for the rest of the procedure. Cell saved blood should be re- \\ninfused through a leucocyte filter which minimises the risk of adverse reactions \\ndue to fetal cells (almost all will be filtered out) \\n10.5 In an Rh negative mother, if the cell salvaged blood has been transfused \\n1500iu of anti D needs to be administered and a Kleihauer test needs to be \\nperformed 1 hour post transfusion to confirm if further dosses are required. \\nPlease document on blood request form that cell salvage has been used. \\n \\n Interventional Radiology \\n11.1 When it is used \\nInterventional radiology (IR) is used electively for women with suspected placenta \\naccreta or multiple previous CS and an anterior placenta. On an emergency basis the \\ncases would usually be PPH, peripartum hysterectomy and ongoing bleeding, or \\nperineal haematomas. There are also numerous other rarer scenarios of ongoing \\nbleeding where there is scope for using interventional radiology. This is always on a \\ncase by case decision between the obstetrician and the interventional radiologists and \\nalways at consultant level. \\n11.2 The process \\nIt will always be consultant led decision and process and as there is no formal on call \\nservice for obstetrics from the radiologists it is limited by availability. Consultant \\nobstetrician and interventional radiologist (via radiology dpt) must discuss each case \\non an individual basis and agree a management plan. \\n11.3 Where it will happen \\nIR is only available at RSCH and can be carried out in the interventional \\nradiology suite in the Barry Building or in main theatre or in obstetric theatre \\ndepending on the case. If it can be anticipated that IR may be used then PRH \\nwomen should ideally be delivered at RSCH with a multidisciplinary plan. In \\nsome emergencies there may be scope to transfer a woman from PRH (if \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 21 of 23 \\n\\nwoman is stable and after discussion with consultant obstetrician and \\ninterventional radiologist) \\n11.4 Interventional radiology management flow chart: \\n\\n Documentation \\n \\nAccurate documentation is essential. All staff involved should provide written \\ndocumentation of actions undertaken within the maternity notes. The Obstetric \\nhaemorrhage form within the maternity notes should be used as a summary of events. \\n12.1 It is important to record: \\n12.1.1 The staff in attendance and the time they arrived \\n12.1.2 The sequence of events \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 22 of 23 \\n\\n12.1.3 The time of administration of different pharmacological agents given, \\ntheir timing and sequence \\n12.1.4 The time of surgical intervention, where relevant \\n12.1.5 The condition of the mother throughout the different steps \\n12.1.6 The timing of the fluid and blood products given \\n12.1.7 Fluid balance chart \\n12.2 Use the MEOWs chart to document maternal observations \\n\\n Thromboprophylaxis \\n \\nOnce the bleeding is arrested and the coagulopathy corrected, thromboprophylaxis is \\nessential due to the high risk of thrombosis. The timing of thromboprophylaxis \\nadministration should be considered in conjunction with the anaesthetic team, with \\nconsideration of the timing of removal of an epidural/spinal. Pneumatic compression \\ndevices should be used in addition in the HDU/ITU setting, and where \\nthromboprophylaxis is contraindicated. \\n \\n Debriefing \\n \\nThis is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team who was \\ninvolved at the time of events at the earliest opportunity. \\nWomen should routinely be offered a 6 week follow-up appointment to discuss the \\nevents in more detail, and to discuss any implications for future pregnancies. \\n \\n DATIX \\nA datix needs to be completed for all MOHs >1500ml \\n \\n References \\n\\nObstetric Haemorrhage MP053 \\nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 23 of 23 \\n\\n Appendix A – Refusal of Blood or Blood Products for any reason \\n(Including Jehovah’s Witness) \\n \\nUnit Number: \\nPatient Surname: \\nFirst Names: \\nDate of Birth: \\nAddress: \\nPostcode: \\n\\nThe following form is to be read and signed by the Woman (Patient): \\n1 The clinician is here to help you.

The most critical gaps are the Consultant referral, placenta accreta evaluation, and patient counseling.\n\n--- Token Usage Report ---\nPrompt tokens: 9423\nCompletion tokens: 626\nTotal tokens: 10049\nEstimated cost: $0.005025",
