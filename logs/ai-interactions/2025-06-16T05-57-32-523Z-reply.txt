  "transcript": "SITUATION: 29-year-old G2P1 at 32+1 weeks gestation presenting with regular uterine contractions and threatened preterm labor\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Thompson presented to triage at 3am with a 4-hour history of regular, painful abdominal tightening occurring every 5-7 minutes. She describes the pain as cramping, similar to period pain but more intense, radiating to her lower back. She also reports increased vaginal discharge over the past 24 hours, initially clear but now slightly blood-tinged. No frank bleeding, no gush of fluid, fetal movements remain good. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with term delivery. No significant medical history. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy (ceased). Current medications: folic acid, iron supplements for mild anemia. Recent throat infection treated with penicillin 2 weeks ago, now resolved.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears uncomfortable during contractions. Vital signs: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, temp 37.1°C. Abdomen palpable contractions every 6 minutes lasting 45-60 seconds, moderate intensity. Fundal height 31cm (appropriate). CTG shows baseline 140 bpm with good variability, contractions clearly visible every 6 minutes. Speculum examination reveals cervix 2cm dilated, 70% effaced, soft, central position. Minimal blood-stained discharge, no obvious rupture of membranes. Digital examination confirms cervical findings. Fetal fibronectin test positive. Recent bloods: Hb 10.1 g/dL, WCC 12.1 x10⁹/L, CRP 8 mg/L, MSU pending.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of established preterm labor. Immediate admission to delivery suite. Tocolysis with nifedipine commenced to delay delivery and allow time for interventions. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone 12mg IM) given, repeat dose in 24 hours for fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate considered for neuroprotection if delivery appears imminent. Group B streptococcus status unknown - high vaginal swab sent and prophylactic antibiotics considered. Pediatric team alerted regarding potential preterm delivery. Attempt to prolong pregnancy for at least 48 hours to complete steroid course. Continuous fetal monitoring and maternal observations 4-hourly.",
