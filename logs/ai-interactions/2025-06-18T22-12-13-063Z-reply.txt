Eligible babies are those born at UH Sussex NHS Trust. **Key Recommendations:** - **Timing:** Screen by 72 hours; refer abnormalities promptly. - **Missed Screens:** Report if due to pathway failure; document parental declines or medical unsuitability. - **Training:** Practitioners (doctors/midwives) must complete accredited training and annual updates. - **Hip Screening:** Refer abnormal exams or high-risk babies (breech, family history) for ultrasound at 4-6 weeks. - **Documentation:** Record declines, deaths, or incomplete screenings; escalate near breaches. - **Failures:** Track missed appointments; adjust timelines for preterm babies (<34 weeks). - **Incidents:** Report serious incidents; ensure follow-up for abnormal results. **Pathways:** - Community midwives or GPs complete post-discharge screens. - Hip clinic referrals: abnormal exams → ultrasound at 4 weeks; risk factors → scan at 4-6 weeks. **Data & Reporting:** Submit quarterly KPI data; discuss performance mitigations. **Contacts:** Referral/queries to designated NHS emails. *Glossary terms defined (e.g., NICU, NIPE, PHE).* *(For full details, refer to Staffnet document.)*",
