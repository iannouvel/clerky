Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Factors increasing failure risk include mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, and large fetal head circumference. Pre-procedure ultrasound is advised if fetal head position is uncertain. Post-birth care includes antibiotics, monitoring for complications, bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Psychological support should be offered for traumatic births, avoiding single-session trauma-focused interventions. Units must ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports. Auditable standards should be monitored per RCOG guidelines\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
