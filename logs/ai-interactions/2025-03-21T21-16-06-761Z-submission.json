    "prompt": "Read the clinical scenario below\nList the significant issues as brief, single-line statements. \nWhen multiple issues might be related by a clinical entity, combine them into one concise issue. \nEach issue must be 60 characters or fewer. \nPlease ensure the list of issues isn't numbered.\nPlease ensure there isn't a trailing full stop at the end of each issue\nPlease only generate 2-3 issues for most patients.\nFor complex patients, perhaps 5 issues, for very complex patients 7. \nUse medical words where possible. \n\nExample:\nIssue 1\nIssue 2\nIssue 3\n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nClinical Summary:\nDictation:\n\nPatient: Female, 31 years old, weighing 70 kg with a BMI of 29, presents with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. She has one prior pregnancy.\n\nClinician: Good morning, Mrs. Smith. Thank you for coming in today. Can you please tell me more about your symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain? How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\n\nPatient: I have been having heavy periods for the past few months, and the pelvic pain started around the same time. It's been quite uncomfortable and affecting my daily activities.\n\nClinician: I see. Have you had any previous gynaecological issues or surgeries? Any history of fibroids or endometriosis?\n\nPatient: No, I have not had any gynaecological surgeries before, and I'm not aware of any fibroids or endometriosis.\n\nClinician: Okay. Are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies to medications?\n\nPatient: I am not taking any medications, and I do not have any known allergies.\n\nClinician: Can you tell me about your occupation and any social factors that may be relevant to your symptoms?\n\nPatient: I work as a teacher, and I lead a fairly active lifestyle. I don't smoke or drink alcohol.\n\nClinician: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your history of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain, I will need to perform a pelvic examination to further evaluate your symptoms. \n\nAfter the examination:\n\nClinician: Mrs. Smith, based on your history and examination findings, it appears that you may have a condition called adenomyosis, which is a thickening of the uterine lining. I recommend further investigations such as an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn terms of management, we can discuss options such as hormonal therapy to help regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce the heavy bleeding. If conservative measures are not effective, we may consider other treatment options such as a minimally invasive procedure to address the adenomyosis.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your gynaecologist regularly to monitor your symptoms and response to treatment. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about the management plan.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough evaluation and explanation. I will follow up with my gynaecologist as recommended."
