      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Indication for Induction:** Recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce stillbirth risks, especially in Black/Asian women and deprived areas. - **Membrane Sweep:** Offer at 38 weeks and from 39 weeks for those aiming for vaginal birth. - **High BMI (â‰¥30):** Discuss induction at 36-38 weeks; offer by 40 weeks. - **Methods:** Membrane sweep, cervical balloon catheter, dinoprostone, artificial rupture of membranes (ARM), and oxytocin infusion. - **Contraindications:** Precipitate labor history, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Bishop Score, maternal/fetal wellbeing, and gestation confirmation. - **Cervical Ripening:** Balloon catheter (outpatient/inpatient criteria apply) or dinoprostone gel. Monitor for complications. - **Oxytocin Use:** Start after counseling; titrate to achieve adequate contractions. Continuous fetal (CTG) and maternal monitoring required. - **Pre-Labor Rupture of Membranes (PROM):** Offer induction after ~24 hours or expectant management with close monitoring. - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24-48 hours; options include further attempts or cesarean. - **Complications:** Uterine hyperstimulation (tocolysis if needed) or rupture (emergency cesarean). - **Documentation & Monitoring:** Strict record-keeping, CTG post-procedures, and audit compliance. **Special Cases:** Preterm labor, fetal demise, prior cesarean, diabetes, or maternal request require individualized plans",
