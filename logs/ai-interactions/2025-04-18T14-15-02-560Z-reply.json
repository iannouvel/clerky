She describes feeling lightheaded while standing and had to sit down to avoid falling. No reported loss of consciousness. History of Presenting Complaint: - Symptoms began approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. - No preceding trauma, chest pain, or dyspnoea. - No recent illness or fever. - Denies headache, visual disturbances, or abdominal pain. - No reported vaginal bleeding or contractions. - Last ate 4 hours prior to symptoms (small meal). - No recent travel or prolonged immobility. Past Medical History: - No known medical conditions. - No previous surgeries. - No known allergies. Medications: - No regular medications. - Denies recent use of over-the-counter or recreational drugs. Social History: - Non-smoker. - Occasional alcohol (last drink 1 week ago). - No current employment (student). - Lives with parents. Examination Findings: - General: Alert, appears slightly pale. - Vitals: - BP: 98&#x2F;62 mmHg (left arm, sitting) - HR: 110 bpm (regular) - RR: 16&#x2F;min - SpO₂: 98% (room air) - Temp: 36.7°C - Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, no murmurs. - Respiratory: Clear, equal air entry. - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses. - Neurological: No focal deficits, normal gait (not formally assessed). Notable Omissions (for testing purposes): - No documented fetal heart rate assessment (if applicable). - No recorded lying&#x2F;standing BP comparison. - No detailed fluid intake&#x2F;output history. - No urinalysis performed. - No assessment for signs of DVT. Impression: Possible vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension in a young primigravida (gestation unclear). Differential includes dehydration, anaemia, or early pregnancy-related cardiovascular changes. Management Plan: 1. Immediate: - IV access obtained, bloods sent for FBC, U&amp;E, glucose (awaiting results). - Encourage oral fluids if tolerated. - Bed rest with gradual mobilisation. 2. Monitoring: - Repeat BP&#x2F;HR hourly. - Consider lying&#x2F;standing BP if symptoms recur. 3. Follow-up: - If symptoms resolve, discharge with advice to increase fluid&#x2F;salt intake. - If persistent tachycardia&#x2F;hypotension, consider ECG and further cardiac review. - Advise to return if recurrent episodes or worsening symptoms. Contingencies: - If collapse recurs, escalate to senior obstetrician and consider sepsis screening. - If gestation confirmed as third trimester, consider pre-eclampsia workup (despite no proteinuria&#x2F;HTN currently).
