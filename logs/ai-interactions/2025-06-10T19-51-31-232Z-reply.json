She reports associated light vaginal spotting but denies heavy bleeding. She also notes mild dizziness but no syncope.  \n\n**Relevant History:**  \n- **Obstetric history:** G2P1 (one previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery, no known miscarriages).  \n- **Contraception:** Stopped oral contraceptive pills 4 months ago; no recent barrier use.  \n- **Medical history:** Mild asthma (no recent exacerbations).  \n- **Surgical history:** Appendectomy at age 18.  \n- **Medications:** Salbutamol PRN, no recent antibiotics.  \n- **Allergies:** No known drug allergies.  \n- **Social history:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* Sexual history and recent partner details were not explored.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, afebrile, SpO2 98% on room air.  \n- **Abdomen:** Mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa with no guarding or rebound. No palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum exam:** Minimal blood in the vault; cervix appears closed.  \n- **Bimanual exam:** Cervical motion tenderness present; right adnexal tenderness noted. Left adnexa non-tender.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* No documentation of uterine size or further characterization of adnexal masses.  \n\n**Investigations:**  \n- **Urine hCG:** Positive.  \n- **Bedside ultrasound (limited):** No intrauterine gestational sac visualized. Right adnexal mass noted but no free fluid seen.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nSuspected ectopic pregnancy given positive hCG, absent intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound, and right adnexal tenderness.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent formal transvaginal ultrasound** to confirm location of pregnancy and assess for hemoperitoneum.  \n2. **Serial beta-hCG monitoring** if diagnosis remains uncertain.  \n3. **Counsel patient on warning signs** (severe pain, heavy bleeding, syncope) and advise immediate return if these occur.  \n4. **Discuss potential treatment options** (methotrexate vs. surgical intervention) pending confirmatory imaging.  \n5. **Avoid NSAIDs** until ectopic ruled out due to bleeding risk.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* Patient was not asked about Rh status or desire for future fertility.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Arrange OBGYN review within 24 hours.  \n- If hemodynamically unstable, escalate to emergency department.  \n\n**End of Dictation.**  \n\n*Disclaimer: This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is given or implied.*",
