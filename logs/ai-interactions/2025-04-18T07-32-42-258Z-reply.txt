A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Endometrial Hyperplasia (GTG 2014 Guideline Application)**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 52 years  
- Weight: 87 kg  
- Height: 1.66 m  
- BMI: 31.4 (obese class I)  
- Parity: G1P1 (1 prior pregnancy, vaginal delivery)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding with intermittent spotting between periods. She describes episodes of flooding requiring frequent pad changes (soaking a pad every 2 hours during heavy days). She also reports mild lower abdominal discomfort but no dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began 6 months ago with progressively heavier cycles (previously regular).  
- No associated fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  
- No recent hormonal medication use.  
- Denies postmenopausal bleeding (still menstruating, albeit irregularly).  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago, controlled on lisinopril).  
- Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago, managed with metformin).  
- No history of thrombosis or bleeding disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 20).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, previously regular 28-day cycles.  
- LMP: 2 weeks ago (heavy, prolonged).  
- No history of abnormal smears.  
- No prior pelvic infections or endometriosis.  

**Drug History:**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  
- Metformin 500 mg BD.  
- No HRT or anticoagulants.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Works as an office administrator.  
- Non-smoker.  
- Alcohol: 5–6 units/week.  
- Lives with husband; moderately active (walks occasionally).  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Concerned about cancer due to family history (mother had breast cancer).  
- Wants to understand if her bleeding is "just menopause" or something more serious.  
- Hoping to avoid surgery if possible.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Obese, no pallor or signs of endocrine disease.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- Pelvic exam: Speculum – slight cervical ectropion, no visible lesions. Bimanual – uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal masses. No cervical motion tenderness.  

**Investigations:**  
- Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS): Endometrial thickness 12 mm, heterogeneous echo pattern. No focal lesions.  
- Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology).  

**Clinical Impression:**  
- Likely **endometrial hyperplasia (EH)** (per GTG 2014 guidelines), given:  
  - Age >45 + obesity (BMI 31.4) + hypertension + diabetes (all risk factors for EH).  
  - Abnormal uterine bleeding with thickened endometrium on imaging.  
- Await biopsy to exclude atypia/malignancy.  

**Management Plan (GTG 2014-Based):**  
1. **If biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia:**  
   - First-line: **Progesterone therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUS or oral progestins).  
   - Weight loss counseling (BMI ≥30 increases EH recurrence risk).  
   - Repeat endometrial sampling in 6 months.  

2. **If atypia present:**  
   - Refer to gynecology oncology for consideration of hysterectomy (definitive treatment).  

3. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Encourage weight loss (even 5–10% reduction improves hormonal balance).  
   - Optimize diabetes/hypertension control.  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review biopsy results within 2 weeks.  
   - Provide written information on EH and bleeding diaries.  

**Patient Reassured:**  
- EH is treatable, especially if no atypia.  
- Low threshold for re-referral if symptoms worsen.
