NVP affects up to 90% of pregnant people and can be successfully managed in General Practice. HG is a severe form of NVP that may require specialist support. Prompt effective management improves quality of life and pregnancy outcomes.\n\nMedication to manage symptoms of NVP and HG:\n- Antiemetic medications can be taken in all trimesters of pregnancy.\n- Use pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate or cyclizine for first-time pregnancies.\n- Consider combinations of antiemetics for non-responders.\n- Consider thiamine for patients with severe symptoms.\n- Use the PUQE scoring system to assess severity.\n\nPractice points for General Practitioners:\n- Consider alternative causes if symptoms start after 16 weeks of pregnancy.\n- Regularly monitor renal function, weight, hydration, and vitamin levels.\n- Assess mental health and consider referral if necessary.\n- Offer counselling and validate the severity of symptoms.\n- Prescribe antiemetics as needed and refer for specialist support if required.\n\nPractice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management):\n- Review risks and consider LMWH as per local guidelines.\n- Use antiemetic medication guidance and consider corticosteroids if needed.\n- Ensure appropriate nutrition, hydration, and management of concurrent conditions.\n- Offer serial scans for people with continued symptoms in late pregnancy.\n- Provide support groups information and advise on future pregnancies.\n\nHow to refer for specialist support/ambulatory care:\n- Contact specialist centers for support and referrals.\n- Consider termination of pregnancy only after exploring all treatment options.\n- Offer counselling before and after any decision regarding termination.\n\nUseful resources and signposting information:\n- Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum\n- RCOG pregnancy sickness patient information leaflet\n- Pregnancy Sickness Support organization\n- UK Teratology Information Service\n- Specialist Pharmacy Service\n- HER Foundation\n\nAppendix 1: Summary for General Practitioners\n- Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum\n\nAppendix 2: Summary for Management in General Practice\n\nAppendix 3: Summary for Ambulatory Care\n\nAppendix 4: Summary for Emergency Department Staff\n\nAppendix 5: Summary for Inpatient Care\n\nNote: Trust may be using IV thiamine - see local policy.",

  "response": "### Analysis of Clinical Note vs. Guideline\n\nThe provided clinical note discusses a case of twin pregnancy with suspected obstetric cholestasis, while the referenced guideline focuses on the management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). These are distinct clinical conditions with different management approaches. \n\nSince the clinical note does not mention nausea, vomiting, or hyperemesis gravidarum, there is no direct overlap with the guideline's recommendations. Therefore, no specific recommendations can be made to align the clinical note with this particular guideline.\n\n### Suggested Next Steps\nIf you would like an analysis of the clinical note for obstetric cholestasis management, please provide a relevant guideline (e.g., RCOG or local trust guidelines on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy). Alternatively, if nausea/vomiting or hyperemesis gravidarum were part of the patient's presentation but were omitted from the note, please clarify so appropriate recommendations can be made. \n\n### Summary\nNo actionable recommendations can be provided at this time due to the mismatch between the clinical note (obstetric cholestasis) and the guideline (NVP/HG). A guideline specific to cholestasis of pregnancy would be needed for meaningful analysis. \n\nWould you like to:\n1. Provide a cholestasis-specific guideline for analysis?  \n2. Modify the clinical note to include NVP/HG symptoms?  \n3. Proceed with a general review of the note without guideline alignment?  \n\nPlease advise how you'd like to proceed.",
