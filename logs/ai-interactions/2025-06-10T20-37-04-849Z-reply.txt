  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\n**Fictional Clinical Dictation – Placenta Previa (For Testing Purposes Only)**  \n\n**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  \n**Age:** 32 years  \n**Gestational Age:** 28 weeks  \n**Weight:** 68 kg  \n**Date of Encounter:** [Fictional Date]  \n**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  \n\n### **History of Present Illness:**  \nMs. Doe presents today for a routine prenatal visit. She reports intermittent, painless vaginal bleeding over the past week, described as bright red and light in volume. She denies associated contractions, fever, or trauma. She has no history of bleeding earlier in this pregnancy. She reports normal fetal movements.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- G2P1 (previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term)  \n- No prior cesarean sections or uterine surgeries  \n- No known history of placenta previa or other placental abnormalities  \n\n**Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- No significant medical conditions  \n- No prior surgeries  \n- No known bleeding disorders  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- No anticoagulants or other medications  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Occasional alcohol use prior to pregnancy (none since conception)  \n- Works as a teacher; no heavy lifting or strenuous activity  \n\n*(Incomplete: Family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications not elicited. Sexual activity and recent intercourse not discussed.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/72 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- Temp: 98.4°F  \n- RR: 16  \n\n**Abdomen:**  \n- Soft, non-tender  \n- Fundal height consistent with dates  \n- No palpable contractions  \n\n**Speculum Exam (Deferred Today):**  \n- Patient declined speculum exam due to discomfort; no active bleeding noted externally  \n\n**Fetal Assessment:**  \n- FHR: 142 bpm (Doppler)  \n- Normal movement reported  \n\n*(Incomplete: No documentation of cervical exam or ultrasound confirmation of placental location at this visit.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \nSuspected **placenta previa** given history of painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. Differential includes marginal bleed, cervical irritation, or other causes.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Management:**  \n   - Advised pelvic rest (no intercourse, no heavy lifting, no strenuous activity)  \n   - Instructed to present to Labor & Delivery immediately if heavy bleeding (>1 pad/hour), contractions, or decreased fetal movement  \n\n2. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - Scheduled for **urgent ultrasound** (transvaginal preferred) to confirm placental location  \n   - CBC to assess for anemia (not yet ordered)  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat prenatal visit in 1 week  \n   - If placenta previa confirmed, will discuss potential need for cesarean delivery and closer monitoring  \n\n*(Incomplete: No discussion of RhoGAM status if Rh-negative, no iron supplementation if anemic, no detailed contingency planning for recurrent bleeding.)*  \n\n**Impression:**  \n32-year-old G2P1 at 28 weeks with painless vaginal bleeding, concerning for placenta previa. Further imaging required for definitive diagnosis. Patient counseled on warning signs and activity restrictions.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith  \n**For Testing Purposes Only – Not Real Medical Advice**  \n\n---  \n*Note: This fictional dictation intentionally includes gaps in history and management for educational/testing purposes. Always follow institutional protocols for real clinical documentation.*\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status and administer Anti-D immunoglobulin if the patient is Rh-negative.  \n   Reason: The guideline (gtg-2011-aph-pdf) explicitly states that Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH to prevent alloimmunization.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Order a CBC immediately to assess for anemia due to bleeding.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes maternal investigations (e.g., blood tests) to assess the extent of APH and guide management, especially in cases of suspected placenta previa.  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Perform a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm placental location, as deferred imaging delays definitive diagnosis.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights the importance of ultrasound in diagnosing placenta previa, which directly impacts management (e.g., need for hospitalization, delivery planning).  \n\n4. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on immediate hospitalization if bleeding recurs or worsens, rather than waiting for a scheduled follow-up.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends hospitalization for APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding to ensure prompt intervention if maternal/fetal compromise occurs.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Elicit family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications.  \n   Reason: The guideline underscores the need for a full history to identify risk factors for APH (e.g., inherited bleeding disorders).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider antenatal corticosteroids given the risk of preterm delivery with placenta previa.  \n   Reason: The guideline suggests corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth, which is a potential complication of APH.  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Document discussion of domestic violence screening due to recurrent presentations.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends asking about domestic violence in women with repeated APH episodes.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on pelvic rest and warning signs.  \n   Reason: While the guideline focuses on clinical management, patient education supports adherence to activity restrictions.  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Clarify sexual activity history to assess for cervical irritation as a bleeding source.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes the need to identify all potential causes of APH, though this is less critical than placental evaluation.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Include statistics on placenta previa outcomes during counseling.  \n   Reason: While patient-centered, this does not directly affect guideline compliance or acute management.  \n\n---  \n**Summary:** The note aligns well with the guideline but lacks critical elements (Rh status, immediate CBC, ultrasound confirmation). Hospitalization should be emphasized for active bleeding. Minor gaps (e.g., family history) are less urgent but would optimize care.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 50 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
