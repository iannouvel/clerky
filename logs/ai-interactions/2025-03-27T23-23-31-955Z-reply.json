She reports associated dizziness but denies fever, vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- The pain is described as sharp, intermittent, and localized to the right iliac fossa.  \n- Bleeding is dark, intermittent, and heavier than spotting but less than a normal period.  \n- No history of trauma or recent intercourse.  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 6 weeks ago, but cycles are usually irregular (every 5-8 weeks).  \n- She has a positive home pregnancy test 3 weeks ago but has not yet had formal antenatal care.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 3 years ago, on metformin)  \n- Hypertension (on lisinopril, switched to methyldopa in early pregnancy)  \n- Previous gestational diabetes (last pregnancy)  \n- Depression (on sertraline)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Caesarean section x 2 (last one 2 years ago for fetal distress)  \n- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (age 20, benign cyst)  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12  \n- Dysmenorrhea since teens, managed with NSAIDs  \n- No history of STIs (last screen negative 1 year ago)  \n- Contraception: Previously used Depo-Provera, currently none  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 1g BD  \n- Methyldopa 250mg TDS  \n- Sertraline 50mg OD  \n- PRN ibuprofen for pain  \n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Part-time retail assistant  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (reduced from 10 during pregnancy)  \n- No alcohol or recreational drugs  \n- Lives with partner and 4 children (ages 1, 3, 5, 7)  \n- Limited social support; financial stressors reported  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns & Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried this may be another miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.  \n- **Concerns:** Fears needing another caesarean or complications due to weight.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants confirmation of pregnancy viability and pain management.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Obese, mildly tachycardic (HR 100), BP 140/90  \n- Abdomen: Soft, tender in right iliac fossa, no guarding/rebound  \n- Speculum: Small amount of dark blood in vault, cervix closed  \n- Bimanual: Uterus slightly enlarged (8-week size), right adnexal tenderness, no palpable mass  \n- Bedside ultrasound (difficult due to BMI): No intrauterine gestational sac seen, possible right adnexal mass  \n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**  \n1. **Ectopic pregnancy** (high suspicion given pain, bleeding, adnexal tenderness, no IUGS on scan)  \n2. **Threatened miscarriage** (less likely given adnexal findings)  \n3. **Haemorrhagic ovarian cyst** (history of cysts, but high β-hCG makes ectopic more likely)  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent serum β-hCG** (quantitative) and progesterone.  \n2. **Formal transvaginal ultrasound** (despite BMI limitations) to assess for ectopic pregnancy.  \n3. **Admit for observation** given haemodynamic risk (tachycardia, pain).  \n4. **Consult obstetrics/gynaecology team** for possible methotrexate if ectopic confirmed.  \n5. **Diabetic control optimisation** (switch to insulin if pregnancy continues).  \n6. **Counselling:** Risks of rupture, need for close monitoring, smoking cessation support.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review β-hCG trends and scan results within 24 hours.  \n- If stable, consider outpatient follow-up with early pregnancy unit.  \n- Long-term: Discuss weight management, contraception post-resolution.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nHigh suspicion of ectopic pregnancy in a high-risk patient (obesity, prior caesareans, diabetes). Expedited management required to prevent rupture.  \n\n---  \n**End of Dictation** (For testing purposes only – no real patient data or medical advice intended.)",
