Known HIV-positive women should be re-screened. - **Declining Screening:** Women may decline screening, but this must be documented. They should be informed they can opt for screening later and will be contacted for further discussion. Re-offer screening at 28 weeks if unscreened. - **Sample Collection:** Samples must be properly labeled. Unacceptable samples require a repeat within 10 working days. - **Results:** Available within 5 working days. Follow up within 10 days, including for women who miscarry or terminate. Negative results do not guarantee protection; repeat testing can be requested. - **Positive Results:** Confirmatory testing is done in a designated lab. Key staff are notified, and women are referred to specialists within 10 working days. Confidentiality is maintained unless consent is given for disclosure. - **Audit & Training:** Mandatory data collection and annual audits are required. Midwives must receive training, and incidents must be reported. - **Goal:** Early identification reduces mother-to-child transmission and ensures appropriate care",
