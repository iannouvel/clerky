Irregular heavy menstrual bleeding for the past 6 months, associated with clots and fatigue.  2. Secondary subfertility – trying to conceive for 18 months without success.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Menstrual history: Cycles previously regular (28–30 days) but now irregular (21–45 days), with prolonged bleeding (7–10 days). Heavy flow (soaking 6–8 pads&#x2F;day) with clots. Reports fatigue and dizziness, suggestive of anaemia.  - Subfertility: One prior uncomplicated pregnancy 5 years ago (spontaneous conception, vaginal delivery). Now trying for a second child with no success. No history of pelvic pain or dyspareunia.  - No post-coital bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding.  Past Medical History:  - Obesity (BMI 44)  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed aged 28 (irregular cycles, hirsutism)  - Gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy (diet-controlled)  - Depression (on sertraline 50mg OD)  Past Surgical History:  - Appendicectomy (age 20)  - No prior gynaecological surgery  Drug History:  - Sertraline 50mg OD  - Folic acid 400mcg OD (preconception)  - No regular analgesia  Allergies:  - NKDA  Family History:  - Mother: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension  - No family history of gynaecological cancers  Social History:  - Non-smoker  - Occasional alcohol (2–3 units&#x2F;week)  - Works full-time in an office setting  - Lives with husband and 5-year-old child  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns &amp; Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried that her weight is affecting fertility and bleeding. Concerned about possible fibroids or cancer.  - Concerns: Anxious about difficulty conceiving and impact of heavy bleeding on daily life.  - Expectations: Wants investigations and treatment to regulate cycles and improve fertility.  Examination Findings:  - General: Obese (BMI 44), no pallor, no signs of hyperandrogenism.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  - Pelvic exam:    - Speculum: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.    - Bimanual: Uterus slightly bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  - No evidence of infection or cervical motion tenderness.  Investigations Ordered:  1. Blood tests: FBC (anaemia screen), HbA1c (glucose control), TSH, prolactin, testosterone (PCOS follow-up).  2. Pelvic ultrasound: To assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, and rule out fibroids&#x2F;polyps.  3. Hysteroscopy (if ultrasound abnormal): For further evaluation of heavy bleeding.  Management Plan:  1. Heavy menstrual bleeding:     - Medical: Tranexamic acid (if not contraindicated) + progesterone therapy (cyclical norethisterone).     - Surgical (if medical therapy fails): Consider endometrial ablation or Mirena IUS (if fertility not immediate goal).  2. Subfertility:     - Weight management: Referral to dietitian + bariatric team (BMI 44 increases pregnancy risks).     - Ovulation induction (if anovulatory): Clomiphene citrate (after excluding tubal blockage).     - Further tests: Day 21 progesterone (luteal phase), HSG (tubal patency).  3. Anaemia: Iron supplementation if Hb low.  Follow-Up:  - Review ultrasound and blood results in 2 weeks.  - Discuss fertility options based on findings.  - Advised to track cycles with ovulation kits.  Impression:  1. Complex PCOS with obesity-related subfertility.  2. Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely anovulatory vs. structural cause).  Plan Documented By: Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  Date: [Fictional date]  Disclaimer: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is given.",
