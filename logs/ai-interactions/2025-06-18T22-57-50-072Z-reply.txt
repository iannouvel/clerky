Key points include: - **Two staff members** must perform counts together before and after procedures, recording and signing all counts. Discrepancies require investigation. - **Sharps safety** must be followed, with audible counting and proper disposal. - **Post-procedure**, counts must be verified by two staff, with separate checks for all items. Missing items must be located; if unresolved, an urgent x-ray is required. - **Unreconciled counts** at homebirths require hospital transfer for x-ray if the item is not found. - **Transfer to theatre** requires completed counts; vaginal packing must be documented and communicated. - **Audit** includes checklists for pre-, intra-, and post-procedure counts, with actions for discrepancies. Non-reconciled counts before patient discharge are not typically classified as incidents if resolved. Missing items must be documented, with plans for removal or x-ray if unlocated",
