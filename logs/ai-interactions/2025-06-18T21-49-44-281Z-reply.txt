      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower fetal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Failure risk factors**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, provide analgesia, bladder care, and thromboprophylaxis. Document thoroughly and plan postnatal follow-up. - **Psychological support**: Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive care for families and staff after adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports when required, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
