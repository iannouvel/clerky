  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 28-year-old G1P1 presenting with acute onset premature rupture of membranes (prom)\n\nBACKGROUND: Patient has a background of [relevant medical history]. Current pregnancy/cycle has been uncomplicated until now. No known drug allergies. Regular medications include folic acid 5mg daily. Family history significant for maternal diabetes and hypertension.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination: BP 140/90, HR 88, temp 37.2Â°C. Abdomen soft, fundal height appropriate. CTG shows baseline 140 with good variability. Urinalysis shows trace protein. Bloods pending including FBC, U&Es, LFTs, and coagulation studies.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Plan: Admit for monitoring and further investigation. IV access established. Continuous CTG monitoring. Serial BP measurements. Consultant review within 2 hours. Consider delivery if condition deteriorates.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n- Patient counselled regarding condition and management options\n- Written information provided\n- Next of kin contacted and updated\n- Documentation completed in patient notes\n- Handover given to on-call team\n\nPLAN:\n- Continuous monitoring as per protocol\n- Serial observations 4-hourly\n- Repeat bloods in 24 hours\n- Consultant review tomorrow morning\n- Discharge planning when appropriate\n\nSigned: Dr. [Name]\nDate: [Current date]\nTime: [Current time]\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) - Diagnosis and Management\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a sterile speculum examination was performed to confirm PPROM diagnosis.  \n   Reason: Guideline states diagnosis should be made by maternal history followed by sterile speculum examination.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Initiate erythromycin for 10 days or until established labor.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends antibiotic (preferably erythromycin) given for 10 days or until established labor in PPROM.  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Offer corticosteroids if gestation is between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends offering corticosteroids to women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestation.  \n\n4. **Additional information needed** - Document gestational age explicitly in the note.  \n   Reason: Many recommendations (e.g., corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate) depend on gestational age, which is not clearly stated.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Offer emotional support and provide links to support groups (e.g., Little Heartbeats).  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends emotional support should be offered to women with PPROM and their partners.  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document discussion with neonatology team if delivery is anticipated.  \n   Reason: Guideline states neonatologists should be informed when PPROM diagnosis is confirmed and delivery is anticipated.  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider magnesium sulfate if delivery is planned within 24 hours and gestation is 24+0 to 29+6 weeks.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends magnesium sulfate for women with PPROM in established labor between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 testing was considered if no amniotic fluid was observed.  \n   Reason: Guideline suggests considering these tests if no amniotic fluid is seen on speculum exam.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about PPROM (e.g., RCOG patient leaflet).  \n   Reason: Guideline references patient information resources, though the note already mentions \"written information provided.\"  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting whether outpatient management was discussed.  \n   Reason: Guideline suggests outpatient care can be considered on an individual basis, but inpatient monitoring is reasonable.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Document whether the patient was counseled about the median latency period (7 days).  \n   Reason: Guideline provides background statistics, but this is not critical for immediate management.  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:\n- Absence of documented speculum exam (key for diagnosis).  \n- Missing antibiotic (erythromycin) and corticosteroid administration if indicated.  \n- Gestational age not explicitly stated, affecting multiple management decisions.  \n\nThese changes would significantly improve adherence to the guideline.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 56 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) - Diagnosis and Management\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
