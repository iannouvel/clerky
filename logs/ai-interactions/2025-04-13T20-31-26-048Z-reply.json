Abdominal: - Soft, non-tender gravid uterus palpable at symphysis-fundal height of 14 weeks (larger than dates). - No palpable masses or organomegaly. Speculum&#x2F;Bimanual (consent obtained): - Cervix appears closed, no active bleeding at time of exam. - Uterus enlarged, non-tender; no adnexal masses. Bedside Ultrasound (if available): - Single intrauterine pregnancy, fetal heartbeat detected. - Placenta appears low-lying (potential placenta praevia? Requires formal scan). ---### Management Plan 1. Investigations: - Urgent formal obstetric ultrasound (confirm viability, placental location). - FBC (assess for anemia), HbA1c (diabetes control), coagulation screen. - Group &amp; Save (given bleeding history). 2. Immediate Advice: - Pelvic rest (no intercourse&#x2F;tampons). - Emergency contact instructions if bleeding worsens. 3. Long-Term: - Referral to high-risk obstetric clinic (maternal BMI, diabetes, hypertension). - Dietitian review for weight&#x2F;diabetes optimization. - Smoking cessation support. 4. Patient Education: - Counseled on risks of obesity in pregnancy (gestational diabetes exacerbation, macrosomia). - Discussed importance of antenatal attendance.
