She had an uncomplicated prenatal course with no significant past medical history. During the second stage of labor, she suddenly developed acute respiratory distress, profound hypotension (BP 70/40 mmHg), and altered mental status. The fetal heart tracing showed prolonged decelerations. No prior history of clotting disorders or allergies was noted.  \n\n*Missing Pertinent Information:*  \n- Family history of thrombophilia or adverse pregnancy outcomes  \n- Recent infections or illnesses  \n- Medications taken during pregnancy (e.g., anticoagulants)  \n- Detailed labor progression prior to the event  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Distressed, cyanotic, diaphoretic  \n- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (HR 130 bpm), weak peripheral pulses  \n- Respiratory: Tachypneic (RR 32), oxygen saturation 82% on room air  \n- Abdomen: Fundal height consistent with dates, no uterine tenderness  \n- Neurologic: Confused, sluggish pupillary response  \n- No documented assessment for DIC (e.g., bleeding from IV sites, petechiae)  \n\n*Missing Pertinent Information:*  \n- Full coagulation profile (e.g., PT/INR, fibrinogen, platelets)  \n- Detailed fetal assessment post-event  \n- Urine output assessment (sign of renal perfusion)  \n\n**Impression:**  \nHigh suspicion for **amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)** given acute cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy in a laboring patient. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, or hemorrhage, but clinical presentation strongly favors AFE.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Resuscitation:**  \n   - Call for multidisciplinary team (OB, anesthesia, critical care).  \n   - Secure airway (intubation if needed), high-flow oxygen.  \n   - Aggressive IV fluids + vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) for hypotension.  \n   - Blood products (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) if DIC suspected (not yet confirmed).  \n\n2. **Delivery:**  \n   - Expedited delivery via cesarean section due to maternal instability and non-reassuring fetal status.  \n\n3. **Monitoring:**  \n   - Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line if available).  \n   - Serial labs (CBC, coagulation panel, ABG).  \n\n4. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Explained critical nature of AFE to family (fictional surrogate decision-maker).  \n   - Discussed high mortality/morbidity risk.  \n\n*Missing Pertinent Management Steps:*  \n- No mention of echocardiogram to assess right heart strain.  \n- No documentation of consent process for emergency surgery.  \n- No discussion of long-term follow-up (e.g., neurologic outcomes).  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Transfer to ICU post-delivery.  \n- Hematology consult for coagulopathy management.  \n- Social work support for family.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional), Obstetrics Team  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n---  \n*Note: This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only.
