**Impression:**  
Possible vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension in a young primigravida (gestation unclear). Differential includes dehydration, anaemia, or early pregnancy-related cardiovascular changes.

1. **Immediate:**  
   - IV access obtained, bloods sent for FBC, U&E, glucose (awaiting results).  
   - Encourage oral fluids if tolerated.  
   - Bed rest with gradual mobilisation.  
2. **Monitoring:**  
   - Repeat BP/HR hourly.  
   - Consider lying/standing BP if symptoms recur.  
3. **Follow-up:**  
   - If symptoms resolve, discharge with advice to increase fluid/salt intake.  
   - If persistent tachycardia/hypotension, consider ECG and further cardiac review.  
   - Advise to return if recurrent episodes or worsening symptoms.  

**Contingencies:**  
- If collapse recurs, escalate to senior obstetrician and consider sepsis screening.  
- If gestation confirmed as third trimester, consider pre-eclampsia workup (despite no proteinuria/HTN currently).
