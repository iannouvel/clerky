Clinical Summary:
Clinician: Good morning, Mrs. Smith. Thank you for coming in today. Can you please start by telling me a bit about your current concern? Patient: Hello, doctor. I've been experiencing some irregular bleeding and pelvic pain for the past few months. It's been quite concerning for me. Clinician: I see. Let's start by taking a comprehensive history. Can you tell me your age and weight? Patient: I am 45 years old and weigh 90 kg, which gives me a BMI of 39. Clinician: Thank you. Can you tell me about your past medical, surgical, and gynaecological history? Patient: I have had one prior pregnancy, which was uncomplicated. I have not had any surgeries in the past. I do have a history of hypertension and take medication for it. Clinician: Thank you for sharing that information. Can you also tell me about any allergies you may have and your occupation? Patient: I am allergic to penicillin. I work as a teacher. Clinician: Great, thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me more about your symptoms of irregular bleeding and pelvic pain? How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Patient: The irregular bleeding has been going on for about 3 months now, and the pelvic pain started about 2 months ago. The pain is mostly on the left side and is sharp in nature. Clinician: Thank you for sharing that. Based on your history, I would like to perform a pelvic examination to further evaluate your symptoms. After the examination, I will be able to provide you with more specific management advice. (Examination findings: Pelvic examination reveals tenderness on the left side and a palpable mass in the left adnexa.) Clinician: Mrs. Smith, based on your history and examination findings, it appears that you may have a complex gynaecological issue such as an ovarian cyst or endometriosis. I would recommend further imaging studies such as an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, I will prescribe you pain medication to help manage your symptoms. We will discuss further treatment options once we have the results of the imaging studies. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough evaluation and guidance. I will follow up with the imaging studies as soon as possible. Clinician: You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We will work together to address your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care.
