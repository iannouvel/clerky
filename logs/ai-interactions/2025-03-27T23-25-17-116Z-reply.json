She reports associated dizziness but denies fever, vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - The pain is described as sharp, intermittent, and localized to the right iliac fossa.  - Bleeding is dark, intermittent, and heavier than spotting but less than a normal period.  - No history of trauma or recent intercourse.  - Last menstrual period (LMP) was 6 weeks ago, but cycles are usually irregular (every 5-8 weeks).  - She has a positive home pregnancy test 3 weeks ago but has not yet had formal antenatal care.  Past Medical History:  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 3 years ago, on metformin)  - Hypertension (on lisinopril, switched to methyldopa in early pregnancy)  - Previous gestational diabetes (last pregnancy)  - Depression (on sertraline)  Past Surgical History:  - Caesarean section x 2 (last one 2 years ago for fetal distress)  - Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (age 20, benign cyst)  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12  - Dysmenorrhea since teens, managed with NSAIDs  - No history of STIs (last screen negative 1 year ago)  - Contraception: Previously used Depo-Provera, currently none  Drug History:  - Metformin 1g BD  - Methyldopa 250mg TDS  - Sertraline 50mg OD  - PRN ibuprofen for pain  Allergies:  - No known drug allergies  Social History:  - Occupation: Part-time retail assistant  - Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (reduced from 10 during pregnancy)  - No alcohol or recreational drugs  - Lives with partner and 4 children (ages 1, 3, 5, 7)  - Limited social support; financial stressors reported  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns & Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried this may be another miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.  - Concerns: Fears needing another caesarean or complications due to weight.  - Expectations: Wants confirmation of pregnancy viability and pain management.  Examination Findings:  - General: Obese, mildly tachycardic (HR 100), BP 140/90  - Abdomen: Soft, tender in right iliac fossa, no guarding/rebound  - Speculum: Small amount of dark blood in vault, cervix closed  - Bimanual: Uterus slightly enlarged (8-week size), right adnexal tenderness, no palpable mass  - Bedside ultrasound (difficult due to BMI): No intrauterine gestational sac seen, possible right adnexal mass  Differential Diagnoses:  1. Ectopic pregnancy (high suspicion given pain, bleeding, adnexal tenderness, no IUGS on scan)  2. Threatened miscarriage (less likely given adnexal findings)  3. Haemorrhagic ovarian cyst (history of cysts, but high β-hCG makes ectopic more likely)  Management Plan:  1. Urgent serum β-hCG (quantitative) and progesterone.  2. Formal transvaginal ultrasound (despite BMI limitations) to assess for ectopic pregnancy.  3. Admit for observation given haemodynamic risk (tachycardia, pain).  4. Consult obstetrics/gynaecology team for possible methotrexate if ectopic confirmed.  5. Diabetic control optimisation (switch to insulin if pregnancy continues).  6. Counselling: Risks of rupture, need for close monitoring, smoking cessation support.  Follow-Up:  - Review β-hCG trends and scan results within 24 hours.  - If stable, consider outpatient follow-up with early pregnancy unit.  - Long-term: Discuss weight management, contraception post-resolution.  Impression:  High suspicion of ectopic pregnancy in a high-risk patient (obesity, prior caesareans, diabetes). Expedited management required to prevent rupture.  ---  End of Dictation (For testing purposes only – no real patient data or medical advice intended.)"
