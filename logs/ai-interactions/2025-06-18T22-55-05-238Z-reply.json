Key recommendations include: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Mothers should receive help with positioning, attachment, and hand expression. Responsive feeding and recognizing feeding cues are emphasized. - **Exclusive Breastfeeding:** Encouraged as the optimal choice, with supplementation only when medically indicated. Avoid teats, dummies, and nipple shields initially. - **Monitoring & Assessment:** Use the Badgernet breastfeeding tool to assess feeding effectiveness. Monitor weight loss, wet/dirty nappies, and signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., lethargy, jitteriness). - **Excessive Weight Loss Management:** For >12% weight loss or high sodium, involve ANNP/neonatologist. Implement feeding plans, encourage skin-to-skin, and prioritize expressed breast milk over formula. - **Formula Feeding:** Educate on responsive feeding and safe preparation. Follow recommended volumes. - **Tongue Tie:** Refer if feeding difficulties persist after positioning support. Frenulotomy is indicated for unresolved issues. - **Preterm/Ill Babies:** Prioritize breastmilk; support mothers in expressing milk. Encourage non-nutritive sucking and skin-to-skin contact. - **Staff Compliance:** Adhere to the International Code for Breast Milk Substitutes and ensure ongoing training. Early skin-to-skin contact, frequent feeding assessments, and specialist referrals (e.g., Infant Feeding Team) are critical for optimal outcomes\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
