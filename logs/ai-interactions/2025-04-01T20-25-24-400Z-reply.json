Doe (Fictional Name) Age: 26 Weight: 136 kg | BMI: 52 Prior Pregnancies: 2 (1 term vaginal delivery, 1 first-trimester miscarriage) ---### History of Presenting Complaint Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns: 1. Recurrent Pelvic Pain: Intermittent sharp pain in the left lower quadrant, worsening over the past 3 months. Pain is non-cyclical, exacerbated by prolonged standing, and associated with occasional post-coital bleeding. No fever or urinary symptoms. 2. Irregular Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB): Cycles vary from 21–45 days, with flooding&#x2F;clotting lasting 7–10 days. Reports fatigue and dizziness consistent with anemia. ### Past Medical&#x2F;Surgical History - Medical: PCOS (diagnosed age 18), insulin resistance, depression. - Surgical: Appendectomy (age 12), cesarean section (age 23 for fetal distress). - Gynecological: - Miscarriage (age 25, managed medically). - History of bacterial vaginosis (recurrent). ### Medications &amp; Allergies - Metformin 500 mg BD, Sertraline 50 mg OD, OCP (previously, discontinued due to HMB). - Allergies: NKDA. ### Social History - Works as a childcare assistant; limited physical activity due to pain&#x2F;fatigue. - Smokes 5 cigarettes&#x2F;day (10 pack-year history). Occasional alcohol. - Lives with partner; uses condoms inconsistently. ### Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations - Ideas: Worried pain may be &quot;cysts or endometriosis.&quot; Anxious about fertility due to irregular cycles. - Concerns: Fear of cancer due to family history (aunt with ovarian cancer). - Expectations: Requests &quot;scan to check everything&quot; and options to regulate bleeding. ---### Examination Findings - General: Obese (BMI 52), acanthosis nigricans noted. Pale conjunctiva. - Abdominal: Soft, non-distended. Tenderness in left iliac fossa; no palpable mass. - Pelvic Exam: - Speculum: Cervix appears healthy; minimal old blood in vault. - Bimanual: Uterus bulky, non-tender. Left adnexal fullness (+&#x2F;- complex cyst). No cervical motion tenderness. ---### Differential Diagnoses 1. Complex Adnexal Mass: Likely hemorrhagic ovarian cyst vs. endometrioma (given history of PCOS&#x2F;pain). 2. AUB-O (Ovulatory Dysfunction): Secondary to PCOS&#x2F;obesity. ---### Management Plan 1. Investigations: - Pelvic USS: To characterize adnexal mass and endometrial thickness. - Bloods: FBC (anemia workup), HbA1c (diabetes screening), CA-125 (cautiously, given family history). 2. Symptomatic Relief: - Tranexamic acid for HMB; iron supplementation if anemic. - Trial of NSAIDs for pain (avoid opioids given depression history). 3. Long-Term: - Weight loss support (bariatric referral if interested). - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD vs. cyclical progestins) post-imaging. 4. Follow-Up: - Review USS results in 2 weeks. If cyst &gt;5 cm&#x2F;persistent, consider laparoscopy. - Screen for depression exacerbation (link to counselor). Patient Counseled: Reassured no immediate red flags for malignancy but emphasized need for further evaluation. Advised smoking cessation support. Signed: Dr. A.
