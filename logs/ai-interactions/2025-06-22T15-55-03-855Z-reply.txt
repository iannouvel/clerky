Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth based on bile acid levels. Fetal monitoring has not shown to improve outcomes. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common. Clinicians should consider ICP in pregnant individuals with itching, perform bile acid testing, and offer ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment. Monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended during labor. Resolution of symptoms should be confirmed postpartum. Patients and family members are at higher risk for ICP in future pregnancies.\n\nThis clinical practice guideline aims to evaluate and summarize the available literature on ICP and provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical care. ICP is a common gestational disease that targets the liver, with varying incidence rates globally. Bile acids play a key role in the pathophysiology of ICP, and genetic susceptibility may contribute to its development. Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities. The most common symptom of ICP is pruritis, with elevated serum bile acids being a common laboratory finding. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated total serum bile acids, and monitoring levels is important for fetal outcomes. Maternal and fetal sequelae of ICP include an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Further testing for alternative diagnoses is recommended in certain cases.\n\nUrocholate impacted the rate and rhythm of cardiomyocyte contraction and abnormal calcium dynamics. Evaluation of pregnancies with ICP have supported the presence of alterations to fetal cardiac parameters. The goal of treating ICP is to ameliorate maternal symptomatology of pruritus and improve fetal outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most frequently used medication for ICP. Treatment with UDCA may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Refractory cases of ICP may benefit from a referral to a specialist. Follow-up laboratory testing and monitoring should be performed to gauge the magnitude of fetal risk. Fetal monitoring with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasound may be considered. Delivery timing should be based on the highest recorded non-fasting bile acid level. Postpartum outcomes, contraception considerations, and recurrence risk should be discussed. The recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies is around 70%. Individuals with ICP are at an increased risk of acquiring metabolic disease during adulthood. The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception for those with ICP. Overall, ICP is a multifactorial and common hepatic disease unique to pregnancy.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a condition that can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal complications. It is associated with elevated serum bile acid concentrations and may increase the risk of preeclampsia. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to be effective in managing the condition. Induction of labor may be necessary in some cases to reduce the risk of complications. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and optimal management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.\n\nIntrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy\nDifferential diagnoses for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy include AFLP, allergic or drug reaction, autoimmune hepatitis, biliary obstruction, drug-induced liver injury, HELLP syndrome, and more. Recommendations for iatrogenic birth are based on non-fasting bile acid levels. Contraceptive eligibility for women with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is outlined.",

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available.  
   Reason: Guideline emphasizes the importance of bile acid levels for diagnosis and management (ID: guideline-no-452). Baseline values can help track progression.  

2. **Different management plan** - Ensure fetal growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers are performed if not done in the past 2 weeks.  
   Reason: Guideline highlights the increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes in twin pregnancies with ICP, necessitating closer surveillance (ID: guideline-no-452).  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Clearly document counseling about the high recurrence risk (~70%) in future pregnancies and the need for monitoring in subsequent pregnancies.  
   Reason: Guideline explicitly states the high recurrence risk and need for future vigilance (ID: guideline-no-452).  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Consider testing for alternative diagnoses (e.g., AFLP, HELLP, biliary obstruction) if bile acids/LFTs are inconclusive.  
   Reason: Guideline recommends further testing for alternative diagnoses in certain cases (ID: guideline-no-452).  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed written information about postpartum follow-up, including monitoring for resolution of symptoms and metabolic disease risk.  
   Reason: Guideline notes the need for postpartum follow-up and long-term metabolic risks (ID: guideline-no-452).  

3. **Different management plan** - Discuss contraceptive options postpartum, particularly combined estrogen-progestin contraception (if appropriate).  
   Reason: Guideline endorses specific contraceptive considerations for patients with ICP (ID: guideline-no-452).  

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document a more detailed social history (e.g., support system for twin care postpartum).  
   Reason: While not directly related to ICP, this may help in holistic care planning.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Include statistics on neonatal outcomes (e.g., respiratory distress risk) during counseling.  
   Reason: Guideline mentions neonatal risks, but this is secondary to immediate management (ID: guideline-no-452).  

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document childhood asthma history in more detail.  
   Reason: Unlikely to impact ICP management.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide additional written materials on general twin pregnancy care.  
   Reason: While helpful, this is not specific to ICP management.  

Overall, the note is well-aligned with the guideline but could be strengthened by ensuring baseline bile acid documentation, explicit counseling on recurrence risk, and closer fetal surveillance in twins.
