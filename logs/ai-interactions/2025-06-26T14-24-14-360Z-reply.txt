She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] mp019-hypertension-and-pre-eclampsia-in-pregnancy-pdf\nTitle: MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy\nContent:

It can occur \nin isolation, or in association with proteinuria when it is known as pre-\neclampsia. \n1.4 Pre-eclampsia \n \n Raised BP on 2 occasions at > 20/40 gestation with significant proteinuria. \nPre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that can affect almost all maternal \norgan systems and the unborn baby. \nWomen/people with either pre-existing hypertension or gestational \nhypertension are at increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia. \n1.5 Eclampsia \nPre-eclampsia becomes eclampsia when the mother develops seizures. \n1.6 HELLP Syndrome ( Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) \nIt represents a subtype of preeclampsia with severe features in which \nhaemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia are the predominant \nfeatures, rather than hypertension or central nervous system or renal \ndysfunction, although the latter do occur. The majority of patients, but not all, \nhave hypertension (82 to 88 percent) and/or proteinuria (86 to 100 percent) \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 8 of 39 \n \n1.7 Preeclampsia superimposed upon pre-existing hypertension \nSuperimposed preeclampsia is defined by the new onset of proteinuria, \nsignificant end-organ dysfunction, or both after 20 weeks of gestation in a \nwoman with pre-existing hypertension. \nFor women/people with pre-existing hypertension who have proteinuria prior to \nor in early pregnancy, superimposed preeclampsia is defined by worsening or \nresistant hypertension (especially acutely) in the last half of pregnancy or \ndevelopment of signs/symptoms of the severe end of the disease spectrum. \nSection 2: Hypertension \n2 Antenatal Management of Women/people with a Previous History \nof hypertensive disease during pregnancy or at High Risk of Pre-\nEclampsia \n2.1 Risk assessment and Antiplatelet agent (150mg Asprin) \n\nModerate \n• First pregnancy \n• Age ≥ 40 years \n• Pregnancy interval \n>10years \n• BMI ≥ 35kgm\n2 \nat booking \n• Family history of pre-\neclampsia \n• Multi-fetal pregnancy \n \nHigh \n• Hypertensive disease \nduring previous pregnancy \n• Chronic kidney disease \n• Autoimmune disease such \nas systemic lupus \nerythematosus or \nantiphospholipid syndrome \n• Type 1 or type 2 diabetes \n• Chronic hypertension \n≥2 moderate risk \nfactors or ≥1 high risk \nfactors \nAsprin 150mg from 12 \nweeks until 36 weeks \nin the evening \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 9 of 39 \n\n2.2 Assessment of proteinuria in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy \n2.2.1 If dipstick screening is positive (1+ or more), use protein: creatinine \nratio to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women/people. Do not use \nfirst morning urine void to quantify proteinuria in pregnant \nwomen/people. \n2.2.2 Do not routinely use 24-hour urine collection to quantify proteinuria in \npregnant women/people. \n2.2.3 Use protein creatinine ratio of 30mg/mmol as a threshold for significant \nproteinuria \nIf the result is 30mg/mmol or above and there is still uncertainty about the \ndiagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re-testing on a new sample, alongside \nclinical review. \n3 Antenatal referrals and management \nWomen/people who are identified at the initial booking visit as being at high risk or \nhaving more than one moderate risk factor, should be referred immediately to a \nconsultant-led antenatal clinic for further assessment. \nThey should be seen in the clinic as soon as possible after the initial visit, but by 20 weeks \ngestation at the latest. \nIn the consultant-led clinic, an individualised plan of care will be made on a case-to-case \nbasis and documented in the handheld maternity notes, including a decision about the \nneed for antenatal aspirin \n4 Referral / Management Guidance for Midwives in Antenatal Clinic \nSetting \n \n4.1 If a midwife has concerns about a BP they should ensure that the BP is taken \nusing a manual sphygmomanometer and an appropriate sized cuff. (Please see \nAppendix A for information on how the BP should be taken) \n4.2 Midwives can refer by directly contacting the DAU at either hospital site during \nDAU opening hours; outside of these times e.g. weekends, the labour ward \ncoordinator on duty should be contacted to organise a review. \n \n• Two BP readings within one week >140 mmHg systolic* \n• Raised diastolic >90 mmHg \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 10 of 39 \n \n• Significant proteinuria (++protein or more) with raised systolic / \ndiastolic \n• Borderline systolic / diastolic + symptoms of PET +/- proteinuria \n• Significant proteinuria (++protein or more) and symptoms suggestive \nof PET (oedema / frontal headache / epigastric pain / visual \ndisturbance) \n \n* in detecting a raised systolic >140mmHg on the first occasion \n \nIf no other concerns arrange for the woman to be seen within 1 week for repeat \nBP measurement and urinalysis \n \n• If there is +proteinuria send MSU \n• If the repeat BP check is >140 mmHg again -

NHS Trust East Page 20 of 39 \n \n9.1 Treat women/people with above BP or MAP during pregnancy or after birth \nimmediately with one of the following: \nLabetalol infusion: - First Line Treatment \nIntravenous labetalol should be used for first-line therapy because it is effective, \nhas a rapid onset of action, and a good safety profile. If the woman can tolerate \noral therapy initial 200mg dose can be given immediately whilst gaining venous \naccess for IV labetalol: \n \n9.2 The fall in blood pressure begins within 5 to 10 minutes and lasts from 3 to 6 \nhours. Continuous cardiac monitoring is not necessary routinely, but should be \nused in patients with relevant co-morbidities (eg, coronary artery disease). \n9.3 Cumulative maximum dose is 300 mg. If target BP is not achieved, switch to \nanother class of agent. \nAlternatively \n9.4 A continuous IV infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/minute can be started after initial 20 mg \nIV dose instead of intermittent therapy. \n9.5 Adjust dose within this range to achieve target blood pressure. \n \nStep 1 Begin with 20mg intravenously over 2 minutes (given as 4mls labetalol: 5mg/ml) \nStep 2 If BP remains above target level at 10 minutes, give 40mg IV over 2 minutes \nStep 3 If BP remains above target level at 20 minutes, give 80mg IV over 2 minutes \nStep 4 If BP remains above target level at 30 minutes, give 80mg IV over 2 minutes \nStep 5 If BP remains above target level at 40 minutes, give 80mg IV over 2 minutes \nStep 1 \nInfusion of (neat) labetalol via syringe pump at 5mg/ml starting rate of 4ml/hr or \n20mg/hr \nStep 2 If BP remains above target level at 30 minutes increase to 40mg/hr \nStep 3 If BP remains above target level at 30 minutes increase to 80mg/hr \nStep 4 \nIf BP remains above target level at 30 minutes increase to 160mg/hr (maximum \ndose) \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 21 of 39 \n \n9.6 Cumulative maximum dose is 300 mg. If target BP is not achieved, switch to \nanother class of agent. \n9.7 Note - Although manufacturer's labelling recommends against exceeding a 300 \nmg cumulative dose (intermittent IV and continuous infusion) it may be \nreasonable to exceed this threshold in closely monitored patients who are \nresponding. \n9.8 Contraindications \n9.8.1 Labetalol is contra-indicated in patients with a history of oral steroid \ndependent asthma or obstructive airways disease. Oral nifedipine \nwould be the drug of choice in these women/people. In mild asthma \n(i.e. defined as not requiring regular or steroid based oral medication), \nlabetalol may be used with caution and attention paid to the \ndevelopment of bronchospasm. \n \n9.9 Oral nifedipine – Second Line Treatment \n \n9.9.1 Caution - In most cases, use of immediate-release oral nifedipine will \nbe safe and well tolerated; however, there is a risk of an acute, \nprecipitous fall in blood pressure, which may result in a reduction in \nuteroplacental perfusion. The shorter acting preparations of nifedipine \nare also associated with a higher incidence of headache and \ntachycardia. \n9.9.2 Nifidipine used in conjunction with Magnisium sulphate may cause \nprofound hypotension. \n \n9.10 Intravenous hydralazine – Third Line Treatment \nAdequate reduction of blood pressure is less predictable than with IV labetalol \n \nStep 1 5 mg IV gradually over 1 to 2 minutes \nStep 2 \nIf BP remains above target level at 20 minutes, give 5 or 10mg IV over 2 minutes, \ndepending on the initial response \nStep 3 If BP remains above target level at 40 minutes, give 5 or 10mg IV over 2 minutes, \nStep 1 Immediate release nifedipine 10mg orally \nStep 2 \nIf target BP not achieved after 20 minutes administer 10-20mg depending on initial \nresponse \nStep 3 \nIf target BP not achieved after further 20 minutes administer 10-20mg depending on \nprevious response \nStep 4 If target BP not achieved after further 20 minutes switch to another agent \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 22 of 39 \n \ndepending on the initial response \nStep 4 \nIf BP remains above target level at 60 minutes, give 10 mg IV over 2 minutes, depending \non the previous response \n Cumulative maximum dose is 30 mg \n9.11 Consider using up to 500 ml crystalloid fluid before or at the same time as the \nfirst dose of intravenous hydralazine in the antenatal period. \n9.12 If target BP is not achieved, switch to another class of agent. \n9.13 In women/people with severe hypertension who are in critical care, monitor \ntheir response to treatment: \n9.13.1 To ensure that their blood pressure falls \n9.13.2 To identify adverse effects for both the woman and the baby \n9.13.3 To modify treatment according to response \n \n10 Corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation \n10.1 If early birth is considered likely within 7 days in women/people with pre-\neclampsia, offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids in line with the NICE \nguideline on preterm labour and birth. \n10.2 Corticosteroids to manage HELLP syndrome \nDo not use dexamethasone or betamethasone for the treatment of HELLP \nsyndrome. \n11 Fluid balance and volume expansion \n \nDo not use volume expansion in women/people with severe pre-eclampsia unless \nhydralazine is the antenatal antihypertensive \n11.1 In women/people with severe pre-eclampsia, limit maintenance fluids to \n80 ml/hour unless there are other ongoing fluid losses (for example, \nhaemorrhage). \n11.2 The woman should have an indwelling urinary catheter with an hourly urometer \nattached hourly fluid balance should be clearly documented on a fluid balance \nchart \n12 CVP line \n12.1 Should be considered if: \n• oliguria persists despite management with fluid challenges \n• serum albumin <20 \n• any suspicion of HELLP syndrome: Liaise with the anaesthetist \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 23 of 39 \n \n12.2 Referral to critical care: \nRefer women/people with severe hypertension or severe pre-eclampsia to the \nappropriate critical care setting using the criteria in table 4. \n12.3 Clinical criteria for choice of critical care level \n \nLevel 3 care Severe pre-eclampsia and needing ventilation \nLevel 2 care Step-down from level 3 or severe pre-eclampsia with any of the following \ncomplications: \n• eclampsia \n• HELLP syndrome \n• haemorrhage \n• hyperkalaemia \n• severe oliguria \n• coagulation support \n• intravenous antihypertensive treatment \n• initial stabilisation of severe hypertension \n• evidence of cardiac failure \n• abnormal neurology \nLevel 1 care Pre-eclampsia with hypertension \nOngoing conservative antenatal management of severe preterm \nhypertension \nStep-down treatment after the birth \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 24 of 39 \n \n13 Plan for Delivery \n13.1 Involve a senior obstetrician in any decisions on timing of birth for \nwomen/people with pre-eclampsia. \n13.2 Discuss with the anaesthetic team if birth is planned in a woman with severe \npre-eclampsia. \n13.3 Discuss with the neonatal team if birth is planned in a woman with pre-\neclampsia, and neonatal complications are anticipated. \n13.4 Caesarean section versus induction of labour \nChoose mode of birth for women/people with severe hypertension, severe pre-\neclampsia or eclampsia according \n• clinical circumstances \n• gestational age \n• fetal condition \n• womans/persons preference \n\nHypertension & Pre-eclampsia MP019 \nIn Pregnancy (RSCH PRH only) \n \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East Page 25 of 39 \n \n13.5 Decision regarding the timing of delivery as the only cure for pre – eclampsia is \ndelivery \n13.5.1 This should not be attempted before adequate control of BP, \ncoagulopathy;

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy) with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document the protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) to quantify proteinuria, as dipstick alone is insufficient per guideline (Section 7.1).  
   Reason: Guideline recommends PCR >30mg/mmol as threshold for significant proteinuria (Section 2.2.3).  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider CVP line insertion given oliguria (current creatinine 98 µmol/L vs booking 65 µmol/L) and HELLP risk (platelets 98 x10⁹/L, ALT/AST elevation).  
   Reason: Guideline recommends CVP for oliguria unresponsive to fluids or HELLP suspicion (Section 12.1).  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly document discussion of long-term cardiovascular risks (e.g., 2-5x increased hypertension risk post-pre-eclampsia) and postnatal follow-up plan.  
   Reason: Guideline mandates counseling on recurrence risks and cardiovascular disease (Section 19.1-19.4).  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Include MAP calculation (current BP 168/112 mmHg → MAP ~131 mmHg) to guide urgency of treatment.  
   Reason: Guideline defines MAP ≥125 mmHg as obstetric emergency (Section 9).  

2. **Different management plan** - Specify labetalol dosing regimen (e.g., IV bolus vs infusion) and target BP (135/85 mmHg).  
   Reason: Guideline details stepwise IV labetalol protocol (Section 9.4-9.7).  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Document breastfeeding-compatible antihypertensive options (e.g., enalapril/nifedipine) for postnatal planning.  
   Reason: Guideline advises avoiding diuretics/ARBs postpartum (Section 18.1.1).  

### Less Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Record fundoscopic exam findings (e.g., papilledema) given headaches/visual disturbances.  
   Reason: Papilledema is a feature of severe pre-eclampsia (Section 7.2).  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Include written materials on pre-eclampsia symptoms for postnatal vigilance.  
   Reason: Guideline references patient leaflets (Section 20).  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Note exact betamethasone dosing (e.g., 12mg x2 doses 24h apart).  
   Reason: Though recommended for fetal lung maturity (Section 10.1), exact dosing is not critical for guideline compliance.  

### Key Omissions Addressed:  
- **HELLP syndrome criteria**: Platelets <100 x10⁹/L and AST/ALT >70 IU/L meet biochemical criteria (Section 1.6) – consider adding HELLP to assessment.  
- **Fluid restriction**: Guideline limits maintenance fluids to 80 mL/hr in severe pre-eclampsia (Section 11.1) – this should be explicitly stated.  

The note largely aligns with urgent delivery and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (Section 8.3), but could better detail monitoring intervals (e.g., hourly reflexes/respiratory rate post-magnesium, Section 8.7) and anesthetic consultation specifics (Section 13.2).  

Would you like me to refine any specific recommendations further?
