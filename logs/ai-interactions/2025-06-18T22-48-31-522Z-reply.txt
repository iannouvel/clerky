      "newValue": "**Summary of Breech Presentation and ECV Management Guidelines** - **Incidence**: Breech presentation occurs in 3â€“4% of term pregnancies, with higher perinatal risks compared to cephalic presentation. - **Types**: Frank, complete, footling, or kneeling breech. - **Before 36 weeks**: Most breech presentations resolve spontaneously; referral to Day Assessment Unit (DAU) if persistent after 36 weeks. - **ECV**: Recommended at term unless contraindicated (50% success rate), performed by trained obstetricians with informed consent. - **Delivery options**: - **Elective cesarean (LSCS)**: Booked near 39 weeks. - **Vaginal breech birth**: Requires thorough risk assessment (e.g., hyperextended neck, fetal weight extremes, footling presentation). Higher-risk cases should be advised against vaginal delivery. - **Intrapartum care**: - Continuous monitoring, multidisciplinary team involvement. - Lower tolerance for labor delay; expedite delivery if fetal distress occurs. - Assisted maneuvers (e.g., Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit for head delay), no traction on breech. - **Contraindications**: Induction not recommended; cesarean preferred for preterm breech or twin pregnancies with breech-presenting twin. - **Emergency care**: Unplanned breech in labor may require cesarean, especially in first stage. - **Training & governance**: Regular audits, skills drills, and clear communication with patients. - **Patient counseling**: Risks/benefits of ECV, vaginal breech, and cesarean must be discussed",
