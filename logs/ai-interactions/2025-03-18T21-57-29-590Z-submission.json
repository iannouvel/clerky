    "prompt": "You are provided with the text of a clinical note from a patient encounter and a set of clinical guidelines. Your task is to:\n\n1. Cross-check the clinical note against each provided guideline:\n2. Identify areas in the clinical note that do not fully adhere to the guideline recommendations.\n3. Note any parts of the note that could be improved based on the guidelines.\nInclude the full text of each guideline in your response:\n4.
