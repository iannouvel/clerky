      "newValue": "**Summary of Breech Management Guideline v6.0** This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing breech presentation, focusing on **external cephalic version (ECV)** and **vaginal breech birth**. - **ECV** should be offered to pregnant women with confirmed breech presentation after **36 weeks**, unless contraindicated (e.g., placenta previa, fetal compromise). Risks are rare, and prior cesarean is not a contraindication. - Perform ECV in a **labor ward** with facilities for emergency care. Administer **Anti-D** if rhesus negative, document the procedure, and arrange follow-up. - **Vaginal breech birth** is an option if no unfavorable factors (e.g., fetal distress, hyperextended head). Ensure **anterior fetal position** and monitor fetal heart rate. - During delivery, assist by grasping the fetal pelvis, allow the body to hang for head flexion, and use maneuvers if needed (e.g., nuchal arm). - **Complications** (e.g., cord prolapse) require prompt management. **Paired cord blood samples** should be taken post-delivery. - Staff must counsel women on risks, benefits, and alternatives for both ECV and vaginal breech birth. Follow RCOG Green-Top Guideline 20b (2017) standards",
