      "newValue": "**Summary of Failed Intubation in the Obstetric Patient (RSCH PRH) MP044:** This protocol provides guidance for managing failed intubation in obstetric patients requiring general anesthesia. Key principles emphasize measurable standards while allowing for professional judgment. **Scope:** Applies to all peri-partum patients needing general anesthesia. **Responsibilities:** Anaesthetists, midwives, and obstetricians must understand and follow the protocol, applying clinical judgment. The management team ensures protocol accessibility and regular updates. **Background:** Pregnant patients face unique risks (rapid desaturation, aspiration, difficult airway) requiring an algorithmic approach. The OAA/DAS Guidelines (2015) offer structured management for unanticipated difficult airways in this population. **Key Recommendations:** - Use the OAA/DAS algorithm for failed intubation. - Prioritize maternal and fetal status. - Address rapid oxygen desaturation and aspiration risks. - Ensure multidisciplinary teamwork and preparedness.
