      "newValue": "**Summary of Cord Prolapse Management Guideline** Cord prolapse occurs when the umbilical cord descends past the presenting part after membrane rupture, with an incidence of 0.1â€“0.6%. Risk factors include breech presentation, long cord, and artificial rupture of membranes. **Key Recommendations:** - **Antenatal Care:** High-risk pregnancies (e.g., breech) should be reviewed by an obstetric consultant; urgent hospital presentation is advised if labor signs appear. - **Immediate Management:** - Call for help and prepare for emergency caesarean section. - Manual elevation of the presenting part and maternal repositioning (e.g., knee-chest) may relieve cord compression. - **Postnatal Care:** Offer debriefing to reduce post-traumatic stress. - **Training & Audit:** Annual training in obstetric emergencies, including cord prolapse, is required. Submit clinical incident forms and conduct audits for all cases. **Governance:** Aligns with NICE (2023) intrapartum care standards. Replaces prior protocols (MP047, CG12026). Next review due November 2027",
