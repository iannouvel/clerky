She denies fever or dizziness but notes occasional lightheadedness. She is currently 8 weeks pregnant (by last menstrual period) and has had no antenatal care to date.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Bleeding is bright red, with occasional clots, requiring hourly pad changes at its worst.  \n- Pain is crampy, localized to the suprapubic region, and radiates to the lower back.  \n- No history of trauma or recent intercourse.  \n- Previous pregnancies: 3 live births (all vaginal deliveries, no complications), 1 miscarriage at 10 weeks (2022), 1 termination (2021).  \n\n---\n\n### **Past Medical, Surgical, and Gynaecological History**  \n- **Medical:** Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed age 18, on metformin), hypertension (diagnosed postpartum after third delivery).  \n- **Surgical:** Appendectomy (age 15).  \n- **Gynaecological:** History of chlamydia (treated 2020), no cervical screening in past 3 years.  \n\n### **Drug History & Allergies**  \n- **Current Medications:** Metformin 500 mg BD, labetalol 100 mg BD.  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA.  \n\n### **Social History**  \n- **Occupation:** Unemployed (previously worked in retail).  \n- **Smoking:** 10 cigarettes/day since age 16.  \n- **Alcohol:** Occasional binges (estimates 20 units/month).  \n- **Drugs:** Denies recreational drug use.  \n- **Living Situation:** Single, lives with parents; has 3 children (ages 4, 2, and 1).  \n\n### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried this is \"another miscarriage\" or \"something worse, like cancer.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Fear of needing surgery or losing fertility.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"answers today\" and reassurance about the pregnancy’s viability.  \n\n---\n\n### **Examination Findings**  \n**General:** Pale conjunctivae (possible anaemia), obese.  \n**Abdominal:** Soft, tender suprapubically; no guarding/rebound.
