She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] bjog-2022-stock-antenatal-corticosteroids-to-reduce-neonatal-morbidity-and-mortality-pdf\nTitle: BJOG - 2022 - Stock - Antenatal corticosteroids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.pdf\nContent: Antenatal corticosteroids given within seven days prior to preterm birth reduce perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids. Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth, and benefits are still seen if given within 24 hours of birth.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation. Steroids have short-term respiratory benefits for the neonate but may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons. Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended. Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage, corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth is likely. Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. There is limited evidence to recommend repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after administration. The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS in pregnancies that birth between 24 hours and 7 days of administration of the second dose.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids have shown significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage among infants born within specific time frames after administration. There is a reduction in fetal and neonatal death for births within 24 hours to seven days after administration. However, caution is advised in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Population-based cohort studies support the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with the largest effect seen 24 hours to seven days after the first injection. Concerns about potential risks to both women and babies include effects on maternal blood glucose levels, fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, long-term metabolic and neurological consequences, and potential impacts on brain development. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of maternal and neonatal hospital services are available.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should not be delayed in serious maternal or fetal conditions. In the presence of systemic infection, the use of corticosteroids should be carefully balanced due to the risk of exacerbating the infection. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies. The maximum number of corticosteroid courses in pregnancy should not exceed three. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions and to investigate potential off-target effects. Recommendations for future research include determining the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing neonatal morbidity in elective caesarean births at term and investigating the safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancies and women with diabetes. Auditable topics include discussions about corticosteroids in planned caesarean births and the proportion of women offered corticosteroids for preterm birth.

A: ### Very Important Recommendations  
**Different management plan** - The note states betamethasone was given for fetal lung maturity at 36+4 weeks, but the guideline recommends corticosteroids should be **considered** (not routinely offered) between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks, weighing risks (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia) and benefits (short-term respiratory improvement).  
**Reason**: The guideline explicitly states corticosteroids in late preterm (35+0 to 36+6 weeks) require careful risk-benefit discussion, especially as this patient has severe preeclampsia with imminent delivery. The note lacks documentation of this discussion or justification for steroid use. [Reference: Guideline section on "Antenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation."]  

**Improved patient advice** - The note mentions "risks explained" to the partner but does not specify if the risks/benefits of late preterm corticosteroids (e.g., hypoglycemia vs. respiratory benefits) were discussed with the patient.  
**Reason**: The guideline emphasizes informed decision-making for corticosteroids in late preterm births, particularly when maternal conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) may limit time for administration. [Reference: Guideline section on "The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits."]  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
**Additional information needed** - The note does not document whether the patient has diabetes or gestational diabetes, which would require additional insulin and monitoring per the guideline.  
**Reason**: The guideline highlights that women with diabetes should not be excluded from corticosteroids but need close glucose monitoring. [Reference: Guideline section on "Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended."]  

**Different management plan** - The guideline recommends not delaying birth for corticosteroids if maternal/fetal health is at risk, but the note plans delivery "within 6 hours." If maternal stabilization (e.g., BP control) allows, earlier delivery may be preferable.  
**Reason**: The guideline states, "Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby." Severe preeclampsia with clonus and severe hypertension warrants expedited delivery. [Reference: Guideline section on "Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby."]  

### Less Important Recommendations  
**Additional information needed** - The note does not mention whether this is a singleton or multiple pregnancy, which affects corticosteroid recommendations (e.g., limited evidence for twins).  
**Reason**: The guideline notes targeted corticosteroids may be less beneficial in twins. [Reference: Guideline section on "In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons."]  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - The note could explicitly state the betamethasone dose (24 mg) and route (IM) for clarity, though this is likely standard practice.  
**Reason**: The guideline specifies the optimum dose/route. [Reference: Guideline section on "The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly."]  

### Summary of Critical Gaps:  
1. **Lack of documented risk-benefit discussion** for late preterm steroids (very important).  
2. **Potential delay in delivery** for a non-urgent 6-hour window (somewhat important).  
3. **Missing screening for diabetes** (somewhat important).  
**Actionable improvements**:  
- Add a brief note clarifying the rationale for betamethasone (e.g., "Corticosteroids administered after discussion with patient regarding potential respiratory benefits vs. neonatal hypoglycemia risks").  
- Consider earlier delivery if maternal condition deteriorates further.  
- Document diabetes screening status.
