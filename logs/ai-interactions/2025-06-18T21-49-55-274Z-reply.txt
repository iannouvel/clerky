      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower neonatal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Contraindications & risk factors**: Avoid assisted birth with contraindications (e.g., fetal bleeding disorders). Higher failure rates occur with mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short stature, or large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document thoroughly and provide postnatal follow-up discussions. - **Psychological support**: Offer referral to midwife counselors for traumatic births but avoid single-session, high-intensity trauma-focused interventions. - **Safety & reporting**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports for serious events, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
