Currently 36+2 weeks. Previous pregnancies complicated by similar issues. BMI 28. Non-smoker. Partner supportive. Lives locally with good social support.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient reports good compliance with treatment regimen. Symptoms well controlled on current management.

Routine bloods today including glucose tolerance test. Next appointment in 2 weeks. Patient counselled on warning signs and advised to contact triage if concerned. Delivery plan discussed.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n- Patient counselled regarding condition and management options\n- Written information provided\n- Next of kin contacted and updated\n- Documentation completed in patient notes\n- Handover given to on-call team\n\nPLAN:\n- Continuous monitoring as per protocol\n- Serial observations 4-hourly\n- Repeat bloods in 24 hours\n- Consultant review tomorrow morning\n- Discharge planning when appropriate\n\nSigned: Dr. [Name]\nDate: [Current date]\nTime: [Current time]\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH.pdf) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has experienced any episodes of bleeding (spotting, minor, major, or massive hemorrhage) since diagnosis.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes the importance of assessing and documenting the severity of APH (spotting, minor, major, or massive) to guide management (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Definitions and Clinical Assessment\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Specify whether the patient has been admitted or is being managed as an outpatient, given her gestational age (36+2 weeks) and placenta previa.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends hospitalization for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Management of APH\").  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Document whether Anti-D Ig has been administered (if the patient is RhD-negative).  \n   Reason: The guideline states that Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Management of APH\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide explicit counseling on the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and the need for active management of the third stage of labor.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights that PPH should be anticipated in placenta previa cases, and active management is recommended (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Management of APH\").  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a senior pediatrician/neonatologist has been alerted for potential neonatal assessment at delivery.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends neonatal assessment by a senior pediatrician in cases of major APH (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Management of APH\").  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing thromboprophylaxis given the patient's history of recurrent placenta previa and potential hospitalization.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions postnatal thromboprophylaxis as a consideration for women with APH (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Postnatal Issues\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether domestic violence screening has been performed, given the patient's recurrent presentations.  \n   Reason: The guideline suggests asking about domestic violence in women with repeated APH presentations (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Clinical Assessment\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on the signs of clinical shock and when to seek immediate help.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes the importance of recognizing clinical shock due to underestimated blood loss (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Definitions and Clinical Assessment\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been offered debriefing or psychological support.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions debriefing as a postnatal consideration but is less critical in the antepartum phase (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Postnatal Issues\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include statistics on perinatal outcomes related to placenta previa in the counseling.  \n   Reason: While patient education is important, specific statistics are not emphasized in the guideline as a critical component (gtg-2011-aph-pdf, \"Background\").  \n\n### Summary of Key Improvements:\n- Explicitly document bleeding episodes and Anti-D Ig administration.  \n- Clarify inpatient vs. outpatient management.  \n- Strengthen counseling on PPH and neonatal preparedness.  \n- Consider thromboprophylaxis and domestic violence screening.  \n\nThese changes will better align the note with the guideline and improve patient safety.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 53 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
