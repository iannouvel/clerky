Document declined tests. - **Individualized Care:** Tailor care to needs, involving partners if desired. Provide unbiased information and language support where needed. - **Screening & Tests:** Offer blood/urine tests (MSU for preterm risk), discuss blood product consent, and ensure proper documentation. - **High-Risk Groups:** Refer to obstetric consultants for existing conditions, safeguarding concerns, mental health, domestic abuse, or FGM. - **Lifestyle Advice:** Address smoking cessation, alcohol, and weight management (BMI <30). - **Monitoring:** Regular urinalysis, fetal growth assessments, and growth scans if needed. Manage common pregnancy issues (nausea, bleeding, etc.). - **Referrals:** Unexplained bleeding <16wks to EPAC; ≥16wks to labor ward. High-risk women (ethnic minorities, deprived areas, migrants) need closer monitoring. - **Continuity & Communication:** Ensure consistent care, access to online resources, and clear coordination for complex cases. - **Documentation:** Maintain records (risk assessments, test results) and update at each appointment. *References: MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC screening recommendations.*",
