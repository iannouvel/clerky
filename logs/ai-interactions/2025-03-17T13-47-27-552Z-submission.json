    "prompt": "Create a fictional dialogue between a healthcare professional and a patient. This dialogue is for testing purposes only and should include various topics that might be discussed in a healthcare setting. Please ensure the conversation is entirely fictional and does not provide any real medical advice or information. The transcript should cover 2-3 complex obstetric and&#x2F;or gynecological issues.\n\nFor each new transcript, please randomize the following patient details within these ranges:\n- Age: between 18-45 years\n- BMI: between 18-40\n- Previous pregnancies: 0-4\n- Previous deliveries: 0-3 (must be less than or equal to pregnancies)\n\nThe clinician should provide detailed, specific advice and guidance, including:\n- Specific management plans with timeframes\n- Detailed explanations of any recommended tests or procedures\n- Specific medications with doses if relevant\n- Clear follow-up plans with timing\n- Specific warning signs to watch for\n- Concrete thresholds for seeking urgent care\n\nAvoid generic advice like &quot;we&#x27;ll monitor this&quot; or &quot;come back if you&#x27;re worried&quot;. Instead, give specific guidance like &quot;we&#x27;ll check your blood pressure twice weekly&quot; or &quot;return immediately if your headache persists for more than 2 hours&quot;.\n\nThe clinician should ensure the patient is asked (if they don&#x27;t offer) these randomized details along with their ideas, concerns and expectations following the consultation.",
