This analysis focuses on identifying areas where the clinical documentation can be improved according to the specific guideline requirements.\n\nGuideline: Outpatient Hysteroscopy\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nKey recommendations:\n- All gynaecology departments should provide a dedicated outpatient hysteroscopy service for women and people with abnormal uterine bleeding, reproductive problems, and insertion/retrieval of intrauterine devices.\n- Written information should be provided to the woman prior to their appointment, including details about the procedure, benefits and risks, advice regarding pre-operative analgesia, and contact details for the hysteroscopy unit.\n- Women should be made aware of other settings and modes of anaesthesia for hysteroscopy.\n- Women should be advised to alert the clinical team if the procedure becomes too painful or distressing.\n- Vaginoscopy should be the standard technique for outpatient hysteroscopy unless a vaginal speculum is required.\n- Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes.\n- Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view.\n- Conscious sedation should not be routinely used in outpatient hysteroscopic procedures.\n\nWomen should be given verbal and/or written informed consent prior to hysteroscopy, and should be informed of the potential pain and distress during the procedure. A safety checklist should be considered before hysteroscopy, including exclusion of pregnancy. Care after hysteroscopy should include discussing clinical findings, providing contact information, and offering a dedicated recovery area. Training in hysteroscopy should cover basic and advanced skills, and analgesia with NSAIDs or alternatives should be recommended.\n\nA statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, and antispasmodics given prior to hysteroscopy. NSAIDs and TENS showed no significant difference in side effects, while opioids and antispasmodics had a higher likelihood of side effects. Cervical preparation with vaginal prostaglandins can be considered in selected cases, but is associated with side effects and complications. Miniature hysteroscopes of 3.5mm or less in outer diameter should be used for diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy to reduce pain. When performing operative hysteroscopy, smaller diameter hysteroscopes and mechanical tissue removal systems should be used for less pain. The choice of hysteroscope lens angle is at the discretion of the clinician.\n\nAdverse events were not meta-analysed. Image quality showed no significant difference between scope sizes, or found significantly better visualisation with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Studies reported a significant increase in success when using a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Procedural duration was significantly shorter with a miniaturised hysteroscope in some studies. The incidence of vasovagal reactions was significantly lower with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope in one study. Flexible hysteroscopes are associated with less pain during diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy. Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems are preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for endometrial polyp removal. Inactivated mechanical mini-scissors should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for uterine septa removal. Saline is recommended as the distension medium for outpatient hysteroscopy due to less pain, better image quality, and greater patient satisfaction. Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view. Warming saline to body temperature can be considered for outpatient hysteroscopy.\n\nRoutine cervical dilatation should be avoided prior to outpatient hysteroscopy. Blind dilatation of the cervix causes pain, discomfort, and uterine trauma in the outpatient setting. Local anaesthesia should not be routinely administered prior to outpatient hysteroscopy if a vaginoscopic approach is used, but should be considered if a vaginal speculum is planned. The choice of local anaesthetic agent and route of administration should be left to the discretion of the hysteroscopist. Conscious sedation should not be routinely used in outpatient hysteroscopic procedures. If conscious sedation is used, appropriate patient selection and monitoring are essential.\n\nConscious sedation is defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which women respond purposefully to verbal commands. It is imperative to follow guidance on safe use to prevent life-threatening complications. Different sedation levels affect airway, ventilation, and cardiovascular function. Intravenous conscious sedation reduces pain during outpatient hysteroscopy compared to local anesthesia. Inhaled conscious sedation shows the greatest pain reduction but lacks recorded side effects. Close monitoring is necessary to identify and respond to over-sedation. Vaginoscopy is recommended for outpatient hysteroscopy due to reduced pain and quicker procedures. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, but antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected. Standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings is essential.\n\nEffect of cervical preparation with prostaglandins on pain relief and feasibility in outpatient hysteroscopy. Safety, acceptability and feasibility of hysteroscopy according to angle of distal optical lens. Effectiveness of the vaginoscopic approach to outpatient hysteroscopy in relieving pain compared with traditional approaches with local anaesthesia. Relative effectiveness of different types, routes, doses and timings of local anaesthesia on pain and incidence of vasovagal reactions. Effectiveness of warming fluid distension media on pain relief and satisfaction. Effectiveness of methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) on pain relief and satisfaction. Assessment of specific operative hysteroscopic technologies including endometrial ablative devices, regarding pain, acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness. Evaluation of technical, analgesic, anaesthetic and sedative interventions for specific operative outpatient hysteroscopic procedures. Qualitative research exploring patient experience and preferences. Qualitative research exploring patient recovery and return to daily activity following outpatient hysteroscopy. Units should consider collecting data for quality assurance purposes. Provision of pre-appointment written information on OPH ≥ 95%. Mean peak intra-procedural pain score (on an 11-point Visual Analogue Scale) for various procedures. Procedure acceptability for diagnostic hysteroscopy, hysteroscopic polypectomy, and endometrial ablation. Mean overall level of care for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Compliance with safety checklists for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Documentation completion rates for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Vasovagal reaction rates for diagnostic hysteroscopy, hysteroscopic polypectomy & endometrial ablation. Rates of uterine/cervical trauma, infection, hospital admission, and hospital readmission for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. No reliable data for operative outpatient myomectomy or removal of retained products of conception. No data available for outpatient endometrial ablation. No data available for outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy or outpatient endometrial ablation. No data available for outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy or outpatient endometrial ablation. Recommended quality assurance tools for outpatient hysteroscopy include patient satisfaction surveys and the BSGE Surgical Information Collection System.\n\nHysteroscopy: Prospective randomized trials on pain management during outpatient hysteroscopy have been conducted, evaluating the use of various analgesic methods such as music, virtual reality, nitrous oxide, lidocaine, tramadol, misoprostol, diclofenac, and other medications. These studies have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in reducing pain associated with hysteroscopy. Additionally, studies have evaluated the optimal timing and methods of cervical preparation prior to hysteroscopy in different patient populations. Complications such as uterine perforation have also been reported in some cases.\n\nOUTPATIENT HYSTEROSCOPY\nSeveral clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of different medications for cervical priming before hysteroscopy, including misoprostol, carboprost methylate suppository, and vaginal dinoprostone. These studies have shown varying levels of efficacy and pain relief in different patient populations. Additionally, studies comparing different types of hysteroscopes, such as flexible versus rigid endoscopes, have been conducted to determine the feasibility and patient discomfort associated with each type. Overall, the choice of medication and hysteroscope type can impact the success and patient experience of outpatient hysteroscopy.\n\nPain management in outpatient hysteroscopy is important for patient comfort and procedure completion rates. Various methods, such as warm saline distension media, topical anesthesia, and paracervical blocks, have been studied in randomized controlled trials to assess their efficacy in reducing pain during hysteroscopy. These studies have shown promising results in improving patient comfort and procedural outcomes.\n\nOutpatient hysteroscopy: traditional versus the “no-touch” technique. Randomized studies comparing different hysteroscopy techniques and antibiotic use. Fatal systemic infection following hysteroscopy. Meta-analysis on antibiotic prophylaxis for hysteroscopy. Comparison of outpatient vs inpatient polyp treatment. Local anesthesia during endometrial ablation: a systematic review.
