Asked to review CTG due to >4:10 and 1x ?decel

P0 40+1
PROM since 18/2 14:00
Prostin at midnight
No symptoms of infection
Good fetal movements
Background
Additional Information
Under Miss Sinclair (Mat Med) Dr Postlethwaite (Obs Physician) and Dr Knibb (Neurologist)

Background
Same sex relationship Insemination with donor sperm
Epilepsy - Keppra 500 mg BD
Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD)
PTSD
Hard of hearing due to glue ear
Plan of care in labour is early epidural (from 4cm) and avoidance of stress / dehydration / pain as this would increase the risk of seizure
Assessment
Review
Appears well
Mild contractions, lasting up to 1 min, 4-5:10
FHR N over time, stable with accels, in N range
Abdo soft, palpable tightenings, good resting tone
MEOWS 0
Hb N, WBC 20, CRP 4

Advice
Discussed rest, coming off CTG, treatment if strength / length of contractions increases

Advised some sort of help to ensure well rested for labour - antihistamines 'caution' with BNF ?incr risk seizures, oxazepam reasonable

Advised currently just over 4:10, FHR N, no need for reversal, given 1x ?decel, to continue FHR trace for 30 more mins, if remains same, can come off and repeat in 4 hours, get some rest
