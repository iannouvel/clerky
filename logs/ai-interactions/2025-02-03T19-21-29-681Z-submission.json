    "prompt": "Please determine the significant issues within the attached text related to a clinical encounter.\nThe text is below\nPlease return the issues as a list:\n\nRules:\nOne line per issue\nMerge similar issues into one single issue\nEach issue should be essentially a subject-heading for an aspect of the clinical encounter, so if the patient's only issue is post-menopausal bleeding, the only issue listed should be 'post-menopausal bleeding', not 'vaginal bleeding', 'menopausal', 'need for transvaginal ultrasound', 'need for endometrial sampling'.\nMaximum 50 characters per issue\nExpress each issue in medical vernacular ie use 'obesity' rather than 'overweight'\nAvoid generic issues like 'Pregnancy Risks'\nIf one issue line is related to symptoms, and another line is related to testing or management, merge these issues into a single issue, ie 'symptoms of anaemia' and 'iron level testing' are essentially both related to anaemia, so the issue should be 'Anaemia'.\nIf necessary and appropriate, offer context, ie 'Morbid obesity: BMI 44'\n\nBelow is the text related to the encounter:\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\n[The scene opens in an obstetrician/gynaecologist's office. Dr. Smith, the OB/GYN, is seated at the desk, reviewing the patient's medical records. Mrs. Johnson, a 35-year-old pregnant woman, is sitting on the examination table, looking concerned.]\n\nDr. Smith: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?\n\nMrs. Johnson: Hello, Dr. Smith. I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms, and I'm worried about my pregnancy.\n\nDr. Smith: I understand, Mrs. Johnson. Let's start by discussing your symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\n\nMrs. Johnson: Well, I've been having severe abdominal pain, especially on my right side. I've also noticed some vaginal bleeding, which has me really worried.\n\nDr. Smith: I see. Those are concerning symptoms. Let me take a look at your medical records and see if we need to run some tests. [Dr. Smith reviews Mrs. Johnson's records, noting her previous history of endometriosis and a previous ectopic pregnancy.]\n\nDr. Smith: Mrs. Johnson, based on your symptoms and medical history, I'd like to perform a transvaginal ultrasound to assess the status of your pregnancy and rule out any complications. I'll also order some blood tests to check your hormone levels and assess for any signs of infection.\n\nMrs. Johnson: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your thoroughness. Can you please explain what these tests will involve and what we're looking for?\n\nDr. Smith: Of course, Mrs. Johnson. The transvaginal ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure that uses sound waves to create images of your reproductive organs. We'll be looking for the location of the pregnancy, any signs of ectopic pregnancy, and the overall health of the fetus. The blood tests will help us assess your hormone levels and check for any signs of infection that could be causing your symptoms.\n\n[After the tests are completed, Dr. Smith reviews the results with Mrs. Johnson.]\n\nDr. Smith: Mrs. Johnson, the ultrasound shows that you have a suspected ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy located outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. This can be a serious condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent complications.\n\nMrs. Johnson: Oh no, that's really concerning. What are our next steps, Dr. Smith?\n\nDr. Smith: Given your history of endometriosis and previous ectopic pregnancy, we need to act quickly to address this. I recommend a laparoscopic surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy and assess the health of your fallopian tubes. This procedure is minimally invasive and has been shown to be safe for both you and the baby.\n\nMrs. Johnson: I trust your expertise, Dr. Smith. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I just want to make sure we're doing what's best for my health and the baby's.\n\nDr. Smith: Absolutely, Mrs. Johnson. Your health and safety are our top priorities. We'll schedule the surgery as soon as possible to address the ectopic pregnancy and ensure your well-being. I'll also consult with our team to ensure we provide you with the best possible care throughout this process.\n\n[The consultation concludes with Dr. Smith providing Mrs. Johnson with detailed information about the surgery, recovery process, and follow-up care. Mrs. Johnson leaves the office feeling reassured and confident in the treatment plan outlined by Dr. Smith.]"
