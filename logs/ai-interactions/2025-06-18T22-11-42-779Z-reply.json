The vaccine is 70-80% effective against severe TB (e.g., meningitis). **Key Recommendations:** - **Eligibility:** Infants at increased TB risk; exclude if SCID detected, immunosuppressed, or with contraindications (e.g., fever, HIV+, untreated skin conditions). - **Procedure:** Administer 0.05ml (under 12 months) or 0.1ml (over 12 months) intradermally in the left upper arm. - **Documentation:** Verify identity, SCID screening result, and consent. Record vaccine details (batch, expiry) in EPMA and PCHR. - **Timing:** Vaccinate by 28 days; defer if SCID result pending. Avoid other vaccines in the same arm for 3 months. - **Follow-up:** Provide post-vaccine advice; monitor for local reactions (e.g., soreness, lump). Report data to PHE monthly. **Roles:** Trained nurses/midwives administer BCG; NIPE practitioners ensure referrals. Public Health Midwives track eligibility via NIPE/Medway reports. **Contraindications:** Active immunosuppression, maternal HIV (unless low-risk), or no SCID result. **Performance Metrics:** Monitor vaccination rates by 28 days and delays. Ensure failsafe checks for missed referrals\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
