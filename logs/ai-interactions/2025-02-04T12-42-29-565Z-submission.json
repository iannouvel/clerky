    "prompt": "Please determine the significant issues within the attached text related to a clinical encounter.\nThe text is below\nPlease return the issues as a list:\n\nRules:\nOne line per issue\nMerge similar issues into one single issue\nEach issue should be essentially a subject-heading for an aspect of the clinical encounter, so if the patient's only issue is post-menopausal bleeding, the only issue listed should be 'post-menopausal bleeding', not 'vaginal bleeding', 'menopausal', 'need for transvaginal ultrasound', 'need for endometrial sampling'.\nMaximum 50 characters per issue\nExpress each issue in medical vernacular ie use 'obesity' rather than 'overweight'\nAvoid generic issues like 'Pregnancy Risks'\nIf one issue line is related to symptoms, and another line is related to testing or management, merge these issues into a single issue, ie 'symptoms of anaemia' and 'iron level testing' are essentially both related to anaemia, so the issue should be 'Anaemia'.\nIf necessary and appropriate, offer context, ie 'Morbid obesity: BMI 44'\n\nBelow is the text related to the encounter:\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\n[The scene opens in an obstetrician/gynaecologist's office. Dr. Smith, the OB/GYN, is seated at the desk, reviewing the patient's chart. Mrs. Johnson, a 35-year-old pregnant woman, is sitting on the examination table, looking concerned.]\n\nDr. Smith: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?\n\nMrs. Johnson: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms, and I'm worried about my pregnancy.\n\nDr. Smith: I understand. Let's start by checking your vital signs and discussing your symptoms. Could you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\n\n[Mrs. Johnson describes her symptoms of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and itching. Dr. Smith listens attentively and takes notes.]\n\nDr. Smith: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Johnson. Based on your symptoms, I'd like to perform a physical examination and some tests to investigate further. I'll also refer to some guidelines to ensure we cover all aspects of your care.\n\n[Dr. Smith performs a physical examination and orders blood tests, including liver function tests and a complete blood count. While waiting for the results, she discusses the guidelines relevant to Mrs. Johnson's case.]\n\nDr. Smith: Mrs. Johnson, your symptoms could be indicative of several conditions, including ectopic pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and possibly even a miscarriage. I'll be referencing the guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy, Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy, and Management of Unscheduled Bleeding on HRT to guide our next steps.\n\nMrs. Johnson: Oh, I see. I've heard of some of those conditions before. Can you explain more about what they are and how they might affect my pregnancy?\n\nDr. Smith: Of course, Mrs. Johnson. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It can be a serious condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent complications. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver disorder that can cause itching and elevated bile acids, potentially leading to preterm birth and other issues. As for unscheduled bleeding on HRT, it's important to investigate the cause and adjust your hormone replacement therapy accordingly.\n\n[Mrs. Johnson nods, absorbing the information.]\n\nDr. Smith: Once we have the test results, we'll be able to tailor our approach to your care more specifically. In the meantime, I'll also consider the guidelines on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics and Antenatal Care to ensure we address any potential complications.\n\n[Mrs. Johnson looks relieved to have a plan in place.]\n\nMrs. Johnson: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your thoroughness and expertise in managing my care. I feel more at ease knowing we have a comprehensive approach.\n\nDr. Smith: You're welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Your health and well-being are my top priorities, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's wait for the test results and then discuss our next steps based on the guidelines and your individual needs.\n\n[The consultation concludes with Dr. Smith reassuring Mrs. Johnson and emphasizing the importance of ongoing communication and collaboration in her care.]"
