After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless no prior testing was done (check random glucose; if ≥7mmol/L, consult the team). - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Urgent referral if glucose >11.0mmol/L or fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise changes. Corticosteroid use may require hospitalization for glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment. - **Labor/delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Postpartum, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. Breastfeeding individuals should monitor frequently. - **Monitoring**: Include 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam. Self-monitor blood glucose; discuss corticosteroid risks. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidance; prioritize GDM patients. - **Emergencies**: Immediate medical attention required for diabetic emergencies. Regular audits ensure care quality",
