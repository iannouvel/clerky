Fast bleep the Obstetric Registrar for clinical deterioration or unconsciousness. **Specialist Involvement**: Consult non-maternity specialists for complex complications after discussion with the maternity team. **Common Causes**: Major haemorrhage, cardiovascular events, thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, eclampsia, anaphylaxis, and metabolic disturbances. **Anaphylaxis Management**: Remove triggers, follow ABCDE, administer adrenaline, chlorphenamine, and hydrocortisone. **Resuscitation**: Follow Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines. Left uterine displacement for aortocaval compression â‰¥20 weeks. Consider delivery within 5 minutes of cardiac arrest. **Debriefing**: Essential for the woman, family, and staff to address PTSD, depression, and anxiety. **Training**: Annual multidisciplinary training in advanced life support and maternal collapse management is mandatory. **Documentation**: Accurate records and incident reporting are crucial",
