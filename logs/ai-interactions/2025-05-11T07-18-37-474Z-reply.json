She reports intermittent heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking through a pad every 2 hours) lasting 7–10 days, accompanied by clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but notes occasional pelvic discomfort.  \n\n**Relevant History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12, previously regular cycles (28–30 days).  \n- No history of dysmenorrhea.  \n- Last menstrual period: [Fictional Date].  \n- Contraception: None currently; prior use of oral contraceptive pills (discontinued 2 years ago).  \n- Obstetric history: 4 uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, 1 first-trimester miscarriage.  \n- Medical history: Mild iron-deficiency anemia (treated with oral iron in the past). No known bleeding disorders.  \n- Medications: Occasional ibuprofen for pain.  \n- Allergies: NKDA.  \n- Family history: Mother with fibroids; no known clotting disorders.  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects of History (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- Sexual history (e.g., recent STI screening, dyspareunia) not elicited.  \n- Thyroid symptoms (fatigue, weight changes) not explored.  \n- Detailed medication reconciliation (e.g., herbal supplements) omitted.  \n\n---\n\n### **Objective Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/76 mmHg | HR: 78 bpm | Temp: 36.8°C  \n- Weight: 68 kg | Height: 167 cm | BMI: 24.4  \n\n**Focused Exam:**  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender. No palpable masses.  \n- Pelvic exam (deferred today due to patient preference).  \n- No external lesions or signs of trauma.  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects of Exam (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- Speculum/bimanual exam not performed.  \n- Thyroid/breast exam not documented.  \n\n---\n\n### **Assessment:**  \n**Working Diagnosis:**  \nAbnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), likely secondary to:  \n1. **Structural causes:** Fibroids or endometrial polyps (given parity/family history).  \n2. **Non-structural:** Anovulation (consider PCOS, thyroid dysfunction—pending further evaluation).  \n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**  \n- Endometrial hyperplasia  \n- Coagulopathy (less likely, but not ruled out)  \n- Iatrogenic (e.g., medication effect)  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - **Pelvic ultrasound:** Assess for fibroids, polyps, endometrial thickness.  \n   - **Labs:** CBC (evaluate anemia), TSH, coagulation panel (if indicated), β-hCG (to rule out pregnancy).  \n   - **Endometrial biopsy:** Consider if ultrasound shows thickened endometrium or age >35 with risk factors.  \n\n2. **Management:**  \n   - **Symptomatic relief:** Tranexamic acid (if heavy bleeding persists).  \n   - **Hormonal options:** Trial of combined oral contraceptives (if no contraindications) or progesterone therapy.  \n   - **Iron supplementation:** Reinitiate if anemia confirmed.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Return in 2 weeks for results and further discussion of surgical (e.g., hysteroscopy) vs. medical management.  \n   - Counsel on tracking bleeding patterns via diary.  \n\n**Patient Instructions:**  \n- Seek urgent care if hemodynamically unstable (e.g., dizziness, syncope).  \n- Avoid NSAIDs if bleeding worsens.  \n\n**Clinician Note:**  \n*History and exam intentionally incomplete per testing parameters.
