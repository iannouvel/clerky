Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4.

We should run some tests to determine the cause.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I've also been having pain during intercourse.\n\nHealthcare Professional: That's concerning. It's important to investigate the underlying cause of your dyspareunia. We may need to perform a pelvic exam and possibly imaging studies.\n\nPatient: I understand. I've also been trying to conceive without success for the past year.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Infertility can be challenging, but we can explore different options to help you achieve pregnancy. We may need to assess your ovarian reserve and your partner's fertility as well.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your help and guidance. I appreciate your thorough approach to addressing my concerns.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Of course, we're here to support you every step of the way. Let's work together to find the best solutions for your health needs."
