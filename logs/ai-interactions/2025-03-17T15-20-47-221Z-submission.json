    "prompt": "Read the clinical scenario below\nList the significant issues as brief, single-line statements. \nWhen multiple issues might be related by a clinical entity, combine them into one concise issue. \nEach issue must be 60 characters or fewer. \nDo not number the issues; simply list one per line.\nPlease only generate 2-3 issues for most patients.\nFor complex patients, perhaps 5 issues, for very complex patients 7. \nUse medical words where possible. \n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\nDictation:\n\nPatient Encounter\nDate: [Today's Date]\n\nPatient Information:\nName: Mrs. Jane Doe\nAge: 34 years\nWeight: 120 kg\nBMI: 49\nOccupation: Office Manager\nNumber of Prior Pregnancies: 4\n\nChief Complaint:\nMrs. Doe presents today with concerns regarding heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain.\n\nHistory of Presenting Complaint:\nMrs. Doe reports experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding for the past six months, with clots and prolonged periods lasting up to 10 days. She also describes intermittent pelvic pain, especially during menstruation, which has been progressively worsening.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Hypertension\n- Type 2 Diabetes\n- Obesity\n- Depression\n\nPast Surgical History:\n- Cesarean section x 4\n\nGynecological History:\n- Regular menstrual cycles prior to the onset of heavy bleeding\n- No history of abnormal pap smears\n- No history of sexually transmitted infections\n\nDrug History:\n- Metformin\n- Lisinopril\n- Sertraline\n\nAllergy History:\n- No known drug allergies\n\nSocial History:\nMrs. Doe is an office manager, married with four children. She denies tobacco or alcohol use.\n\nIdeas, Concerns, and Expectations:\nMrs. Doe is concerned about the impact of her symptoms on her daily life and is interested in finding a solution to alleviate her heavy bleeding and pelvic pain.\n\nExamination Findings:\nOn examination, Mrs. Doe appears uncomfortable due to pelvic tenderness. Abdominal examination reveals no masses or organomegaly. Pelvic examination shows a bulky, tender uterus with no adnexal masses palpated.\n\nManagement Advice and Guidance:\nBased on Mrs. Doe's history and examination findings, the heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain are likely due to conditions such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis. Further investigations such as an ultrasound and possibly an MRI may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the interim, management options may include:\n1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief\n2. Oral contraceptives or hormonal IUDs to help regulate menstrual bleeding\n3. Tranexamic acid to reduce heavy bleeding\n4. Referral to a gynecologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical options if needed.\n\nMrs. Doe should also be counseled on lifestyle modifications to help manage her conditions, including weight loss to improve her overall health and potentially reduce symptoms.\n\nFollow-up:\nMrs. Doe will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review investigation results and discuss further management options.\n\nDictated by: Dr. A.
