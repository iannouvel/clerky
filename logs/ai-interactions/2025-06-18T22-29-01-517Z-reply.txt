Rule out differentials (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis). - **Investigations:** Use cervical swabs (NAAT for *Chlamydia/gonorrhea*), pregnancy test, and ultrasound if complications (e.g., abscess) are suspected. - **Treatment:** - **Outpatient:** Ceftriaxone IM + doxycycline + metronidazole (14 days). - **Inpatient:** IV ceftriaxone + doxycycline ± metronidazole, switching to oral therapy after 24–48 hours if improved. - **Pregnancy:** Use safe antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin for *Chlamydia*). Avoid doxycycline. - **Complications:** Manage tubo-ovarian abscess with drainage if needed; consider IUCD removal if severe. - **Partner Management:** Treat all sexual partners within 60 days; abstain until treatment completion. - **Follow-up:** Reassess at 3 days for improvement; retest for STIs if persistent symptoms. **Key Points:** Early treatment reduces infertility risk. Counsel on STI prevention and adherence to therapy",
