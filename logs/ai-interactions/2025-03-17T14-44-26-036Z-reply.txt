- 32-year-old pregnant female presenting with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding
- Previous history of miscarriage, BMI 25
- Concerned about the health of her baby

In this scenario, Sarah, a 32-year-old pregnant teacher with a BMI of 25, presents with severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and dizziness. She had a previous miscarriage and no other complications. Physical examination revealed signs of placental abruption, necessitating immediate hospital admission for further evaluation and management.

Plan:
1. Admit the patient to the hospital for monitoring and management of placental abruption.
2. Consider interventions such as emergency cesarean section based on the severity of the abruption.
3. Provide close monitoring to ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the baby.
