      "newValue": "**Summary of 20-Week Anomaly Scan Protocol** The 20-week anomaly scan screens for major fetal anomalies, including anencephaly, spina bifida, cardiac defects, and trisomies 18/13. Key anatomical structures (head, spine, heart, abdomen, limbs) must be examined and documented. **Key Recommendations:** - **Fibroids:** Seek second opinion if concerning; no routine rescans or growth scans unless clinically indicated. - **Placenta:** Assess location; follow up for low-lying placenta/praevia. Suspect placenta accreta if placental lakes >50%, bridging vessels, or abnormal Doppler signals. - **Vasa Praevia:** Use Doppler to identify fetal vessels near cervix; refer to ANST if suspected. - **Referrals:** Promptly communicate suspected abnormalities. Normal variants need no referral. Refer placental masses, large lakes, or succenturiate lobes to fetal medicine. - **Pathways:** Follow specific protocols for echogenic bowel, renal pylectasia, ventriculomegaly, talipes, adnexal masses, and amniotic bands. - **Documentation:** Archive required images; update maternity records and notify relevant teams (midwife, consultant, pediatrician). **High-Risk Pregnancies:** Include uterine artery Dopplers. Postnatal counseling and neonatal monitoring may be needed for certain findings. *Review Date: February 2027*",
