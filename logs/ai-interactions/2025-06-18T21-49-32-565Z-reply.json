Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding; initiate skin-to-skin contact post-birth. Support mothers in expressing milk if separated from their baby. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for colostrum or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes if needed. Limit supplementation and avoid teat use to prevent nipple confusion. - **Formula Feeding:** Provide guidance on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is recommended for hospital use. - **Parent Support:** Promote skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, and safe sleeping practices (cot by the bed). Address feeding problems with assessments and referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring:** Track supplementation rates and feeding cues. Weigh newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10. The guideline prioritizes individualized care, parental education, and maintaining breastmilk supply while respecting feeding choices\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
