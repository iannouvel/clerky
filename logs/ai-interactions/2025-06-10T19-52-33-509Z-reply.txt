  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\n**Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Ectopic Pregnancy (Fictional for Testing Purposes Only)**  \n\n**Patient Details:**  \n- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  \n- Age: 32 years  \n- Gender: Female  \n- Weight: 68 kg  \n- Occupation: Office administrator  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP): Approximately 6 weeks ago  \n\n**Presenting Complaint:**  \nThe patient presents with a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain, predominantly on the right side, described as sharp and intermittent. She reports associated light vaginal spotting but denies heavy bleeding. She also notes mild dizziness but no syncope.  \n\n**Relevant History:**  \n- **Obstetric history:** G2P1 (one previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery, no known miscarriages).  \n- **Contraception:** Stopped oral contraceptive pills 4 months ago; no recent barrier use.  \n- **Medical history:** Mild asthma (no recent exacerbations).  \n- **Surgical history:** Appendectomy at age 18.  \n- **Medications:** Salbutamol PRN, no recent antibiotics.  \n- **Allergies:** No known drug allergies.  \n- **Social history:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* Sexual history and recent partner details were not explored.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, afebrile, SpO2 98% on room air.  \n- **Abdomen:** Mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa with no guarding or rebound. No palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum exam:** Minimal blood in the vault; cervix appears closed.  \n- **Bimanual exam:** Cervical motion tenderness present; right adnexal tenderness noted. Left adnexa non-tender.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* No documentation of uterine size or further characterization of adnexal masses.  \n\n**Investigations:**  \n- **Urine hCG:** Positive.  \n- **Bedside ultrasound (limited):** No intrauterine gestational sac visualized. Right adnexal mass noted but no free fluid seen.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nSuspected ectopic pregnancy given positive hCG, absent intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound, and right adnexal tenderness.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent formal transvaginal ultrasound** to confirm location of pregnancy and assess for hemoperitoneum.  \n2. **Serial beta-hCG monitoring** if diagnosis remains uncertain.  \n3. **Counsel patient on warning signs** (severe pain, heavy bleeding, syncope) and advise immediate return if these occur.  \n4. **Discuss potential treatment options** (methotrexate vs. surgical intervention) pending confirmatory imaging.  \n5. **Avoid NSAIDs** until ectopic ruled out due to bleeding risk.  \n\n*Clinician’s note:* Patient was not asked about Rh status or desire for future fertility.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Arrange OBGYN review within 24 hours.  \n- If hemodynamically unstable, escalate to emergency department.  \n\n**End of Dictation.**  \n\n*Disclaimer: This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is given or implied.*\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status of the patient.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends anti-D immunoglobulin for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy (Section: \"Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss long-term fertility prospects and desire for future fertility with the patient.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes discussing long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy (Section: \"Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy should be discussed with patients\").  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Include a single serum b-hCG level at diagnosis and consider a repeat in 48 hours if needed.  \n   Reason: The guideline states that a single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management, and a repeat in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management (Section: \"A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Explore sexual history and recent partner details.  \n   Reason: The guideline implies comprehensive history-taking for risk factors (e.g., tubal damage, smoking), though not explicitly stated.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on treatment options and support services, including patient support groups.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends offering support and counseling, including access to patient support groups (Section: \"Support and counseling should be offered to women undergoing treatment, including access to patient support groups and local bereavement counseling services\").  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Document uterine size and further characterize adnexal masses during examination.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes detailed ultrasound criteria for diagnosing ectopic pregnancies (Section: \"Ultrasound is the primary diagnostic modality... with specific criteria for identification\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss the 3-month waiting period before trying to conceive after methotrexate treatment.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends waiting at least 3 months post-methotrexate due to fetal development concerns (Section: \"It is recommended to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again after methotrexate treatment\").  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document if the patient has any risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (e.g., smoking, prior tubal surgery).  \n   Reason: The guideline notes smoking as a risk factor, though this is less critical for immediate management (Section: \"Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest muscle relaxation training if methotrexate is chosen.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions this as a potential benefit but is not critical (Section: \"Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial for women undergoing treatment with methotrexate\").  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document if the patient has access to a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends such services but does not impact immediate care (Section: \"Providers of early pregnancy care should offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service\").\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 48 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
