**Fictional Clinical Dictation – Complex Obstetric/Gynaecological Scenario**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (fictional)  
- **Age:** 31 years  
- **Weight:** 115 kg  
- **BMI:** 42 (obesity class III)  
- **Gravida:** 3 (prior pregnancies)  
- **Para:** 2 (2 live births, 0 miscarriages, 0 terminations)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of heavy, irregular vaginal bleeding associated with pelvic pain. She reports passing clots and fatigue due to blood loss. She also describes dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) over the last 3 months.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Bleeding episodes occur unpredictably, lasting 7–10 days, with 2–3 weeks between episodes.  
- Pain is dull and central, worsening during menstruation.  
- No recent trauma or foreign body use.  
- No fever, urinary, or bowel symptoms.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 3 weeks ago but was unusually heavy.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed aged 25.  
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin).  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril).  
- Depression (on sertraline).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x2 (2018, 2020).  
- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (2019).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche aged 12.  
- Cycles typically irregular (every 35–60 days).  
- No history of STIs.  
- Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  
- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception currently).  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1g BD.  
- Lisinopril 10mg OD.  
- Sertraline 50mg OD.  
- Over-the-counter iron supplements (self-initiated for fatigue).  

**Allergy History:**  
- Penicillin – rash.  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a school administrator.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  
- Alcohol: 4–6 units/week.  
- Lives with partner and 2 children.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried bleeding may indicate cancer or fibroids.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about impact on fertility (desires future pregnancy).  
- **Expectations:** Wants a "clear explanation" and treatment to stop bleeding.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, pale conjunctiva (possible anaemia).  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no lesions, minimal fresh bleeding.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  

**Investigations Requested:**  
1. **Bloods:** FBC (anaemia screen), HbA1c, coagulation screen.  
2. **Pelvic ultrasound:** Assess for fibroids, endometrial thickness, ovarian pathology.  
3. **Endometrial biopsy:** Given obesity and irregular bleeding (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Immediate:**  
   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS for heavy bleeding.  
   - Discuss weight loss (BMI 42 increases surgical/anesthetic risks).  
2. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review ultrasound/biopsy results.  
   - If benign: Consider Mirena IUS (first-line for heavy bleeding) or progesterone therapy.  
   - If abnormal: Hysteroscopy +/- resection.  
3. **Long-term:**  
   - Optimise diabetes/hypertension pre-conception if future pregnancy desired.  
   - Smoking cessation referral.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured no obvious malignancy found today but biopsy essential.  
- Advised that obesity exacerbates PCOS symptoms and bleeding.  
- Offered counselling re: fertility options if biopsy normal.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Follow-up in 2 weeks with results.  
- Urgent referral if bleeding worsens (e.g., syncope).

**Second Scenario (Complex Gynaecological):**  
*[Would cover a 31-year-old with BMI 42, history of 3 prior pregnancies, presenting with chronic pelvic pain and suspected adenomyosis. Include similar detail on history/exam/management.]*
