A: Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Twin Pregnancy with Obstetric Cholestasis  
Patient Details:  
Name: [Fictional Name] Sarah Ahmed  
Age: 32  
BMI: 24.7 (weight 68 kg, height 1.66 m)  
Gravida: 2, Para: 1 (previous spontaneous vaginal delivery at term)  
Current Gestation: 32+2 weeks (DCDA twins confirmed on early scan)  
Booking bloods and anomaly scans: Unremarkable  

History of Presenting Complaint:  
Ms. Ahmed presents with a 10-day history of worsening pruritus, predominantly affecting her palms and soles, with associated sleep disturbance. She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.  

Relevant Obstetric History:  
Previous pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.  
No history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.  
No history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.  

Relevant Medical History:  
Mild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).  
No known liver or gallbladder disease.  

Medications & Allergies:  
Currently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.  
No known drug allergies.  

Social History:  
Lives with husband and toddler son.  
Non-smoker; does not consume alcohol.  
Works part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.  

Examination Findings:  
General: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.  
Abdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.  
Twins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.  
No uterine tenderness or signs of labour.  
No peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.  

Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):  
Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available.  
No record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.  
No documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.  

Impression:  
Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Plan postnatal follow-up to confirm resolution. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.  

Management Plan:  
Investigations:  
Serum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.  
Fasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.  
Full blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).  
CTG to assess fetal wellbeing.  
Growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers only if clinically indicated (e.g., severe symptoms or comorbidities).  

Medical Management:  
Consider ursodeoxycholic acid only for symptomatic relief if pruritus is severe.  
Consider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.  

Ongoing Care and Delivery Planning:  
Weekly bile acids and LFTs.  
Focus on fetal movement monitoring rather than routine CTGs/growth scans.  
Reserve earlier delivery only for cases with bile acids ≥100 µmol/L.  

Counseling Provided:  
Discussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.  
Reassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.  
Advised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.  
Provided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.
