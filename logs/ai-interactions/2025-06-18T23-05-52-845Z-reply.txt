It applies to midwives, neonatal staff, and maternity support workers. **Key Recommendations:** - **Assessment:** A full breastfeeding assessment must precede tongue tie evaluation, ensuring proper positioning/latch. Use the Tongue Tie Assessment and Division Clinic form and Frenulotomy Safety Checklist. - **Referral:** Refer to Tongue Tie Clinic only for feeding concerns linked to tongue tie. - **Procedure:** Frenulotomy can be performed ad-hoc by trained practitioners. No anesthetic is needed. Ensure clinical area has emergency access, lighting, and privacy. - **Contraindications:** Thick frenulum or visible blood vessels require specialist referral. - **Pre-procedure:** Obtain informed consent, explain risks, and document discussions. - **Post-procedure:** Encourage immediate feeding to stop bleeding. Provide follow-up care and information leaflets. Monitor for complications. - **Audit:** Outcomes are tracked by the Infant Feeding Team. **Note:** Babies must receive IM vitamin K (or 2 oral doses) before the procedure. Persistent bleeding warrants medical attention",
