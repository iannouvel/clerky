Consent is required. - **Referrals**: Made to audiology based on results/risk factors. Twins/multiples require verified IDs. Referrals tracked via S4H. - **Governance**: Monthly/quarterly KPI reports; incidents reported internally and escalated. - **Training**: Staff complete national ECA and Level 3 Diploma (exempt if registered). Annual competency reassessment via e-learning/observation. - **Equipment & QA**: Daily QA checks; failed tests trigger investigation/re-training. Missed screens prompt follow-up. - **Special Cases**: Foster care, out-of-area births, child deaths, and declines require specific protocols (e.g., safeguarding checks, decline forms, audiology notifications). - **Failsafes**: Regular audits (S4H/SEMA) to ensure no missed screens; NICU babies require AOAE/AABR. - **Outcome Codes**: Track incomplete, referred, or declined screens. Key focus: Early detection, standardized pathways, and robust governance to ensure timely intervention",
