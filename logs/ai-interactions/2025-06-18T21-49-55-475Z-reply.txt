      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Operators should select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum use is linked to neonatal cephalohematoma and retinal hemorrhage but not increased cesarean rates or low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Ultrasound is recommended if fetal head position is uncertain. - **Post-birth care**: Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document thoroughly and provide postnatal follow-up discussions. - **Psychological support**: Offer referral to a midwife counselor for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure a supportive framework for families and staff after adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports when required, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
