Ready-made formula and safe preparation advised. - **Safety & Care Standards:** Skin-to-skin safety, safe sleeping (cot by bed), and rooming-in promoted. Regular weight checks (birth, day 5, day 10). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory training; compliance audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative. - **Problem Management:** Feeding assessments, referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie), and incident reporting for re-admitted newborns. - **Parent Education:** Recognize feeding cues, avoid overfeeding, and maintain breastmilk supply if supplementing. Local parenting support provided. *Focus: Evidence-based, mother-centered care to optimize newborn feeding outcomes.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
