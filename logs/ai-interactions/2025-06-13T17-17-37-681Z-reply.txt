A: Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Twin Pregnancy with Obstetric Cholestasis  
Patient Details:  
Name: [Fictional Name] Sarah Ahmed  
Age: 32  
BMI: 24.7 (weight 68 kg, height 1.66 m)  
Gravida: 2, Para: 1 (previous spontaneous vaginal delivery at term)  
Current Gestation: 32+2 weeks (DCDA twins confirmed on early scan)  
Booking bloods and anomaly scans: Unremarkable  

History of Presenting Complaint:  
Ms. Ahmed presents with a 10-day history of worsening pruritus, predominantly affecting her palms and soles, with associated sleep disturbance. She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.  

Relevant Obstetric History:  
Previous pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.  
No history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.  
No history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.  

Relevant Medical History:  
Mild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).  
No known liver or gallbladder disease.  

Medications & Allergies:  
Currently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.  
No known drug allergies.  

Social History:  
Lives with husband and toddler son.  
Non-smoker; does not consume alcohol.  
Works part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.  

Examination Findings:  
General: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.  
Abdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.  
Twins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.  
No uterine tenderness or signs of labour.  
No peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.  

Notable Omissions:  
Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods for future reference.  
No record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.  
No documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.  

Impression:  
Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.  

Management Plan:  
Investigations:  
Serum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.  
Fasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.  
Full blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).  
CTG to assess fetal wellbeing.  
Growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers if not done in past 2 weeks.  

Medical Management:  
Consider ursodeoxycholic acid only for symptomatic relief if pruritus is severe, as it does not improve perinatal outcomes.  
Consider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.  

Ongoing Care and Delivery Planning:  
Weekly bile acids and LFTs.  
Emphasize fetal movement monitoring over CTG/ultrasound as primary surveillance method.  
Plan delivery at 36–37 weeks only if bile acids ≥100 µmol/L, otherwise continue monitoring.  

Counseling Provided:  
Discussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.  
Counsel patient about increased risks of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia with ICP.  
Avoid routine vitamin K unless steatorrhea or abnormal coagulation is present.  
Counsel patient about ICP recurrence risk in future pregnancies and need for baseline testing.  
Reassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.  
Advised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.  
Provided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.
