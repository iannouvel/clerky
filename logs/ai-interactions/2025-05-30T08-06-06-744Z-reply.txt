A: Since no clinical transcript was provided (the placeholder `{{text}}` was not replaced with actual content), I cannot generate a clinical note.  

Please provide the clinical transcript, and I will create a structured note following your requested format.  

For reference, here is how the output would be structured if the transcript were provided:  

---  
**Summary:**  
- Age: [if mentioned]  
- Presenting complaint(s): [e.g., "abdominal pain, nausea"]  
- Relevant history: [e.g., "nulliparous, BMI 28"]  

**Details:**  
- [First issue]: [Description with context and doctor's advice]  
- [Second issue]: [Description with context and doctor's advice]  

**Plan:**  
1. [First management step]  
2. [Second management step]  
---  

Let me know the clinical details, and I will draft the note accordingly.
