A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Endometrial Hyperplasia**  
*For testing purposes only. No real medical advice is provided.*  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 43 years  
- Weight: 102 kg  
- BMI: 37.4 (obese class II)  
- Prior pregnancies: 3 (all vaginal deliveries, no complications reported)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding**, with episodes lasting up to 10 days and associated with large clots. She describes **intermenstrual bleeding** over the past 2 months and occasional **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began insidiously; initially attributed to perimenopause.  
- Bleeding has worsened, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking >1 pad every 2 hours on heavy days).  
- No recent hormonal contraceptive use.  
- No prior investigations for abnormal uterine bleeding.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago, on metformin).  
- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril).  
- Obesity (BMI 37.4, no prior weight management interventions).  

**Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 20).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12.  
- Regular cycles until 6 months ago (previously 28-day cycles).  
- Parity: 3 (all term deliveries).  
- No history of cervical dysplasia or STIs.  
- Last Pap smear 2 years ago (normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 500 mg BD.  
- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  
- No NSAID or hormonal therapy use.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a school administrator (sedentary role).  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  
- Alcohol: occasional (1–2 units/week).  
- Lives with husband and children; reports moderate stress due to work.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried this could be "cancer" due to family history (maternal aunt with endometrial cancer).  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery or fertility implications (though not planning more children).  
- **Expectations:** Wants "answers quickly" and prefers "non-surgical options if possible."  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of hyperandrogenism.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic:**  
  - Speculum: Cervix appears normal; no visible lesions.  
  - Bimanual: Uterus slightly enlarged (~10-week size), mobile, non-tender. Adnexae clear.  
- **PV bleeding:** Minimal active bleeding at time of exam.  

**Investigations Requested:**  
1. **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness and morphology.  
2. **Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle)**: Given high-risk features (obesity, diabetes, abnormal bleeding).  
3. **HbA1c and lipids:** Given metabolic risk factors.  

**Provisional Diagnosis:**  
**Endometrial hyperplasia (likely complex atypical, given risk factors)**.  
*Differential:*  
- Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (perimenopausal).  
- Endometrial polyp/carcinoma (less likely but must exclude).  

**Management Plan (aligned with GTG 2014 Endometrial Hyperplasia guidelines):**  
1. **Urgent referral to gynaecology** for hysteroscopy +/- biopsy given abnormal bleeding and risk factors.  
2. **Weight management:** Referral to dietitian and structured lifestyle program (weight loss reduces hyperplasia risk).  
3. **Diabetes optimization:** Reinforce adherence to metformin; consider endocrinology review.  
4. **Smoking cessation:** Offered support services.  
5. **Hormonal therapy discussion:**  
   - If biopsy confirms **non-atypical hyperplasia**, trial of **progestogens (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral medroxyprogesterone)**.  
   - If **atypical hyperplasia**, discuss definitive surgery (hysterectomy) due to malignancy risk.  
6. **Safety-netting:** Advised to return if bleeding worsens (e.g., syncope, severe anemia).  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review biopsy results in 2 weeks.  
- GP to coordinate multidisciplinary care (diabetes, weight, gynaecology).  

**Patient Reassurance:**  
- Acknowledged her concerns about cancer; explained that while hyperplasia is not cancer, it requires prompt treatment to prevent progression.  
- Emphasized that most cases respond well to hormonal therapy or surgery if needed.
