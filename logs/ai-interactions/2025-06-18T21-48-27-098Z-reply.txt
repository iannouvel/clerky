Administer Hepatitis B vaccine if indicated. - **Perinatal Care**: Avoid pethidine/diamorphine in opiate-dependent mothers; do not give naloxone. - **Postnatal Care**: Keep mother and baby together. Observe for withdrawal; start pharmacological treatment if scores are high. - **Opiate withdrawal**: Start morphine (125 mcg/kg/day, 4x daily) and wean gradually. - **Non-opiate withdrawal**: Phenobarbitone for alcohol, chlorpromazine for benzodiazepines. - **Breastfeeding**: Encourage if safe based on maternal medication. - **Discharge Criteria**: Stable NAS scores, normal feeding/sleeping, no morphine dose changes for 36 hours. Ensure social support and follow-up. - **Education**: Provide parents with NAS information and monitoring rationale. **Monitoring**: Audit antenatal tasks, NAS scoring, and discharge planning",
