Random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion. - **GDM diagnosis without GTT**: Fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or any glucose >11.0mmol/L requires urgent referral. - **Management**: For fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise changes first. - **Corticosteroid use**: Monitor glucose closely; adjust insulin, consider hospitalization if unstable. - **Labor & delivery**: Continue insulin; may require VRIII. Postpartum, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Diabetic emergencies**: Immediate medical attention required. - **Monitoring**: 20-week ultrasound, fetal heart exam, self-monitoring of glucose. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 and other recommended vaccines per guidelines. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure adherence to care standards",
