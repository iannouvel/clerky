      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Indication for Induction:** Recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce stillbirth risk, especially in Black/Asian women and deprived areas. - **Membrane Sweep:** Offer at 38 and 39 weeks to encourage spontaneous labor. - **Methods:** Include membrane sweep, cervical balloon catheter, dinoprostone, artificial rupture of membranes (ARM), and oxytocin infusion. - **Contraindications:** Avoid routine induction in precipitate labor history, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Check maternal/fetal wellbeing, confirm gestation, and assess cervix (Bishop Score). - **High-Risk Groups:** Women with BMI ≥30 should discuss induction by 40 weeks; GBS-positive individuals may need oxytocin infusion. - **Monitoring:** Continuous CTG during induction; watch for uterine hyperstimulation (manage with terbutaline if needed). - **Oxytocin Use:** Titrate infusion to achieve adequate contractions; consider in second stage if labor stalls. - **Pre-Labor Rupture of Membranes (PROM):** Offer induction after 24 hours if no labor; monitor for infection (avoid routine swabs/CRP). - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24–48 hours; options include further attempts or cesarean. - **Complications:** Suspect uterine rupture if abnormal fetal heart rate; emergency cesarean required. - **Documentation:** Record all procedures (balloon placement, ARM, oxytocin dosing) and maternal/fetal responses. **Special Cases:** Preterm labor, prior cesarean, diabetes, or maternal request require individualized management",
