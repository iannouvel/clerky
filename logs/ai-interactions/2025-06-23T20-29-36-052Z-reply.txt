She reports vomiting 15-20 times daily, unable to keep down solid food for 2 weeks, and has lost 6kg since pregnancy confirmation. She also noticed vaginal spotting for 3 days, initially light pink but now brown discharge. Her symptoms seem disproportionately severe for gestational age. Last menstrual period was 13 weeks ago, home pregnancy tests have been consistently strongly positive. No previous pregnancies, conceived naturally after 4 months of trying. Family history includes thyroid disease (maternal). She appears significantly dehydrated and has been unable to work for 1 week due to severity of symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell, with obvious weight loss. Vital signs: BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Weight 52kg (down from 58kg at GP booking). Thyrotoxic signs present: mild tremor, warm skin, tachycardia. Abdominal examination reveals uterine size larger than expected for dates (approximately 16-week size). Speculum shows brown discharge from cervical os, no active bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance with multiple cystic spaces throughout uterine cavity, no fetal pole visible. Quantitative β-hCG markedly elevated at 186,000 mIU/mL (much higher than expected for gestational age). Thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH <0.1 mU/L, elevated free T4 28 pmol/L indicating gestational thyrotoxicosis. Chest X-ray clear, no evidence of pulmonary metastases.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole requiring urgent evacuation. Pre-operative investigations including FBC, coagulation screen, cross-match for 2 units blood. Surgical evacuation arranged urgently via suction curettage under general anesthetic. IV fluid resuscitation commenced. Antiemetics for symptom control. Propranolol considered for thyrotoxicosis symptoms. Post-evacuation histology confirmation and registration with regional trophoblastic screening center mandatory. Serial β-hCG monitoring weekly until negative then monthly for 6 months. Reliable contraception essential during follow-up period. Patient counseled regarding excellent prognosis with appropriate follow-up and monitoring.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] gp010-termination-of-pregnancy-pdf\nTitle: GP010 Termination of Pregnancy\nContent: Termination of Pregnancy\n \nUnder 14 Weeks \n \nThe Care and Management of Termination of Pregnancy for \nWomen with underlying Medical and Anesthetic risks and for Fetal \nAbnormality \n\nGynecology Protocol: GP010 \nDate agreed: March 2016 \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 2 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\nGuideline Reviewer: Tosin Ajala \n \nVersion: 1.1 \n \nApproval Committee: Women’s Services Safety and Quality Committee \n \nDate agreed: March 2016 \n \nReview date: March 2019 \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 3 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\nContents \n \nKey Principles ............................................................................................................................... 4 \n \nScope ............................................................................................................................................ 4 \n \nResponsibilities ............................................................................................................................ 4 \n \n1.0 Referral Criteria For Women From BPAS....................................................................5 \n \n2.0 Specific Organ Systems and Diseases .........................................................................5 \n \n2.1 Respiratory system ........................................................................................................ 5 \n \n2.2 Cardiovascular system................................................................................................... 5 \n \n2.3 Endocrine system .......................................................................................................... 6 \n \n2.4 Renal System ................................................................................................................ 6 \n \n2.5 Liver Disease.................................................................................................................. 6 \n \n2.6 Neurological disease ..................................................................................................... 6 \n \n2.7 Haematology ................................................................................................................. 6 \n \n2.8 Anaesthetic History ....................................................................................................... 6 \n \n2.9 Other ............................................................................................................................. 6 \n \n3.0 Referral Pathway ......................................................................................................7 \n \n4.0 Management of a Pregnancy with Fetal Abnormality ................................................7 \n \n5.0 Clinical Assessment ...................................................................................................7 \n \n6.0 Surgical Management of Termination of Pregnancy ...................................................8 \n \n7.0 In-Patient Medical Management Of Termination Of Pregnancy 14 Weeks Or Less ......9 \n \n8.0 Discharge & Follow Up For Women Referred From BPAS ......................................... 11 \n \n9.0 References .............................................................................................................. 12 \n \nAppendix A: ASA PS Catagory .................................................................................................... 13 \n \nAppendix B - Certificate A .......................................................................................................... 14 \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 4 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\nKey Principles \n \nA protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. \nProfessional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol. \n\nScope \n \nThis protocol applies to: \n \n All women requesting a Termination of Pregnancy with underlying Medical and \nAnesthetic risks and for Fetal Abnormality \n\nResponsibilities \n \nNurses, Midwives, Obstetricians & Gynaecologists \n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \n To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol \n \nManagement Team: \n To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations \n To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 5 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\n1.0 Referral Criteria For Women From BPAS \n \n1.1 BSUH will act as a referral centre for termination of pregnancies that cannot be safely \ncarried out by BPAS.

Antibiotic prophylaxis must be prescribed: \n Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days starting on the day of abortion, \nplus \n Metronidazole 800 mg orally prior to or at the time of abortion \n \n5.8 If pre-op nurse requires anaesthetic advice they are to contact the anaesthetic \ndepartment on extension 4307 or request that the Doctor in clinic dictates a letter \nrequesting urgent anaesthetic review and e-mail to: anaesthetic.admin@bsuh.nhs.uk \n \n5.9 All women undergoing a termination of pregnancy must have a VTE risk assessment \n \n5.10 Notes to be sent directly to the Day surgical unit for surgical TOP or L11 for medical \nTOP \n\n6.0 Surgical Management of Termination of Pregnancy \n \n6.1 Women should be counselled regarding the risks of the procedure including those of \nperforation (1 in 1000), bleeding (1 in 1000), infection (1 in 10) and repeat procedure \n(2 in 1000) as a result of incomplete evacuation. \n \n6.2 Sample of products of conception must be sent to histology on all surgical \nterminations. \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 9 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\n6.3 If no products are obtained at ERPC, contact the Consultant on-call whilst patient still \nanaesthetised and if after review no products are obtained, then follow-up with serial \nbiochemistry is indicated. \n6.4 The routine use of oxytocin for surgical TOP is not routinely recommended. \n \n6.5 All Surgical TOP on women over 12 weeks of pregnancy should be discussed with the \noperating surgeon. \n \n6.6 Form HSA 4 (Yellow Booklet): this form is to be completed immediately post TOP by \nthe practitioner terminating the pregnancy. It must not be filed in the notes and \nshould be and sent to Gynae Secretary Denise Hemsley on L11, this is then sent in a \nsealed envelope to: \nThe Chief Medical Officer, \nDepartment of Health, \nRichmond House, \n79 White Hall, \nLondon, \nSW1A 2NS \n \n6.7 Evidence \nNo accurate high quality data relating to individual risks of surgical evacuation of \npregnancy. Overall complications rates are ~2%. \n\n7.0 In-Patient Medical Management Of Termination Of Pregnancy 14 Weeks Or Less \n \n7.1 Routine history and examination must be carried out, ruling out possible contra- \nindications to medical management; \n Uncontrolled severe asthma \n Suspected ectopic pregnancy \n Chronic adrenal failure \n Porphyria, \n Severe diarrhoea \n Anaemia (less than 9g/dl) \n \n7.2 Severe uncontrolled asthma is classified as those cases not controlled with \ninhalers/medication and requiring hospital admission and /or steroids in the past year \n \n7.3 Women with a pregnancy less than 14 weeks gestation should be given the option of \nin-patient medical management of termination of pregnancy unless clinically contra- \nindicated. \n \n7.4 Before prescribing the Mifepristone (below) the prescribing doctor must check that \ncertificate A has been completed. \n \n7.5 Staff administering the mifepristone must both check certificate A has been \ncompleted with 2 signatures prior to administering Mifepristone. \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 10 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\n7.6 Those with a pregnancy with a CRL measurement of greater than 8 week size but less \nthan 12 weeks can be managed using the following regimen: \n Mifepristone 200mg orally on day 1 followed by 800mcg of Misoprostol per \nvaginum on day 3 (48 hours later) \n \n7.7 Those women with a pregnancy over 12 (up to 14 weeks) weeks can be offered \nmedical management using the following regimen: \n Mifepristone 200mg orally on day 1 followed by 5 doses of 400mcg Misprostol \nper vaginum on day 3 (48 hours later) \n7.8 Arrange to readmit to L11/Horsted Keynes 36-48 hours following Mifepristone \n \n7.9 Failure to deliver after the first course, can be managed with a second course the \nfollowing day. \n \n7.10 Failure to deliver after this interval requires a consultant opinion. A third course \nshould not be started for 24 hours or induction can be undertaken with amniotomy \nand syntocinon. \n \n7.11 Following delivery of fetus continue Misoprostol until placenta delivers \n \n7.12 If placenta not delivered 6 hours after last Misoprostol patient needs ERPC \n \n7.13 If bleeding heavy following delivery of fetus use syntocinon infusion \n \n7.14 Evidence \nCombinations of mifepristone and Misoprostol are more successful than Misoprostol \nalone \n \n7.15 Misoprostol is more successful than Cervagem \n \n7.16 Overall success rates are greater than 90% \n \n7.17 200mg of oral mifepristone is prescribed and must be taken by the patient in the \npresence of two clinicians (nursing or medical). \n \n7.18 Codydramol 2 tablets to be taken 4 to 6 hourly PRN, max of 8 tablets a day should be \nprescribed for 4 days \n \n7.19 Ibuprofen 400mg TDS should be recommended, in suitable patients, for use only if \nrequired (care with asthmatic patients). Patient to be advised to purchase over the \ncounter. \n \n7.20 Due to the high success rates of medical management, formal follow up in EPU is not \nrequired. Patients should be advised to do a home pregnancy test three weeks after \nthe medication is given. If this is positive then they should contact EPU for follow up. \n\nTermination of Pregnancy Under 14 Weeks\n \nGP010\n \nPage 11 of 15\n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals\n\n7.21 If at 3 weeks pregnancy test is still positive then a transvaginal ultrasound scan is \nindicated. \n If endometrial thickness is greater than 15mm, offer one week of expectant \nmanagement or 600mcg Misoprostol PV and rescan in 1 week or consider ERPC. \n \n7.22 Evidence \nMedical evacuation is a safe alternative management shown to be acceptable \nto some patients. \n \n7.23 It empowers these patients the choice of an alternative method to surgical evacuation. \n \n7.24 The regime of 200mg Mifepristone PO followed by 800mcg of vaginal Misoprostol is \nassociated with: \n high efficacy rates (complete evacuation) ~ 97% \n low failure rates ~ 0.5% (5 in 1000) \n high patient acceptability rates, greater than 90% \n \n7.25 There is limited specific data on the number of ERPCs required following medical \nmanagement, but is likely to be small overall and less than is seen with conservative \nmanagement. \n \n7.26 Form HSA 4 (Yellow Booklet): this form is to be completed immediately post TOP by \nthe practitioner terminating the pregnancy.

}

A: ### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document completion of Form HSA1 (Abortion Act Certificate A) with two signatures as required by law.  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 5.3 mandates completion of Form HSA1 with two qualified medical practitioners' signatures before proceeding with termination.  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider medical management (mifepristone + misoprostol) as an alternative to surgical evacuation, given the high success rates (>90%) and patient acceptability.  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 7.6–7.7 recommends offering medical management for pregnancies <14 weeks unless contraindicated, with comparable efficacy to surgical evacuation.  

3. **Additional information needed** - Ensure RhD status is confirmed and anti-D immunoglobulin is administered if the patient is RhD-negative.  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 5.6 requires anti-D prophylaxis for all non-sensitized RhD-negative women within 72 hours of evacuation.  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on contraceptive options post-evacuation to prevent pregnancy during follow-up (as serial β-hCG monitoring is required).  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 8.4 emphasizes contraception counseling to avoid pregnancy during the follow-up period.  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis if indicated.  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 5.9 mandates VTE risk assessment for all women undergoing termination of pregnancy.  

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written and verbal discharge instructions, including signs of complications (e.g., infection, heavy bleeding).  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 8.6 recommends clear discharge information for patient safety.  

2. **Additional information needed** - Screen for Chlamydia and prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis (doxycycline + metronidazole).  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 5.7 recommends infection screening and prophylaxis for all termination procedures.  

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain management post-procedure (if no contraindications).  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 7.19 recommends ibuprofen for pain relief but notes it is optional.  

2. **Additional information needed** - Ensure histology request form (P1 consent for cremation) is completed.  
   Reason: Guideline GP010 Section 5.3 requires this for legal documentation but does not impact immediate clinical care.  

### Summary of Critical Gaps:
- **Legal compliance**: Missing Form HSA1 certification.  
- **Patient safety**: RhD prophylaxis and VTE assessment not explicitly documented.  
- **Optimal care**: Medical management not discussed as an alternative despite guideline recommendations.  

These adjustments ensure adherence to protocol while maintaining patient-centered care.
