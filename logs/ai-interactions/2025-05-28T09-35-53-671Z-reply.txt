A: **Summary:**  
- Age: 36  
- BMI: 18.9  
- Gravida 1, Para 1 (prior full-term vaginal delivery)  
- Presenting complaint: 4-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding (7–10 days, every 2–3 weeks) with associated fatigue and occasional cramping  
- No intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding  
- Not sexually active in the past year  
- No known bleeding disorders, thyroid dysfunction, or gynecological history  
- Pale conjunctivae on exam (possible anemia)  
- Normal pelvic exam  

**Details:**  
Ms. Doe reports a 4-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding lasting 7–10 days and occurring every 2–3 weeks, accompanied by fatigue and occasional cramping.  
She denies intermenstrual spotting or post-coital bleeding and has not been sexually active in the past year.  
Examination reveals pale conjunctivae (suggestive of anemia) but no abdominal tenderness, cervical abnormalities, or uterine/adnexal pathology.  
The differential diagnosis includes ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  
The doctor advised symptomatic relief with tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding and consideration of COCP for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  
Investigations were recommended to rule out anemia, endocrine causes, and structural pathology.  

**Plan:**  
1. Investigations:  
   - Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.  
2. Symptomatic relief:  
   - Trial of tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding.  
   - Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  
3. Follow-up:  
   - Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.  
   - Escalate to gynecology referral if bleeding worsens or anemia is confirmed.  
4. Counseling:  
   - Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and report syncope or severe fatigue.
