It applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and recovery staff. **Key Recommendations:** - **Equipment:** Blood pressure monitor, oxygen saturation monitor, thermometer, oxygen/breathing system, suction, and infusion devices must be available. - **Monitoring:** Continuous vital sign observation until stable, with specific protocols for general/regional anaesthesia. - **Ongoing Care:** Ensure IV cannula patency, administer prescribed medications, and avoid leaving women unattended. - **Discharge Criteria:** Consciousness, clear airway, stable cardiovascular status, adequate analgesia, and removed pressure dressings. - **Postnatal Care:** Monitor temperature, pulse, BP; support breastfeeding and baby care. Refer anaesthetic complications to an obstetric anaesthetist. - **Training/Audit:** Staff must complete recovery care training. Audits should assess vital sign documentation and MEOWS chart completion. Care continues until handover to the midwife is complete",
