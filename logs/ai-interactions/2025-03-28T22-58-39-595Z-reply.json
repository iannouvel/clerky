She also reports **dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)** and concerns about **possible early pregnancy complications** due to irregular cycles.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Heavy bleeding lasting 8–10 days per cycle, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking >6 pads/day).  \n- Pelvic pain is dull and constant, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  \n- No history of intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding.  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 5 weeks ago, but cycles have been irregular (25–40 days).  \n- Denies fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No chronic medical conditions.  \n- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Three previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries** (ages 16, 17, and 18).  \n- No history of caesarean sections or gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12.  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n- No cervical screening (Pap smear) yet (due to age).  \n- Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular medications).  \n- No hormonal contraception in the past year.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works part-time in retail.  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  \n- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Lives with partner and three children.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about possible fibroids or endometriosis due to pain and heavy bleeding.  \n- **Concerns:** Fear of infertility or complications in future pregnancies.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants investigation and treatment to improve symptoms.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or distress.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum Exam:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions or discharge.  \n- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild cervical motion tenderness noted.  \n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**  \n1. **Adenomyosis** (given multiparity, heavy bleeding, and dysmenorrhea).  \n2. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** (due to cervical motion tenderness, though no fever or discharge).  \n3. **Endometriosis** (given dyspareunia and cyclical pain).  \n\n**Investigations Advised:**  \n- **Pelvic ultrasound** (to assess uterine structure, rule out fibroids/adenomyosis).  \n- **STI screen** (chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR, given cervical tenderness).  \n- **Full blood count (FBC)** (to check for anaemia due to menorrhagia).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Pain relief:** Regular NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) during menstruation.  \n2. **Hormonal options:** Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (after STI screen) to regulate cycles.  \n3. **Lifestyle advice:** Smoking cessation counselling (due to increased cardiovascular risk with hormonal contraception).  \n4. **Follow-up:** Review in 4 weeks with investigation results. If PID suspected, treat empirically with antibiotics.  \n\n**Patient Counselling:**  \n- Reassured that symptoms are manageable but require further assessment.  \n- Advised to return urgently if fever, severe pain, or worsening bleeding occurs.  \n\n**Plan for Future Pregnancy:**  \n- Discussed long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) options if desired.  \n- Advised preconception counselling if planning another pregnancy.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (Fictional Clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional case for testing purposes only.
