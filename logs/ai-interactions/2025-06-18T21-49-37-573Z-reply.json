Formula feeding guidance includes responsive practices and safe preparation. - **Safety & Care Standards:** Rooming-in recommended; weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Safe sleeping practices (cot by bed, avoid sofas) emphasized. - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative. - **Supplementation:** Limit formula use; offer responsively if medically indicated. Avoid teat confusion (use cup/tube). Support mothers to maintain breastmilk supply. - **Problem Management:** Feeding assessments for issues; referrals for complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). Incident reporting for re-admitted newborns with feeding problems. - **Parent Education:** Recognize feeding cues, optimal positioning (e.g., laid-back), and avoid overfeeding. Formula use may reduce supply and increase infection/allergy risks. *Targets increased breastfeeding rates and aligns with Baby Friendly Initiative standards.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
