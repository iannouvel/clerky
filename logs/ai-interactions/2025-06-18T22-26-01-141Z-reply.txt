Exclusions include allergies, panic attacks, or certain medical conditions. Patients must be counseled and provide informed consent. Pain control options (e.g., nitrous oxide, post-procedure medication) should be discussed. The procedure involves cervical numbing, tissue removal (10â€“15 minutes), and 60-minute recovery. Post-procedure care includes tissue examination, monitoring for bleeding/pain, and a urine pregnancy test at 3 weeks. Risks: incomplete evacuation, bleeding, infection, uterine perforation. Alternatives include conservative, medical, or surgical management. Patients should report persistent symptoms and are encouraged to take time deciding. Contact details provided for post-procedure concerns",
