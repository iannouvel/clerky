**Date:** [Fictional Date]

### **History of Presenting Complaint**  
Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns:  
1. **Recurrent Pelvic Pain**: Intermittent, sharp left-sided pelvic pain for 6 months, worsening during menstruation and intercourse. No associated bleeding or urinary symptoms.  
2. **Secondary Infertility**: Unable to conceive for 2 years despite regular unprotected intercourse. She previously conceived without intervention.  

### **Past Medical/Surgical History**  
- **Medical**: Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 5 years ago, on metformin), hypertension.  
- **Surgical**: Cesarean section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018).  
- **Gynaecological**: History of ovarian cysts (resolved, no surgery), heavy menstrual bleeding (treated with tranexamic acid PRN).  

### **Drug History & Allergies**  
- **Medications**: Metformin 500 mg BD, lisinopril 10 mg OD, tranexamic acid during menses.  
- **Allergies**: None known.  

### **Social History**  
- **Occupation**: Office manager (sedentary role).  
- **Lifestyle**: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- **Family Planning**: Desires pregnancy but concerned about age/weight impacting fertility.  

### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations**  
- **Ideas**: Worried pain may be "fibroids or cysts" affecting fertility.  
- **Concerns**: Anxious about surgical intervention due to BMI; fears IVF may be her only option.  
- **Expectations**: Requests "a scan to check everything" and lifestyle advice to improve chances of conception.

### **Examination Findings**  
- **General**: Obese (BMI 44), acanthosis nigricans noted (consistent with insulin resistance).  
- **Abdominal**: Soft, non-tender; old Pfannenstiel scar well-healed.  
- **Pelvic Exam**:  
  - **Speculum**: Cervix appears normal; no discharge/lesions.  
  - **Bimanual**: Uterus enlarged (~12-week size), irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids); left adnexal tenderness (no palpable mass).

### **Assessment & Management Plan**  
#### **1. Recurrent Pelvic Pain & Suspected Fibroids**  
- **Investigations**:  
  - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess fibroid burden/adnexae.  
  - HbA1c (poorly controlled diabetes may exacerbate symptoms).  
- **Management**:  
  - If fibroids confirmed: Discuss options (medical vs. surgical—myomectomy/hysterectomy).  
  - Weight loss counseling (BMI 44 increases surgical risks; refer to dietitian).  

#### **2. Secondary Infertility**  
- **Investigations**:  
  - Day 3 FSH/AMH (ovarian reserve assessment).  
  - Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to rule out tubal blockage (given prior cesarean).  
- **Management**:  
  - Optimize metabolic health (tight glycemic control, weight loss).  
  - Refer to reproductive endocrinology if tests suggest diminished reserve.  

#### **Patient Counseling**  
- **Risks**: Highlight increased miscarriage risk (age/BMI) and potential complications in pregnancy (e.g., gestational diabetes).  
- **Next Steps**: Schedule TVUS/HSG; follow-up in 4 weeks to discuss results.
