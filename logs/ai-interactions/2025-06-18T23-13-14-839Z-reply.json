Refer high-risk patients (e.g., thrombophilia, prior VTE, antiphospholipid syndrome) to Maternal Medicine/Joint Obstetric Haematology Clinic (JOHC). - **Thromboprophylaxis:** Offer LMWH to hospitalized pregnant/postnatal patients (unless contraindicated), those with COVID-19 (during admission + 10 days post-discharge), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (first trimester), and hyperemesis gravidarum. - **LMWH Administration:** Start antenatal prophylaxis early; discontinue if vaginal bleeding, SROM, or labor begins. Postnatally, begin LMWH 6 hours after birth unless contraindicated. Avoid DOACs in pregnancy/breastfeeding. - **Special Cases:** Fondaparinux requires hematologist consultation. Warfarin is restricted; switch postpartum if needed. Aspirin is not for VTE prophylaxis but may be used with LMWH for other indications. - **Diagnosis & Treatment:** Suspected VTE requires urgent imaging (ultrasound, V/Q scan, or CTPA). Treat with LMWH (1mg/kg BD). - **Additional Measures:** Encourage mobilization, hydration, and TED stockings during labor/postpartum. Consider wound drains for cesarean sections in LMWH-treated patients. - **Contraindications/Allergies:** Seek JOHC advice for LMWH allergies or bleeding risks. Use anti-embolism stockings if LMWH is contraindicated. *Note: LMWH is the preferred agent; dosing guidance provided for syringe strengths.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
