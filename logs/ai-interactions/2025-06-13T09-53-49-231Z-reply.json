She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.\nRelevant Obstetric History:\nPrevious pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.\n\n\nNo history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.\n\n\nNo history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.\n\n\nRelevant Medical History:\nMild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).\n\n\nNo known liver or gallbladder disease.\n\n\nMedications & Allergies:\nCurrently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband and toddler son.\n\n\nNon-smoker; does not consume alcohol.\n\n\nWorks part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.\n\n\nExamination Findings:\nGeneral: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.\n\n\nAbdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.\n\n\nTwins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.\n\n\nNo uterine tenderness or signs of labour.\n\n\nNo peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.\n\n\nNotable Omissions (for testing purposes):\nNo documented baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods.\n\n\nNo record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.\n\n\nNo documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nImpression:\n Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.\nManagement Plan:\nInvestigations:\n\n\nSerum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.\n\n\nFasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.\n\n\nFull blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).\n\n\nCTG to assess fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nGrowth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers if not done in past 2 weeks.\n\n\nMedical Management:\n\n\nStart ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg BID while awaiting results.\n\n\nConsider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.\n\n\nOngoing Care and Delivery Planning:\n\n\nWeekly bile acids and LFTs.\n\n\nIncrease surveillance: twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans.\n\n\nAim for delivery at 36–37 weeks if bile acids <100 µmol/L.\n\n\nConsider earlier delivery if bile acids ≥100 µmol/L or evidence of fetal compromise.\n\n\nCounseling Provided:\n\n\nDiscussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.\n\n\nReassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.\n\n\nAdvised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.\n\n\nProvided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.\n\n\nDictated by: Dr. [Fictional Name] Patel\n Date: [Fictional Date]\n--Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real patient data or medical advice is contained herein.\n\n\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Different management plan** - Avoid routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) unless for symptomatic relief, as it does not improve perinatal outcomes.  \n   Reason: The guideline states \"Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.\"  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Reconsider the planned delivery timing based on peak bile acid levels (earlier delivery only if ≥100 µmol/L).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends \"Active management with planned early birth is recommended... to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes,\" but only specifies earlier delivery for bile acids ≥100 µmol/L.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Clarify that CTG and ultrasound do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, emphasizing fetal movement monitoring instead.  \n   Reason: The guideline states \"Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised.\"  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods for comparison.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends baseline measurements in subsequent pregnancies to establish normal levels.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Avoid routine growth scans and Dopplers unless clinically indicated, as they do not predict stillbirth in ICP.  \n   Reason: The guideline states \"Additional investigations not recommended unless itch is severe or associated with comorbidities.\"  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel about the increased risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and ensure regular monitoring for these conditions.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that women with ICP have a higher chance of developing these conditions.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider checking for steatorrhea or coagulation abnormalities before initiating vitamin K.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends vitamin K only if fat absorption is impaired or coagulation studies are abnormal.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide information about the increased risk of hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases later in life.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions this small increased risk for long-term counseling.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Offer links to ICP support groups (e.g., ICP Support and RCOG) for additional patient resources.  \n   Reason: The guideline lists these as useful links but does not mandate their provision.  \n\nThese recommendations aim to align the clinical note with the latest evidence-based guidelines while ensuring patient safety and optimal care.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 53 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
