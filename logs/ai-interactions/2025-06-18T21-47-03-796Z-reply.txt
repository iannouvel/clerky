      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Indication for Induction:** Recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce stillbirth risk, particularly for Black/Asian women and those in deprived areas. - **Informed Consent:** Discuss risks/benefits, methods (membrane sweep, balloon catheter, dinoprostone, oxytocin), and alternatives. - **Membrane Sweep:** Offer at 38 and 39 weeks to promote spontaneous labor. - **High-Risk Groups:** Induce by 40 weeks for BMI ≥30; discuss earlier induction (36–38 weeks). - **Cervical Ripening:** Balloon catheter (outpatient/inpatient) or dinoprostone gel; monitor with CTG. - **Oxytocin Use:** Start after cervical ripening; titrate to achieve 3–4 contractions/10 mins. Monitor maternal/fetal status closely. - **Pre-Labor Rupture of Membranes (PROM):** Offer induction after 24 hours if no labor; immediate review for meconium/GBS. - **Contraindications:** Avoid routine induction with precipitate labor history, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without medical indication. - **Complications:** Manage hyperstimulation with tocolysis (terbutaline); emergency cesarean for uterine rupture. - **Failed Induction:** Reassess after 24–48 hours; options include further attempts or cesarean. - **Monitoring:** Regular CTG, maternal observations, and documentation (Bishop score, procedure notes). **Special Cases:** Preterm labor, prior cesarean, diabetes, or fetal anomalies require individualized plans. Respect patient autonomy if induction is declined, with increased monitoring from 42 weeks. (Word count: 200)",
