  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nHere’s a fictional but clinically authentic SBAR clerking for a patient with **cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)**, using British medical terminology and abbreviations:  \n\n---  \n\n### **SBAR CLERKING – CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (CIN)**  \n\n#### **SITUATION:**  \n- **Patient:** 32F, G2P1, non-smoker  \n- **Presenting complaint:** Referred to Gynaecology Oncology Clinic following abnormal cervical screening (HPV+ with high-grade dyskaryosis).  \n- **Key issue:** Colposcopy-confirmed **CIN3** (squamo-columnar junction fully visible, satisfactory colposcopy). Asymptomatic, no PV bleeding/discharge.  \n\n#### **BACKGROUND:**  \n- **PMHx:** Previous LLETZ (2019) for CIN2. No other gynae history.  \n- **Obstetric Hx:** SVD 2018 (no complications).  \n- **Medications:** Nil regular. No allergies.  \n- **Risk factors:** Persistent high-risk HPV (type 16 detected), previous CIN.  \n- **Last menstrual period (LMP):** Day 12 of cycle.  \n\n#### **ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **Observations:** Afebrile, BP 118/72, HR 72, BMI 24.  \n- **Examination:** Speculum – healthy cervix, no contact bleeding. No vulval/vaginal lesions.  \n- **Colposcopy findings:** Acetowhite epithelium, coarse mosaicism, punctation at 3 o’clock (TZ3).  \n- **Histology (biopsy):** CIN3 with clear margins. No invasive features.  \n- **Recent investigations:**  \n  - **HPV PCR:** Positive (type 16).  \n  - **FBC:** Normal (Hb 132, WBC 6.2, Plt 280).  \n  - **USS pelvis:** Normal uterus/adnexa.  \n\n#### **RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Treatment:**  \n   - **LLETZ excision** under local anaesthesia (GA if anxious) – booked for next available list.  \n   - Consent for possible future preterm labour risk (cervical weakness).  \n\n2. **Follow-up:**  \n   - **Post-op HPV test at 6 months** (if negative, return to routine screening; if positive, repeat colposcopy).  \n   - **Annual cytology x3 years** if margins unclear on histology.  \n\n3. **Patient counselling:**  \n   - Reinforce HPV vaccination (if not already received).  \n   - Advise barrier contraception to reduce HPV transmission risk.  \n   - Safety-netting: Report PV bleeding/pelvic pain.  \n\n4. **MDT referral:**  \n   - Discuss in **Gynae-Oncology MDT** if any suspicion of microinvasion on histology.  \n\n---  \n\n**Notes:**  \n- Follows **BSCCP/British Gynaecological Cancer Society** guidelines.  \n- Fictional for educational purposes.  \n\nWould you like any modifications (e.g., more detail on histology, MDT criteria, or patient counselling points)?\n\nGuideline Analysis:\nClinical transcript analysis for guideline compliance check against: Management of Vulval Conditions. This analysis focuses on identifying areas where the clinical documentation can be improved according to the specific guideline requirements.\n\nGuideline: Management of Vulval Conditions\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\n 2014 UK National Guideline on the Management of Vulval Conditions\n\nNew in the 2014 Guidelines:\n- General advice for the management of vulval disorders\n- Onward referral guidelines\n- Vulval lichen simplex\n- Vulval psoriasis\n- Use of calcineurin inhibitors\n\nObjectives:\n- Recommendations on the management of vulval disorders\n- Concentrates on a select group of conditions\n- Offers guidance for onward referral\n\nGeneral Advice for all vulval conditions:\n- Avoid irritants\n- Inform GP\n- Consider STI screening\n- Assess for sexual dysfunction\n\nVulval lichen sclerosus:\n- Symptoms include itch, soreness, dyspareunia\n- Signs include pale, white areas, fissuring, erosions\n- Complications may include squamous cell carcinoma\n- Diagnosis through clinical appearance and histology\n- Treatment with ultra-potent topical steroids\n\nVulval lichen planus:\n- Symptoms include itch, soreness, dyspareunia\n- Signs include different lesions types\n- Complications may include scarring and carcinoma\n- Diagnosis through clinical appearance and histology\n- Treatment with biopsy and topical steroids\n\nSmall risk of neoplastic change. Recommended Regimen: Ultrapotent topical steroids like Clobetasol proprionate. Maintenance treatment may be required with weaker steroid preparations. Vaginal corticosteroids may be used in more severe cases. Alternative regimens may include ultra-potent topical steroids with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Topical steroids are safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Referral to a vulval clinic is recommended for erosive disease or recalcitrant cases. Follow-up at 2-3 months is advised. Biopsy should be performed in non-responsive cases. \n\nVulval eczema: Avoidance of precipitating factors is recommended. Use of emollient soap substitute and topical corticosteroids are advised. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nLichen simplex: Avoidance of precipitating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and anxiolytic antihistamines may be used. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nVulval psoriasis: Avoidance of irritating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and coal-tar preparations may be used. Follow-up as clinically required. \n\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): Referral for colposcopy is recommended. Treatment options include local excision, imiquimod cream, or vulvectomy. Follow-up is mandatory. \n\nVulval pain: Vulvodynia is defined as vulvar discomfort without visible findings. Treatment depends on the type of vulvodynia.\n\nAetiology: Likely multifactorial, with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis as a common feature.\n\nClinical Features: Vulval pain, focal tenderness, no signs of acute inflammation.\n\nComplications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.\n\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis based on history and examination.\n\nManagement: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.\n\nTreatment: Avoid irritating factors, use emollient soap substitute, consider topical local anaesthetics with caution. Physical therapies, cognitive behaviour therapy, pain modifiers, and surgery may be options.\n\nFollow-up: As clinically required, long-term follow-up and psychological support may be necessary.\n\nUnprovoked Vulvodynia: Aetiology unknown, managed as a chronic pain syndrome.\n\nClinical Features: Longstanding unexplained pain, may be associated with urinary symptoms.\n\nComplications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.\n\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis after excluding other causes.\n\nManagement: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.\n\nTreatment: Use emollient soap substitute, consider pain modifiers like tricyclic antidepressants. Referral to a pain clinic may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases.\n\nFollow-up: As clinically required.\n\nGuidelines for the management of Vulvodynia.
