      "newValue": "**Summary of Medical Guideline on Surrogacy:** This guideline ensures robust antenatal, labor, and postnatal planning for surrogacy arrangements. Key recommendations: - **Legal Framework**: The surrogate is the legal mother until a parental order or adoption transfers rights. Same-sex couples and foreign parents may apply. - **Clinical Care**: Provide non-judgmental, supportive care. The surrogate retains decision-making rights, including termination. - **Postnatal Handling**: Sensitive management is required; the baby is registered under the surrogate until legal transfer. - **Roles & Responsibilities**: - Surrogate gives newborn screening consent. - Commissioning parents apply for parental/adoption orders. - Joint decisions on babyâ€™s care between surrogate and parents. - **Inclusive Language**: Use terms like \"surrogate\" (not \"surrogate mother\") and \"your baby\" for intended parents. - **Equality & Compliance**: Adhere to the Equality Act (2010), ensuring non-discriminatory care. Audit cases annually. **Appendix 3**: Promotes inclusive language (e.g., \"commissioning parent\" instead of \"intended mother/father\"). **Appendix 4**: Outlines newborn screening consent, with the surrogate providing initial consent.
