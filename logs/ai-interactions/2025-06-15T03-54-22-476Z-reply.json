    "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I've been experiencing some concerns about recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nDoctor: Good morning. I'm glad you came in today. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Well, it started about a week ago. I've been having some symptoms that are worrying me. The pain is quite uncomfortable and it's affecting my daily activities.\n\nDoctor: I understand your concern. Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your situation. When did you first notice these symptoms?\n\nPatient: It was last Tuesday morning. I woke up and felt something wasn't right. The discomfort has been getting worse since then.\n\nDoctor: Can you describe the nature of the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or throbbing?\n\nPatient: It's more of a dull ache that comes and goes. Sometimes it's quite intense, especially in the mornings.\n\nDoctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this? Any nausea, fever, or changes in your appetite?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling a bit nauseous, and I haven't been eating as much as usual. No fever though.\n\nDoctor: Based on what you're telling me, this could be related to recurrent pregnancy loss. I'd like to perform a physical examination and possibly order some tests to get a clearer picture....\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - The clinical note should include specific details about the patient's pregnancy history (number of previous losses, gestational age at loss, any prior ectopic pregnancies) and risk factors (e.g., smoking, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal surgery).  \n   **Reason:** The guideline emphasizes the importance of identifying risk factors and history for accurate diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy (Section: \"Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - The note does not mention ordering a transvaginal ultrasound or serum b-hCG, which are critical for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline states, \"Transvaginal ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice for tubal ectopic pregnancy\" and \"A serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) level is useful for planning management\" (Section: \"Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\").  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - The patient should be informed about the possibility of ectopic pregnancy and the need for urgent diagnostic tests.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline highlights the importance of early diagnosis and patient awareness to prevent complications (Section: \"Women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be managed in dedicated early pregnancy clinics\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - The note should document whether the patient is RhD-negative to determine if anti-D immunoglobulin is required.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline recommends, \"Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy\" (Section: \"Anti-D immunoglobulin recommendations\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - The patient should be counseled about long-term fertility prospects and support services.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline states, \"Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy should be discussed with patients\" and \"Support and counseling should be offered\" (Section: \"Long-term fertility and counseling\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - The note could include more details about the patient's pain (e.g., unilateral vs. bilateral, radiation to shoulder).  \n   **Reason:** While not critical, this helps differentiate ectopic pregnancy from other causes of pelvic pain (Section: \"Diagnostic clues to ectopic pregnancy\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - The patient could be given written information about ectopic pregnancy and support groups.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline recommends providing \"written information on treatment options and support services\" (Section: \"Patient information and support\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - The note could document the patient's smoking status more explicitly.  \n   **Reason:** Smoking is a risk factor, but its absence does not rule out ectopic pregnancy (Section: \"Risk factors such as... smoking\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - The patient could be advised about muscle relaxation techniques if methotrexate is planned.  \n   **Reason:** The guideline mentions this as a supportive measure but not as a critical intervention (Section: \"Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial\").  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps  \n- **Missing diagnostic workup:** No mention of transvaginal ultrasound or b-hCG testing.  \n- **Incomplete history:** Lack of detailed pregnancy history and risk factors.  \n- **Inadequate counseling:** No discussion of ectopic pregnancy risks, fertility, or support.  \n\n**Actionable Steps:**  \n1. Order transvaginal ultrasound and serum b-hCG immediately.  \n2. Document Rh status and administer anti-D if indicated.  \n3. Provide clear counseling about ectopic pregnancy and next steps.  \n\nThese changes align the note with the guideline's emphasis on early diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient-centered care.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 57 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
