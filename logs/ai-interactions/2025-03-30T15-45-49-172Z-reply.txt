She also reports chronic pelvic pain, exacerbated during intercourse (dyspareunia).  History of Presenting Complaint:  - The dysmenorrhoea has progressively worsened over the past year, now requiring regular NSAID use.  - Intermenstrual bleeding occurs 1–2 times per cycle, lasting 2–3 days, with small-volume fresh bleeding.  - Pelvic pain is described as a deep, dragging sensation, worse on the left side.  - No post-coital bleeding or abnormal discharge reported.  - Denies urinary or bowel symptoms.  Past Medical History:  - Iron-deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron, now resolved).  - No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  Past Surgical History:  - Appendectomy (age 16).  - No other major surgeries.  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12.  - Regular 28-day cycles, but heavy flow (changing pads every 2–3 hours on heavy days).  - Last menstrual period: 1 week ago.  - Previous pregnancies:    - Term vaginal delivery 3 years ago (no complications).    - First-trimester miscarriage 1 year ago (managed expectantly).  - No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 6 months ago).  - Current contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception).  Drug History:  - Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN for pain (takes 2–3 times per week).  - No regular medications.  Allergy History:  - No known drug allergies.  Social History:  - Works as a teacher.  - Non-smoker.  - Alcohol: 4–5 units per week.  - No recreational drug use.  - In a stable relationship; partner is supportive.  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - The patient is concerned that her symptoms may indicate endometriosis or fibroids, as her mother had similar issues.  - She is anxious about fertility implications given her previous miscarriage.  - Hopes for a clear diagnosis and effective pain management.  Examination Findings:  - General inspection: Well-appearing, no pallor.  - Abdominal examination: Soft, non-distended. Mild tenderness in left iliac fossa, no palpable masses.  - Speculum examination: Cervix appears healthy, no contact bleeding.  - Bimanual examination: Uterus anteverted, normal size. Left adnexal tenderness noted, with possible nodularity in the pouch of Douglas. No palpable masses.  Assessment:  1. Suspected endometriosis – Given chronic dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and adnexal tenderness.  2. Intermenstrual bleeding – Possible anovulatory cycles or cervical polyp (though not visualised on speculum exam).  Management Plan:  1. Investigations:     - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess for endometriomas, adenomyosis, or fibroids.     - Pelvic MRI if ultrasound inconclusive.     - Consider diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist despite initial management.  2. Medical Management:     - Trial of combined hormonal contraceptive (after counselling) to reduce menstrual bleeding/pain.     - If no improvement, discuss GnRH analogues (with add-back therapy).  3. Fertility Counselling:     - Reassure that endometriosis does not always impair fertility but offer early referral to a gynaecology specialist if conception is desired.  4. Follow-Up:     - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.     - Advised to track symptoms using a pain/bleeding diary.  Patient Advice:  - Encouraged to continue NSAIDs as needed but avoid excessive use.  - Provided with endometriosis support resources.  - Emergency contact details given if pain becomes severe/unmanageable.  Next Steps:  - Await ultrasound results.  - Consider gynaecology referral if symptoms persist or worsen.
