I'm feeling a bit worried about my pregnancy.\n\nClinician: I understand. Let's start by getting some information. Can you please confirm your age and weight?\n\nPatient: I'm 32 years old and I weigh 70 kg, which gives me a BMI of 25.\n\nClinician: Thank you. What seems to be the main concern regarding your pregnancy?\n\nPatient: I've been experiencing severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.\n\nClinician: How long have you been having these symptoms?\n\nPatient: It started about 2 days ago and has been getting worse.\n\nClinician: Have you had any complications in previous pregnancies or any gynaecological issues in the past?\n\nPatient: No, this is my first pregnancy, and I haven't had any gynaecological problems before.\n\nClinician: Do you have any medical conditions or allergies that I should be aware of?\n\nPatient: I have asthma, but no known allergies.\n\nClinician: Thank you for sharing that. Can you tell me a bit about your occupation and social history?\n\nPatient: I work as a teacher and live with my husband and our two cats.\n\nClinician: Alright. Based on your symptoms, I will need to perform a pelvic examination to assess the cause of your pain and bleeding. \n\nAfter the examination:\n\nClinician: Mrs. Johnson, based on the examination findings, it appears that you may have a threatened miscarriage. I recommend bed rest and avoiding strenuous activities. We will also monitor your hormone levels and schedule a follow-up ultrasound to check on the baby's well-being. It's important to stay hydrated and contact us immediately if you experience any worsening symptoms.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance and will follow your recommendations.\n\nClinician: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Take care, and we'll see you at your next appointment.",
