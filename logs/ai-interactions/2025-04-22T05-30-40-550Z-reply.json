She describes the sensation as intense, often worse at night, and notes occasional sharp pain with intercourse. She denies any vaginal discharge, bleeding, or urinary symptoms. She has tried over-the-counter antifungal creams without relief. Relevant History: - No prior pregnancies. - No history of sexually transmitted infections. - No chronic medical conditions. - No known allergies. - No prior vulvar biopsies or procedures. Incomplete aspects: - Family history of autoimmune or dermatologic conditions not explored. - Sexual history (e.g., recent partners, contraception) not fully assessed. - Impact on daily activities or emotional well-being not discussed. ### Objective: Physical Examination: - General: Well-appearing, no acute distress. - Vulvar Inspection: Thin, pale, parchment-like skin with areas of whitish plaques noted on labia minora and perineum. Fissuring present near the posterior fourchette. No active bleeding or ulcerations. - Speculum Exam: Vaginal mucosa appears normal; cervix without lesions. - Bimanual Exam: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa without masses. Incomplete aspects: - No documentation of lymph node assessment. - No mention of anal involvement (common in lichen sclerosus). ### Assessment: Working Diagnosis: Likely lichen sclerosus given classic appearance of vulvar skin changes and symptoms. Differential includes lichen planus or vulvar dysplasia, though less likely. ### Plan: 1. Topical Therapy: Prescribe high-potency corticosteroid ointment (e.g., clobetasol 0.05%) applied thinly to affected areas once daily for 4 weeks, then taper. 2. Symptom Management: Recommend emollients (e.g., plain petroleum jelly) to reduce friction and soothe skin. 3. Follow-Up: Re-evaluate in 6 weeks to assess response. If no improvement, consider biopsy to confirm diagnosis. 4. Counseling: Advised to avoid irritants (e.g., scented soaps, tight clothing). Discussed chronic nature of condition but reassured about benign course with treatment. Omissions in Guidance: - No discussion of long-term monitoring for malignancy risk (rare but increased in lichen sclerosus). - No referral to dermatology or vulvar specialty clinic considered. Next Steps: Patient instructed to call if worsening symptoms or new lesions arise.
