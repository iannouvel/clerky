A: ### **Summary:**  
- **Age:** 42 years

- **Associated Symptoms:** Fatigue, occasional spotting; denies dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or pelvic pain  
- **Medical History:** Hypertension (lisinopril), obesity (BMI 34)  
- **Family History:** Mother with uterine fibroids  
- **Social History:** Sexually active with one partner, inconsistent condom use; non-smoker, occasional alcohol  
- **BMI:** 34  

### **Detailed Assessment:**  
- **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding:** Likely secondary to hormonal imbalance, fibroids, or endometrial pathology.  
- **Differential Diagnoses:** Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory), uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia/polyp, coagulopathy (less likely).  
- **Associated Fatigue:** No dizziness, syncope, or symptoms of anemia reported.  
- **Pelvic Exam Deferred:** Patient declined speculum exam due to discomfort; no external lesions noted.  
- **Missed Assessments:** Hirsutism/acne (PCOS not ruled out), coagulation studies not ordered, incomplete sexual history (STI contribution not explored).  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Diagnostics:**  
   - CBC + ferritin to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH to rule out thyroid dysfunction.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for fibroids and endometrial thickness.  
   - Consider endometrial biopsy if ultrasound is abnormal.  

2. **Management:**  
   - Start tranexamic acid 1 g TID during heavy bleeding days (if no contraindications).  
   - Consider trial of combined oral contraceptive pill after BP reassessment.  
   - Initiate iron supplementation if anemia is confirmed.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks for review of labs and imaging.  
   - Counsel on importance of endometrial biopsy if bleeding persists.  

4. **Patient Education:**  
   - Advised to track bleeding patterns.  
   - Warned about red flags (syncope, severe fatigue).  
   - Discussed weight management for hormonal regulation.
