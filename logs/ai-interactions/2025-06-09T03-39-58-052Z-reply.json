For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids. Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth, and benefits are still seen if given within 24 hours of birth.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation. Steroids have short-term respiratory benefits for the neonate but may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons. Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended. Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage, corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth is likely. Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. There is limited evidence to recommend repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after administration. The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS in pregnancies that birth between 24 hours and 7 days of administration of the second dose.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids have shown significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage among infants born within specific time frames after administration. There is a reduction in fetal and neonatal death for births within 24 hours to seven days after administration. However, caution is advised in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Population-based cohort studies support the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with the largest effect seen 24 hours to seven days after the first injection. Concerns about potential risks to both women and babies include effects on maternal blood glucose levels, fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, long-term metabolic and neurological consequences, and potential impacts on brain development. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of maternal and neonatal hospital services are available.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should not be delayed in serious maternal or fetal conditions. In the presence of systemic infection, the use of corticosteroids should be carefully balanced due to the risk of exacerbating the infection. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies. The maximum number of corticosteroid courses in pregnancy should not exceed three. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions and to investigate potential off-target effects. Recommendations for future research include determining the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing neonatal morbidity in elective caesarean births at term and investigating the safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancies and women with diabetes. Auditable topics include discussions about corticosteroids in planned caesarean births and the proportion of women offered corticosteroids for preterm birth.

  "response": "Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Different management plan** - **Consider antenatal corticosteroids given the planned early delivery (36–37 weeks) for twin pregnancy with obstetric cholestasis.**  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids to women with twins at risk of preterm birth (24+0 to 34+6 weeks). While the current gestation is 32+2 weeks, the planned delivery at 36–37 weeks falls within the late preterm period (35+0 to 36+6 weeks), where corticosteroids should still be considered due to potential respiratory benefits, despite increased hypoglycemia risk. [Reference: Guideline section on late preterm birth and multiple pregnancies.]  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - **Document discussion with the patient about risks/benefits of antenatal corticosteroids, especially given twin pregnancy and planned early delivery.**  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes informed decision-making regarding corticosteroids, particularly in multiple pregnancies where evidence is limited. The note does not mention counseling on this intervention. [Reference: Guideline section on informed discussion and multiple pregnancies.]  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - **Provide clearer counseling on the potential need for corticosteroids if delivery occurs earlier than planned (e.g., due to worsening cholestasis).**  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights that corticosteroids should not delay delivery if medically indicated but should be offered if birth is imminent (<34+6 weeks). The patient should be aware of this possibility. [Reference: Guideline section on timing and contraindications.]  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - **Monitor maternal glucose levels if corticosteroids are administered, given the potential risk of hyperglycemia.**  \n   Reason: The guideline cautions about corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia, especially in women without diabetes. While this patient has no diabetes history, close monitoring would align with best practices. [Reference: Guideline section on maternal risks.]  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - **Clarify whether a growth scan was performed recently (within 1–2 weeks) to assess fetal well-being, as this may influence corticosteroid timing.**  \n   Reason: The guideline does not explicitly link growth scans to corticosteroid administration, but fetal well-being assessments are critical in high-risk pregnancies like twins with cholestasis.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - **Consider providing written information on antenatal corticosteroids alongside cholestasis materials.**  \n   Reason: While not critical, supplemental education on corticosteroids (if used) could enhance patient understanding.  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:  \n- **Missing corticosteroid plan** for a twin pregnancy with planned preterm delivery, despite guideline recommendations.  \n- **No documented discussion** of risks/benefits, which is a key auditable standard in the guideline.  \n\nSuggested additions to the note:  \n- *\"Given twin gestation and planned delivery at 36–37 weeks, discussed option of antenatal corticosteroids with patient, including potential respiratory benefits for neonates and risks of neonatal hypoglycemia. Patient opted for [decision]. Plan to administer [dexamethasone/betamethasone] if delivery occurs before 35+0 weeks.\"*  \n- *\"Will monitor maternal glucose levels if corticosteroids given.\"*  \n\nThese changes would align the note with the guideline’s emphasis on proactive corticosteroid use in preterm twin deliveries and shared decision-making.",
