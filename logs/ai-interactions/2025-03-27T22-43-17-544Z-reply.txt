**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Appendicectomy (age 20)**

**Drug History:**

**Family History:**  
- Mother: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker  
- Occasional alcohol (2–3 units/week)  
- Works full-time in an office setting  
- Lives with husband and 5-year-old child  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns & Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that her weight is affecting fertility and bleeding. Concerned about possible fibroids or cancer.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about difficulty conceiving and impact of heavy bleeding on daily life.  
- **Expectations:** Wants investigations and treatment to regulate cycles and improve fertility.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese (BMI 44), no pallor, no signs of hyperandrogenism.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Pelvic exam:**  
  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  
- **No evidence of infection or cervical motion tenderness.**  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Blood tests:** FBC (anaemia screen), HbA1c (glucose control), TSH, prolactin, testosterone (PCOS follow-up).  
2. **Pelvic ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, and rule out fibroids/polyps.  
3. **Hysteroscopy (if ultrasound abnormal):** For further evaluation of heavy bleeding.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding:**  
   - **Medical:** Tranexamic acid (if not contraindicated) + progesterone therapy (cyclical norethisterone).  
   - **Surgical (if medical therapy fails):** Consider endometrial ablation or Mirena IUS (if fertility not immediate goal).  
2. **Subfertility:**  
   - **Weight management:** Referral to dietitian + bariatric team (BMI 44 increases pregnancy risks).  
   - **Ovulation induction (if anovulatory):** Clomiphene citrate (after excluding tubal blockage).  
   - **Further tests:** Day 21 progesterone (luteal phase), HSG (tubal patency).  
3. **Anaemia:** Iron supplementation if Hb low.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review ultrasound and blood results in 2 weeks.  
- Discuss fertility options based on findings.  
- Advised to track cycles with ovulation kits.  

**Impression:**  
1. **Complex PCOS with obesity-related subfertility.**  
2. **Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely anovulatory vs. structural cause).**
