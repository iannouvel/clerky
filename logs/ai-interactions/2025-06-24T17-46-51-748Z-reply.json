set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. \nThis guidance is for midwives and doctors working in and with University Hospitals Sussex (Legacy \nEast) Maternity Services. The guidance is not rigid and should be tailored to the individual \ncircumstances of each woman or pregnant person. If the guidance is not being followed, \ndocumentation of the reasoning and/or justification is essential, with clear documentation of \nalternative plans and discussions. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a \nprotocol. \n \nScope \nThis protocol applies to: All childbearing women and people. \n \nResponsibilities \nMidwives & Obstetricians: \n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \n• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol. \n \nManagement Team: \n• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations \n• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \n• To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n7 \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring in the Antenatal Period \n \nAim of Antenatal Fetal Monitoring \nTo identify a fetus at risk of intrauterine hypoxia and acidaemia. Timely and appropriate intervention \nmay avoid fetal neurological damage or death. \n \nIntermittent Auscultation \nAntenatal period auscultation of the fetal heart (FH) may confirm that the fetus is alive but is \nunlikely to have any predictive value and routine listening is, therefore, not recommended. \nHowever, when requested by the woman or pregnant person, auscultation of the fetal heart may \nprovide reassurance. \nThe fetal heart rate (FHR) should be auscultated by pinard or sonicaid pre/post intervention e.g. \nprior to administration of intramuscular analgesia and vaginal examination. \n \nElectronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) \nFor a woman or birthing person without identified risk factors, continuous electronic fetal \nmonitoring is not indicated and should not be employed. \nCardiotography (CTG) is the most adopted tool for antenatal fetal assessment. It should not be used \nin isolation. This protocol aims to assist midwives and obstetricians in the interpretation of antenatal \nCTG. This includes understanding the situations where computerised CTG (cCTG) is indicated and \nhow to interpret the Dawes Redman (DR) Criteria. Saving Babies Lives (SBLB)v2 recommends DR \nanalysis in the antenatal period. It is also a Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) \nrequirement. \n \nComputerised CTG (cCTG) – DR Analysis \ncCTG provides objective CTG interpretation and is evidence based. It allows the communication of \nrobust numeric facts as opposed to opinion. DR analysis references a database of 150,000 traces and \nrelates it to outcomes. It therefore acts as an ‘expert assistant’ for CTG interpretation and accurate \ninterpretation criteria. The use of cCTG compared to traditional CTG showed a significant reduction \nin perinatal mortality (Cochrane review, 2015). The final clinical judgement should be based on the \nentire clinical assessment with cCTG forming a part of this holistic approach to pregnancy \nmanagement. \nSee Appendix 1 for the dataset from which the DR criteria are derived. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n8 \n\nGestational Age for cCTG \nSevere pre-term pregnancies: The Local Maternity and Neonatal System (LMNS) has agreed 26/40 \nas the gestation before which continuous electronic monitoring might not be carried out. Decisions \naround fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and people, and the \nmulti-disciplinary (MDT) team which should include Neonatal staff. \nThe DR criteria are based upon the normal distribution at 32 weeks. Gestations below 32 weeks may \ntake longer to meet criteria due to an immature central nervous system. \nIndications for Dawes Redman (DR) Criteria \nComputerised CTG (cCTG) should be performed in the antenatal period for fetal monitoring as per \nthese clinical indications: \n• Gestational age ≥ 26 weeks \n• Reduced fetal movements \n• Polyhydramnios \n• Oligohydramnios \n• Antepartum haemorrhage \n• Abdominal pain or trauma \n• Multiple pregnancy \n• Diabetes \n• Previous CS or uterine surgery \n• Obstetric Cholestasis \n• Maternal hypertension \n• Pre-eclampsia \n• Fetal growth restriction \n• PROM/PPROM \n• Pre-prostaglandin to induce labour. NOT for use after administering PGE \n• Pre, and post, ARM to induce labour \n• Pre, and post, stretch and membrane sweep \n• Threatened pre-term labour where FFN is negative and no palpable or painful contractions \n• Other reasons for antenatal CTG in the absence of palpable or painful contractions \nDawes Redman Criteria is NOT appropriate for intrapartum fetal monitoring. It must be \ndiscontinued once the woman is in active labour or has palpable or painful contractions. \nSee Appendix 2 for a quick reference flow chart for DR CTG. \nEquipment \nA Huntleigh Sonicaid Team3 monitor must be used for all antenatal cCTGs. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n9 \n\nSetting Up The cCTG Monitor \n1. Turn on the machine by touching the on/off switch on the front, upper right corner \nof the machine for 3 seconds \n2. Ensure the date and time are correct on the machine \n3. Position the toco and ultrasound transducers. Dawes Redman Criteria cannot be met \nwith >10% loss of contact – therefore reposition transducers if contact is poor \n4. Manually palpate the maternal radial pulse to differentiate between fetal heart and \nmaternal heart rates \n5. Auscultate FHR by sonic aid or pinard before commencing the CTG to confirm fetal \nheart rate sounds \n6. Connect the fetal movement button and show the woman or birthing person how to \nuse it. AUTOMATIC FETAL MOVEMENT INTERPRETATION IS NOT VALID FOR DAWES \nREDMAN ANALYSIS. Fetal movements will only be registered if the fetal movement \nbutton is pressed. It is imperative that women and birthing people are informed as \nto the importance of using this button. Dawes Redman will not analyse fetal \nmovements as a discrete element \n7. Input patient name, hospital number and gestational age. Use the scan EDD. DO \nNOT use LMP \n8. Ensure maternal pulse is recording \n9. Select DR criteria through the settings button \n10. Press print \n11. Sign and print the paper cCTG \n12. At the end of the trace press ‘print’ to print the DR analysis \n \nNOTE the analysis will not start unless the gestation is entered. \n\nDuration of Dawes Redman Monitoring \n1. 10 minutes \nThe computer analyses the CTG data and compares it with the DR criteria, initially at 10 minutes, and \nevery 2 minutes thereafter. \n2. 60 minutes \nThe maximum record length for DR analysis is 60 minutes. At this point criteria are either ‘Met’ or \n‘Not Met’. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n10 \n\n1. Basal heart rate outside normal range \n2. Large decelerations \n3. No episodes of high variation \n4. No movements and fewer than three accelerations \n5. Baseline fitting is uncertain \n6. Short-term variation is less than 3ms \n7. Possible error at the end of the record \n8. Deceleration at the end of the record \n9. High-frequency sinusoidal rhythm \n10. Suspected sinusoidal rhythm \n11. Long-term variation in high episodes below acceptable level \n12. No accelerations \nInterpreting Dawes Redman Analysis \nResults – Criteria Met \nIf the computerised CTG (cCTG) meets DR criteria, the trace is normal. The criteria can be achieved \nas early as 10 minutes. The CTG can be stopped if there are no additional clinical concerns. If there \nare other clinical concerns, the DR analysis can be turned off, but the CTG should be continued. \nResults – Criteria NOT Met \nThe cCTG must continue for FULL 60 minutes before it can be said to have ‘Not Met’ criteria. \nHowever, all CTGs must be visually inspected and escalated if there are a concern before 60 minutes \nhas elapsed. \nIf the criteria are still not met at 60 minutes, the Huntleigh machine will end the analysis and print \nthe results, but the trace will continue. The reasons why criteria might not meet are highlighted \nbelow: \nReasons why criteria may not have met: \n\nWhat to do when criteria is not met at 60 minutes \n• Manage the CTG trace with conservative measures as per usual \n• Use your clinical judgement and classify the trace according to NICE Antenatal Guidelines \nand document on BadgerNet \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n11 \n\nSTV Values \n≥ 4ms: NORMAL \n< 4ms: LOW \n< 3ms: ABNORMAL \n< 2ms: HIGHLY ABNORMAL \nDawes Redman STV: Guidance only – Management should \nbe planned on an individual basis and clinical information. \n \nIf criteria Not Met, but the trace visually appears normal: \n \n1.4.0 milliseconds or more: \na.>37 weeks – repeat CTG within 4 hours \nb.<37 weeks – repeat CTG within 24 hours. If RFM repeat within \n4 hours \n2. 3.0 – 3.99ms: \nRepeat CTG within 4 hours \n3. <3.0ms: \nPreterminal trace – notify medical staff IMMEDIATELY \n• Escalate to Obstetric Registrar ≥ST3 \n• Use your clinical judgement as to whether the trace should continue, or can be stopped, \nwhile awaiting clinical review \n• Check short term variation \n• Escalate to the LWC if timely Obstetric SpR review is unavailable \n \nShort Term Variation (STV) \nShort-term variation is a computerised measure of the micro fluctuations of the fetal heart, invisible \nto the human eye. STV is invalid before 60 minutes has elapsed. The STV should be considered, but \nMUST NOT be used in isolation as an indicator of fetal condition. \nA value of less than 3ms is strongly linked to the development of metabolic acidaemia and \nimpending intrauterine death, particularly in the absence of an episode of high variation. STV of less \nthan 3ms should be discussed and reviewed immediately by the Consultant. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n12 \n\nDO NOT RELY ON THE DR ANALYSIS IN ISOLATION: It may not identify abnormal \npatterns that may be more obvious on visual interpretation. Ensure holistic assessment of \nthe clinical scenario. \n \nFetal Heart Monitoring During Intrapartum Period \n \nAim of Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring \nTo identify hypoxia before it is sufficient to lead to long-term poor neurological outcome for babies. \n \nInitial Assessment for Monitoring \nPerform an initial assessment of antenatal risk factors for fetal compromise at the onset of labour to \ndetermine whether intermittent auscultation (IA) or cardiotocography (CTG) is offered as the initial \nmethod of fetal heart rate monitoring. \nConfirm with the woman or birthing person which method of fetal monitoring has already been \nadvised as part of their personalised care plan. Explain to the woman or birthing person that risk \nassessment is a continual process, and that the advised method of fetal heart rate monitoring may \nchange throughout the course of labour. \nLow Risk Pregnancies \nOffer intermittent auscultation (IA) of the fetal heart rate in low-risk pregnancies in all birth settings. \nIncreased Risk Pregnancies \nOffer continuous fetal monitoring (CTG) in pregnancies with increased risk. See Appendix 3: \nIndications for CTG Use. \n \nIntermittent Auscultation in Labour \nEnsure one-to-one support is maintained by having a midwife remain with the woman throughout \nlabour. If the midwife needs to leave the room or there needs to be a change in staff, ensure the \nwoman or birthing person knows this is happening. \nEquipment \nA pinard stethoscope or handheld doppler ultrasound (sonicaid) device should be used for IA in all \npractice areas. A description of the equipment used should be documented in the maternal notes. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n13 \n\nActions: \n• Carry out IA immediately after a palpated contraction for at least 1 minute, at least once \nevery 15 minutes, and record the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) it as a single rate on the BadgerNet \npartogram and in the woman's notes \n• Record accelerations and decelerations, if heard \n• Palpate, and record on the partogram, the maternal pulse hourly, or more often if there are \nany concerns, to ensure differentiation between the maternal and fetal heartbeats \n• If no fetal heartbeat is detected, offer urgent real-time ultrasound assessment to check fetal \nviability \nOnce the woman or birthing person has signs of, or is in confirmed second stage of labour: \n• Perform IA immediately after a palpated contraction for at least 1 minute, at least once \nevery 5 minutes and record the FHR as a single rate on the partogram \n• Palpate the woman's pulse simultaneously, at least every 5 minutes, to differentiate \nbetween the maternal and fetal heart rates and record this on the partogram \n• If there are concerns about differentiating between the 2 heart rates, seek help and consider \nchanging the method of fetal heart rate monitoring. \nSuspected Rising Baseline Rate (BLR) rate or decelerations: \nIf there is a rising baseline fetal heart rate (as plotted on the partogram) of ≥20 beats a minute from \nthe start of labour or within the last hour, or decelerations are suspected on IA, actions should \ninclude: \n• Carry out IA more frequently eg. after the next 3 consecutive contractions \n• Carry out a full review of the whole clinical picture taking into account: antenatal and \nexisting or new intrapartum risk factors; maternal observations; frequency of contractions \n(including hypertonus); and the progress of labour. \nConfirmation of rising BLR or decelerations \nIf a rising baseline rate or decelerations are confirmed, further actions should include: \n• Summoning help \n• Advising continuous CTG, and explaining to the woman or birthing person, and their birth \ncompanion(s), why it is needed \n• Transferring the woman or birthing person to obstetric-led care if it is safe and appropriate \nto do so. \nReturn to intermittent auscultation if continuous CTG monitoring has been started due to concerns \narising from intermittent auscultation, and the CTG trace is normal after 20 minutes. If the woman \nor birthing person decides to remain on continuous CTG monitoring, so be it. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n14 \n\nHourly review \nPerform and document a systematic assessment of the condition of the woman and unborn baby \nevery hour, more frequently if there are concerns. Update the labour ward coordinator (LWC) of \nprogress and escalate concerns sooner if necessary. Discuss the results of each hourly assessment \nwith the woman and base recommendations about care in labour on her preferences and: \n• Their reports of the frequency, length and strength of contractions \n• Any antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for fetal compromise \n• The current wellbeing of the woman or birthing person and unborn baby \n• How labour is progressing. \nInclude birthing companion(s) in these discussions if appropriate and if that is what the woman or \nbirthing person wants. \nHomebirth \nIt is recommended that Homebirth Midwives update the LWC every 4 hours on the red phone, at the \nsite woman or birthing person is booked at, when: Confirmed in established labour or staying at a \nhomebirth; on leaving if NIEL. This is to ensure the safety and support of the MW at the homebirth. \nBetween the hours of 0800-1700, Monday to Friday, this update can be with Community Team \nLeader, who can then inform the LWC. \nDocumentation for IA \nThe following should be documented contemporaneously on the BadgerNet partogram: \n• The fetal heart rate as a single rate at least every 15 minutes in 1\nst\n stage of labour \n• The fetal heart rate as a single rate at least every 5 minutes in 2\nnd\n stage of labour \n• Woman’s or birthing person’s pulse: Every hour in the 1\nst\n stage, every 5 minutes in the 2\nnd\n \nstage of labour \n• Any abnormalities thought to be heard, and a plan in relation to this \n• Any transfer from intermittent auscultation to continuous electronic fetal monitoring and \nthe reasons therefore \n• Hourly assessment on women and unborn baby \n• 4 hourly maternal observations including: blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, \ntemperature, and bladder care. \n \nContinuous Cardiotocography (CTG) in Labour \nHypoxic events in labour contribute to 10-20% of the total population of brain damaged infants and \nsuch damage is potentially preventable by adequate fetal monitoring and appropriate management \nof the hypoxic fetus. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n15 \n\nIt is recommended that women or birthing people with any high risk features have their baby \nmonitored continuously throughout their labour once it is established. \n \nGestational Age for CTG \nSevere pre-term pregnancies: The Local Maternity and Neonatal System (LMNS) has agreed 26/40 \nas the gestation before which continuous electronic monitoring might not be carried out. Decisions \naround fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and people, and the \nmulti-disciplinary (MDT) team which should include Neonatal staff. \nEquipment \nA cardiotocograph (CTG) machine should be used for continuous fetal heart monitoring. This can \nonly be performed in the hospital environment. \nDo not use Dawes Redman analysis: It is not valid in the intrapartum period. \n \nTelemetry \nEnsure wireless transducers are kept charged and maintained so that they are ready to use. \nSwitch from wireless to wired transducers as soon as possible if there is signal loss which is not \nresolved by reducing the distance between the base unit and the woman, in order to confirm \nwhether or not there is a clinical problem. \n \nManagement of Continuous Fetal Monitoring \nWhen being continuously monitored, a woman or pregnant person should be offered one-2-one \ncare. This will enable prompt reaction to any deviation from normality. \nCTG Reviews \n• The CTG trace must be systematically assessed every 30 minutes by the midwife caring for \nthe woman or pregnant person. Include: baseline rate, baseline variability, accelerations, \nand decelerations \n• Consider the woman or pregnant person’s holistic picture and care \n• Document the review in the woman or pregnant person’s BadgerNet record. \n \nFresh Eyes \nOn an hourly basis another Midwife (≥Band 6) or Obstetrician (≥ST3) should systematically review all \ncontinuous CTGs alongside the midwife providing care. Where possible, the team-member providing \nthe fresh eyes review should not be the same every time in order to have a true fresh eye \nassessment. The assessment should be logged in the BadgerNet record as a ‘Peer Review’. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n16 \n\nThe review should include: \n• A complete holistic review of the woman or birthing person \n• Risk assessment, contractions, baseline rate, variability, accelerations and decelerations \n• Any infusions in progress \n• The plan going forward. \n \nInterpretation of the INTRAPARTUM CTG \nIf there are changes in the fetal heart rate pattern over time which indicate a change in the baby's \ncondition, review antenatal or intrapartum risk factors for hypoxia. \nWhen reviewing a CTG trace, assess and document the following: \n• Contractions \n• Baseline fetal heart rate \n• Variability \n• Presence or absence of decelerations (and characteristics of decelerations if present) \n• (Presence of accelerations). \nCategorise the 4 features of the CTG trace (contractions, baseline fetal heart rate, variability, \ndecelerations) as WHITE, AMBER or RED (indicating increasing levels of concern), and consider \nalongside the presence, or not, of accelerations, to classify the overall CTG trace as NORMAL, \nSUSPICIOUS or PATHOLOGICAL. \nContractions \n• Use a tocodynamometer to record contraction frequency and length on the CTG trace \n• If decelerations are present, evaluate their timing in relation to contractions \n• If 5 or more contractions per 10 minutes are present: \n- perform a full risk assessment \n- take action to reduce contraction frequency as described in the section on underlying \ncauses and conservative measures \n- explain to the woman what is happening, and ensure that she has adequate pain relief. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n17 \n\nWHITE AMBER RED \nFewer than 5 contractions \n5 or more contractions in 10 \nminutes, leading to reduced \nresting time between \ncontractions \n\nOR \n\nHyertonus (contraction lasting \n2 minutes or long) \n\nBaseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) \nWhen assessing baseline FHR, differentiate between fetal and maternal heartbeats \nDetermine baseline fetal heart rate by looking at the mean fetal heart rate, excluding accelerations \nand decelerations, over a period of 10 minutes when the fetal heart rate is stable. When deciding if \nthere is any change in baseline fetal heart rate, compare it with earlier CTG traces or recordings of \nfetal heart rate. \nConsider that lower baseline fetal heart rates are expected with post-term pregnancies, with higher \nbaseline rates in preterm pregnancies. \nA rise in baseline fetal heart rate may indicate either developing infection or hypoxia. \n\nWHITE AMBER RED \nStable baseline of 110 to 160 \nbeats a minute (bpm) \nIncrease in baseline FHR of 20 \nbpm or more from the start of \nlabour or since the last review \nan hour ago \nOR \nUnable to determine baseline \nrate \nOR \n100-109bpm \nBelow 100bpm \nOR \nAbove 160bpm \n\nIncrease in FHR baseline of \n200bpm or more in active 2nd \nstage \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n18 \n\nVariability \nDetermine variability by looking at the minor oscillations in the fetal heart rate, which usually occur \nat 3 to 5 cycles a minute. Measure it by estimating the difference in beats per minute between the \nhighest heart rate and the lowest heart rate in a 1-minute segment of the trace between \ncontractions, excluding decelerations and accelerations. \nIf there is an absence of variability, carry out a review of the whole clinical picture with a low \nthreshold for expedited birth, as this is a very concerning feature. \nTake the following into account when assessing fetal heart rate variability: \n• variability will usually be between 5 and 25 beats a minute (bpm) \n• intermittent periods of reduced variability are normal, especially during periods of \nquiescence ('sleep') \n• certain medicines, such as opioids, may lead to a reduction in variability, but all other \nintrapartum risk factors should be carefully reviewed as a potential cause (for example, look \nfor other features on the CTG such as a rise in the baseline fetal heart suggestive of another \nreason such as sepsis) \n• increased variability refers to oscillations around the baseline fetal heart rate of more than \n25 bpm, and shorter episodes lasting a few minutes may represent worsening fetal \ncondition. \nObtain an urgent review by an obstetrician or senior midwife and consider expediting birth if: \n• there is an isolated reduction in variability to fewer than 5 bpm for more than 30 minutes \nwhen combined with antenatal or intrapartum risk factors, as this is associated with an \nincreased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, \nOR \n• there is a reduction in variability to fewer than 5 bpm combined with other CTG changes, \nparticularly a rise in the baseline fetal heart rate, as this is a strong indicator for fetal \ncompromise. \n\nWHITE AMBER RED \n5-25 bpm \nFewer than 5bpm for between \n30 and 50 minutes \n\nOR \n\nMore than 25 beats a minute \nfor up to 10 minutes \nFewer than 5bpm for more \nthan 50 minutes \nOR \nMore than 25bpm for more \nthan 10 minutes \nOR \nSinusoidal \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n19 \n\nDecelerations \nDefine decelerations as transient episodes when the fetal heart rate slows to below the baseline rate \nby more than 15 beats a minute, with each episode lasting 15 seconds or more. An exception to this \nis that in a trace with reduced variability, decelerations may be 'shallow'. \nConcerning characteristics of variable decelerations: \n• Lasting more than 60 seconds \n• Reduced variability within the deceleration \n• Failure or slow return to baseline fetal heart rate \n• Loss of previously present shouldering. \n\nWHITE AMBER RED \nNo decelerations \nOR \nEarly decelerations \nOR \nVariable decelerations that are \nnot evolving to have \nconcerning characteristics \nRepetitive variable \ndecelerations with any \nconcerning characteristics for \nless than 30 minutes \nOR \nVariable decelerations with \nany concerning characteristics \nfor more than 30 minutes* \nOR \nrepetitive late decelerations \nfor less than 30 minutes \nRepetitive variable \ndecelerations with any \nconcerning characteristics for \nmore than 30 minutes* \nOR \nRepetive late decelerations for \nmore than 30 minutes* \nOR \nAcute bradycardia or a single \nprolonged deceleration lasting \n3 minutes or more \n\n*If there are decelerations lasting longer than 30 minutes in the presence of either rise in baseline \nheart rate or reduced variability, start conservative measure and carry out urgent obstetric review. \nTake into account the following to determine the need to expedite birth: \n• Sepsis \n• Presence of meconium \n• Slow progress of labour \n• Use of oxytocin \nIf variable decelerations with no concerning characteristics and no other CTG changes, including no \nrise in the baseline fetal heart rate, are observed: \n• Be aware that these are very common, can be a normal feature in an otherwise \nuncomplicated labour and birth, and are usually a result of cord compression \n• Support the woman to change position or mobilise \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n20 \n\nTake into account that early decelerations are uncommon and usually associated with head \ncompression and that they are not accompanied by any other CTG changes such as reduced \nvariability or a rise in FHR. \nAccelerations \nDefine accelerations as transient increases in fetal heart rate of 15 beats a minute or more, lasting \n15 seconds or more. \nTake the following into account when assessing accelerations in fetal heart rate: \n• The presence of fetal heart rate accelerations, even with reduced variability, is generally a \nsign that the baby is healthy \n• The absence of accelerations on an otherwise normal CTG trace does not indicate fetal \nacidosis. \n \nClassifying the Intrapartum CTG \n\nNORMAL SUSPICIOUS PATHOLOGICAL \nNo amber or red features. All \n4 features are white \nAny 1 feature is amber \nAny 1 feature is red \nOR \n2 or more features are amber \n\nAfter the CTG trace has been classified, discuss with the birth person and their partner what is \nhappening. Take into account their individual circumstances and preferences, and support their \ndecisions. \n \nActions following CTG Classification \n\nCLASSIFICATION \n \nPLAN \n \nNORMAL \n \n- perform a full assessment including a full set of maternal \nobservations, taking into account the whole clinical picture \nand document the findings \n- continue to perform full risk assessment hourly \n \nSUSPICIOUS with no \nother concerning risk \nfactors \n \n- perform a full risk assessment \n- escalate to obstetrician and midwife in charge \n- note that is the accelerations are present then fetal \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n21 \n\nacidosis is unlikely \n- if the CTG was classified as normal in the last fresh eyes, \nconsider possibly underlying reasons for the change \n- undertake change in maternal position \n \nSUSPICOUS with \nintrapartum risk factors \nsuch as slow progress, \nsepsis or meconium \n \n- perform a full risk assessment \n- consider possible underlying causes and undertake \nconservative measures \n- obtain an urgent review by an obstetrician \n- inform senior midwife \n- consider fetal scalp stimulation or expediting birth \n \nPATHOLOGICAL \n \n- urgent review by an obstetrician \n- inform midwife in charge immediately \n- exclude acute events (cord prolapse, abruption and uterine \nabruption) that need immediate intervention \n- perform full risk assessment \n- consider possible underlying causes \n \nPATHOLOGICAL after \nimplementing \nconservative measure \n \n- obtain urgent review by an obstetrician and a senior \nmidwife \n- evaluate the whole clinical picture consider expediting \nbirth \n \nBradycardia or single \nprolonged deceleration \nfor 2 minutes or more \n \n- urgently seek obstetric review \n- prepare for urgent birth, including a request for neonatal \nsupport \n- expedite birth \n- if FHR has recovered at any time up to 9 minutes, reassess \nany decision to expedite the birth. Take into account \nantenatal and intrapartum risk factors, and discuss this \nwith the women or birthing person \n\nConservative Measures \nIf there are concerns about the baby's wellbeing, be aware of the possible underlying causes and \nstart 1 or more of the following conservative measures based on an assessment of the most likely \ncause(s): \n• Maternal position (this can affect uterine blood flow and cord compression): Encourage the \nwoman to mobilise, adopt an alternative position, and avoid being supine \n• Hypotension. Do not offer intravenous fluids to treat fetal heart rate abnormalities unless \nthe woman is hypotensive or has signs of sepsis. If the woman is hypotensive secondary to \nan epidural top-up, start intravenous fluids, move her to a left lateral position and call an \nanaesthetist to review \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n22 \n\n• If there is excessive contraction frequency, consider reducing or turning oxytocin off and/or \noffering subcutaneous terbutaline 0.25mg. \nFetal Scalp Stimulation \nIf the CTG trace is suspicious with antenatal or intrapartum risk factors, consider digital fetal scalp \nstimulation. If this leads to an acceleration in fetal heart rate and a sustained improvement in the \nCTG trace, continue to monitor fetal heart rate and clinical picture for the next 30 minutes. \nBe aware that the absence of an acceleration in response to fetal scalp stimulation is a worrying sign \nthat fetal compromise may be present, and that expedited birth may be necessary. \nFetal Blood Sampling \nThere is limited evidence that fetal blood sampling (FBS) improves the outcomes for women and \npregnant people and babies compared to CTG alone. Therefore, the recommendation is to avoid \nusing FBS as an aid to check for fetal hypoxia. \nIf a FBS is carried out this must have be discussed and agreed with the Consultant on-call and the \nreason for its use clearly documented on BadgerNet. \nFBS results should be clearly documented on BadgerNet alongside the on-going management plan. \n \nDocumentation for CTGs \nLinking Traces \n• A Huntleigh monitor trace must be scanned and uploaded to BadgerNet until such time that \nSonicCentrale is implemented \n• A Philips trace must be connected through BadgerNet. If this is not possible, the trace must \nbe scanned and uploaded to BadgerNet. \nBadgerNet \n• The rationale for the CTG should be documented on BadgerNet \n• Any member of staff who is asked to provide an opinion on a trace should document their \nfindings in the BadgerNet record. In the case of Fresh Eyes, they should document their \nassessment in the BadgerNet record as a ‘Peer Review’ \n• With every review an action plan should be agreed and documented \n• On completion of the tracing, ensure the CTG is disconnected from BadgerNet or \nSonicCentrale. \nAntenatal cCTG \n• The cCTG should be reviewed on BadgerNet using the CTG review form: Ensure the \n‘computerised CTG’ button is checked \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n23 \n\n• The practitioner who ends the cCTG must sign the trace and document to confirm that the \nCTG is normal. If at any point the practitioner disagrees with the outcome on the printout, \nthis must be escalated to a Senior Obstetric Registrar or Obstetric Consultant. \nIntrapartum: 1\nst\n stage of labour \n- Fetal heart rate to be recorded on the partogram at least every 15 minutes \n- Maternal pulse to recorded on the partogram every hour: More frequently if required \n- Clear documentation on the woman’s wellbeing \n- Document full assessment and fresh eyes every hour on BadgerNet. \n \nIntrapartum: 2\nnd\n stage of labour \n- Fetal heart rate to be recorded on the partogram at least every 5 minutes \n- Maternal pulse to recorded on the partogram every 15 minutes alongside fetal heart \nrate: More frequently if required \n- Clear documentation on the woman’s wellbeing \n- Document full assessment and fresh eyes every hour on BadgerNet. \n \nAll Traces \n• Ensure the date and time on the CTG machine is set correctly \n• At the start of a trace, enter the woman or pregnant person’s details via the interactive \nscreen, use a sticker, or handwrite the person’s details. As a minimum include: \n- The woman or pregnant person’s name \n- The current gestation \n- Date and time (CTG date stamp) \n- Woman or pregnant person’s hospital number \n- Woman or pregnant person’s pulse \n- The woman or pregnant person’s risk status and indication for the CTG \n• During the trace handwrite or use the notes buttons on the CTG screen, to log events such \nas vaginal examination, fetal blood sampling and siting of an epidural etc. Document events \non BadgerNet also \n• Any member of staff who is asked to provide an opinion on a trace should document their \nfindings on the (c)CTG trace: Their classification, signature, print and grade should be \nincluded. \nPostnatal \n- Health professional’s signature and print \n- Date & time of birth \n- Mode of birth. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n24 \n\nRecord Keeping \nDocumentation will be kept by this Trust for a period of 25 years. Any paper documentation must be \nstored securely in a folder or envelope provided and created by the ward clerk. These folders should \nbe stored on labour ward. \nIn cases where there is a concern that the baby may have sustained a possible brain injury, scan the \n(c)CTG trace and upload to BadgerNet. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n25 \n\nAppendix 1: The Dawes Redman Criteria Dataset \n\nSignal loss (%) \n \nThe percentage of the trace for which there was no fetal heart rate \nrecorded. Signal loss is usually due to poor transducer positioning or fetal \nmovement. Reposition the transducer to get the best possible signal, \nensuring plenty of gel is used. If the signal loss is >50% during accelerations \nor large decelerations, these will not be included in the analysis results. \n \nContractions \n \nThe software registers a contraction if there is a rise of 16% or more, lasting \nfor 30 seconds or more, from the resting ‘zero’ line. \n \nMovements \n \nSimply counts fetal movements recorded by the mother. Note that this will \nalways be shown as zero for twins monitoring, as it is not possible to tell \nwhich fetus is moving. \n \nBasal Heart Rate \n(bpm) \n \nThis is the average rate measured normally during periods of low variation. \nOn very reactive traces it is assessed by a ‘best fit’ method. It is similar to \nvisually assessed baseline rate (BLR) but may differ with some trace \npatterns (eg. very reactive, large decelerations, etc.). Users should always \nvisually assess BLR independently from the analysis. \n \nAccelerations \n \nA rise from the BLR of 10bpm or more, lasting 15 seconds or more. \nResearch has shown that a small percentage (5-8%) of traces without \naccelerations are in fact normal. It is not therefore essential to have \naccelerations present for the trace to be interpreted as normal. This is \nparticularly true \n \nDecelerations \n \nA fall from the BLR of at least 10bpm, lasting 60s or more, with >5 ‘lost \nbeats’, or a decrease of 20bpm lasting 30 seconds or more, with >5 ‘lost \nbeats’. See below for definition of ‘lost beats’. \n \nHigh Episodes \n \nThis is a measure of how reactive the trace is. Rather than relying on \naccelerations (see above), this measures the amount of time the change \nfrom one beat to the next exceeds a certain level. It can be interpreted as \nthe period of time, during the trace, over which the FHR was highly \nreactive. \n \nLost Beats \n \n‘Lost beats’ are a measure of the area or ‘size’ of the deceleration. To \nunderstand this, consider a trace with a baseline rate of 120bpm with a 1 \nminute deceleration. If the heart rate had stayed at the baseline rate for \nthis period, instead of decelerating, there would have been 120 heart beats \nin the one minute. Because of the deceleration, the FHR slowed down and \nthere were actually only, say, 80 beats during the one minute. This means it \n‘lost’ (120-80 =) 40 beats – this is how DR measures decelerations, in ‘Lost \nbeats’. Lost beats is simply the ‘size’ of the largest deceleration. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n26 \n\nShort Term \nVariation \n(STV) (ms) \n \nThis is a form of ‘variability’ or ‘baseline variation’. Traditionally, variability \nis assessed visually as the difference between the highest & lowest rates in \na 1 minute period during a quiescent period (ie. no accelerations or \ndecelerations). Short Term Variation (STV) is essentially the same, but \nmeasured over a much shorter time period than can be done visually \n(3.75s). It is measured in milliseconds rather than bpm. This is the time \nbetween beats, rather than the number of beats per minute – just a \ndifferent way of measuring heart beats. In non-reactive traces, STV has \nbeen shown to correlate highly with the development of metabolic \nhypoxaemia and intrauterine death. If there is a consistent downward \ntrend in STV towards or below 3ms over period of days or weeks, delivery \nmay need to be expedited. \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n\n27 \n \nCommence cCTG recording unless uterine activity is present \nFirst result is available at 10 minutes, and every 2 minutes thereafter to a maximum of 60 minutes. \nAppendix 2: Quick Reference Flow Chart for DR CTG \n\nNO \nYes \n\nNO \n\nYes \n\nCriteria for NOT using D/R \n- labour \n- <26 weeks \n- Latent phase \n- Post PGE insertion (or within 24 hours) \n \nIf you are not using DR, please use Phillips machines \nto allow connectivity to BadgerNet. \nIf you have commenced DR CTG for pre IOL CTG, \ncontinue to use same machine for ease and file \nappropriately. \n \nCriteria for using D/R \n- GA ≥ 26 weeks \n- no palpable or painful contractions \n- before/after sweep \n- IOL- pre first PGE insertion \n \nCriteria Met \nVisually review and classify \nthe CTG. If this is normal and \nthere are no other on-going \nclinical concerns, the (c)CTG \ncan be stopped. \nThis can be as little as 10 \nminutes recording time. The \nprinter will produce a report \nof the analysis results. \nDo not review the numeric \ndata as the cCTG has been \nclassified as normal and this \ndata is therefore insignificant. \n \nCriteria Not Met BEFORE 60 minutes \nUnless there are clear abnormal \nfeatures, or any cause FOR concern, \ncontinue the recording until the criteria \nis Met. \nVISUALLY ABNORMAL ASSESSMENT? \nURGENT REVIEW REQUIRED \nSTV cannot be interpreted before 60 \nminutes. \nDO NOT prematurely stop the \nrecording. If the analysis has been \nstopped before the criteria are met \nbefore 60 minutes, STV IS NOT VALID. \n \nCTG NOT indicated. \nAuscultate with pinard or \nsonicaid. \nConfirm rationale for CTG \nIs there a maternal or fetal condition or \ndisease that could negatively impact fetal \ndevelopment? \n \nIs this pregnancy ≥ 26/40 weeks? \n \nCTG NOT indicated. \nAuscultate with pinard or \nsonicaid. \n \nCriteria Not Met AFTER 60 minutes \nAn abnormal outcome. Urgent review is required, \nparticularly if the CTG visual assessment is \nabnormal. \nThe case must be reviewed by an ≥ST3 and action \ntaken based on the reasons for failure, visual trace \nreview and a holistic assessment of the pregnancy. \nThe STV should be considered and the trend \nreviewed if previous analysis has been performed. It \nhas the predictive value for fetus at risk of metabolic \nacademia and IUD. \nSTV cannot be assessed visually and can only be \nanalysed with a full 60 minutes. STV must not be \nused in isolation as an indicator or fetal condition \nSTV values \n≥4ms is normal \n3-4ms is low \n<3ms is abnormal \n<2ms is highly abnormal \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n28 \n\nAppendix 3: Indications for CTG Use \nAdvise continuous CTG if any of the following risk factors are present at initial assessment or arise \nduring labour: \nGeneral: \n• 1:1 care is not possible: The inability to offer 1:1 care in labour is, in itself, a risk. A CTG \nshould be commenced until such time that 1:1 care can be offered. Document as frequently \nas is possible \n• Auscultation issues: If unable to auscultate intermittently, change to CTG monitoring and \ndocument accordingly \n• Sepsis: Suspected chorioamnionitis or maternal sepsis \n• Epidural: CTG for 30mins: Post siting of epidural, post anaesthetic review and bolus, or \nfollowing haemodynamic instability. CTG is not necessary before epidural siting \n• Oxytocin Use \n• Concerns: Any other concerns about antenatal or intrapartum factors not listed here that \nmay lead to fetal compromise \nMaternal: \n• Pulse over 120bpm: Woman or birthing person’s pulse over 120 beats per minute on 2 \noccasions 30 minutes apart \n• Temperature ≥37.5°c: Woman or birthing person’s temperature of ≥38°c on a single reading, \nor ≥37.5°c on 2 consecutive occasions, 1 hour apart \n• Pain: Reported by the woman or birthing person that differs from the pain normally \nassociated with contractions \n• Bleeding: Fresh vaginal bleeding that develops in labour or vaginal blood loss other than \nshow during antenatal period \n• VBAC: Previous caesarean birth or other full thickness uterine scar \n• Hypertension: Any hypertensive disorder needing medication \n• PROM: Women who are already in established labour at 24 hours after their membranes \nruptured do not need CTG unless there are other concerns \n• Diabetes: Pre-existing diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and gestational diabetes requiring \nmedication \n• Gestational age: > 42/40 weeks at the onset of established labour \nFetal: \n• Abnormalities on IA: Abnormalities of the fetal heart rate as detected on intermittent \nauscultation \n• Induction of labour for reduced fetal movements: Regardless of current fetal movements \n• Reduced fetal movements in the 2 hours prior to the onset of contractions \n• Induction of labour for IUGR / SGA \n• Meconium: Any evidence of meconium, regardless of consistency. Ensure that healthcare \nprofessionals trained in advanced neonatal life support are readily available for the birth \n\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \n29 \n\n• Presentation: Non cephalic presentation \n• IUGR / SGA: Estimated fetal weight <10\nth\n centile \n• Liquor Volume: Anhydramnios or polyhydramnios",

  "response": "Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the specific STV (Short-Term Variation) value from the CTG trace, as it is critical for assessing fetal wellbeing.  \n   Reason: The guideline states STV <3ms is abnormal and strongly linked to metabolic acidaemia (MP037, Section \"Short Term Variation (STV)\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Immediate obstetric review should be sought given the CTG did not meet DR criteria due to \"No episodes of high variation\" and \"long-term variation during episodes of high variation below acceptable level.\"  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends urgent review by an Obstetric Registrar ≥ST3 if criteria are not met and STV is low (MP037, Section \"What to do when criteria is not met at 60 minutes\").  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Clearly document the risks of macrosomia (e.g., shoulder dystocia) and the benefits of earlier delivery in the discussion with the patient.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes holistic counseling for high-risk conditions like macrosomia (MP037, Introduction: \"Key Principles\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include maternal observations (BP, pulse, temperature) in the note to rule out sepsis or other contributors to abnormal CTG.  \n   Reason: Sepsis can cause fetal tachycardia or reduced variability (MP037, Appendix 3: \"Indications for CTG Use\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider continuous CTG monitoring instead of intermittent repeats due to the additional risk factor of macrosomia.  \n   Reason: Macrosomia is an indication for continuous monitoring per guideline (MP037, Appendix 3: \"Fetal\" section).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Document a clear plan for timing of repeat CTG (e.g., \"within 4 hours as per protocol\") and contingency plans if the patient declines.  \n   Reason: The guideline specifies timeframes for repeat CTG based on STV values (MP037, Section \"What to do when criteria is not met at 60 minutes\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Note whether the fetal movement button was used during the CTG, as automatic movement detection is invalid for DR analysis.  \n   Reason: DR analysis requires manual fetal movement recording (MP037, Section \"Equipment\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on reduced fetal movements and macrosomia to reinforce verbal discussions.  \n   Reason: Enhances informed decision-making (MP037, Introduction: \"Key Principles\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the specific Huntleigh monitor settings used (e.g., DR criteria selected).  \n   Reason: Ensures technical compliance but does not impact clinical management (MP037, Section \"Equipment\").  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:\n- Lack of STV documentation and urgent escalation for non-reassuring CTG.  \n- Incomplete counseling on macrosomia risks.  \n- Absence of maternal observations to exclude confounding factors.  \n\nThese changes would align the note with guideline standards and improve patient safety.",

is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. \\nThis guidance is for midwives and doctors working in and with University Hospitals Sussex (Legacy \\nEast) Maternity Services. The guidance is not rigid and should be tailored to the individual \\ncircumstances of each woman or pregnant person. If the guidance is not being followed, \\ndocumentation of the reasoning and/or justification is essential, with clear documentation of \\nalternative plans and discussions. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a \\nprotocol. \\n \\nScope \\nThis protocol applies to: All childbearing women and people. \\n \\nResponsibilities \\nMidwives & Obstetricians: \\n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \\n• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol. \\n \\nManagement Team: \\n• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \\nrecommendations \\n• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \\n• To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n7 \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring in the Antenatal Period \\n \\nAim of Antenatal Fetal Monitoring \\nTo identify a fetus at risk of intrauterine hypoxia and acidaemia. Timely and appropriate intervention \\nmay avoid fetal neurological damage or death. \\n \\nIntermittent Auscultation \\nAntenatal period auscultation of the fetal heart (FH) may confirm that the fetus is alive but is \\nunlikely to have any predictive value and routine listening is, therefore, not recommended. \\nHowever, when requested by the woman or pregnant person, auscultation of the fetal heart may \\nprovide reassurance. \\nThe fetal heart rate (FHR) should be auscultated by pinard or sonicaid pre/post intervention e.g. \\nprior to administration of intramuscular analgesia and vaginal examination. \\n \\nElectronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) \\nFor a woman or birthing person without identified risk factors, continuous electronic fetal \\nmonitoring is not indicated and should not be employed. \\nCardiotography (CTG) is the most adopted tool for antenatal fetal assessment. It should not be used \\nin isolation. This protocol aims to assist midwives and obstetricians in the interpretation of antenatal \\nCTG. This includes understanding the situations where computerised CTG (cCTG) is indicated and \\nhow to interpret the Dawes Redman (DR) Criteria. Saving Babies Lives (SBLB)v2 recommends DR \\nanalysis in the antenatal period. It is also a Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) \\nrequirement. \\n \\nComputerised CTG (cCTG) – DR Analysis \\ncCTG provides objective CTG interpretation and is evidence based. It allows the communication of \\nrobust numeric facts as opposed to opinion. DR analysis references a database of 150,000 traces and \\nrelates it to outcomes. It therefore acts as an ‘expert assistant’ for CTG interpretation and accurate \\ninterpretation criteria. The use of cCTG compared to traditional CTG showed a significant reduction \\nin perinatal mortality (Cochrane review, 2015). The final clinical judgement should be based on the \\nentire clinical assessment with cCTG forming a part of this holistic approach to pregnancy \\nmanagement. \\nSee Appendix 1 for the dataset from which the DR criteria are derived. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n8 \\n\\nGestational Age for cCTG \\nSevere pre-term pregnancies: The Local Maternity and Neonatal System (LMNS) has agreed 26/40 \\nas the gestation before which continuous electronic monitoring might not be carried out. Decisions \\naround fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and people, and the \\nmulti-disciplinary (MDT) team which should include Neonatal staff. \\nThe DR criteria are based upon the normal distribution at 32 weeks. Gestations below 32 weeks may \\ntake longer to meet criteria due to an immature central nervous system. \\nIndications for Dawes Redman (DR) Criteria \\nComputerised CTG (cCTG) should be performed in the antenatal period for fetal monitoring as per \\nthese clinical indications: \\n• Gestational age ≥ 26 weeks \\n• Reduced fetal movements \\n• Polyhydramnios \\n• Oligohydramnios \\n• Antepartum haemorrhage \\n• Abdominal pain or trauma \\n• Multiple pregnancy \\n• Diabetes \\n• Previous CS or uterine surgery \\n• Obstetric Cholestasis \\n• Maternal hypertension \\n• Pre-eclampsia \\n• Fetal growth restriction \\n• PROM/PPROM \\n• Pre-prostaglandin to induce labour. NOT for use after administering PGE \\n• Pre, and post, ARM to induce labour \\n• Pre, and post, stretch and membrane sweep \\n• Threatened pre-term labour where FFN is negative and no palpable or painful contractions \\n• Other reasons for antenatal CTG in the absence of palpable or painful contractions \\nDawes Redman Criteria is NOT appropriate for intrapartum fetal monitoring. It must be \\ndiscontinued once the woman is in active labour or has palpable or painful contractions. \\nSee Appendix 2 for a quick reference flow chart for DR CTG. \\nEquipment \\nA Huntleigh Sonicaid Team3 monitor must be used for all antenatal cCTGs. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n9 \\n\\nSetting Up The cCTG Monitor \\n1. Turn on the machine by touching the on/off switch on the front, upper right corner \\nof the machine for 3 seconds \\n2. Ensure the date and time are correct on the machine \\n3. Position the toco and ultrasound transducers. Dawes Redman Criteria cannot be met \\nwith >10% loss of contact – therefore reposition transducers if contact is poor \\n4. Manually palpate the maternal radial pulse to differentiate between fetal heart and \\nmaternal heart rates \\n5. Auscultate FHR by sonic aid or pinard before commencing the CTG to confirm fetal \\nheart rate sounds \\n6. Connect the fetal movement button and show the woman or birthing person how to \\nuse it. AUTOMATIC FETAL MOVEMENT INTERPRETATION IS NOT VALID FOR DAWES \\nREDMAN ANALYSIS. Fetal movements will only be registered if the fetal movement \\nbutton is pressed. It is imperative that women and birthing people are informed as \\nto the importance of using this button. Dawes Redman will not analyse fetal \\nmovements as a discrete element \\n7. Input patient name, hospital number and gestational age. Use the scan EDD. DO \\nNOT use LMP \\n8. Ensure maternal pulse is recording \\n9. Select DR criteria through the settings button \\n10. Press print \\n11. Sign and print the paper cCTG \\n12. At the end of the trace press ‘print’ to print the DR analysis \\n \\nNOTE the analysis will not start unless the gestation is entered. \\n\\nDuration of Dawes Redman Monitoring \\n1. 10 minutes \\nThe computer analyses the CTG data and compares it with the DR criteria, initially at 10 minutes, and \\nevery 2 minutes thereafter. \\n2. 60 minutes \\nThe maximum record length for DR analysis is 60 minutes. At this point criteria are either ‘Met’ or \\n‘Not Met’. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n10 \\n\\n1. Basal heart rate outside normal range \\n2. Large decelerations \\n3. No episodes of high variation \\n4. No movements and fewer than three accelerations \\n5. Baseline fitting is uncertain \\n6. Short-term variation is less than 3ms \\n7. Possible error at the end of the record \\n8. Deceleration at the end of the record \\n9. High-frequency sinusoidal rhythm \\n10. Suspected sinusoidal rhythm \\n11. Long-term variation in high episodes below acceptable level \\n12. No accelerations \\nInterpreting Dawes Redman Analysis \\nResults – Criteria Met \\nIf the computerised CTG (cCTG) meets DR criteria, the trace is normal. The criteria can be achieved \\nas early as 10 minutes. The CTG can be stopped if there are no additional clinical concerns. If there \\nare other clinical concerns, the DR analysis can be turned off, but the CTG should be continued. \\nResults – Criteria NOT Met \\nThe cCTG must continue for FULL 60 minutes before it can be said to have ‘Not Met’ criteria. \\nHowever, all CTGs must be visually inspected and escalated if there are a concern before 60 minutes \\nhas elapsed. \\nIf the criteria are still not met at 60 minutes, the Huntleigh machine will end the analysis and print \\nthe results, but the trace will continue. The reasons why criteria might not meet are highlighted \\nbelow: \\nReasons why criteria may not have met: \\n\\nWhat to do when criteria is not met at 60 minutes \\n• Manage the CTG trace with conservative measures as per usual \\n• Use your clinical judgement and classify the trace according to NICE Antenatal Guidelines \\nand document on BadgerNet \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n11 \\n\\nSTV Values \\n≥ 4ms: NORMAL \\n< 4ms: LOW \\n< 3ms: ABNORMAL \\n< 2ms: HIGHLY ABNORMAL \\nDawes Redman STV: Guidance only – Management should \\nbe planned on an individual basis and clinical information. \\n \\nIf criteria Not Met, but the trace visually appears normal: \\n \\n1.4.0 milliseconds or more: \\na.>37 weeks – repeat CTG within 4 hours \\nb.<37 weeks – repeat CTG within 24 hours. If RFM repeat within \\n4 hours \\n2. 3.0 – 3.99ms: \\nRepeat CTG within 4 hours \\n3. <3.0ms: \\nPreterminal trace – notify medical staff IMMEDIATELY \\n• Escalate to Obstetric Registrar ≥ST3 \\n• Use your clinical judgement as to whether the trace should continue, or can be stopped, \\nwhile awaiting clinical review \\n• Check short term variation \\n• Escalate to the LWC if timely Obstetric SpR review is unavailable \\n \\nShort Term Variation (STV) \\nShort-term variation is a computerised measure of the micro fluctuations of the fetal heart, invisible \\nto the human eye. STV is invalid before 60 minutes has elapsed. The STV should be considered, but \\nMUST NOT be used in isolation as an indicator of fetal condition. \\nA value of less than 3ms is strongly linked to the development of metabolic acidaemia and \\nimpending intrauterine death, particularly in the absence of an episode of high variation. STV of less \\nthan 3ms should be discussed and reviewed immediately by the Consultant. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n12 \\n\\nDO NOT RELY ON THE DR ANALYSIS IN ISOLATION: It may not identify abnormal \\npatterns that may be more obvious on visual interpretation. Ensure holistic assessment of \\nthe clinical scenario. \\n \\nFetal Heart Monitoring During Intrapartum Period \\n \\nAim of Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring \\nTo identify hypoxia before it is sufficient to lead to long-term poor neurological outcome for babies. \\n \\nInitial Assessment for Monitoring \\nPerform an initial assessment of antenatal risk factors for fetal compromise at the onset of labour to \\ndetermine whether intermittent auscultation (IA) or cardiotocography (CTG) is offered as the initial \\nmethod of fetal heart rate monitoring. \\nConfirm with the woman or birthing person which method of fetal monitoring has already been \\nadvised as part of their personalised care plan. Explain to the woman or birthing person that risk \\nassessment is a continual process, and that the advised method of fetal heart rate monitoring may \\nchange throughout the course of labour. \\nLow Risk Pregnancies \\nOffer intermittent auscultation (IA) of the fetal heart rate in low-risk pregnancies in all birth settings. \\nIncreased Risk Pregnancies \\nOffer continuous fetal monitoring (CTG) in pregnancies with increased risk. See Appendix 3: \\nIndications for CTG Use. \\n \\nIntermittent Auscultation in Labour \\nEnsure one-to-one support is maintained by having a midwife remain with the woman throughout \\nlabour. If the midwife needs to leave the room or there needs to be a change in staff, ensure the \\nwoman or birthing person knows this is happening. \\nEquipment \\nA pinard stethoscope or handheld doppler ultrasound (sonicaid) device should be used for IA in all \\npractice areas. A description of the equipment used should be documented in the maternal notes. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n13 \\n\\nActions: \\n• Carry out IA immediately after a palpated contraction for at least 1 minute, at least once \\nevery 15 minutes, and record the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) it as a single rate on the BadgerNet \\npartogram and in the woman's notes \\n• Record accelerations and decelerations, if heard \\n• Palpate, and record on the partogram, the maternal pulse hourly, or more often if there are \\nany concerns, to ensure differentiation between the maternal and fetal heartbeats \\n• If no fetal heartbeat is detected, offer urgent real-time ultrasound assessment to check fetal \\nviability \\nOnce the woman or birthing person has signs of, or is in confirmed second stage of labour: \\n• Perform IA immediately after a palpated contraction for at least 1 minute, at least once \\nevery 5 minutes and record the FHR as a single rate on the partogram \\n• Palpate the woman's pulse simultaneously, at least every 5 minutes, to differentiate \\nbetween the maternal and fetal heart rates and record this on the partogram \\n• If there are concerns about differentiating between the 2 heart rates, seek help and consider \\nchanging the method of fetal heart rate monitoring. \\nSuspected Rising Baseline Rate (BLR) rate or decelerations: \\nIf there is a rising baseline fetal heart rate (as plotted on the partogram) of ≥20 beats a minute from \\nthe start of labour or within the last hour, or decelerations are suspected on IA, actions should \\ninclude: \\n• Carry out IA more frequently eg. after the next 3 consecutive contractions \\n• Carry out a full review of the whole clinical picture taking into account: antenatal and \\nexisting or new intrapartum risk factors; maternal observations; frequency of contractions \\n(including hypertonus); and the progress of labour. \\nConfirmation of rising BLR or decelerations \\nIf a rising baseline rate or decelerations are confirmed, further actions should include: \\n• Summoning help \\n• Advising continuous CTG, and explaining to the woman or birthing person, and their birth \\ncompanion(s), why it is needed \\n• Transferring the woman or birthing person to obstetric-led care if it is safe and appropriate \\nto do so. \\nReturn to intermittent auscultation if continuous CTG monitoring has been started due to concerns \\narising from intermittent auscultation, and the CTG trace is normal after 20 minutes. If the woman \\nor birthing person decides to remain on continuous CTG monitoring, so be it. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n14 \\n\\nHourly review \\nPerform and document a systematic assessment of the condition of the woman and unborn baby \\nevery hour, more frequently if there are concerns. Update the labour ward coordinator (LWC) of \\nprogress and escalate concerns sooner if necessary. Discuss the results of each hourly assessment \\nwith the woman and base recommendations about care in labour on her preferences and: \\n• Their reports of the frequency, length and strength of contractions \\n• Any antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for fetal compromise \\n• The current wellbeing of the woman or birthing person and unborn baby \\n• How labour is progressing. \\nInclude birthing companion(s) in these discussions if appropriate and if that is what the woman or \\nbirthing person wants. \\nHomebirth \\nIt is recommended that Homebirth Midwives update the LWC every 4 hours on the red phone, at the \\nsite woman or birthing person is booked at, when: Confirmed in established labour or staying at a \\nhomebirth; on leaving if NIEL. This is to ensure the safety and support of the MW at the homebirth. \\nBetween the hours of 0800-1700, Monday to Friday, this update can be with Community Team \\nLeader, who can then inform the LWC. \\nDocumentation for IA \\nThe following should be documented contemporaneously on the BadgerNet partogram: \\n• The fetal heart rate as a single rate at least every 15 minutes in 1\\nst\\n stage of labour \\n• The fetal heart rate as a single rate at least every 5 minutes in 2\\nnd\\n stage of labour \\n• Woman’s or birthing person’s pulse: Every hour in the 1\\nst\\n stage, every 5 minutes in the 2\\nnd\\n \\nstage of labour \\n• Any abnormalities thought to be heard, and a plan in relation to this \\n• Any transfer from intermittent auscultation to continuous electronic fetal monitoring and \\nthe reasons therefore \\n• Hourly assessment on women and unborn baby \\n• 4 hourly maternal observations including: blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, \\ntemperature, and bladder care. \\n \\nContinuous Cardiotocography (CTG) in Labour \\nHypoxic events in labour contribute to 10-20% of the total population of brain damaged infants and \\nsuch damage is potentially preventable by adequate fetal monitoring and appropriate management \\nof the hypoxic fetus. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n15 \\n\\nIt is recommended that women or birthing people with any high risk features have their baby \\nmonitored continuously throughout their labour once it is established. \\n \\nGestational Age for CTG \\nSevere pre-term pregnancies: The Local Maternity and Neonatal System (LMNS) has agreed 26/40 \\nas the gestation before which continuous electronic monitoring might not be carried out. Decisions \\naround fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and people, and the \\nmulti-disciplinary (MDT) team which should include Neonatal staff. \\nEquipment \\nA cardiotocograph (CTG) machine should be used for continuous fetal heart monitoring. This can \\nonly be performed in the hospital environment. \\nDo not use Dawes Redman analysis: It is not valid in the intrapartum period. \\n \\nTelemetry \\nEnsure wireless transducers are kept charged and maintained so that they are ready to use. \\nSwitch from wireless to wired transducers as soon as possible if there is signal loss which is not \\nresolved by reducing the distance between the base unit and the woman, in order to confirm \\nwhether or not there is a clinical problem. \\n \\nManagement of Continuous Fetal Monitoring \\nWhen being continuously monitored, a woman or pregnant person should be offered one-2-one \\ncare. This will enable prompt reaction to any deviation from normality. \\nCTG Reviews \\n• The CTG trace must be systematically assessed every 30 minutes by the midwife caring for \\nthe woman or pregnant person. Include: baseline rate, baseline variability, accelerations, \\nand decelerations \\n• Consider the woman or pregnant person’s holistic picture and care \\n• Document the review in the woman or pregnant person’s BadgerNet record. \\n \\nFresh Eyes \\nOn an hourly basis another Midwife (≥Band 6) or Obstetrician (≥ST3) should systematically review all \\ncontinuous CTGs alongside the midwife providing care. Where possible, the team-member providing \\nthe fresh eyes review should not be the same every time in order to have a true fresh eye \\nassessment. The assessment should be logged in the BadgerNet record as a ‘Peer Review’. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n16 \\n\\nThe review should include: \\n• A complete holistic review of the woman or birthing person \\n• Risk assessment, contractions, baseline rate, variability, accelerations and decelerations \\n• Any infusions in progress \\n• The plan going forward. \\n \\nInterpretation of the INTRAPARTUM CTG \\nIf there are changes in the fetal heart rate pattern over time which indicate a change in the baby's \\ncondition, review antenatal or intrapartum risk factors for hypoxia. \\nWhen reviewing a CTG trace, assess and document the following: \\n• Contractions \\n• Baseline fetal heart rate \\n• Variability \\n• Presence or absence of decelerations (and characteristics of decelerations if present) \\n• (Presence of accelerations). \\nCategorise the 4 features of the CTG trace (contractions, baseline fetal heart rate, variability, \\ndecelerations) as WHITE, AMBER or RED (indicating increasing levels of concern), and consider \\nalongside the presence, or not, of accelerations, to classify the overall CTG trace as NORMAL, \\nSUSPICIOUS or PATHOLOGICAL. \\nContractions \\n• Use a tocodynamometer to record contraction frequency and length on the CTG trace \\n• If decelerations are present, evaluate their timing in relation to contractions \\n• If 5 or more contractions per 10 minutes are present: \\n- perform a full risk assessment \\n- take action to reduce contraction frequency as described in the section on underlying \\ncauses and conservative measures \\n- explain to the woman what is happening, and ensure that she has adequate pain relief. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n17 \\n\\nWHITE AMBER RED \\nFewer than 5 contractions \\n5 or more contractions in 10 \\nminutes, leading to reduced \\nresting time between \\ncontractions \\n\\nOR \\n\\nHyertonus (contraction lasting \\n2 minutes or long) \\n\\nBaseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) \\nWhen assessing baseline FHR, differentiate between fetal and maternal heartbeats \\nDetermine baseline fetal heart rate by looking at the mean fetal heart rate, excluding accelerations \\nand decelerations, over a period of 10 minutes when the fetal heart rate is stable. When deciding if \\nthere is any change in baseline fetal heart rate, compare it with earlier CTG traces or recordings of \\nfetal heart rate. \\nConsider that lower baseline fetal heart rates are expected with post-term pregnancies, with higher \\nbaseline rates in preterm pregnancies. \\nA rise in baseline fetal heart rate may indicate either developing infection or hypoxia. \\n\\nWHITE AMBER RED \\nStable baseline of 110 to 160 \\nbeats a minute (bpm) \\nIncrease in baseline FHR of 20 \\nbpm or more from the start of \\nlabour or since the last review \\nan hour ago \\nOR \\nUnable to determine baseline \\nrate \\nOR \\n100-109bpm \\nBelow 100bpm \\nOR \\nAbove 160bpm \\n\\nIncrease in FHR baseline of \\n200bpm or more in active 2nd \\nstage \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n18 \\n\\nVariability \\nDetermine variability by looking at the minor oscillations in the fetal heart rate, which usually occur \\nat 3 to 5 cycles a minute. Measure it by estimating the difference in beats per minute between the \\nhighest heart rate and the lowest heart rate in a 1-minute segment of the trace between \\ncontractions, excluding decelerations and accelerations. \\nIf there is an absence of variability, carry out a review of the whole clinical picture with a low \\nthreshold for expedited birth, as this is a very concerning feature. \\nTake the following into account when assessing fetal heart rate variability: \\n• variability will usually be between 5 and 25 beats a minute (bpm) \\n• intermittent periods of reduced variability are normal, especially during periods of \\nquiescence ('sleep') \\n• certain medicines, such as opioids, may lead to a reduction in variability, but all other \\nintrapartum risk factors should be carefully reviewed as a potential cause (for example, look \\nfor other features on the CTG such as a rise in the baseline fetal heart suggestive of another \\nreason such as sepsis) \\n• increased variability refers to oscillations around the baseline fetal heart rate of more than \\n25 bpm, and shorter episodes lasting a few minutes may represent worsening fetal \\ncondition. \\nObtain an urgent review by an obstetrician or senior midwife and consider expediting birth if: \\n• there is an isolated reduction in variability to fewer than 5 bpm for more than 30 minutes \\nwhen combined with antenatal or intrapartum risk factors, as this is associated with an \\nincreased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, \\nOR \\n• there is a reduction in variability to fewer than 5 bpm combined with other CTG changes, \\nparticularly a rise in the baseline fetal heart rate, as this is a strong indicator for fetal \\ncompromise. \\n\\nWHITE AMBER RED \\n5-25 bpm \\nFewer than 5bpm for between \\n30 and 50 minutes \\n\\nOR \\n\\nMore than 25 beats a minute \\nfor up to 10 minutes \\nFewer than 5bpm for more \\nthan 50 minutes \\nOR \\nMore than 25bpm for more \\nthan 10 minutes \\nOR \\nSinusoidal \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n19 \\n\\nDecelerations \\nDefine decelerations as transient episodes when the fetal heart rate slows to below the baseline rate \\nby more than 15 beats a minute, with each episode lasting 15 seconds or more. An exception to this \\nis that in a trace with reduced variability, decelerations may be 'shallow'. \\nConcerning characteristics of variable decelerations: \\n• Lasting more than 60 seconds \\n• Reduced variability within the deceleration \\n• Failure or slow return to baseline fetal heart rate \\n• Loss of previously present shouldering. \\n\\nWHITE AMBER RED \\nNo decelerations \\nOR \\nEarly decelerations \\nOR \\nVariable decelerations that are \\nnot evolving to have \\nconcerning characteristics \\nRepetitive variable \\ndecelerations with any \\nconcerning characteristics for \\nless than 30 minutes \\nOR \\nVariable decelerations with \\nany concerning characteristics \\nfor more than 30 minutes* \\nOR \\nrepetitive late decelerations \\nfor less than 30 minutes \\nRepetitive variable \\ndecelerations with any \\nconcerning characteristics for \\nmore than 30 minutes* \\nOR \\nRepetive late decelerations for \\nmore than 30 minutes* \\nOR \\nAcute bradycardia or a single \\nprolonged deceleration lasting \\n3 minutes or more \\n\\n*If there are decelerations lasting longer than 30 minutes in the presence of either rise in baseline \\nheart rate or reduced variability, start conservative measure and carry out urgent obstetric review. \\nTake into account the following to determine the need to expedite birth: \\n• Sepsis \\n• Presence of meconium \\n• Slow progress of labour \\n• Use of oxytocin \\nIf variable decelerations with no concerning characteristics and no other CTG changes, including no \\nrise in the baseline fetal heart rate, are observed: \\n• Be aware that these are very common, can be a normal feature in an otherwise \\nuncomplicated labour and birth, and are usually a result of cord compression \\n• Support the woman to change position or mobilise \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n20 \\n\\nTake into account that early decelerations are uncommon and usually associated with head \\ncompression and that they are not accompanied by any other CTG changes such as reduced \\nvariability or a rise in FHR. \\nAccelerations \\nDefine accelerations as transient increases in fetal heart rate of 15 beats a minute or more, lasting \\n15 seconds or more. \\nTake the following into account when assessing accelerations in fetal heart rate: \\n• The presence of fetal heart rate accelerations, even with reduced variability, is generally a \\nsign that the baby is healthy \\n• The absence of accelerations on an otherwise normal CTG trace does not indicate fetal \\nacidosis. \\n \\nClassifying the Intrapartum CTG \\n\\nNORMAL SUSPICIOUS PATHOLOGICAL \\nNo amber or red features.

Do not offer intravenous fluids to treat fetal heart rate abnormalities unless \\nthe woman is hypotensive or has signs of sepsis.

If this leads to an acceleration in fetal heart rate and a sustained improvement in the \\nCTG trace, continue to monitor fetal heart rate and clinical picture for the next 30 minutes. \\nBe aware that the absence of an acceleration in response to fetal scalp stimulation is a worrying sign \\nthat fetal compromise may be present, and that expedited birth may be necessary. \\nFetal Blood Sampling \\nThere is limited evidence that fetal blood sampling (FBS) improves the outcomes for women and \\npregnant people and babies compared to CTG alone. Therefore, the recommendation is to avoid \\nusing FBS as an aid to check for fetal hypoxia. \\nIf a FBS is carried out this must have be discussed and agreed with the Consultant on-call and the \\nreason for its use clearly documented on BadgerNet. \\nFBS results should be clearly documented on BadgerNet alongside the on-going management plan. \\n \\nDocumentation for CTGs \\nLinking Traces \\n• A Huntleigh monitor trace must be scanned and uploaded to BadgerNet until such time that \\nSonicCentrale is implemented \\n• A Philips trace must be connected through BadgerNet. If this is not possible, the trace must \\nbe scanned and uploaded to BadgerNet. \\nBadgerNet \\n• The rationale for the CTG should be documented on BadgerNet \\n• Any member of staff who is asked to provide an opinion on a trace should document their \\nfindings in the BadgerNet record. In the case of Fresh Eyes, they should document their \\nassessment in the BadgerNet record as a ‘Peer Review’ \\n• With every review an action plan should be agreed and documented \\n• On completion of the tracing, ensure the CTG is disconnected from BadgerNet or \\nSonicCentrale. \\nAntenatal cCTG \\n• The cCTG should be reviewed on BadgerNet using the CTG review form: Ensure the \\n‘computerised CTG’ button is checked \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n23 \\n\\n• The practitioner who ends the cCTG must sign the trace and document to confirm that the \\nCTG is normal. If at any point the practitioner disagrees with the outcome on the printout, \\nthis must be escalated to a Senior Obstetric Registrar or Obstetric Consultant. \\nIntrapartum: 1\\nst\\n stage of labour \\n- Fetal heart rate to be recorded on the partogram at least every 15 minutes \\n- Maternal pulse to recorded on the partogram every hour: More frequently if required \\n- Clear documentation on the woman’s wellbeing \\n- Document full assessment and fresh eyes every hour on BadgerNet. \\n \\nIntrapartum: 2\\nnd\\n stage of labour \\n- Fetal heart rate to be recorded on the partogram at least every 5 minutes \\n- Maternal pulse to recorded on the partogram every 15 minutes alongside fetal heart \\nrate: More frequently if required \\n- Clear documentation on the woman’s wellbeing \\n- Document full assessment and fresh eyes every hour on BadgerNet. \\n \\nAll Traces \\n• Ensure the date and time on the CTG machine is set correctly \\n• At the start of a trace, enter the woman or pregnant person’s details via the interactive \\nscreen, use a sticker, or handwrite the person’s details.

Any paper documentation must be \\nstored securely in a folder or envelope provided and created by the ward clerk. These folders should \\nbe stored on labour ward. \\nIn cases where there is a concern that the baby may have sustained a possible brain injury, scan the \\n(c)CTG trace and upload to BadgerNet. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n25 \\n\\nAppendix 1: The Dawes Redman Criteria Dataset \\n\\nSignal loss (%) \\n \\nThe percentage of the trace for which there was no fetal heart rate \\nrecorded. Signal loss is usually due to poor transducer positioning or fetal \\nmovement. Reposition the transducer to get the best possible signal, \\nensuring plenty of gel is used. If the signal loss is >50% during accelerations \\nor large decelerations, these will not be included in the analysis results. \\n \\nContractions \\n \\nThe software registers a contraction if there is a rise of 16% or more, lasting \\nfor 30 seconds or more, from the resting ‘zero’ line. \\n \\nMovements \\n \\nSimply counts fetal movements recorded by the mother. Note that this will \\nalways be shown as zero for twins monitoring, as it is not possible to tell \\nwhich fetus is moving. \\n \\nBasal Heart Rate \\n(bpm) \\n \\nThis is the average rate measured normally during periods of low variation. \\nOn very reactive traces it is assessed by a ‘best fit’ method. It is similar to \\nvisually assessed baseline rate (BLR) but may differ with some trace \\npatterns (eg. very reactive, large decelerations, etc.). Users should always \\nvisually assess BLR independently from the analysis. \\n \\nAccelerations \\n \\nA rise from the BLR of 10bpm or more, lasting 15 seconds or more. \\nResearch has shown that a small percentage (5-8%) of traces without \\naccelerations are in fact normal. It is not therefore essential to have \\naccelerations present for the trace to be interpreted as normal. This is \\nparticularly true \\n \\nDecelerations \\n \\nA fall from the BLR of at least 10bpm, lasting 60s or more, with >5 ‘lost \\nbeats’, or a decrease of 20bpm lasting 30 seconds or more, with >5 ‘lost \\nbeats’. See below for definition of ‘lost beats’. \\n \\nHigh Episodes \\n \\nThis is a measure of how reactive the trace is. Rather than relying on \\naccelerations (see above), this measures the amount of time the change \\nfrom one beat to the next exceeds a certain level. It can be interpreted as \\nthe period of time, during the trace, over which the FHR was highly \\nreactive. \\n \\nLost Beats \\n \\n‘Lost beats’ are a measure of the area or ‘size’ of the deceleration. To \\nunderstand this, consider a trace with a baseline rate of 120bpm with a 1 \\nminute deceleration. If the heart rate had stayed at the baseline rate for \\nthis period, instead of decelerating, there would have been 120 heart beats \\nin the one minute. Because of the deceleration, the FHR slowed down and \\nthere were actually only, say, 80 beats during the one minute. This means it \\n‘lost’ (120-80 =) 40 beats – this is how DR measures decelerations, in ‘Lost \\nbeats’. Lost beats is simply the ‘size’ of the largest deceleration. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n26 \\n\\nShort Term \\nVariation \\n(STV) (ms) \\n \\nThis is a form of ‘variability’ or ‘baseline variation’. Traditionally, variability \\nis assessed visually as the difference between the highest & lowest rates in \\na 1 minute period during a quiescent period (ie. no accelerations or \\ndecelerations). Short Term Variation (STV) is essentially the same, but \\nmeasured over a much shorter time period than can be done visually \\n(3.75s). It is measured in milliseconds rather than bpm. This is the time \\nbetween beats, rather than the number of beats per minute – just a \\ndifferent way of measuring heart beats. In non-reactive traces, STV has \\nbeen shown to correlate highly with the development of metabolic \\nhypoxaemia and intrauterine death. If there is a consistent downward \\ntrend in STV towards or below 3ms over period of days or weeks, delivery \\nmay need to be expedited. \\n\\nFetal Heart Monitoring MP037 \\n\\n27 \\n \\nCommence cCTG recording unless uterine activity is present \\nFirst result is available at 10 minutes, and every 2 minutes thereafter to a maximum of 60 minutes. \\nAppendix 2: Quick Reference Flow Chart for DR CTG \\n\\nNO \\nYes \\n\\nNO \\n\\nYes \\n\\nCriteria for NOT using D/R \\n- labour \\n- <26 weeks \\n- Latent phase \\n- Post PGE insertion (or within 24 hours) \\n \\nIf you are not using DR, please use Phillips machines \\nto allow connectivity to BadgerNet. \\nIf you have commenced DR CTG for pre IOL CTG, \\ncontinue to use same machine for ease and file \\nappropriately. \\n \\nCriteria for using D/R \\n- GA ≥ 26 weeks \\n- no palpable or painful contractions \\n- before/after sweep \\n- IOL- pre first PGE insertion \\n \\nCriteria Met \\nVisually review and classify \\nthe CTG.
