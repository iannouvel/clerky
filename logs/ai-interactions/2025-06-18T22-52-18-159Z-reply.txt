Pregnant individuals are at higher risk. Prevention involves monitoring fluid intake/output, avoiding excess water, and bladder care. **Severe Hyponatraemia (Na <125mmol/L + symptoms):** - Medical emergency requiring urgent obstetric/anaesthetic review and ITU/critical care involvement. - Aim: symptom improvement, not rapid sodium correction. - **Management:** - Strict fluid restriction (30ml/hr). - Hourly sodium monitoring. - 1.8% Sodium Chloride (150ml bolus) **only** under ITU supervision; repeat if no improvement. - Limit sodium increase to â‰¤10mmol/L in 24 hours. - Continue fluid balance monitoring until asymptomatic. - Consider Level 2 care in ITU if possible",
