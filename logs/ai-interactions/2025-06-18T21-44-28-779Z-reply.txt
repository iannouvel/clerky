It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing midwives, healthcare assistants, and pediatricians. Key actions include anticipating hypothermia in at-risk infants, maintaining a warm environment, and promoting skin-to-skin contact. After birth, dry the baby, initiate skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding. If hypothermia occurs, use skin-to-skin contact, monitoring, and a hot cot (pre-warmed, with gradual temperature reduction). Skin-to-skin contact stabilizes heart rate, temperature, and supports feeding. Ongoing care includes discontinuing monitoring once temperature stabilizes and ensuring adequate feeding. Parents should be informed about monitoring and management. Audit processes are detailed in the Maternity Audit Document",
