**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe (pseudonym)  
- **Age:** 19 years  
- **Weight:** 68 kg  
- **Height:** 1.65 m  
- **BMI:** 25 kg/m²  
- **Gravidity:** 4  
- **Parity:** 3 (all previous pregnancies resulted in live births)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with **heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)** and **recurrent pelvic pain**, which has worsened over the past three months. She also reports **dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)** and concerns about **possible early pregnancy complications** due to irregular cycles.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Heavy bleeding lasting 8–10 days per cycle, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking >6 pads/day).  
- Pelvic pain is dull and constant, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  
- No history of intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was 5 weeks ago, but cycles have been irregular (25–40 days).  
- Denies fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- No chronic medical conditions.  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Three previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries** (ages 16, 17, and 18).  
- No history of caesarean sections or gynaecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12.  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  
- No cervical screening (Pap smear) yet (due to age).  
- Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently.  

**Drug History:**  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular medications).  
- No hormonal contraception in the past year.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Works part-time in retail.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- No recreational drug use.  
- Lives with partner and three children.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about possible fibroids or endometriosis due to pain and heavy bleeding.  
- **Concerns:** Fear of infertility or complications in future pregnancies.  
- **Expectations:** Wants investigation and treatment to improve symptoms.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or distress.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Speculum Exam:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions or discharge.  
- **Bimanual Exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild cervical motion tenderness noted.  

**Differential Diagnoses:**  
1. **Adenomyosis** (given multiparity, heavy bleeding, and dysmenorrhea).  
2. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** (due to cervical motion tenderness, though no fever or discharge).  
3. **Endometriosis** (given dyspareunia and cyclical pain).  

**Investigations Advised:**  
- **Pelvic ultrasound** (to assess uterine structure, rule out fibroids/adenomyosis).  
- **STI screen** (chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR, given cervical tenderness).  
- **Full blood count (FBC)** (to check for anaemia due to menorrhagia).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Pain relief:** Regular NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) during menstruation.  
2. **Hormonal options:** Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (after STI screen) to regulate cycles.  
3. **Lifestyle advice:** Smoking cessation counselling (due to increased cardiovascular risk with hormonal contraception).  
4. **Follow-up:** Review in 4 weeks with investigation results. If PID suspected, treat empirically with antibiotics.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that symptoms are manageable but require further assessment.  
- Advised to return urgently if fever, severe pain, or worsening bleeding occurs.  

**Plan for Future Pregnancy:**  
- Discussed long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) options if desired.  
- Advised preconception counselling if planning another pregnancy.
