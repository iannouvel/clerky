Liver scan showed sludge, FHx of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Risks include stillbirth, preterm birth, mec at delivery, and neonatal care.

Normal uterine artery dopplers on anomaly scan. Previous macrosomic vaginal birth. Patient rebooked due to poor experience at previous facility.\n\nPlan:\n- Prescribe piriton\n- Weekly LFTs and bile acids\n- Consider weekly bloods and CTGs for reassurance, although not predictive of stillbirth in ICP\n- Follow-up with Miss Archer in ANC for further management decisions\n- Await glucose tolerance test and third-trimester ultrasound."
