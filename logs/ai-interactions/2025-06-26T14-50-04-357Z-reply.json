She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6Â°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### CG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a transvaginal scan (TVS) was performed to confirm placenta previa diagnosis (beyond the initial 20-week anomaly scan).\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 states TVS should be used to confirm diagnosis when placenta previa is suspected, as 25-60% of cases are reclassified by TVS.\n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider earlier delivery timing (36+0 to 37+0 weeks) given this is the second bleeding episode.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.6 recommends delivery at 36-37 weeks for uncomplicated placenta previa, and earlier for recurrent bleeds (RCOG 2018).\n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Document assessment for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) given previous two cesarean sections and complete previa.\n   Reason: Guideline 7.1 states PAS should be suspected with anterior previa and prior uterine surgery, requiring TVS by experienced consultant.\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide counseling about risks of preterm birth and hemorrhage, including specific warning signs requiring immediate attention.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.4 emphasizes counseling about risks and when to seek care for women with placenta previa.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether cervical length was measured, as this predicts preterm delivery risk.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 notes cervical length <34 weeks predicts preterm delivery and massive hemorrhage risk.\n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider cell salvage setup given high-risk nature.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.6 recommends cell salvage for all placenta previa cases.\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether RCOG patient information leaflet was provided.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 recommends providing the RCOG placenta previa information leaflet at diagnosis.\n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Document discussion about avoiding intercourse given bleeding episodes.\n   Reason: Guideline 6.4 suggests advising against intercourse for women with previa who have bled.\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting more frequent hemoglobin monitoring (e.g., every 48 hours) given active bleeding.\n   Reason: While serial hemoglobin monitoring is planned, more frequent checks may better track acute blood loss.\n\nThe clinical note generally follows guideline recommendations well but could be strengthened by more complete documentation of diagnostic evaluations (especially TVS and PAS assessment), earlier delivery planning given recurrent bleeds, and more detailed patient counseling documentation. The highest priority improvements relate to confirming the diagnosis with TVS and evaluating for PAS given the patient's risk factors.\n\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether domestic violence screening was performed given recurrent APH.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes that women with repeated presentations of APH should be asked about domestic violence (GTG 2011 - APH, Clinical Assessment section).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider administering anti-D immunoglobulin (if not already done, though note states Rh-positive mother).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends anti-D Ig for RhD-negative women after any APH presentation (GTG 2011 - APH, Management Principles section). While this patient is Rh-positive, explicitly stating this avoids ambiguity.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer counseling on the risks of recurrent bleeding, preterm delivery, and potential need for emergency delivery.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights the association of APH with adverse perinatal outcomes (GTG 2011 - APH, Introduction). Patient understanding of risks is crucial for informed decision-making.  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document a detailed plan for thromboprophylaxis given bed rest and high-risk status (previous C-sections, placenta previa).  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions postnatal thromboprophylaxis but does not explicitly address antenatal prophylaxis. However, given immobilization, this is a significant consideration.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Include a documented anesthetic plan (e.g., preference for regional anesthesia if no contraindications).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends regional anesthesia for operative delivery in APH unless contraindicated (GTG 2011 - APH, Management Principles). While an anesthetic consult was arranged, specifics would improve clarity.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss long-term implications (e.g., future pregnancy risks, need for elective C-sections).  \n   Reason: The guideline focuses on acute management but does not explicitly address long-term counseling. This would enhance patient-centered care.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting a debriefing plan post-delivery.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions debriefing as a postnatal issue (GTG 2011 - APH, Postnatal section), but this is less critical for the acute note.  \n\n### Summary of Key Improvements:  \n- Explicitly address domestic violence screening.  \n- Clarify anti-D Ig administration (though not needed here).  \n- Enhance patient counseling on risks and long-term implications.  \n- Document thromboprophylaxis and anesthetic plans in more detail.  \n\nOverall, the note is well-aligned with the guideline but could be strengthened in these areas.\n\n### MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been referred to a Consultant Obstetrician Antenatal Clinic as per guideline 3.1.1 (all women with placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks should be referred).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.1 requires referral to a Consultant Obstetrician for placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing the need for MRI to evaluate placenta accreta given the patient's history of two previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa (if applicable).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.5 states that women with previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa should be evaluated for placenta accreta with MRI.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on the risks of preterm delivery and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the rationale for elective cesarean at 36-37 weeks.  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.3 recommends counseling women with placenta previa about risks and delivery planning.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a Group and Save sample has been taken every 7 days (if no prior transfusion) or more frequently (if prior transfusion or unusual antibodies).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.8 specifies regular Group and Save monitoring for inpatients with placenta previa.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the Consultant Obstetrician is present in theater for the planned cesarean section (if not already planned).  \n   Reason: Guideline 3.2.1 mandates Consultant Obstetrician presence for major placenta previa cesarean sections.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about blood transfusion risks/benefits and discuss cell salvage options (if applicable).  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.4.3 discusses patient counseling on blood product alternatives.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a MEOWS chart has been commenced for fluid balance monitoring.  \n   Reason: Guideline 1.8 requires fluid balance documentation for all women with obstetric hemorrhage.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer a postnatal debriefing and follow-up appointment to discuss the hemorrhage and implications for future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: Guideline 8.2.6 recommends postnatal discussions and Birth Stories service referral.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting whether the anesthetic team has discussed cell salvage availability for the planned cesarean.  \n   Reason: Guideline 10.1 mentions cell salvage for predicted major hemorrhage but is not critical in this case.  \n\nOverall, the clinical note is well-aligned with the guideline, but the above adjustments would further improve compliance and patient care. The most critical gaps are the Consultant referral, placenta accreta evaluation, and patient counseling.\n\n### Obstetric Haemorrhage Protocol: MP053\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been formally counseled on the risks of placenta previa, including the possibility of hysterectomy, ICU admission, and neonatal outcomes.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline emphasizes the importance of clear counseling on risks for women with placenta previa (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure a Consultant Obstetrician is directly involved in the patientâs care, given her high-risk status (previous C-sections, recurrent bleeding).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline states that women with placenta previa should be referred to a Consultant Obstetrician (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on emergency procedures, including when to seek immediate help (e.g., further bleeding, contractions, reduced fetal movements).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline highlights the need for clear communication of risks and emergency plans (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a thromboprophylaxis plan, as the patient is on bed rest and at risk of VTE.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline states thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is controlled (Section: Postnatal Care).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider iron supplementation or further evaluation for anemia (Hb 10.8 g/dL) to optimize preoperative hemoglobin.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline emphasizes monitoring blood levels and iron stores (Section: Antenatal Care).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss and document the patientâs birth preferences, including anesthetic options and consent for potential interventions (e.g., blood transfusion, hysterectomy).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline stresses the importance of individualized care plans (Section: Women Who Decline Blood Products).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a debriefing plan for after delivery, given the high-risk nature of her case.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline recommends debriefing by a senior team member (Section: Postnatal Care).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider involving a hematology consult preemptively, given her recurrent bleeding and risk of major hemorrhage.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline highlights communication with hematology in major hemorrhage cases (Section: Postpartum Hemorrhage).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Ensure the Kleihauer-Betke test result is explicitly documented in the notes (though it is implied as negative).  \n   **Reason**: Minor documentation detail (Section: Antepartum Hemorrhage).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide additional written resources on pelvic rest and activity modifications.  \n   **Reason**: The patient is already compliant, so this is a minor reinforcement (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \n\nThese recommendations ensure the clinical note aligns more closely with the guidelineâs emphasis on risk counseling, consultant involvement, thromboprophylaxis, and clear documentation.\n\n### Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Neonatal Outcomes in Preterm Birth\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the exact timing and dose of antenatal corticosteroids administered (e.g., dexamethasone 24 mg IM in two doses 24 hours apart).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline specifies the optimal dose and route (24 mg dexamethasone phosphate or betamethasone IM) and emphasizes timing effectiveness within 48 hours prior to birth (BJOG guideline, \"Optimum dose and route\" section).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on the purpose, benefits (reduced neonatal respiratory distress), and potential risks (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia) of corticosteroids.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline stresses informed discussions, particularly regarding risks/benefits in late preterm (35+0â36+6 weeks) and special populations (BJOG guideline, \"Informed discussion\" and \"Risks\" sections).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Different management plan** - Consider serial hemoglobin monitoring more frequently (e.g., every 12â24 hours) given the drop from 11.4 to 10.8 g/dL and active bleeding risk.  \n   **Reason**: While not directly addressed in the corticosteroid guideline, close monitoring aligns with general placenta previa management to detect anemia exacerbation promptly.  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document contingency plans for repeat corticosteroid courses if delivery is delayed beyond 7 days and bleeding recurs.  \n   **Reason**: The guideline notes limited evidence for repeat courses but suggests considering them if the risk of preterm birth persists (BJOG guideline, \"Repeat courses\" section).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on corticosteroids and placenta previa (e.g., support group links).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline mentions support groups as a resource, though this is not critical for immediate care (BJOG guideline, \"Support groups\" section).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Note the specific brand of corticosteroid used (e.g., dexamethasone vs. betamethasone).  \n   **Reason**: The guideline considers both equivalent, making this a minor detail (BJOG guideline, \"Optimum dose and route\" section).  \n\n### Key Omissions Addressed:  \n- The note aligns well with the guidelineâs core recommendations for corticosteroid use in preterm placenta previa (24+0â34+6 weeks). However, explicit documentation of counseling, drug details, and monitoring frequency would strengthen compliance.  \n\n**Summary**: The management plan is largely guideline-compliant, but improvements in documentation, patient counseling, and monitoring granularity are suggested to optimize care.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against 5 most relevant guidelines successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 157 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the top 5 most relevant.*\n\n\nGuideline: CG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 1 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\nAntepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage \nGuideline \n(Including antenatal management of placenta praevia & placenta accreta) \nSummary statement: How does the \ndocument support patient care? \nBy providing evidence based guidance in the management \nof antepartum and intrapartum haemorrhage. \nStaff/stakeholders involved in \ndevelopment: \nLabour Ward Leads (Obstetric and Midwifery), Consultant \nObstetricians, Senior midwives, Joint Obstetric Guidelines \nGroup. \nDivision: \nWomen and Childrenâs \nDepartment: \nMaternity \nResponsible Person: \nChief of Service \nAuthor: \nConsultant Obstetrician and Maternity Clinical Effectiveness \nteam \nFor use by: \nAll medical, obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic staff \nPurpose: \nTo provide evidence based guidance on the management of \nantepartum and intrapartum haemorrhage. \nThis document supports: \n \nCEMACH 2007, RCOG 2011, 2018, MBRRACE-UK 2019 \nNICE NG121 (2019) \nKey related documents: \nUH Sussex (SRH&WH) Maternity Guidelines: Postpartum \nHaemorrhage, Care of Severely III Pregnant \nWoman/Transfer to High Dependency Unit, Induction of \nLabour following Intrauterine Death/Fetal Abnormality, \nVenous Thromboembolism, Uterine Rupture, Anti D, \nPreterm Labour and Delivery \nApproved by: \nJOGG: 18\nth\n January 2023 \nMedicines Governance Committee: 13\nth\n June 2023 \nDate uploaded: \n14\nth\n July 2023 \nRatified by Board of Directors/ \nCommittee of the Board of Directors \nNot Applicable â Divisional Ratification only required \nRatification Date: \nNot Applicable â Divisional Ratification only required \nExpiry Date: \nDecember 2023 \nReview date: \nJune 2023 \nIf you require this document in another format such as Braille, large print, \naudio or another language please contact the Trusts Communications Team \nReference Number: \nCG12004 \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 2 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\nVersion Date Author Status Comment \n1.0 January 2021 Consultant \nObstetricians & \nCNST Midwife \nArchived New Trustwide guideline \n2.0 November 2014 N.

3-5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of \nperinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. \n \nThe major causes for APH and intrapartum haemorrhage are placenta praevia (30%) and \nplacental abruption (20%) but the majority are of unknown aetiology (40%). Five per cent of \nwomen have a low lying placenta at 20 weeks but only 0.5% persist past 37 weeks \ngestation. Placental abruption occurs in 0.65% of pregnancies. \n \nAll pregnant women/people 16 weeks or more with significant revealed vaginal bleeding or \nsuspicion of concealed bleeding should be reviewed on triage/Delivery Suite. \n \nIf a pregnant woman/person in labour has any vaginal blood loss other than a âshowâ, they \nshould be transferred to obstetric-led care and be reviewed by an obstetrician. \n \nPregnant women/people less than16 weeks should be referred to A&E or to EPAC as \nappropriate. \n \n5.1 Definition \n \nBleeding from the genital tract between 24 weeks gestation and delivery, however, any \npregnant woman/person with bleeding after 16 weeks of pregnancy should be assessed in \nthe Delivery Suite/Labour Ward. \n \nClassification of APH & intrapartum haemorrhage: \n \nï· Spotting â staining or streaking noted on underwear. \nï· Minor haemorrhage â blood loss less than 50 ml which has settled. \nï· Major haemorrhage â blood loss of 50-1000 ml, with no clinical signs of shock. \nï· Severe major haemorrhage - blood loss greater than 1000ml and/or signs of \nshock. \n \nIf a pregnant woman/person in labour has vaginal blood loss typical of a âshowâ, CG1196 \nCare in labour should be followed. \n \nPlease see Appendix 2: Antepartum/Intrapartum Haemorrhage Proforma. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 6 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nIf the bleed is assessed as being significant or recurrent by the obstetrician, a new \nplan will need to be decided. Once plan has been agreed and FGR risk amended \nplease inform the Antenatal Clinic via email: \nWorthing: uhsussex.wor.antenatalclinic@nhs.net \nor \nSRH: antenatalclinic1@nhs.net \nto ensure the appropriate care planning is arranged. \n\n5.2 Causes \n \nï· Placenta praevia \nï· Placental abruption \nï· Vasa praevia \nï· Local causes \nï· Undiagnosed \nï· Uterine rupture (CG1151 Uterine rupture guideline) \n \nPregnant women/people should be advised to report all vaginal bleeding to their health \nprofessional. \n \nAll patients presenting with significant vaginal bleeding or a suspicion of concealed bleeding \nmust be admitted to hospital. The initial assessment should be carried out on the delivery \nsuite. Priority must be given to assessing maternal and fetal well-being. \n \nHaemorrhage should be considered when classic signs of hypovolaemia are present \n(tachycardia and/or agitation are late signs of hypotension) even in the absence of revealed \nbleeding. Recurrent bleeding, pain or agitation should be seen as âred flagsâ in \nwomen/people with placenta accreta and they should be advised to remain in hospital. \n \nWhilst significant haemorrhage may be apparent from observed physiological disturbances, \nyoung fit pregnant women/people compensate remarkably well. A tachycardia commonly \ndevelops but there can be a paradoxical bradycardia.

On transvaginal scan, \nlow lying placenta praevia is confirmed when the placenta is less than or equal to \n20 mm from the internal os. \nï· Placenta accreta: a morbidly adherent placenta (including accreta, increta and \npercreta). \n \nThe term placenta praevia should be used when the placenta lies directly over the internal \nos. For pregnancies at more than 16 weeks of gestation the term low-lying placenta should \nbe used when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os on transabdominal \nor transvaginal scanning (TVS). \n \n6.1 Risk factors \n \nï· Previous caesarean section \nï· Previous placenta praevia \nï· Previous termination of pregnancy \nï· Multiparity \nï· Maternal age over 40 years \nï· Smoking \nï· Multiple pregnancy \nï· Assisted conception \n \n6.2 Diagnosis \n \nUsually made at the routine anomaly ultrasound examination, but should be suspected in \nany pregnant woman/person with vaginal bleeding and a high presenting part or abnormal \nlie, irrespective of previous imaging results. If images are available from the 20 week \nscan, these can be rechecked in the event of bleeding. \n \n6.3 Antenatal screening and management of placenta praevia \n \nï· If placenta praevia is suspected at the anomaly scan, the diagnosis should be \nconfirmed by transvaginal scan (TVS). 25-60% will be reclassified by use of TVS. \nï· Women/people diagnosed with a low lying placenta at the anomaly scan should \nbe given the RCOG patient information leaflet: Placenta praevia, placenta accreta \nand vasa praevia should be given following the scan with appropriate counselling. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 8 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nFollow up should be arranged for all women/people where the placenta covers or \noverlaps the os at the anomaly scan. \nï· Asymptomatic women/people with suspected low lying placenta should be \nrescanned at 32 weeks. If the leading edge of the placenta is greater than 20mm \nfrom the internal os, a vaginal delivery can be anticipated, however if the head \nfails to engage by term, Consultant review should be arranged. If a low lying \nplacenta persists and the woman/person is asymptomatic, a further TVS at 36 \nweeks can be performed to inform discussion mode of birth (RCOG 2018). \nï· Asymptomatic women/people with suspected placenta praevia or a suspicion of \nplacenta accreta should be rescanned at around 32 weeks to clarify the diagnosis \nand allow planning for further imaging and birth (See section 7.0 for management \nof suspected placenta accreta). \nï· Cervical length measurement may help facilitate management decisions in \nasymptomatic women/people with placenta praevia. A short cervical length on \nTVS before 34 weeks of gestation increases the risk of preterm emergency \ndelivery and massive haemorrhage at caesarean birth (RCOG 2018). \n \n6.4 Inpatient/outpatient management of placenta praevia \n \nï· Pregnant women/people with placenta praevia in the third trimester should be \ncounselled about the risks of preterm birth and haemorrhage, and their care \nshould be tailored to their individual needs. \nï· Outpatient management should take into consideration proximity to the hospital, \ntransport, any communication issues, previous bleeding episodes, haematology \nlaboratory results, and acceptance of receiving donor blood or blood products. \nPregnant women/people should be advised to attend immediately on experiencing \nany bleeding, contractions or pain, including vague suprapubic period-like \nsymptoms. \nï· Women/people with placenta praevia in the third trimester, or who have had \nbleeding, may be advised to avoid intercourse. \nï· Availability of blood â inpatients with bleeding, should have a current group and \nsave (lasts 72 hours). \nï· Women/people with atypical antibodies are a high risk group and their care should \nbe discussed with the Haematologist and blood bank. \n \n6.5 Signs suggestive of placenta praevia \n \nï· The bleeding is usually fresh and painless and may vary from minimal to profuse. \nï· Abdominal examination reveals a soft non-tender uterus, though secondary \nuterine contractions may occur. \nï· Unengaged head-which may be difficult to palpate with the âboggyâ lower segment. \nï· Malpresentation. \nï· The definitive diagnosis usually relies on ultrasound imaging. \n \nN.B: A digital vaginal examination is potentially an extremely dangerous procedure when \nplacenta praevia is suspected and must never be carried out unless in theatre with the ability \nto perform an immediate caesarean section. A careful speculum examination may be \nindicated. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 9 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\n6.6 Acute management of placenta praevia \n \nManagement is dependent on: \n \nï· Amount of bleeding \nï· Condition of the mother and fetus \nï· Location of the placenta \nï· Stage of the pregnancy \n \nOn admission take a full blood count, U&Es and a group and save; and liaise with the \nhaematologist. \n \nGestation more than 37 weeks or if significant bleeding continues and delivery is \nindicated: \n \nï· Discuss with consultant on call. Obstetric consultants and consultant \nanaesthetists should attend all caesarean sections for placenta praevia. \nï· Prepare for theatre. \nï· Inform Blood Transfusion and request 4- 6 units of blood to be cross-matched. An \nO-negative paediatric pack for the baby is available from blood transfusion on \nrequest; should the baby require it. \nï· Proceed to caesarean section if diagnosis confirmed. \nï· If the diagnosis is in doubt, if possible perform an ultrasound scan or perform a \ncareful examination in theatre. If fetal head is below a low lying placenta, perform \nartificial rupture of membranes to induce labour; commence continuous electronic \nfetal heart rate monitoring. \nï· If placenta praevia is confirmed proceed to caesarean section. \nï· Cell salvage should be set up for collection in all women with placenta praevia. \nï· A paediatrician should be present at delivery because of the risk of fetal \nhaemorrhage. \n \nGestational age less than 37 weeks and/or not significantly bleeding: \n \nï· Maintain nil by mouth, and intravenous infusion until the clinical situation becomes \nclearer. \nï· Send group and save to laboratory, low threshold for cross matching blood \nï· Confirm diagnosis of placenta praevia by ultrasound scan. \nï· If contractions and bleeding have settled patient can be transferred to the \nantenatal ward. \nï· A plan for further management should be made by the Consultant Obstetrician. \nï· Late preterm (34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation) birth should be considered for \nwomen/people presenting with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta and a \nhistory of vaginal bleeding or other associated risk factors for preterm birth. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 10 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nï· Delivery timing should be tailored according to antenatal symptoms and, for \nwomen/people presenting with uncomplicated placenta praevia, delivery should be \nconsidered between 36+0 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. \nï· Whenever possible, CTG monitoring should be performed where knowledge of \nfetal condition will influence the timing and mode of birth. \n \n6.7 Corticosteroid prophylaxis \n \nIn women/people at higher risk of preterm birth, a single course of antenatal corticosteroid \ntherapy is recommended between 34\n+0\n and 35\n+6\n weeks of gestation for pregnant \nwomen/people with a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia and is appropriate prior to \n34\n+0\n weeks of gestation (See CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway). \n \n7.0 Morbidly adherent placenta (including placenta accreta, increta and \npercreta \n \nThe highest risk factors for the development of a morbidly adherent placenta (including \nplacenta accreta, placenta increta and placenta percreta) are placenta praevia and previous \nCaesarean birth (or uterine surgery). The risk in the presence of both of these risk factors is \naround 5-10%. \n \nPlacenta accreta should be suspected in any pregnant woman/person with an anterior \nplacenta praevia and a previous scar. \n \n7.1 Antenatal screening for morbidly adherent placenta \n(including placenta accreta, placenta increta and placenta percreta) \n \nï· If the pregnant woman/person has had previous uterine surgery (e.g. caesarean \nbirth, myomectomy), a TVS should be performed at the next available routine \nappointment. The scan should be carried out by a consultant who is experienced \nin diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum disorder (PAS). The following should be \nassessed: \n- Placental lacunae. \n- Abnormal vessels on colour Doppler. \n- Loss of retro-placental clear space. \n- Bulging mass into the urinary bladder. \nï· If a consultant with the relevant experience is not available at Worthing ANC, a \nreferral should be made to St Richardâs ANC. \nï· If placenta accreta is confirmed or suspicion of placenta accreta continues after \nthis repeat scan, a referral to a Tertiary unit should be made for 32 weeks or after \nto allow for birth planning. \nï· Women/people with uncomplicated placenta accreta, planned birth at 35+0 to \n36+6 weeks of gestation provides the best balance between fetal maturity and the \nrisk of unscheduled delivery. \nï· Consideration may be made for an antenatal MRI only if the local experience and \nexpertise exists for making a diagnosis of placental morbid adherence. \nï· The referral to the St Georgeâs Fetal Medicine Unit should indicate if a second \nopinion is being requested and/or transfer of care if the diagnosis is confirmed. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 11 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \n7.2 Management of women/people with suspected morbidity adherent placenta: \n \nï· Discuss the interventions available for birth with women/person suspected to have \nmorbidly adherent placenta. \nï· Discussion and consent should include possible interventions (such as \nhysterectomy, leaving placenta in situ, cell salvage and interventional radiology \n(IR)). \nï· A consultant obstetrician with appropriate experience should plan and directly \nsupervise the birth. \nï· There should be multidisciplinary involvement in pre-operative planning. \nï· A plan should be made including which other healthcare professionals need to be \npresent at birth. \nï· A consultant obstetric anaesthetist should plan and directly supervise anaesthesia \nat delivery. \nï· Ensure sufficient cross-matched blood and blood products are readily available. \nï· A senior haematologist is available for advice. \nï· An experienced paediatrician is present. \nï· There should be a level 2 critical care bed locally available. \nï· There should be a clear strategy for the management of unpredictable PPH within \nthe department. Where IR services are not available locally or there is no \ncontinuous IR on call, it should be ensured that there is an agreed formal \narrangement for the provision of these services either with a larger service nearby \nor through formation of a network with surrounding organisations. \n \n(South West Thames Regional Protocol for Screening, Diagnosis and Management of \nMorbidly Adherent Placenta - St Georgeâs University Hospitals Foundation Trust 2014). \n \n8.0 Placental abruption \n \nPlacental abruption is defined as bleeding due to the premature separation of a normally \nsituated placenta. The bleeding is from maternal venous sinuses and may be revealed, \npartly revealed or concealed. \n \n8.1 Risk factors \n \nï· Abruption in previous pregnancy (most predictive). \nï· Hypertension/gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia. \nï· Smoking and drug misuse. \nï· Obesity and low BMI. \nï· Trauma (consider domestic violence). \nï· Fetal growth restriction. \nï· Polyhydramnios. \nï· Increased maternal age. \nï· Assisted conception. \nï· Multiparity. \nï· Premature rupture of membranes. \nï· Intrauterine infection. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 12 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\n8.2 Signs suggestive of abruption \n \nï· A tense, tender, irritable uterus. \nï· Co-existing pre-eclampsia. \nï· Maternal haemodynamic compromise (shock) out of proportion to vaginal loss. \nï· History of previous placental abruption. \n \n8.3 Assessment on admission \n \nï· Full clinical history including whether pain exists with haemorrhage. \nï· Identification of any risk factors. \nï· Clinical examination. \nï· Observations-pulse, respirations, blood pressure and temp). \nï· CTG (if over 26 weeks). \nï· Fetal heart check (if under 26 weeks). \nï· Ultrasound if fetal heart not detected as above. \n \n8.4 Management of minor or small placental abruption \n \nï· Pregnant women/people presenting with spotting who are no longer actively \nbleeding and where placenta praevia has been excluded, can go home if clinical \nassessments are reassuring. \nï· If abruption is small and the fetus is not compromised and the mother/person is \nwell, a conservative approach is possible. \nï· Admit for at least 24 hours post bleed (or until bleeding has stopped), and \nconsider an ultrasound scan is carried out to exude placenta praevia (if not \npreviously performed) and assess fetal growth and wellbeing. \nï· Insert a grey venflon and take bloods for full blood count and group & save. \nï· Following single or recurrent episodes of APH from a cervical ectropion, \nsubsequent antenatal care need not be altered. \nï· Following APH from placental abruption or unexplained APH, the pregnancy \nshould be reclassified as high risk and subsequent antenatal care should be \nConsultant led. Serial scans for growth and fetal surveillance should be \nconsidered. \n \nConsider delivery after 38 weeks gestation, especially if recurrent/significant bleeds. \n \n8.5 Management of major placental abruption \n \nThe specific treatment for placental abruption causing major haemorrhage is rapid birth after \nadequate maternal resuscitation. \n \nï· If the fetus is alive and viable, caesarean birth is usually indicated unless a rapid \nvaginal birth is anticipated. The fetal heart should be carefully and continuously \nmonitored. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 13 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nï· In cases where the fetus is dead or non-viable, labour should be induced unless \nthe maternal/birthing parent condition indicates immediate birth by caesarean birth \n(See CG1120 Intrauterine death including induction for a fetal abnormality). \nï· Labour generally progresses well after induction. If this does not occur caesarean \nbirth may be necessary even in the presence of a non-viable or dead fetus. \nï· Post-delivery a syntocinon infusion (40 international units in 500 mls normal saline \nat 125 mls per hour) should be commenced and continued for at least 4 hours due \nto risk of postpartum haemorrhage consider risk of disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC). \nï· Monitor blood pressure closely for underlying pre-eclampsia/ HELLP syndrome. \n\n9.0 Vasa praevia \n \nVasa praevia is defined as fetal blood loss associated with velamentous insertion of the \numbilical cord where one of the fetal vessels crosses the membranes between the \npresenting part of the fetus and the internal os of the uterus. The vessel may be torn when \nthe membranes rupture and a small amount of fetal bleeding will have a severe effect on the \nfetus causing bradycardia or death. \n \n9.1 Diagnosis \n \nIn the antenatal period, in the absence of vaginal bleeding, there is no method to diagnose \nvasa praevia clinically. It can be accurately diagnosed with transvaginal colour Doppler \nultrasonography. For cases identified in second trimester, imaging should be repeated in the \nthird trimester to confirm persistence. Vasa praevia can resolve in up to 15% of cases with \nadvancing gestation. \n \nVasa praevia should not be routinely screened for at the anomaly scan, as it does not fulfil \nthe criteria for a screening programme. \n \nDuring labour, in the absence of vaginal bleeding, vasa praevia can occasionally be \ndiagnosed clinically by the palpation of fetal vessels in the membrane during vaginal \nexamination. \n \n9.2 Management \n \nIn cases of vaginal bleeding, especially associated with membrane rupture and fetal \ncompromise, delivery should not be delayed to try and diagnose vasa praevia. In these \ncases, delivery should be by category 1 caesarean birth. \n \nIn confirmed cases of vasa praevia at term, timely delivery should be carried out by elective \ncaesarean birth (CS). Remember use of corticosteroids where elective caesarean birth is \nplanned before 39 weeks. \n \n10.0 Local causes \n \nThis is bleeding from the cervix or vagina. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 14 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\nï· Usually due to ectropion or polyps but cervicitis and vaginitis also described. \nï· Cervical cancer is an uncommon cause of APH, but must be excluded by \ninspection of the cervix (speculum examination) in all women/people with \nrecurrent bleeding in pregnancy. If any concerns, refer to senior obstetrician. \nï· Pregnant women/people with recurrent admissions for persistent bleeding of \nunknown origin, should be reviewed by an experienced obstetrician and a \nspeculum examination should be performed to exclude cervical cancer. \nï· Please see CG21008 Management of high risk maternal medicine conditions \nsection on âSuspected cervical cancerâ. \n \n11.0 APH of unknown origin \n \nIn many cases, the cause of bleeding is undetermined as it was assumed that these bleeds \nare as a result of a minor degree of placental separation, they were commonly known as \nâmarginal bleedsâ. \n \nPregnancies complicated by an unexplained APH are also at increased risk of adverse \nmaternal perinatal outcomes. Whether or not this is the case, the decision for timing, place \nand mode of birth should be at consultant level. \n \n12.0 Intrapartum haemorrhage \n \nIf a woman/person in labour has any vaginal blood loss other than a âshowâ, possible causes \nof bleeding should be considered: \n \nï· Placental abruption. \nï· Placenta praevia. \nï· Uterine rupture. \nï· Vasa praevia. \n \nTake a history of the bleeding, asking about: \n \nï· Associated symptoms, including pain. \nï· Specific concerns the woman/person may have. \nï· Previous uterine surgery. \nï· Check previous scans for placental position. \nï· Assess the volume of blood loss and characteristics of the blood, such as colour, \nand presence of clots or amniotic fluid. \n \nObstetrician to review and carry out a physical examination, including: \n \nï· Vital signs. \nï· Abdominal palpation. \nï· Speculum examination. \nï· Vaginal examination if placenta praevia has been excluded. \nï· Fetal heart auscultation and commence CTG if more than 26 weeks. \nï· Bloods for full blood count, U&Es blood group. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 15 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n\nA plan of care should be documented following a review by a senior obstetrician and after \ndiscussion with the pregnant woman/person and their birth partner. The labour ward co-\nordinator and senior obstetric anaesthetist and paediatrician should be informed of \nadmission. If stable this should include: \n \nï· Establishing venous access. \nï· Maternal monitoring. \nï· CTG monitoring. \n \nIf a woman/person with intrapartum bleeding has a large blood loss or her condition causes \nconcern, management should include: \n \nï· IV fluids and ensure fluid balance monitoring is performed. \nï· Fetal monitoring. \nï· Taking blood for clotting studies and blood gases. \nï· Cross matching blood. \nï· Triggering the local major haemorrhage protocol. \nï· Use of amniotomy or oxytocin. \nï· Expediting the birth. \nï· Obstetric consultant support. \n \n13.0 Emergency management of acute antepartum & intrapartum \nhaemorrhage (see appendix 1) \n \nThe management will usually be led by the Obstetric Registrar and include the following \nmeasures: \n \nï· Early involvement of anaesthetist if resuscitation required. \nï· If woman/person unstable call for help: â2222â Obstetric Haemorrhage, (and \nNeonatal Emergency - if indicated). \nï· If the woman/person is in a compromised state, rapid assessment and \nresuscitation should be commenced. In this situation, the woman/person is the \npriority and should be stabilised prior to establishing the fetal condition. If \nwoman/person is unstable they should be immediately transferred to theatre for \nstabilisation. \nï· Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion should not be delayed because of false \nreassurance from a single haemoglobin result. \nï· In a woman/person who is bleeding and is likely to develop a coagulopathy or has \nevidence of a coagulopathy, it is prudent to give blood components before \ncoagulation indices deteriorate. This decision should be sanctioned by the \nconsultant haematologist. \nï· Regular observations of maternal/birthing parent pulse, blood pressure, \nrespirations, oxygen saturation and urine output, vaginal blood loss and uterine \nactivity based on the clinical situation, every 15 minutes or more if acute; every 30 \nminutes to hourly if more stable. Document these on MEOWS chart and refer if \nindicated. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 16 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nï· Insert 2 intravenous infusion lines (16 gauge grey cannula) and start IV \nHartmanns. \nï· Send a serum group and save and order immediate cross-matching of 4-6 units \n(depending on clinical picture). \nï· Request urgent haemoglobin, platelet, clotting studies and U&Eâs. \nï· Give acid aspiration prophylaxis. \nï· The paediatric registrar and Special Baby Care Unit should both be informed if \ndelivery of a compromised or premature baby seems likely. \nï· CTG should be performed (greater than 26 weeks). \nï· Ultrasound evaluation of placental site and liquor volume should be performed on \ndelivery suite if possible by the registrar. If fetal size assessment or a more expert \nopinion is required this may have to wait until an ultrasonographer or obstetrician \nwith appropriate skills is available. \nï· Actively bleeding or unstable women/people should not be moved to the \nultrasound department. \nï· Anti D should be given to rhesus negative women/person if delivery not imminent \n(independent of whether routine antenatal prophylactic Anti D has been given). \nï· Consider steroids and magnesium sulphate if significant bleed or if bleed \nprecipitates pre-term labour (see CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway). \n \nTocolysis is contraindicated in the presence of a bleed. \nDiscuss with obstetric consultant. \n \n14.0 Management of extremely preterm (24-26 weeks) pregnancy with APH \n \nï· Regardless of gestation, the woman/personâs life should take priority. They should \nbe stabilised and resuscitated before any decision is made regarding birth. \nï· A senior paediatrician/neonatologist should be involved in the counselling of \nwomen/people at risk of extremely preterm birth. \n \n15.0 Post-delivery management of major APH or intrapartum haemorrhage \n \nFollowing a major APH or intrapartum haemorrhage women/people are at an \nincreased risk of postpartum haemorrhage, DIC (30%), ARDS and renal and liver \nfailure. \n \nï· Prescribe and administer thromboprophylaxis; as there is increased risk of venous \nthromboembolism as soon as risk of haemorrhage is reduced. \nï· Consider the most appropriate place for patients to be nursed e.g. delivery suite, \nCCU. \nï· Consider CCU if large blood loss or co-morbidities. \nï· Patients are often anaemic and may require further transfusions. \nï· Renal function recovery may be slow and should be closely monitored by hourly \nurine measurement and daily U&Eâs. \nï· Transfer to postnatal ward should only occur after obstetric review and when \n4 hourly observations are required. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 17 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \nï· Patients should be seen by their consultant before discharge. A debrief should \ntake place allowing discussion of events with the woman/person and their partner \nwith the opportunity to ask questions. \nï· Offer âBirth Afterthoughtsâ service and 6/52 consultant postnatal appointment for \nthrombophilia screening and planning of future pregnancies. \nï· Where the APH has resulted in fetal demise, good communication between the \nmaternity unit and the woman/personâs general practitioner and community \nmidwife is crucial. These issues are addressed in RCOG GTG55 Late intrauterine \nfetal death and stillbirth (2010). It may be appropriate for the consultant to contact \nthe general practitioner by telephone. \nï· Management of a major APH should be included in obstetric skills drills. \n\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 18 of 20 \nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \n \n16.0 Audit \n \nSuggested auditable standards (RCOG): \n \nï· Evidence of consultant attendance at all CS for placenta praevia. \n \nï· Evidence that women/people with APH and less than 34+6 weeks gestation \nreceive corticosteroids. \n \nï· Documented management plan by consultant obstetrician if placenta praevia or \nplacenta accreta suspected or confirmed. \n\nReferences \n \nConfidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health.

  "textContent": "AI: DeepSeek (deepseek-chat)\n\nQ: {\n  \"prompt\": \"Original Transcript:\\nSITUATION: 35-year-old G4P2+1 at 28+5 weeks gestation with major placenta previa and recent bleeding episode requiring management\\n\\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Ahmed has known complete placenta previa diagnosed at 20-week anomaly scan, where placenta was noted to completely cover the cervical os. She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6Â°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\\n\\nGuideline Analysis:\\n### CG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a transvaginal scan (TVS) was performed to confirm placenta previa diagnosis (beyond the initial 20-week anomaly scan).\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 states TVS should be used to confirm diagnosis when placenta previa is suspected, as 25-60% of cases are reclassified by TVS.\\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider earlier delivery timing (36+0 to 37+0 weeks) given this is the second bleeding episode.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.6 recommends delivery at 36-37 weeks for uncomplicated placenta previa, and earlier for recurrent bleeds (RCOG 2018).\\n\\n3. **Additional information needed** - Document assessment for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) given previous two cesarean sections and complete previa.\\n   Reason: Guideline 7.1 states PAS should be suspected with anterior previa and prior uterine surgery, requiring TVS by experienced consultant.\\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide counseling about risks of preterm birth and hemorrhage, including specific warning signs requiring immediate attention.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.4 emphasizes counseling about risks and when to seek care for women with placenta previa.\\n\\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether cervical length was measured, as this predicts preterm delivery risk.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 notes cervical length <34 weeks predicts preterm delivery and massive hemorrhage risk.\\n\\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider cell salvage setup given high-risk nature.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.6 recommends cell salvage for all placenta previa cases.\\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether RCOG patient information leaflet was provided.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.3 recommends providing the RCOG placenta previa information leaflet at diagnosis.\\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Document discussion about avoiding intercourse given bleeding episodes.\\n   Reason: Guideline 6.4 suggests advising against intercourse for women with previa who have bled.\\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting more frequent hemoglobin monitoring (e.g., every 48 hours) given active bleeding.\\n   Reason: While serial hemoglobin monitoring is planned, more frequent checks may better track acute blood loss.\\n\\nThe clinical note generally follows guideline recommendations well but could be strengthened by more complete documentation of diagnostic evaluations (especially TVS and PAS assessment), earlier delivery planning given recurrent bleeds, and more detailed patient counseling documentation. The highest priority improvements relate to confirming the diagnosis with TVS and evaluating for PAS given the patient's risk factors.\\n\\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH) with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether domestic violence screening was performed given recurrent APH.  \\n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes that women with repeated presentations of APH should be asked about domestic violence (GTG 2011 - APH, Clinical Assessment section).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider administering anti-D immunoglobulin (if not already done, though note states Rh-positive mother).  \\n   Reason: The guideline recommends anti-D Ig for RhD-negative women after any APH presentation (GTG 2011 - APH, Management Principles section). While this patient is Rh-positive, explicitly stating this avoids ambiguity.  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer counseling on the risks of recurrent bleeding, preterm delivery, and potential need for emergency delivery.  \\n   Reason: The guideline highlights the association of APH with adverse perinatal outcomes (GTG 2011 - APH, Introduction). Patient understanding of risks is crucial for informed decision-making.  \\n\\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document a detailed plan for thromboprophylaxis given bed rest and high-risk status (previous C-sections, placenta previa).  \\n   Reason: The guideline mentions postnatal thromboprophylaxis but does not explicitly address antenatal prophylaxis. However, given immobilization, this is a significant consideration.  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include a documented anesthetic plan (e.g., preference for regional anesthesia if no contraindications).  \\n   Reason: The guideline recommends regional anesthesia for operative delivery in APH unless contraindicated (GTG 2011 - APH, Management Principles). While an anesthetic consult was arranged, specifics would improve clarity.  \\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss long-term implications (e.g., future pregnancy risks, need for elective C-sections).  \\n   Reason: The guideline focuses on acute management but does not explicitly address long-term counseling. This would enhance patient-centered care.  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting a debriefing plan post-delivery.  \\n   Reason: The guideline mentions debriefing as a postnatal issue (GTG 2011 - APH, Postnatal section), but this is less critical for the acute note.  \\n\\n### Summary of Key Improvements:  \\n- Explicitly address domestic violence screening.  \\n- Clarify anti-D Ig administration (though not needed here).  \\n- Enhance patient counseling on risks and long-term implications.  \\n- Document thromboprophylaxis and anesthetic plans in more detail.  \\n\\nOverall, the note is well-aligned with the guideline but could be strengthened in these areas.\\n\\n### MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP053 Obstetric Haemorrhage) with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been referred to a Consultant Obstetrician Antenatal Clinic as per guideline 3.1.1 (all women with placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks should be referred).  \\n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.1 requires referral to a Consultant Obstetrician for placenta previa confirmed at 32 weeks.  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing the need for MRI to evaluate placenta accreta given the patient's history of two previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa (if applicable).  \\n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.5 states that women with previous cesarean sections and anterior placenta previa should be evaluated for placenta accreta with MRI.  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on the risks of preterm delivery and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the rationale for elective cesarean at 36-37 weeks.  \\n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.3 recommends counseling women with placenta previa about risks and delivery planning.  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a Group and Save sample has been taken every 7 days (if no prior transfusion) or more frequently (if prior transfusion or unusual antibodies).  \\n   Reason: Guideline 3.1.8 specifies regular Group and Save monitoring for inpatients with placenta previa.  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the Consultant Obstetrician is present in theater for the planned cesarean section (if not already planned).  \\n   Reason: Guideline 3.2.1 mandates Consultant Obstetrician presence for major placenta previa cesarean sections.  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about blood transfusion risks/benefits and discuss cell salvage options (if applicable).  \\n   Reason: Guideline 9.4.3 discusses patient counseling on blood product alternatives.  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a MEOWS chart has been commenced for fluid balance monitoring.  \\n   Reason: Guideline 1.8 requires fluid balance documentation for all women with obstetric hemorrhage.  \\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer a postnatal debriefing and follow-up appointment to discuss the hemorrhage and implications for future pregnancies.  \\n   Reason: Guideline 8.2.6 recommends postnatal discussions and Birth Stories service referral.  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting whether the anesthetic team has discussed cell salvage availability for the planned cesarean.  \\n   Reason: Guideline 10.1 mentions cell salvage for predicted major hemorrhage but is not critical in this case.  \\n\\nOverall, the clinical note is well-aligned with the guideline, but the above adjustments would further improve compliance and patient care. The most critical gaps are the Consultant referral, placenta accreta evaluation, and patient counseling.\\n\\n### Obstetric Haemorrhage Protocol: MP053\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has been formally counseled on the risks of placenta previa, including the possibility of hysterectomy, ICU admission, and neonatal outcomes.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline emphasizes the importance of clear counseling on risks for women with placenta previa (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure a Consultant Obstetrician is directly involved in the patientâs care, given her high-risk status (previous C-sections, recurrent bleeding).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline states that women with placenta previa should be referred to a Consultant Obstetrician (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on emergency procedures, including when to seek immediate help (e.g., further bleeding, contractions, reduced fetal movements).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline highlights the need for clear communication of risks and emergency plans (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a thromboprophylaxis plan, as the patient is on bed rest and at risk of VTE.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline states thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is controlled (Section: Postnatal Care).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider iron supplementation or further evaluation for anemia (Hb 10.8 g/dL) to optimize preoperative hemoglobin.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline emphasizes monitoring blood levels and iron stores (Section: Antenatal Care).  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss and document the patientâs birth preferences, including anesthetic options and consent for potential interventions (e.g., blood transfusion, hysterectomy).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline stresses the importance of individualized care plans (Section: Women Who Decline Blood Products).  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a debriefing plan for after delivery, given the high-risk nature of her case.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline recommends debriefing by a senior team member (Section: Postnatal Care).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider involving a hematology consult preemptively, given her recurrent bleeding and risk of major hemorrhage.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline highlights communication with hematology in major hemorrhage cases (Section: Postpartum Hemorrhage).  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Ensure the Kleihauer-Betke test result is explicitly documented in the notes (though it is implied as negative).  \\n   **Reason**: Minor documentation detail (Section: Antepartum Hemorrhage).  \\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide additional written resources on pelvic rest and activity modifications.  \\n   **Reason**: The patient is already compliant, so this is a minor reinforcement (Section: Placenta Praevia).  \\n\\nThese recommendations ensure the clinical note aligns more closely with the guidelineâs emphasis on risk counseling, consultant involvement, thromboprophylaxis, and clear documentation.\\n\\n### Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Neonatal Outcomes in Preterm Birth\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the exact timing and dose of antenatal corticosteroids administered (e.g., dexamethasone 24 mg IM in two doses 24 hours apart).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline specifies the optimal dose and route (24 mg dexamethasone phosphate or betamethasone IM) and emphasizes timing effectiveness within 48 hours prior to birth (BJOG guideline, \\\"Optimum dose and route\\\" section).  \\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on the purpose, benefits (reduced neonatal respiratory distress), and potential risks (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia) of corticosteroids.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline stresses informed discussions, particularly regarding risks/benefits in late preterm (35+0â36+6 weeks) and special populations (BJOG guideline, \\\"Informed discussion\\\" and \\\"Risks\\\" sections).  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Different management plan** - Consider serial hemoglobin monitoring more frequently (e.g., every 12â24 hours) given the drop from 11.4 to 10.8 g/dL and active bleeding risk.  \\n   **Reason**: While not directly addressed in the corticosteroid guideline, close monitoring aligns with general placenta previa management to detect anemia exacerbation promptly.  \\n\\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document contingency plans for repeat corticosteroid courses if delivery is delayed beyond 7 days and bleeding recurs.  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline notes limited evidence for repeat courses but suggests considering them if the risk of preterm birth persists (BJOG guideline, \\\"Repeat courses\\\" section).  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on corticosteroids and placenta previa (e.g., support group links).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline mentions support groups as a resource, though this is not critical for immediate care (BJOG guideline, \\\"Support groups\\\" section).  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Note the specific brand of corticosteroid used (e.g., dexamethasone vs. betamethasone).  \\n   **Reason**: The guideline considers both equivalent, making this a minor detail (BJOG guideline, \\\"Optimum dose and route\\\" section).  \\n\\n### Key Omissions Addressed:  \\n- The note aligns well with the guidelineâs core recommendations for corticosteroid use in preterm placenta previa (24+0â34+6 weeks). However, explicit documentation of counseling, drug details, and monitoring frequency would strengthen compliance.  \\n\\n**Summary**: The management plan is largely guideline-compliant, but improvements in documentation, patient counseling, and monitoring granularity are suggested to optimize care.\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAnalyzed against 5 most relevant guidelines successfully.\\n\\n*Note: Found 157 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the top 5 most relevant.*\\n\\n\\nGuideline: CG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage\\n\\n\\nFull Guideline Content:\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 1 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\nAntepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage \\nGuideline \\n(Including antenatal management of placenta praevia & placenta accreta) \\nSummary statement: How does the \\ndocument support patient care? \\nBy providing evidence based guidance in the management \\nof antepartum and intrapartum haemorrhage. \\nStaff/stakeholders involved in \\ndevelopment: \\nLabour Ward Leads (Obstetric and Midwifery), Consultant \\nObstetricians, Senior midwives, Joint Obstetric Guidelines \\nGroup. \\nDivision: \\nWomen and Childrenâs \\nDepartment: \\nMaternity \\nResponsible Person: \\nChief of Service \\nAuthor: \\nConsultant Obstetrician and Maternity Clinical Effectiveness \\nteam \\nFor use by: \\nAll medical, obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic staff \\nPurpose: \\nTo provide evidence based guidance on the management of \\nantepartum and intrapartum haemorrhage. \\nThis document supports: \\n \\nCEMACH 2007, RCOG 2011, 2018, MBRRACE-UK 2019 \\nNICE NG121 (2019) \\nKey related documents: \\nUH Sussex (SRH&WH) Maternity Guidelines: Postpartum \\nHaemorrhage, Care of Severely III Pregnant \\nWoman/Transfer to High Dependency Unit, Induction of \\nLabour following Intrauterine Death/Fetal Abnormality, \\nVenous Thromboembolism, Uterine Rupture, Anti D, \\nPreterm Labour and Delivery \\nApproved by: \\nJOGG: 18\\nth\\n January 2023 \\nMedicines Governance Committee: 13\\nth\\n June 2023 \\nDate uploaded: \\n14\\nth\\n July 2023 \\nRatified by Board of Directors/ \\nCommittee of the Board of Directors \\nNot Applicable â Divisional Ratification only required \\nRatification Date: \\nNot Applicable â Divisional Ratification only required \\nExpiry Date: \\nDecember 2023 \\nReview date: \\nJune 2023 \\nIf you require this document in another format such as Braille, large print, \\naudio or another language please contact the Trusts Communications Team \\nReference Number: \\nCG12004 \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 2 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\nVersion Date Author Status Comment \\n1.0 January 2021 Consultant \\nObstetricians & \\nCNST Midwife \\nArchived New Trustwide guideline \\n2.0 November 2014 N.

\\n \\nThe major causes for APH and intrapartum haemorrhage are placenta praevia (30%) and \\nplacental abruption (20%) but the majority are of unknown aetiology (40%). Five per cent of \\nwomen have a low lying placenta at 20 weeks but only 0.5% persist past 37 weeks \\ngestation. Placental abruption occurs in 0.65% of pregnancies. \\n \\nAll pregnant women/people 16 weeks or more with significant revealed vaginal bleeding or \\nsuspicion of concealed bleeding should be reviewed on triage/Delivery Suite. \\n \\nIf a pregnant woman/person in labour has any vaginal blood loss other than a âshowâ, they \\nshould be transferred to obstetric-led care and be reviewed by an obstetrician. \\n \\nPregnant women/people less than16 weeks should be referred to A&E or to EPAC as \\nappropriate. \\n \\n5.1 Definition \\n \\nBleeding from the genital tract between 24 weeks gestation and delivery, however, any \\npregnant woman/person with bleeding after 16 weeks of pregnancy should be assessed in \\nthe Delivery Suite/Labour Ward. \\n \\nClassification of APH & intrapartum haemorrhage: \\n \\nï· Spotting â staining or streaking noted on underwear. \\nï· Minor haemorrhage â blood loss less than 50 ml which has settled. \\nï· Major haemorrhage â blood loss of 50-1000 ml, with no clinical signs of shock. \\nï· Severe major haemorrhage - blood loss greater than 1000ml and/or signs of \\nshock. \\n \\nIf a pregnant woman/person in labour has vaginal blood loss typical of a âshowâ, CG1196 \\nCare in labour should be followed. \\n \\nPlease see Appendix 2: Antepartum/Intrapartum Haemorrhage Proforma. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 6 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nIf the bleed is assessed as being significant or recurrent by the obstetrician, a new \\nplan will need to be decided. Once plan has been agreed and FGR risk amended \\nplease inform the Antenatal Clinic via email: \\nWorthing: uhsussex.wor.antenatalclinic@nhs.net \\nor \\nSRH: antenatalclinic1@nhs.net \\nto ensure the appropriate care planning is arranged. \\n\\n5.2 Causes \\n \\nï· Placenta praevia \\nï· Placental abruption \\nï· Vasa praevia \\nï· Local causes \\nï· Undiagnosed \\nï· Uterine rupture (CG1151 Uterine rupture guideline) \\n \\nPregnant women/people should be advised to report all vaginal bleeding to their health \\nprofessional. \\n \\nAll patients presenting with significant vaginal bleeding or a suspicion of concealed bleeding \\nmust be admitted to hospital. The initial assessment should be carried out on the delivery \\nsuite. Priority must be given to assessing maternal and fetal well-being. \\n \\nHaemorrhage should be considered when classic signs of hypovolaemia are present \\n(tachycardia and/or agitation are late signs of hypotension) even in the absence of revealed \\nbleeding. Recurrent bleeding, pain or agitation should be seen as âred flagsâ in \\nwomen/people with placenta accreta and they should be advised to remain in hospital. \\n \\nWhilst significant haemorrhage may be apparent from observed physiological disturbances, \\nyoung fit pregnant women/people compensate remarkably well. A tachycardia commonly \\ndevelops but there can be a paradoxical bradycardia. Hypotension is always a very late sign, \\ntherefore ongoing bleeding should be acted on without delay. \\n \\n5.3 Complications of APH & intrapartum haemorrhage \\n \\nMaternal Fetal \\nï· Anaemia \\nï· Infection \\nï· Shock \\nï· Renal tubular necrosis \\nï· Consumptive coagulopathy \\nï· Postpartum haemorrhage \\nï· Prolonged hospital stay \\nï· Psychological sequelae \\nï· Complications of blood transfusion \\nï· Hypoxia \\nï· Small for gestational age & \\ngrowth restriction \\nï· Prematurity \\nï· Fetal death \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 7 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\n6.0 Placenta praevia \\n(RCOG GTG 27a 2018) \\n \\nPlacenta praevia is defined as bleeding from a placenta implanted wholly or partly in the \\nlower uterine segment and classified as: \\n \\nï· Placenta praevia: the placenta covers the internal os. \\nï· Low lying placenta (previously minor placenta praevia): the leading edge is in the \\nlower uterine segment, but does not cover the internal os. On transvaginal scan, \\nlow lying placenta praevia is confirmed when the placenta is less than or equal to \\n20 mm from the internal os. \\nï· Placenta accreta: a morbidly adherent placenta (including accreta, increta and \\npercreta). \\n \\nThe term placenta praevia should be used when the placenta lies directly over the internal \\nos. For pregnancies at more than 16 weeks of gestation the term low-lying placenta should \\nbe used when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os on transabdominal \\nor transvaginal scanning (TVS). \\n \\n6.1 Risk factors \\n \\nï· Previous caesarean section \\nï· Previous placenta praevia \\nï· Previous termination of pregnancy \\nï· Multiparity \\nï· Maternal age over 40 years \\nï· Smoking \\nï· Multiple pregnancy \\nï· Assisted conception \\n \\n6.2 Diagnosis \\n \\nUsually made at the routine anomaly ultrasound examination, but should be suspected in \\nany pregnant woman/person with vaginal bleeding and a high presenting part or abnormal \\nlie, irrespective of previous imaging results. If images are available from the 20 week \\nscan, these can be rechecked in the event of bleeding. \\n \\n6.3 Antenatal screening and management of placenta praevia \\n \\nï· If placenta praevia is suspected at the anomaly scan, the diagnosis should be \\nconfirmed by transvaginal scan (TVS). 25-60% will be reclassified by use of TVS. \\nï· Women/people diagnosed with a low lying placenta at the anomaly scan should \\nbe given the RCOG patient information leaflet: Placenta praevia, placenta accreta \\nand vasa praevia should be given following the scan with appropriate counselling. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 8 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nFollow up should be arranged for all women/people where the placenta covers or \\noverlaps the os at the anomaly scan. \\nï· Asymptomatic women/people with suspected low lying placenta should be \\nrescanned at 32 weeks. If the leading edge of the placenta is greater than 20mm \\nfrom the internal os, a vaginal delivery can be anticipated, however if the head \\nfails to engage by term, Consultant review should be arranged. If a low lying \\nplacenta persists and the woman/person is asymptomatic, a further TVS at 36 \\nweeks can be performed to inform discussion mode of birth (RCOG 2018). \\nï· Asymptomatic women/people with suspected placenta praevia or a suspicion of \\nplacenta accreta should be rescanned at around 32 weeks to clarify the diagnosis \\nand allow planning for further imaging and birth (See section 7.0 for management \\nof suspected placenta accreta). \\nï· Cervical length measurement may help facilitate management decisions in \\nasymptomatic women/people with placenta praevia. A short cervical length on \\nTVS before 34 weeks of gestation increases the risk of preterm emergency \\ndelivery and massive haemorrhage at caesarean birth (RCOG 2018). \\n \\n6.4 Inpatient/outpatient management of placenta praevia \\n \\nï· Pregnant women/people with placenta praevia in the third trimester should be \\ncounselled about the risks of preterm birth and haemorrhage, and their care \\nshould be tailored to their individual needs. \\nï· Outpatient management should take into consideration proximity to the hospital, \\ntransport, any communication issues, previous bleeding episodes, haematology \\nlaboratory results, and acceptance of receiving donor blood or blood products. \\nPregnant women/people should be advised to attend immediately on experiencing \\nany bleeding, contractions or pain, including vague suprapubic period-like \\nsymptoms. \\nï· Women/people with placenta praevia in the third trimester, or who have had \\nbleeding, may be advised to avoid intercourse. \\nï· Availability of blood â inpatients with bleeding, should have a current group and \\nsave (lasts 72 hours). \\nï· Women/people with atypical antibodies are a high risk group and their care should \\nbe discussed with the Haematologist and blood bank. \\n \\n6.5 Signs suggestive of placenta praevia \\n \\nï· The bleeding is usually fresh and painless and may vary from minimal to profuse. \\nï· Abdominal examination reveals a soft non-tender uterus, though secondary \\nuterine contractions may occur. \\nï· Unengaged head-which may be difficult to palpate with the âboggyâ lower segment. \\nï· Malpresentation. \\nï· The definitive diagnosis usually relies on ultrasound imaging. \\n \\nN.B: A digital vaginal examination is potentially an extremely dangerous procedure when \\nplacenta praevia is suspected and must never be carried out unless in theatre with the ability \\nto perform an immediate caesarean section. A careful speculum examination may be \\nindicated. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 9 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\n6.6 Acute management of placenta praevia \\n \\nManagement is dependent on: \\n \\nï· Amount of bleeding \\nï· Condition of the mother and fetus \\nï· Location of the placenta \\nï· Stage of the pregnancy \\n \\nOn admission take a full blood count, U&Es and a group and save; and liaise with the \\nhaematologist. \\n \\nGestation more than 37 weeks or if significant bleeding continues and delivery is \\nindicated: \\n \\nï· Discuss with consultant on call. Obstetric consultants and consultant \\nanaesthetists should attend all caesarean sections for placenta praevia. \\nï· Prepare for theatre. \\nï· Inform Blood Transfusion and request 4- 6 units of blood to be cross-matched. An \\nO-negative paediatric pack for the baby is available from blood transfusion on \\nrequest; should the baby require it. \\nï· Proceed to caesarean section if diagnosis confirmed. \\nï· If the diagnosis is in doubt, if possible perform an ultrasound scan or perform a \\ncareful examination in theatre. If fetal head is below a low lying placenta, perform \\nartificial rupture of membranes to induce labour; commence continuous electronic \\nfetal heart rate monitoring. \\nï· If placenta praevia is confirmed proceed to caesarean section. \\nï· Cell salvage should be set up for collection in all women with placenta praevia. \\nï· A paediatrician should be present at delivery because of the risk of fetal \\nhaemorrhage. \\n \\nGestational age less than 37 weeks and/or not significantly bleeding: \\n \\nï· Maintain nil by mouth, and intravenous infusion until the clinical situation becomes \\nclearer. \\nï· Send group and save to laboratory, low threshold for cross matching blood \\nï· Confirm diagnosis of placenta praevia by ultrasound scan. \\nï· If contractions and bleeding have settled patient can be transferred to the \\nantenatal ward. \\nï· A plan for further management should be made by the Consultant Obstetrician. \\nï· Late preterm (34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation) birth should be considered for \\nwomen/people presenting with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta and a \\nhistory of vaginal bleeding or other associated risk factors for preterm birth. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 10 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nï· Delivery timing should be tailored according to antenatal symptoms and, for \\nwomen/people presenting with uncomplicated placenta praevia, delivery should be \\nconsidered between 36+0 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. \\nï· Whenever possible, CTG monitoring should be performed where knowledge of \\nfetal condition will influence the timing and mode of birth. \\n \\n6.7 Corticosteroid prophylaxis \\n \\nIn women/people at higher risk of preterm birth, a single course of antenatal corticosteroid \\ntherapy is recommended between 34\\n+0\\n and 35\\n+6\\n weeks of gestation for pregnant \\nwomen/people with a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia and is appropriate prior to \\n34\\n+0\\n weeks of gestation (See CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway). \\n \\n7.0 Morbidly adherent placenta (including placenta accreta, increta and \\npercreta \\n \\nThe highest risk factors for the development of a morbidly adherent placenta (including \\nplacenta accreta, placenta increta and placenta percreta) are placenta praevia and previous \\nCaesarean birth (or uterine surgery). The risk in the presence of both of these risk factors is \\naround 5-10%. \\n \\nPlacenta accreta should be suspected in any pregnant woman/person with an anterior \\nplacenta praevia and a previous scar. \\n \\n7.1 Antenatal screening for morbidly adherent placenta \\n(including placenta accreta, placenta increta and placenta percreta) \\n \\nï· If the pregnant woman/person has had previous uterine surgery (e.g. caesarean \\nbirth, myomectomy), a TVS should be performed at the next available routine \\nappointment. The scan should be carried out by a consultant who is experienced \\nin diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum disorder (PAS). The following should be \\nassessed: \\n- Placental lacunae. \\n- Abnormal vessels on colour Doppler. \\n- Loss of retro-placental clear space. \\n- Bulging mass into the urinary bladder. \\nï· If a consultant with the relevant experience is not available at Worthing ANC, a \\nreferral should be made to St Richardâs ANC. \\nï· If placenta accreta is confirmed or suspicion of placenta accreta continues after \\nthis repeat scan, a referral to a Tertiary unit should be made for 32 weeks or after \\nto allow for birth planning. \\nï· Women/people with uncomplicated placenta accreta, planned birth at 35+0 to \\n36+6 weeks of gestation provides the best balance between fetal maturity and the \\nrisk of unscheduled delivery. \\nï· Consideration may be made for an antenatal MRI only if the local experience and \\nexpertise exists for making a diagnosis of placental morbid adherence. \\nï· The referral to the St Georgeâs Fetal Medicine Unit should indicate if a second \\nopinion is being requested and/or transfer of care if the diagnosis is confirmed. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 11 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\n7.2 Management of women/people with suspected morbidity adherent placenta: \\n \\nï· Discuss the interventions available for birth with women/person suspected to have \\nmorbidly adherent placenta. \\nï· Discussion and consent should include possible interventions (such as \\nhysterectomy, leaving placenta in situ, cell salvage and interventional radiology \\n(IR)). \\nï· A consultant obstetrician with appropriate experience should plan and directly \\nsupervise the birth. \\nï· There should be multidisciplinary involvement in pre-operative planning. \\nï· A plan should be made including which other healthcare professionals need to be \\npresent at birth. \\nï· A consultant obstetric anaesthetist should plan and directly supervise anaesthesia \\nat delivery. \\nï· Ensure sufficient cross-matched blood and blood products are readily available. \\nï· A senior haematologist is available for advice. \\nï· An experienced paediatrician is present. \\nï· There should be a level 2 critical care bed locally available. \\nï· There should be a clear strategy for the management of unpredictable PPH within \\nthe department. Where IR services are not available locally or there is no \\ncontinuous IR on call, it should be ensured that there is an agreed formal \\narrangement for the provision of these services either with a larger service nearby \\nor through formation of a network with surrounding organisations. \\n \\n(South West Thames Regional Protocol for Screening, Diagnosis and Management of \\nMorbidly Adherent Placenta - St Georgeâs University Hospitals Foundation Trust 2014). \\n \\n8.0 Placental abruption \\n \\nPlacental abruption is defined as bleeding due to the premature separation of a normally \\nsituated placenta. The bleeding is from maternal venous sinuses and may be revealed, \\npartly revealed or concealed. \\n \\n8.1 Risk factors \\n \\nï· Abruption in previous pregnancy (most predictive). \\nï· Hypertension/gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia. \\nï· Smoking and drug misuse. \\nï· Obesity and low BMI. \\nï· Trauma (consider domestic violence). \\nï· Fetal growth restriction. \\nï· Polyhydramnios. \\nï· Increased maternal age. \\nï· Assisted conception. \\nï· Multiparity. \\nï· Premature rupture of membranes. \\nï· Intrauterine infection. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 12 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\n8.2 Signs suggestive of abruption \\n \\nï· A tense, tender, irritable uterus. \\nï· Co-existing pre-eclampsia. \\nï· Maternal haemodynamic compromise (shock) out of proportion to vaginal loss. \\nï· History of previous placental abruption. \\n \\n8.3 Assessment on admission \\n \\nï· Full clinical history including whether pain exists with haemorrhage. \\nï· Identification of any risk factors. \\nï· Clinical examination. \\nï· Observations-pulse, respirations, blood pressure and temp). \\nï· CTG (if over 26 weeks). \\nï· Fetal heart check (if under 26 weeks). \\nï· Ultrasound if fetal heart not detected as above. \\n \\n8.4 Management of minor or small placental abruption \\n \\nï· Pregnant women/people presenting with spotting who are no longer actively \\nbleeding and where placenta praevia has been excluded, can go home if clinical \\nassessments are reassuring. \\nï· If abruption is small and the fetus is not compromised and the mother/person is \\nwell, a conservative approach is possible. \\nï· Admit for at least 24 hours post bleed (or until bleeding has stopped), and \\nconsider an ultrasound scan is carried out to exude placenta praevia (if not \\npreviously performed) and assess fetal growth and wellbeing. \\nï· Insert a grey venflon and take bloods for full blood count and group & save. \\nï· Following single or recurrent episodes of APH from a cervical ectropion, \\nsubsequent antenatal care need not be altered. \\nï· Following APH from placental abruption or unexplained APH, the pregnancy \\nshould be reclassified as high risk and subsequent antenatal care should be \\nConsultant led. Serial scans for growth and fetal surveillance should be \\nconsidered. \\n \\nConsider delivery after 38 weeks gestation, especially if recurrent/significant bleeds. \\n \\n8.5 Management of major placental abruption \\n \\nThe specific treatment for placental abruption causing major haemorrhage is rapid birth after \\nadequate maternal resuscitation. \\n \\nï· If the fetus is alive and viable, caesarean birth is usually indicated unless a rapid \\nvaginal birth is anticipated. The fetal heart should be carefully and continuously \\nmonitored. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 13 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nï· In cases where the fetus is dead or non-viable, labour should be induced unless \\nthe maternal/birthing parent condition indicates immediate birth by caesarean birth \\n(See CG1120 Intrauterine death including induction for a fetal abnormality). \\nï· Labour generally progresses well after induction. If this does not occur caesarean \\nbirth may be necessary even in the presence of a non-viable or dead fetus. \\nï· Post-delivery a syntocinon infusion (40 international units in 500 mls normal saline \\nat 125 mls per hour) should be commenced and continued for at least 4 hours due \\nto risk of postpartum haemorrhage consider risk of disseminated intravascular \\ncoagulation (DIC). \\nï· Monitor blood pressure closely for underlying pre-eclampsia/ HELLP syndrome. \\n\\n9.0 Vasa praevia \\n \\nVasa praevia is defined as fetal blood loss associated with velamentous insertion of the \\numbilical cord where one of the fetal vessels crosses the membranes between the \\npresenting part of the fetus and the internal os of the uterus. The vessel may be torn when \\nthe membranes rupture and a small amount of fetal bleeding will have a severe effect on the \\nfetus causing bradycardia or death. \\n \\n9.1 Diagnosis \\n \\nIn the antenatal period, in the absence of vaginal bleeding, there is no method to diagnose \\nvasa praevia clinically. It can be accurately diagnosed with transvaginal colour Doppler \\nultrasonography. For cases identified in second trimester, imaging should be repeated in the \\nthird trimester to confirm persistence. Vasa praevia can resolve in up to 15% of cases with \\nadvancing gestation. \\n \\nVasa praevia should not be routinely screened for at the anomaly scan, as it does not fulfil \\nthe criteria for a screening programme. \\n \\nDuring labour, in the absence of vaginal bleeding, vasa praevia can occasionally be \\ndiagnosed clinically by the palpation of fetal vessels in the membrane during vaginal \\nexamination. \\n \\n9.2 Management \\n \\nIn cases of vaginal bleeding, especially associated with membrane rupture and fetal \\ncompromise, delivery should not be delayed to try and diagnose vasa praevia. In these \\ncases, delivery should be by category 1 caesarean birth. \\n \\nIn confirmed cases of vasa praevia at term, timely delivery should be carried out by elective \\ncaesarean birth (CS). Remember use of corticosteroids where elective caesarean birth is \\nplanned before 39 weeks. \\n \\n10.0 Local causes \\n \\nThis is bleeding from the cervix or vagina. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 14 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\nï· Usually due to ectropion or polyps but cervicitis and vaginitis also described. \\nï· Cervical cancer is an uncommon cause of APH, but must be excluded by \\ninspection of the cervix (speculum examination) in all women/people with \\nrecurrent bleeding in pregnancy. If any concerns, refer to senior obstetrician. \\nï· Pregnant women/people with recurrent admissions for persistent bleeding of \\nunknown origin, should be reviewed by an experienced obstetrician and a \\nspeculum examination should be performed to exclude cervical cancer. \\nï· Please see CG21008 Management of high risk maternal medicine conditions \\nsection on âSuspected cervical cancerâ. \\n \\n11.0 APH of unknown origin \\n \\nIn many cases, the cause of bleeding is undetermined as it was assumed that these bleeds \\nare as a result of a minor degree of placental separation, they were commonly known as \\nâmarginal bleedsâ. \\n \\nPregnancies complicated by an unexplained APH are also at increased risk of adverse \\nmaternal perinatal outcomes. Whether or not this is the case, the decision for timing, place \\nand mode of birth should be at consultant level. \\n \\n12.0 Intrapartum haemorrhage \\n \\nIf a woman/person in labour has any vaginal blood loss other than a âshowâ, possible causes \\nof bleeding should be considered: \\n \\nï· Placental abruption. \\nï· Placenta praevia. \\nï· Uterine rupture. \\nï· Vasa praevia. \\n \\nTake a history of the bleeding, asking about: \\n \\nï· Associated symptoms, including pain. \\nï· Specific concerns the woman/person may have. \\nï· Previous uterine surgery. \\nï· Check previous scans for placental position. \\nï· Assess the volume of blood loss and characteristics of the blood, such as colour, \\nand presence of clots or amniotic fluid. \\n \\nObstetrician to review and carry out a physical examination, including: \\n \\nï· Vital signs. \\nï· Abdominal palpation. \\nï· Speculum examination. \\nï· Vaginal examination if placenta praevia has been excluded. \\nï· Fetal heart auscultation and commence CTG if more than 26 weeks. \\nï· Bloods for full blood count, U&Es blood group. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 15 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n\\nA plan of care should be documented following a review by a senior obstetrician and after \\ndiscussion with the pregnant woman/person and their birth partner. The labour ward co-\\nordinator and senior obstetric anaesthetist and paediatrician should be informed of \\nadmission. If stable this should include: \\n \\nï· Establishing venous access. \\nï· Maternal monitoring. \\nï· CTG monitoring. \\n \\nIf a woman/person with intrapartum bleeding has a large blood loss or her condition causes \\nconcern, management should include: \\n \\nï· IV fluids and ensure fluid balance monitoring is performed. \\nï· Fetal monitoring. \\nï· Taking blood for clotting studies and blood gases. \\nï· Cross matching blood. \\nï· Triggering the local major haemorrhage protocol. \\nï· Use of amniotomy or oxytocin. \\nï· Expediting the birth. \\nï· Obstetric consultant support. \\n \\n13.0 Emergency management of acute antepartum & intrapartum \\nhaemorrhage (see appendix 1) \\n \\nThe management will usually be led by the Obstetric Registrar and include the following \\nmeasures: \\n \\nï· Early involvement of anaesthetist if resuscitation required. \\nï· If woman/person unstable call for help: â2222â Obstetric Haemorrhage, (and \\nNeonatal Emergency - if indicated). \\nï· If the woman/person is in a compromised state, rapid assessment and \\nresuscitation should be commenced. In this situation, the woman/person is the \\npriority and should be stabilised prior to establishing the fetal condition. If \\nwoman/person is unstable they should be immediately transferred to theatre for \\nstabilisation. \\nï· Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion should not be delayed because of false \\nreassurance from a single haemoglobin result. \\nï· In a woman/person who is bleeding and is likely to develop a coagulopathy or has \\nevidence of a coagulopathy, it is prudent to give blood components before \\ncoagulation indices deteriorate. This decision should be sanctioned by the \\nconsultant haematologist. \\nï· Regular observations of maternal/birthing parent pulse, blood pressure, \\nrespirations, oxygen saturation and urine output, vaginal blood loss and uterine \\nactivity based on the clinical situation, every 15 minutes or more if acute; every 30 \\nminutes to hourly if more stable. Document these on MEOWS chart and refer if \\nindicated. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 16 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nï· Insert 2 intravenous infusion lines (16 gauge grey cannula) and start IV \\nHartmanns. \\nï· Send a serum group and save and order immediate cross-matching of 4-6 units \\n(depending on clinical picture). \\nï· Request urgent haemoglobin, platelet, clotting studies and U&Eâs. \\nï· Give acid aspiration prophylaxis. \\nï· The paediatric registrar and Special Baby Care Unit should both be informed if \\ndelivery of a compromised or premature baby seems likely. \\nï· CTG should be performed (greater than 26 weeks). \\nï· Ultrasound evaluation of placental site and liquor volume should be performed on \\ndelivery suite if possible by the registrar. If fetal size assessment or a more expert \\nopinion is required this may have to wait until an ultrasonographer or obstetrician \\nwith appropriate skills is available. \\nï· Actively bleeding or unstable women/people should not be moved to the \\nultrasound department. \\nï· Anti D should be given to rhesus negative women/person if delivery not imminent \\n(independent of whether routine antenatal prophylactic Anti D has been given). \\nï· Consider steroids and magnesium sulphate if significant bleed or if bleed \\nprecipitates pre-term labour (see CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway). \\n \\nTocolysis is contraindicated in the presence of a bleed. \\nDiscuss with obstetric consultant. \\n \\n14.0 Management of extremely preterm (24-26 weeks) pregnancy with APH \\n \\nï· Regardless of gestation, the woman/personâs life should take priority. They should \\nbe stabilised and resuscitated before any decision is made regarding birth. \\nï· A senior paediatrician/neonatologist should be involved in the counselling of \\nwomen/people at risk of extremely preterm birth. \\n \\n15.0 Post-delivery management of major APH or intrapartum haemorrhage \\n \\nFollowing a major APH or intrapartum haemorrhage women/people are at an \\nincreased risk of postpartum haemorrhage, DIC (30%), ARDS and renal and liver \\nfailure. \\n \\nï· Prescribe and administer thromboprophylaxis; as there is increased risk of venous \\nthromboembolism as soon as risk of haemorrhage is reduced. \\nï· Consider the most appropriate place for patients to be nursed e.g. delivery suite, \\nCCU. \\nï· Consider CCU if large blood loss or co-morbidities. \\nï· Patients are often anaemic and may require further transfusions. \\nï· Renal function recovery may be slow and should be closely monitored by hourly \\nurine measurement and daily U&Eâs. \\nï· Transfer to postnatal ward should only occur after obstetric review and when \\n4 hourly observations are required. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 17 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\nï· Patients should be seen by their consultant before discharge. A debrief should \\ntake place allowing discussion of events with the woman/person and their partner \\nwith the opportunity to ask questions. \\nï· Offer âBirth Afterthoughtsâ service and 6/52 consultant postnatal appointment for \\nthrombophilia screening and planning of future pregnancies. \\nï· Where the APH has resulted in fetal demise, good communication between the \\nmaternity unit and the woman/personâs general practitioner and community \\nmidwife is crucial. These issues are addressed in RCOG GTG55 Late intrauterine \\nfetal death and stillbirth (2010). It may be appropriate for the consultant to contact \\nthe general practitioner by telephone. \\nï· Management of a major APH should be included in obstetric skills drills. \\n\\nCG12004 Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline v4.2 Jan 2023 Page 18 of 20 \\nPlease check on the intranet that this printout is the most version of this document before use. \\n \\n16.0 Audit \\n \\nSuggested auditable standards (RCOG): \\n \\nï· Evidence of consultant attendance at all CS for placenta praevia. \\n \\nï· Evidence that women/people with APH and less than 34+6 weeks gestation \\nreceive corticosteroids. \\n \\nï· Documented management plan by consultant obstetrician if placenta praevia or \\nplacenta accreta suspected or confirmed. \\n\\nReferences \\n \\nConfidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health.
