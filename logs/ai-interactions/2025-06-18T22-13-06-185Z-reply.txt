Key actions include: - **Prevention:** Identify risk factors for falls and implement preventive measures. - **Post-fall management:** - Check baby’s stability, perform observations, and inform the neonatal team. - Document details (location, height, impact surface, baby’s condition). - Notify the safeguarding midwife and monitor for ≥24 hours. - Admit to SCBU/pediatric ward if skull injury or neurological concerns arise. - **Documentation:** Complete DATIX, baby falls proforma, body map, and update medical records. Include maternal/baby history, fall circumstances, and examination findings. - **Imaging:** Consider head/spine imaging for GCS <15, ongoing symptoms, or multiple injuries, balancing radiation risks. - **Follow-up:** Provide parents with a head injury card advising symptom monitoring, rest, and avoiding unprescribed painkillers. - **Audit:** Review incidents to improve safety.
