Key recommendations: - **Monitoring & Risk Assessment**: Close monitoring for BMI ≥30, thromboembolism risk assessment, and thromboprophylaxis. - **Labor & Delivery**: - Induction for BMI ≥30; ultrasound recommended for BMI >30. - Active third-stage management; avoid birthing pools for BMI ≥35. - Alert theatre staff if weight >120 kg; use Pat Slide™ for transfers. - Fetal scalp monitoring for accurate assessment. - **Cesarean Section (CS)**: Suturing subcutaneous tissue; PICO dressings for BMI ≥35. - **High-Risk BMI (≥40)**: Inform senior obstetrician and anesthetist; establish venous access, restrict oral intake. - **Postnatal Care**: Provide necessary equipment, encourage weight management programs (WBIP), and refer to Healthy Eating Services. - **Staff Training**: Ensure proper training and manual handling equipment (e.g., for patients up to 50 stone). Complications should be managed proactively with multidisciplinary involvement",
