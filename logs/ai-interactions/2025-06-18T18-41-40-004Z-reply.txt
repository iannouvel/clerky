After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless new concerns arise (random glucose ≥7mmol/L requires discussion). - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Urgent referral if glucose >11.0mmol/L or fasting ≥5.6mmol/L. For fasting <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise changes first. - **Corticosteroid use**: Monitor glucose closely; may require hospitalization for insulin adjustment and IV fluids. - **Labor/delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Postpartum, adjust insulin doses and monitor glucose. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Diabetic emergencies**: Require immediate intervention. - **Monitoring**: 20-week ultrasound/fetal heart exam; self-monitor glucose. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidance, prioritizing GDM patients. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure adherence to care standards",
