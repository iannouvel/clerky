Key recommendations: - **Responsibilities:** Midwives/obstetricians must follow the protocol; management ensures regular reviews. - **Principles:** Develop flexible pathways to engage women/people not accessing care, with individualized care plans. - **Guidelines:** Identify vulnerable groups, refer to multidisciplinary teams, and ensure active follow-up for missed appointments. - **Follow-up Process:** Detailed steps for community/hospital antenatal clinics and missed scans (ultrasonographer alerts clinic lead midwife). - **Three Missed Appointments:** Triggers escalation to team leader with audit documentation. Vulnerable groups require prioritized follow-up, and all actions must be recorded in maternal notes/audits. References highlight maternal mortality risks from non-attendance",
