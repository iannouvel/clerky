She reports vomiting 15-20 times daily, unable to keep down solid food for 2 weeks, and has lost 6kg since pregnancy confirmation. She also noticed vaginal spotting for 3 days, initially light pink but now brown discharge. Her symptoms seem disproportionately severe for gestational age. Last menstrual period was 13 weeks ago, home pregnancy tests have been consistently strongly positive. No previous pregnancies, conceived naturally after 4 months of trying. Family history includes thyroid disease (maternal). She appears significantly dehydrated and has been unable to work for 1 week due to severity of symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell, with obvious weight loss. Vital signs: BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Weight 52kg (down from 58kg at GP booking). Thyrotoxic signs present: mild tremor, warm skin, tachycardia. Abdominal examination reveals uterine size larger than expected for dates (approximately 16-week size). Speculum shows brown discharge from cervical os, no active bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance with multiple cystic spaces throughout uterine cavity, no fetal pole visible. Quantitative β-hCG markedly elevated at 186,000 mIU/mL (much higher than expected for gestational age). Thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH <0.1 mU/L, elevated free T4 28 pmol/L indicating gestational thyrotoxicosis. Chest X-ray clear, no evidence of pulmonary metastases.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole requiring urgent evacuation. Pre-operative investigations including FBC, coagulation screen, cross-match for 2 units blood. Surgical evacuation arranged urgently via suction curettage under general anesthetic. IV fluid resuscitation commenced. Antiemetics for symptom control. Propranolol considered for thyrotoxicosis symptoms. Post-evacuation histology confirmation and registration with regional trophoblastic screening center mandatory. Serial β-hCG monitoring weekly until negative then monthly for 6 months. Reliable contraception essential during follow-up period. Patient counseled regarding excellent prognosis with appropriate follow-up and monitoring.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] gp004-diagnosis-and-management-of-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-gtd-pdf\nTitle: GP004 Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)\nContent: Diagnosis and \nmanagement Of \nGestational \nTrophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n\nGynaecology Protocol: GP004 \nDate agreed: April 2019 \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 2 of 9 \n\nGuideline Reviewer: Tasneem Singhal \nVersion: 1 \nApproval Committee: Women’s Services Safety and Quality Committee \nDate agreed: April 2019 \nReview date: March 2022 \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 3 of 9 \nTable of Contents \nKey Principles ........................................................................................................................ 4 \nScope ................................................................................................................................... 4 \nResponsibilities ..................................................................................................................... 4 \n1 Introduction ................................................................................................................ 5 \n1.1 Clinical Features ............................................................................................................ 5 \n1.2 Rare presentations include ............................................................................................ 5 \n1.3 Very rare ........................................................................................................................ 5 \n2 Ultrasound examination .............................................................................................. 5 \n3 Complete Moles .......................................................................................................... 5 \n4 Partial Moles ............................................................................................................... 5 \n5 Histology ..................................................................................................................... 6 \n6 Evacuation of molar pregnancy ................................................................................... 6 \n7 Follow up .................................................................................................................... 7 \n8 Future Pregnancy and contraceptive advice ................................................................. 7 \n9 Future pregnancies ...................................................................................................... 8 \n10 Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) .................................................................. 8 \n11 Twin pregnancy ........................................................................................................... 8 \n12 Reference .................................................................................................................... 9 \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 4 of 9 \nKey Principles \n \nThese guidelines and algorithms are aimed to assist in decision making. They are not designed \nto be prescriptive and you are not expected to use them in exclusion of discussions with \nsenior colleagues. \n \nEvidence used to inform these guidelines had been drawn from national/RCOG guidelines. \nWhere applicable other references are quoted. \n \nThese guidelines have been reviewed by all clinicians involved in early pregnancy care, \nincluding consultants, trainees and specialist and senior nursing staff. \n \nA protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. \nProfessional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol. \n \nScope \n \nThese guidelines apply to women who have a confirmed diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy. \n \nResponsibilities \n \nNurses, Midwives & Gynaecologists & Obstetricians: \n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \n To use their professional judgement in application of this guidance \n \nManagement Team \n To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations \n To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \n To ensure protocols are available to service users on request \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 5 of 9 \n1 Introduction \n \nGestational Trophblastic disease (GTD) is a term used for a group of pregnancy-related \ntumours characterized by proliferation of trophoblastic tissue. \nThis Term covers a broad spectrum of disorders from the pre-malignant complete and partial \nmolar pregnancy to the malignant conditions of invasive mole, choriocarcinoma and the very \nrare placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT). \nGTD is a rare condition with an incidence of 1/714 live birth and a high cure rate (98-100%) \n \n1.1 Clinical Features \nThe classic features of molar pregnancy are \n Irregular uterine bleeding \n Hyperemesis \n Early pregnancy failure \n Excessive uterine enlargement \n1.2 Rare presentations include \n Hyperthyroidism \n Early onset pre-eclampsia \n Abdominal distension \n1.3 Very rare \n Acute respiratory failure \n Neurological symptoms such as seizures \n \n2 Ultrasound examination \nIt is helpful in making a pre-evacuation diagnosis but the definitive diagnosis is made by \nhistological examination of the products of conception. \n \n3 Complete Moles \nComplete moles are diploid and androgenic in origin, with no evidence of fetal tissue. \nComplete moles, usually (75–80%) arise as a consequence of duplication of a single sperm \nfollowing fertilisation of an ‘empty’ ovum. Some complete moles (20–25%) can arise after \ndispermic fertilisation of an ‘empty’ ovum. \nThe majority of histologically proven complete moles are associated with an ultrasound \ndiagnosis of delayed miscarriage or an anembryonic pregnancy. \n \n4 Partial Moles \n \nPartial moles are usually (90%) triploid in origin, with two sets of paternal haploid genes and \none set of maternal haploid genes. Partial moles occur, in almost all cases, following \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 6 of 9 \ndispermic fertilisation of an ovum. Ten percent of partial moles represent tetraploid or \nmosaic conceptions. In a partial mole, there is usually evidence of a fetus or fetal red blood \ncells. \n \nThe diagnosis may only be made in 35-40% of cases of partial moles on ultrasound before 14 \nweeks. \n \n5 Histology \n \n5.1 For the above reasons, the histological assessment of material obtained from \nthe medical or surgical management of all failed pregnancies is recommended to \nexclude trophoblastic disease. \n5.2 As persistent trophoblastic neoplasia may develop after any pregnancy, it is \nrecommended that products of conception, obtained after all repeat \nevacuations, should also undergo histological examination with consent as per \nP1 form. \n5.3 The consenting practitioner should complete a P1 form (histological assessment \nof Products of conception) prior to the medical or surgical management of \nmiscarriage, and ALWAYS tick the box – for histological examination. \n5.4 Urinary pregnancy test should be performed 3 weeks after medical or \nconservative management of failed pregnancy if products of conception are not \nobtained. \n \n6 Evacuation of molar pregnancy \n6.1 Suction curettage (surgical management) is the method of choice of evacuation \nfor complete molar pregnancies and partial molar pregnancies except when size \nof foetal parts deters the use of suction curettage and then medical evacuation \nmay be used. The procedure should be performed at The PRH site and not \nLewes Victoria when a molar pregnancy is suspected on ultrasound. \n6.2 Preparation of the cervix immediately prior to evacuation is safe. Prolonged \ncervical preparation should be avoided to reduce the risk of embolization of \ntrophoblastic cells. \n6.3 Surgery of known molar pregnancies should be performed in main theatres or \nDSU at PRH after discussion with Consultant. \n6.4 The routine use of oxytocic infusion prior to completion of the evacuation is not \nadvised. \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 9 \n6.5 Oxytocic agents may be used to control life–threatening heavy bleeding. \n6.6 Anti-D prophylaxis is advised after evacuation of a partial molar pregnancy if the \nWomens Rh Negative. \n6.7 Anti-D prophylaxis is not required after the evacuation of a complete molar \npregnancy as long as the diagnosis is confirmed. \n \n7 Follow up \n7.1 All women diagnosed with GTD on histology are informed about their diagnosis \nby the EPU nurse and given a leaflet to explain the condition. \n7.2 Women are then referred to Charing Cross Hospital by the EPU nurse. \n7.3 Referral may be done by paper forms, via email or on-line. \n7.4 Charing Cross hospital will follow them up directly for urine HCG results. \n7.5 The importance of compliance with follow up testing must be emphasised to the \nwoman. \n7.6 Advice from Charing Cross Hospital to the women and referring clinicians can be \naccessed via \n \nhttp://hmole-chorio.org.uk/clinicians_info_registration.html \n \n8 Future Pregnancy and contraceptive advice \n8.1 Women should be advised not to conceive until their follow-up is complete. \n8.2 Women who undergo chemotherapy are advised not to conceive for 1 year after \ncompletion of treatment. \n8.3 She should be advised to use barrier methods of contraception until hCG levels \nrevert to normal. \n8.4 There is no evidence as to whether single-agent progestogens have any effect \non GTD. \n8.5 If oral contraception has been started before the diagnosis of GTD was made, \nthe woman can be advised to remain on oral contraception but she should be \nadvised that there is a potential but low increased risk of developing GTD. \n8.6 Intrauterine contraceptive devices should not be used until hCG levels are \nnormal. \n8.7 Offer viability scan at 7/40 for future pregnancy \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 9 \n8.8 Advice patient to notify midwife of previous molar pregnancy in future \npregnancy \n8.9 Offer viability scan at 7/40 for future pregnancy \n8.10 Advice patient to notify midwife of previous molar pregnancy in future \npregnancy \n9 Future pregnancies \n9.1 The risk of a further molar pregnancy is low (1/80) \n9.2 More than 98% of women who become pregnant following a molar pregnancy \nwill not have a further molar pregnancy nor are they at increased risk of \nobstetric complications. \n9.3 Following a molar pregnancy any future pregnancy event should be monitored \nfor recurrence by repeating the hCG values 6-8 weeks following the completion \nof pregnancy. \n9.4 Women should be advised to contact the treatment centre as soon as possible \nfor follow up arrangements. \n10 Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) \n \nIf there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, most commonly defined as a persistent \nelevation of beta humanchorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG), the condition is referred to as \ngestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). \nAny woman who develops persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event is at risk of \nhaving GTN. A urine pregnancy test should be offered and performed in all cases of \npersistent or irregular vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event (molar or non-molar) and \nβhCG levels evaluated. \n \n11 Twin Pregnancy \n11.1 If there is a doubt about a combined molar pregnancy with a viable twin \npregnancy – seek advice from the regional Fetal medicine Centre. \n11.2 In the situation of a twin pregnancy where there is one viable fetus and the \nother pregnancy is molar, the woman should be counselled about the increased \nrisk of perinatal morbidity and outcome for GTN \n11.3 Consider offering prenatal invasive testing for fetal karyotype in such cases. \nPrenatal invasive testing for fetal karyotype should be considered in such cases. \n\nDiagnosis and management GP004 \nof Gestational Trophoblastic \nDiseases (GTD) \n \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 9 of 9 \n12 Reference \n \n1 – The Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease. \nGreen–top Guideline No. 38 February 2010 \nhttps://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg_38.pdf.",

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a P1 form (histological assessment of Products of conception) was completed prior to surgical evacuation, as this is mandatory per the guideline.  
   Reason: Guideline section 5.3 states this is required for all evacuations to exclude trophoblastic disease.  

2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the surgical evacuation is performed at the PRH site (not Lewes Victoria) as specified in the guideline.  
   Reason: Guideline section 6.1 specifies the procedure location for suspected molar pregnancies.  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly document counseling about the prohibition of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) until hCG normalizes and the preference for barrier methods.  
   Reason: Guideline section 8.3 and 8.6 emphasize this contraceptive advice.  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether Anti-D prophylaxis was given (though not required for confirmed complete mole, per guideline section 6.7).  
   Reason: Guideline section 6.6-6.7 clarifies Anti-D requirements based on mole type.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Include specific counseling about the 1/80 risk of recurrent molar pregnancy and the need for early viability scans in future pregnancies.  
   Reason: Guideline sections 9.1 and 8.7 highlight these points for patient awareness.  

3. **Different management plan** - Avoid oxytocic infusion prior to evacuation completion unless life-threatening bleeding occurs.  
   Reason: Guideline section 6.4 advises against routine use of oxytocics.  

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Note whether the EPU nurse provided the GTD leaflet and confirmed referral to Charing Cross Hospital.  
   Reason: Guideline section 7.1-7.2 outlines post-diagnosis communication steps.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Mention the option to continue oral contraception if already started (with caveats).  
   Reason: Guideline section 8.5 addresses this scenario.  

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting whether cervical preparation was used immediately prior to evacuation (though not critical if prolonged preparation was avoided).  
   Reason: Guideline section 6.2 mentions this as safe but not mandatory.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Reiterate the excellent prognosis (98-100% cure rate) during counseling, though this is already implied in the note.  
   Reason: Guideline introduction cites this statistic for reassurance.  

### Key Strengths of the Current Note:
- Aligns well with guideline recommendations for urgent evacuation, serial β-hCG monitoring, and thyrotoxicosis management.  
- Clearly documents critical features (e.g., ultrasound findings, β-hCG levels, thyroid dysfunction).  
- Mentions mandatory registration with a trophoblastic screening center.  

The note is largely compliant but would benefit from explicit documentation of the P1 form, procedural location, and contraceptive counseling to fully adhere to the guideline.
