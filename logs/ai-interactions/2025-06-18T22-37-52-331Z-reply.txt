Management requires obstetric-led care, with triplet pregnancies referred directly to fetal medicine. - **Chorionicity**: Ultrasound determines chorionicity/amnionicity (DCDA, MCDA, MCMA), guiding risk stratification and monitoring. - **Antenatal Care**: - Twin pregnancies: Consultant-led care with frequent scans (growth/anomaly) based on chorionicity. - Triplet pregnancies: Managed by fetal medicine team with regular scans. - Discuss risks (preterm labor, interventions) and birth plan early. - **Delivery Planning**: - Active management of third stage (oxytocin) recommended; avoid physiological management. - Continuous CTG monitoring ≥26 weeks; ultrasound on labor onset to confirm fetal positions. - Senior obstetrician involvement for preterm labor (23–25+6 weeks). - **Intrapartum Management**: - Twin I: Midwife-led if cephalic; Twin II requires obstetrician for position assessment (external/internal version if needed). - Aim for ≤45-minute interval between twins; cesarean if vaginal delivery not imminent for compromised twin. - Neonatal team must attend all twin deliveries. - **Staff Requirements**: Middle-grade/consultant obstetrician present; experienced midwives may lead uncomplicated term deliveries. - **Postnatal/Prep**: Discuss PPH risk, steroids for lung maturation, and postnatal support. Weekly reviews if delivery declines. (Word count: 200)",
