Smith, OB/GYN  Patient: Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  Age: 44  Weight: 121 kg | BMI: 44  Gravida: 4 | Para: 3 (Previous deliveries: 2 vaginal, 1 cesarean)  ---### History of Presenting Complaint  Ms. Doe presents with two primary concerns:  1. Recurrent Pelvic Pain: Intermittent, sharp left-sided pelvic pain for 6 months, worsening during menstruation and intercourse. No associated bleeding or urinary symptoms.  2. Secondary Infertility: Unable to conceive for 2 years despite regular unprotected intercourse. She previously conceived without intervention.  ### Past Medical/Surgical History  - Medical: Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 5 years ago, on metformin), hypertension.  - Surgical: Cesarean section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018).  - Gynaecological: History of ovarian cysts (resolved, no surgery), heavy menstrual bleeding (treated with tranexamic acid PRN).  ### Drug History & Allergies  - Medications: Metformin 500 mg BD, lisinopril 10 mg OD, tranexamic acid during menses.  - Allergies: None known.  ### Social History  - Occupation: Office manager (sedentary role).  - Lifestyle: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  - Family Planning: Desires pregnancy but concerned about age/weight impacting fertility.  ### Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, Expectations  - Ideas: Worried pain may be \"fibroids or cysts\" affecting fertility.  - Concerns: Anxious about surgical intervention due to BMI; fears IVF may be her only option.  - Expectations: Requests \"a scan to check everything\" and lifestyle advice to improve chances of conception.  ---### Examination Findings  - General: Obese (BMI 44), acanthosis nigricans noted (consistent with insulin resistance).  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender; old Pfannenstiel scar well-healed.  - Pelvic Exam:    - Speculum: Cervix appears normal; no discharge/lesions.    - Bimanual: Uterus enlarged (~12-week size), irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids); left adnexal tenderness (no palpable mass).  ---### Assessment & Management Plan  #### 1. Recurrent Pelvic Pain & Suspected Fibroids  - Investigations:    - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess fibroid burden/adnexae.    - HbA1c (poorly controlled diabetes may exacerbate symptoms).  - Management:    - If fibroids confirmed: Discuss options (medical vs. surgical—myomectomy/hysterectomy).    - Weight loss counseling (BMI 44 increases surgical risks; refer to dietitian).  #### 2. Secondary Infertility  - Investigations:    - Day 3 FSH/AMH (ovarian reserve assessment).    - Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to rule out tubal blockage (given prior cesarean).  - Management:    - Optimize metabolic health (tight glycemic control, weight loss).    - Refer to reproductive endocrinology if tests suggest diminished reserve.  #### Patient Counseling  - Risks: Highlight increased miscarriage risk (age/BMI) and potential complications in pregnancy (e.g., gestational diabetes).  - Next Steps: Schedule TVUS/HSG; follow-up in 4 weeks to discuss results.
