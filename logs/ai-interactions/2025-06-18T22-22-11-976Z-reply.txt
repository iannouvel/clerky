Rule out differentials (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis). - **Severity Classification**: Mild, moderate, severe, or critical; assess and document severity. Report OHSS-related deaths to maternal death enquiries. - **Management**: - **Outpatient**: Mild/moderate cases with monitoring and symptom control (pain relief, antiemetics). - **Inpatient**: Severe/critical cases or uncontrolled moderate cases require hospitalization (IV rehydration, fluid balance monitoring, paracentesis if needed). - **Key Actions**: Early consultant involvement, IV therapy, pain/nausea management, emotional support, and clear discharge advice with follow-up. - **Discharge**: Provide patient information, contact details, and ensure primary clinician notification. *(Based on RCOG Green-top guideline, 2006.)*",
