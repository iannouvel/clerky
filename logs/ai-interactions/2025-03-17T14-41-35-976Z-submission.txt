Clinical transcript:
Current time: 17 minutes (odd - obstetric scenario)

Clinician: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. I am Dr. Smith, your obstetrician. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Good morning, doctor. I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit concerned lately.

Clinician: I understand. Can you please start by telling me your age and weight?

Patient: I am 32 years old and weigh 70 kg, with a BMI of 25.5.

Clinician: Thank you. What seems to be the main issue bringing you in today?

Patient: I&#x27;ve been experiencing severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.

Clinician: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: It started about a week ago, and it has been quite intense.

Clinician: Have you had any previous pregnancies or gynecological issues?

Patient: Yes, I have had two previous pregnancies, both ending in miscarriages.

Clinician: I see. Have you had any surgeries in the past, or do you take any medications regularly?

Patient: I had a cesarean section during my last pregnancy, and I&#x27;m currently not taking any medications.

Clinician: Thank you for that information. Can you also tell me about your occupation and any allergies you may have?

Patient: I work as a teacher, and I&#x27;m not allergic to any medications.

Clinician: I appreciate that. What are your thoughts or concerns about your current symptoms?

Patient: I&#x27;m worried that this might be related to another miscarriage.

Clinician: I understand your concerns. Let&#x27;s proceed with an examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms.

(Examination findings: Abdominal tenderness and vaginal bleeding)

Clinician: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, it appears that you may be experiencing a threatened miscarriage. I recommend bed rest and close monitoring of your symptoms. We will also conduct further tests to assess the viability of the pregnancy.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your guidance.

Clinician: You&#x27;re welcome. Please follow up with me in a week for a reevaluation. If you experience worsening symptoms, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact us immediately.

Patient: I will do that. Thank you for your help, doctor.

Clinician: Take care, Mrs. Johnson. We are here to support you through this.
