Key steps include: - **Eligibility:** Reviews apply to late fetal losses, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and post-neonatal deaths. - **Multidisciplinary Review:** A systematic MDT review (including relevant professionals) must occur within 72 hours to determine causes and improve future care. - **Communication:** Ensure accessible support (BSL interpreters, text services, translation for non-English speakers) and maintain duty of candor with families. - **Documentation:** Medical records must be securely saved promptly; cases meeting PMRT criteria are classified as serious incidents. - **Family Involvement:** Provide feedback opportunities, share the PMRT report face-to-face, and offer ongoing support contacts. - **Reporting:** Notify MBRRACE-UK; external reviewers may be included. Staff involved should receive debriefs/support. - **Monitoring:** Quarterly audits ensure compliance with NHS Resolution Safety Action 10. - **Delays:** Families must be informed of any delays in review completion. Families are encouraged to share their care experiences, and findings are communicated via a consultant meeting or written/phone follow-up. Support resources are provided",
