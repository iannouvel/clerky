    "response": "Age: Not provided\nParity: Not provided\nPrevious deliveries: Not provided\nGestation: Not applicable\nBMI: Not provided\nRhesus Status: Not provided\n\nPatient presents with persistent pelvic pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, and discomfort during intercourse. Symptoms suggestive of chronic pelvic pain, warranting further evaluation as per GTG 2012 - Initial Mx of Chronic Pelvic Pain.\n\nFurther information needed: Patient's age, parity, previous deliveries, BMI, and Rhesus status for comprehensive assessment.\n\nProposed management:\n1. Evaluate for endometriosis per NICE guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management.\n2. Consider ovarian mass per joint RCOG and BSGE guideline on suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women.\n3. Investigate irregular vaginal bleeding for endometrial thickening as per SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 451.\n4. Perform pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound as recommended in the guideline on the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy.\n5. Consider blood tests for hormonal imbalances or relevant markers.\n\nBenefits of the proposed approach:\n1. Comprehensive evaluation for potential causes of pelvic pain and irregular bleeding.\n2. Early detection and management of conditions like endometriosis and ovarian masses.\n3. Tailored investigations based on clinical presentation for accurate diagnosis.\n\nRisks of the proposed approach:\n1. Invasive procedures like ultrasound may carry minimal risks of discomfort or infection.\n2. Blood tests may have minor risks of bruising or infection at the site of blood draw.\n\nAlternative approaches:\n1. Symptomatic management with analgesics for pelvic pain without investigating underlying causes.\n2. Observation without further investigations, potentially delaying diagnosis and appropriate management.\n3. Referral to a specialist for a second opinion or further evaluation if needed."
