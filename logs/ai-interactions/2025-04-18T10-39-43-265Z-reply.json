ECV should be performed by an experienced clinician, with ultrasound and cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring before and after the procedure. Women should be counseled on the risks (e.g., placental abruption, cord accident) and success rates (~50%). If ECV is unsuccessful or declined, a planned cesarean section is recommended for nulliparous women due to higher risks of vaginal breech delivery.\"*  \n\n2. **UHSussex - MP046 - Management of Breech and ECV**  \n   - *\"ECV should be attempted after 36+0 weeks in nulliparous women, with prior ultrasound confirmation of presentation. Contraindications include placenta praevia, fetal growth restriction, or ruptured membranes. Cervical assessment is not routinely required before ECV unless labor is suspected. Women should receive written information on ECV and breech vaginal delivery risks. Follow-up ultrasound should be arranged post-ECV to confirm fetal position.\"*  \n\n3. **UHSussex - MP019 - Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy**  \n   - *\"Women with pre-existing hypertension should have blood pressure monitored closely in pregnancy (at least every 2-4 weeks). Antihypertensive therapy should be adjusted if needed to maintain BP <140/90 mmHg. Pre-eclampsia screening (urine protein, blood tests) should be performed at each visit if risk factors are present.\"*  \n\n4. **GTG 2016 - Epilepsy in Pregnancy**  \n   - *Not applicable to this case (no epilepsy history).*  \n\n---\n\n### **HTML-Formatted Clinical Note with Adjustments:**\n\n```html\n<p>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> <br>\n  - Age: 50 <br>\n  - BMI: 28.8 <br>\n  - Gravida 1, Para 0 (currently pregnant, no prior deliveries) <br>\n  - Presenting complaint: Breech presentation at 36 weeks gestation <br>\n  - No significant pain, contractions, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage <br>\n  - Concerns about delivery risks and interest in ECV <br>\n  - PMH: Hypertension (controlled), hypothyroidism <br>\n  - No gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia <i>(UHSussex - MP019: Document BP monitoring frequency and antihypertensive adjustments if applicable)</i> <br><br>\n\n  <strong>Details:</strong> <br>\n  - Breech presentation first noted at 34-week scan, with no prior ECV attempted. <br>\n  - Fetal movements normal, no signs of fetal compromise. <br>\n  - Patient anxious about ECV discomfort and seeks clarity on delivery options. <br>\n  - Examination findings: Fundal height consistent with dates, breech palpable, fetal heart rate normal (140 bpm). <br>\n  - Cervical status not yet assessed <i>(UHSussex - MP046: Cervical assessment unnecessary unless labor suspected)</i>. <br>\n  - ECV counseling includes success rates (~50%) and risks (e.g., transient fetal bradycardia) <i>(BJOG - 2017: Include risks like placental abruption/cord accident)</i>. <br>\n  - Vaginal delivery possible if ECV successful; elective caesarean recommended if ECV unsuccessful or declined (given nulliparity and maternal age) <i>(BJOG - 2017: Planned cesarean strongly advised for nulliparous women if ECV fails)</i>. <br><br>\n\n  <strong>Plan:</strong> <br>\n  1.
