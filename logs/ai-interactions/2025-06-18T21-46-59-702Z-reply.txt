      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Indication for Induction:** Advised between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce stillbirth risk, particularly for Black/Asian women and those in deprived areas. - **Membrane Sweep:** Offer at 38 and 39 weeks to promote spontaneous labor. - **Methods of Induction:** Include membrane sweep, cervical balloon catheter, dinoprostone, artificial rupture of membranes (ARM), and oxytocin infusion. - **Contraindications:** Avoid routine induction in cases of precipitate labor, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Check maternal/fetal wellbeing, confirm gestation, and assess cervix using Bishop Score. - **Special Populations:** Women with BMI ≥30 should discuss induction by 40 weeks; GBS-positive individuals may require oxytocin infusion. - **Monitoring:** Continuous CTG during induction; watch for uterine hyperstimulation (manage with terbutaline if needed). - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24–48 hours; options include further attempts or cesarean. - **Pre-Labor Rupture of Membranes (PROM):** Offer induction after 24 hours of expectant management; monitor for infection. - **Oxytocin Use:** Titrate infusion to achieve adequate contractions; follow protocols for dilution and administration. - **Complications:** Suspect uterine rupture if hyperstimulation occurs; emergency cesarean may be needed. - **Documentation:** Record all procedures, consent, and fetal/maternal observations. *Key Points:* Individualize counseling on risks/benefits; prioritize maternal autonomy in decision-making",
