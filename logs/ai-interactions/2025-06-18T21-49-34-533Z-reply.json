Assess feeding in the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes to avoid teat confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, ready-made formula for medical needs, and clear instructions on preparation. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, and safe sleeping practices (cot by bed, avoid sofa co-sleeping). - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments; refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training; compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Supplementation:** Limit formula use; if medically needed, offer small amounts via cup/tube while encouraging continued breastfeeding. Emphasis is on individualized care, parental partnership, and maintaining breastmilk supply. Outcomes are monitored through BFI audits\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
