This analysis focuses on identifying areas where the clinical documentation can be improved according to the specific guideline requirements.\n\nGuideline: Management of Unscheduled Bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nBMS GUIDELINE: Management of unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\nKey Messages:\n- Assess women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT\n- Identify endometrial cancer risk factors in women taking HRT\n- Determine when to investigate unscheduled bleeding on HRT\n- Understand how unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be investigated\n- Adjust HRT to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes\n\nUnscheduled bleeding on HRT:\n- Assess cancer risk factors and bleeding pattern\n- Identify HRT regimen, duration, compliance\n- Offer examination\n- Offer investigations if indicated\n- Offer ultrasound if necessary\n\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer:\n- Major and minor risk factors identified\n- Recommendations for adjusting HRT based on risk factors\n\nOptimizing HRT:\n- Endometrial assessment if bleeding continues after 6 months\n- Offer urgent referral if necessary\n- Adjust HRT regimen as needed\n\nIntroduction:\n- Definition of unscheduled bleeding on HRT\n- Increase in HRT prescriptions and referrals for endometrial cancer assessment\n- Purpose of the guideline to provide recommendations for managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT\n\nMethodology:\n- Expert review panel established to develop evidence-led recommendations\n- Recommendations based on expert opinion and consensus review\n- Guideline to be updated as new evidence becomes available\n- Focus on efficient resource utilization for management of unscheduled bleeding on HRT.\n\nSuggested topics for audit are included. Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nWhen women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).\n\nHistory should include details on the last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed, bleeding pattern before starting HRT, pelvic pain, discharge, vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, bleeding pattern on HRT, HRT use details, application, contraceptive usage, pregnancy risk, cervical screening history, sexual history, drug interactions, malabsorption syndromes, and endometrial cancer risk factors.\n\nExamination and initial investigations should include abdominal assessment, vulvo-vaginal assessment, cervical appearance assessment, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, pregnancy test, and BMI assessment.\n\nThe document outlines major and minor risk factors affecting endometrial cancer risk in women taking HRT, as well as risk factors independent of HRT use. It also discusses the effect of HRT preparation on endometrial cancer risk and provides recommendations for different HRT regimens.\n\nContinuous combined HRT with daily progestogen is recommended for endometrial protection. Sequential/cyclical HRT should be considered in women over 50 with no unscheduled bleeding. Tricycling progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\n\nUnopposed estrogen use in people with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Different progestogen types can provide endometrial protection, with specific recommendations for each type. The use of a levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device is also discussed for endometrial protection.\n\nIt is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about the limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium if unscheduled bleeding occurs. A change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered if new unscheduled bleeding develops at 4 years of use. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. Normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT should be understood. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is important. Clinical pathways for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed based on risk factors and time-frames.\n\nConservative management strategies can be offered for unscheduled bleeding in women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer. Adjustments to HRT can be made if bleeding persists after changes in dose or preparation. Referral for ultrasound is recommended for certain criteria, and HRT can be continued during assessment. Recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options are provided based on ultrasound findings. Endometrial assessment is also recommended for asymptomatic women with a thickened endometrium on TVS. Blind outpatient endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling are options for further assessment.\n\nMenopausal women with unscheduled bleeding may benefit from adjustments in progestogen and hysteroscopic assessment. Recommendations include reassurance and progestogen adjustments after a normal biopsy, urgent hysteroscopy for thickened endometrial tissue, and referral to gynaecology oncology for hyperplasia or cancer. Adjustments in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and non-hormonal alternatives should be considered based on endometrial histology. Progestogen type and route of HRT can impact bleeding profiles, with options such as the Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD) and transdermal preparations showing potential benefits. Recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, considering low dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial in reducing unscheduled bleeding episodes.\n\nCounsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding in perimenopausal women with sequential preparations. Consider timing and offering desogestrel or combined oral contraceptives. Adjust progestogen dose or type as needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists.\n\nStute P, Neulen J, Wildt L.
