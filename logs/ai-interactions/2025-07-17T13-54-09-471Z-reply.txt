Given this patient's risk factors and current presentation, this more structured follow-up plan is indicated if hyperplasia is confirmed to monitor for regression and prevent progression.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: explicit documentation of WHO classification system application for any biopsy results\" with \"Document biopsy results using WHO classification system (hyperplasia with/without atypia) when available\" (Reason: The guideline specifies: 'The 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia.' This classification is critical for determining appropriate management and should be explicitly documented in the patient record when biopsy results are available.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Start norethisterone 5mg TDS for 21/7 (to regulate bleeding)\" with \"If biopsy shows hyperplasia without atypia, consider switching from oral norethisterone to LNG-IUS as primary treatment\" (Reason: The guideline recommends: 'The first-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens.' While norethisterone is appropriate for acute bleeding control, long-term management should follow guideline recommendations if hyperplasia is confirmed.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Gap: no documented discussion of weight loss as management strategy\" with \"Add recommendation for weight loss counseling given obesity as a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia\" (Reason: The guideline emphasizes: 'Weight loss and hormone therapy should be reviewed' for managing endometrial hyperplasia. This patient's BMI of 32 significantly increases her risk and weight loss should be incorporated as part of the management plan to address this modifiable risk factor.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"If biopsy shows hyperplasia → consider progestogens/hysterectomy (if completed family)\" with \"If biopsy shows atypical hyperplasia → recommend total hysterectomy (given patient has completed family)\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'Total hysterectomy is advised for women with atypical hyperplasia to reduce the risk of underlying malignancy or cancer progression.' As this patient is G4P2 and has completed her family, this would be the recommended management for atypical hyperplasia per guidelines.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

### **SITUATION:**  
**Patient Demographics:**  
- **Name:** Ms. X (DOB: 15/05/1985, 39yo)  
- **Gestation:** N/A (G4P2, previous SVD x2, LSCS x1)  
- **Presenting Complaint:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) – heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) for 3/12, worsening over last 2/52.  
- **Key Clinical Issue:** Persistent AUB with associated fatigue (likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia). No hemodynamic instability at present.  

### **BACKGROUND:**  
**Relevant PMHx:**  
- **OBGYN Hx:**  
  - G4P2 (2x SVD, 1x LSCS for FTP, 1x TOP)  
  - Previous IUD (Mirena®) removed 6/12 ago due to expulsion  
  - No known fibroids or endometriosis  
- **Medical Hx:**  
  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD)  
  - Obesity (BMI 32)  
  - No known coagulopathy  
- **Surgical Hx:**  
  - LSCS (2018)  
  - Appendicectomy (2005)  
- **Medications:**  
  - Levothyroxine 75mcg OD  
  - NSAIDs PRN for dysmenorrhea (no recent use)  
- **Allergies:** NKDA  
- **Social Hx:**  
  - Non-smoker, occasional ETOH  
  - Works as a teacher, moderately active  

**Risk Factors for AUB:**  
- Obesity (↑ endometrial hyperplasia risk)  
- Hypothyroidism (may exacerbate HMB)  
- Previous IUD expulsion (possible structural cause)  

### **ASSESSMENT:**  
**Clinical Findings (0800 hours):**  
- **Vitals:**  
  - BP: 128/78 mmHg  
  - HR: 88 bpm (regular)  
  - Temp: 36.7°C  
  - SpO₂: 98% RA  
  - RR: 14/min  
- **General Exam:**  
  - Pale conjunctivae (clinical anemia)  
  - No signs of hemodynamic compromise  
- **Abdo Exam:**  
  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- **PV Exam (consented & chaperoned):**  
  - No active bleeding at time of exam  
  - Cervix appears normal, no cervical excitation  
  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size  
  - No adnexal masses  

**Investigations:**  
- **Bloods (FBC, LFTs, U&Es, CRP, TFTs, coagulation screen):**  
  - Hb: 98 g/L (↓ from 112 g/L 6/12 ago)  
  - MCV: 78 fL (microcytic)  
  - Ferritin: 12 μg/L (↓)

    - Endometrial thickness: 12mm (heterogeneous)  
    - No fibroids/polyps seen  
    - Normal adnexa  
  - **Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology)**  

**Differential Diagnosis (PALM-COEIN):**  
1. **Polyp/Adenomyosis** (USS inconclusive, biopsy pending)  
2. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (↑ risk due to obesity)  
3. **Coagulopathy** (unlikely given normal coagulation)  
4. **Ovulatory dysfunction** (secondary to hypothyroidism?)  
5. **Iatrogenic** (none identified)  

### **RECOMMENDATION:**  
**Immediate Management:**  
- **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulfate 200mg BD + vitamin C (monitor Hb in 4/52)  
- **Hormonal therapy:**  
  - If biopsy shows hyperplasia without atypia, consider switching from oral norethisterone to LNG-IUS as primary treatment  
  - Recommend LNG-IUS (Mirena®) as first-line treatment if biopsy shows hyperplasia without atypia  
- **Analgesia:** Mefenamic acid 500mg TDS PRN (if dysmenorrhea)  
- **Weight loss counseling** given obesity as a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia  

**Monitoring & Follow-Up:**  
- **Repeat Hb in 4/52** (target >110 g/L)  
- **Await endometrial biopsy results** (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy)  
- **Document biopsy results using WHO classification system (hyperplasia with/without atypia) when available**  
- **Schedule follow-up with endometrial surveillance every 6 months if hyperplasia confirmed, with at least two consecutive negative biopsies before discharge**  

**Further Investigations if Needed:**  
- **Hysteroscopy + biopsy** if USS/biopsy inconclusive  
- **Thyroid antibody testing** if TFTs fluctuate  

**Contingencies:**  
- If hemodynamically unstable → admit for IV iron/transfusion  
- If biopsy shows atypical hyperplasia → recommend total hysterectomy (given patient has completed family)
