Refer to social services. - **Perinatal Care**: Avoid pethidine/diamorphine for opiate-dependent mothers; do not give naloxone. - **Postnatal Care**: Keep mother and baby together. Observe for withdrawal; start scoring and pharmacological treatment if needed. - **Opiate withdrawal**: Start morphine (125 mcg/kg/day) and wean based on NAS scores. - **Non-opiate withdrawal**: Phenobarbitone for alcohol, chlorpromazine for benzodiazepines. - **Discharge Criteria**: Stable NAS scores, normal feeding/sleeping, no morphine dose changes for 36 hours. Ensure social support. - **Follow-up**: Provide parent education, document weaning schedules, and conduct discharge planning. **Substance-Specific Risks**: Includes risks like prematurity (amphetamines, nicotine), placental abruption (cocaine), and withdrawal symptoms (opiates, benzodiazepines). **Monitoring**: Audit antenatal tasks, NAS scoring, and discharge processes",
