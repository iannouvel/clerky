PRIORITIZATION:\n   - List most clinically urgent/important issues first\n   - Consider both immediate and long-term clinical significance\n   - Include only active or relevant historical issues\n\n3. CONSOLIDATION RULES:\n   - Merge symptoms into their underlying condition (e.g., 'Shortness of breath' + 'Anemia' → 'Iron Deficiency Anemia')\n   - Use the most specific diagnostic term (e.g., 'Gestational Hypertension' not 'Elevated BP')\n   - Group related issues under the primary condition (e.g., various diabetic symptoms → 'Gestational Diabetes')\n   - Avoid listing issues that are semantically similar or redundant\n\n4.
