While the clinical appearance is classic, biopsy confirmation is recommended in all suspected cases to establish definitive diagnosis and rule out VIN. This is particularly important given the patient's 6-month history and the small but significant risk of neoplastic change associated with lichen sclerosus.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: STI screening documentation\" with \"Consider STI screening (e.g., for herpes simplex virus) given dyspareunia and vulval symptoms.\" (Reason: The guideline provides 'General Advice for all vulval conditions' including 'Consider STI screening'. While lichen sclerosus is the most likely diagnosis, STI screening should be considered in the initial workup of vulval symptoms, particularly with dyspareunia. This would help exclude concurrent infections that might complicate management.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Patient education: Avoid irritants (soaps, tight clothing).\" with \"Patient education: Comprehensive vulval care advice including avoidance of irritants (soaps, tight clothing), use of emollients as soap substitutes, and cotton underwear.\" (Reason: The guideline emphasizes 'Avoidance of precipitating factors' and 'Use of emollient soap substitute' for various vulval conditions. The current education points are appropriate but could be expanded to include more specific vulval care measures that are evidence-based and recommended in the guidelines for lichen sclerosus management.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",
