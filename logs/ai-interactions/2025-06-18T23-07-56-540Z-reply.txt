Key recommendations: - **Monitoring & Voiding:** Encourage regular voiding, monitor fluid intake, and catheterize when necessary. Postnatally, document voiding volumes and consider bladder scans or physiotherapy referrals if needed. - **Catheter Care:** Remove catheters when clinically indicated; provide care instructions to reduce infection risk. Monitor trials without catheter (TWOC) closely. **Bladder Scan Management:** - **<200 mL:** Hydrate and continue TWOC. - **200-500 mL:** In-out catheter, restart TWOC. - **500-1000 mL:** Indwelling catheter (IDC) for 24h, urine tests, then repeat TWOC. - **>1000 mL/failed TWOC:** IDC for 7 days, urine tests, obstetric review, and continence nurse referral. **Second Failed TWOC:** - Check voided volumes and post-void residuals (<150 mL is acceptable). If dysfunction persists, insert IDC for 7 days. **Indwelling Catheter Use Indications:** - Post-Caesarean/operative birth, spinal/epidural analgesia. - Bladder distension in labour, retention issues, retained placenta, PPH, severe perineal trauma (3rd/4th-degree tears, hematoma)",
