She denies associated pain but reports mild fatigue.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- First episode of bleeding occurred 4 months ago, initially dismissed as insignificant.  \n- Bleeding is unpredictable, scant, and not associated with trauma or exertion.  \n- No recent hormonal therapy or new medications.  \n- No weight loss, fever, or night sweats.  \n- No dyspareunia or urinary symptoms.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (controlled on amlodipine 5 mg OD).  \n- Osteopenia (no fractures).  \n- No history of diabetes or hyperlipidemia.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 24).  \n- No prior gynecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12, regular cycles prior to menopause at age 53.  \n- No history of abnormal cervical screening.  \n- One full-term vaginal delivery (age 28), no complications.  \n- No history of endometriosis or fibroids.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Amlodipine 5 mg OD.  \n- Calcium/vitamin D supplement.  \n- No HRT or anticoagulants.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Retired schoolteacher.  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- Lives with husband, independent with ADLs.  \n- Moderate physical activity (walking 3x/week).  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried this could be \"something serious like cancer.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about invasive tests.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on cause and reassurance.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic (speculum):** Minimal atrophic vaginitis, no visible cervical lesions.  \n- **Bimanual:** Uterus normal size, no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nPostmenopausal bleeding in a 61-year-old with BMI 23.4 raises concern for **endometrial hyperplasia** (per **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include age >60 and nulliparity (though parity is protective, her single pregnancy may still confer some risk). Differential includes atrophic endometritis, polyps, or malignancy.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness (if >4 mm, biopsy indicated).  \n   - **Endometrial biopsy (pipelle):** Gold standard for histology.  \n   - Bloods: FBC (rule out anemia), HbA1c (assess metabolic risk).  \n\n2. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Reassure that most causes are benign but emphasize need for exclusion of malignancy.  \n   - Discuss biopsy procedure and expected discomfort.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Urgent referral to gynecology for biopsy given PMB.  \n   - If hyperplasia confirmed, discuss options per GTG 2014 (progestogens vs. hysterectomy based on atypia).  \n\n**Prognosis:**  \nFavorable if hyperplasia without atypia; close surveillance if conservative management chosen.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await biopsy results.  \n- Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [Redacted]  \n\n---  \n*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
