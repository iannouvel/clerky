A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Redacted]  
- Age: 64  
- Weight: 98 kg  
- Height: 1.69 m  
- BMI: 34.2 (Obese Class I)  
- Parity: G0P0 (No prior pregnancies)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 3-week history of intermittent lower abdominal discomfort and a sensation of "fullness" in the pelvis. She reports no associated urinary or bowel symptoms but describes occasional mild backache.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began insidiously, with no clear precipitating factors.  
- Discomfort is dull and non-radiating, rated 3/10 in severity.  
- No exacerbating or relieving factors identified.  
- Denies vaginal bleeding, discharge, or urinary symptoms.  
- No recent weight loss or constitutional symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (diagnosed 10 years ago, well-controlled on medication).  
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago, managed with oral hypoglycaemics).  
- Osteoarthritis (knees and lower back).  
- No history of malignancy.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 22).  
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (age 48).  
- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, regular cycles until menopause at age 52.  
- No history of abnormal cervical screening.  
- Never pregnant (nulliparous).  
- No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis.  

**Drug History:**  
- Amlodipine 5 mg OD  
- Metformin 1 g BD  
- Paracetamol PRN for joint pain  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Retired schoolteacher.  
- Lives with husband; two adult children (adopted).  
- Non-smoker.  
- Alcohol: 1-2 glasses of wine per week.  
- Moderate physical activity (walks 3x weekly).  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- The patient is concerned that her symptoms may indicate an underlying gynaecological issue, given her age and nulliparity.  
- She is particularly anxious about ovarian pathology due to a friend’s recent diagnosis.  
- She hopes for reassurance but is open to further investigations if needed.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General inspection: Well-appearing, no signs of systemic illness.  
- Abdominal examination: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses. No organomegaly.  
- Pelvic examination (speculum and bimanual):  
  - Vaginal walls healthy, cervix appears normal.  
  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size for age.  
  - No adnexal masses or tenderness.  
- No evidence of pelvic organ prolapse.  

**Assessment:**  
Given the patient’s age, nulliparity, and BMI, the differential includes:  
1. **Benign pelvic pathology** (e.g., uterine fibroids, adenomyosis – though less likely post-menopause).  
2. **Ovarian pathology** (though no masses palpated, imaging may be warranted).  
3. **Musculoskeletal discomfort** (given her osteoarthritis).  
4. **Functional bowel disorder** (though no bowel symptoms reported).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal if tolerated)** to assess uterus and adnexae.  
   - **CA-125** (given age and nulliparity, though low suspicion).  
   - Basic bloods (FBC, U&E, LFTs, HbA1c).  

2. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Weight management support (dietician referral given BMI 34.2).  
   - Encourage low-impact exercise to alleviate musculoskeletal discomfort.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 4 weeks with results.  
   - If imaging is normal, consider physiotherapy referral for back/pelvic discomfort.  

4. **Patient Reassurance:**  
   - No red flags identified, but investigations will help exclude significant pathology.  

**Prognosis:**  
- Likely benign given examination findings, but further assessment will provide clarity.
