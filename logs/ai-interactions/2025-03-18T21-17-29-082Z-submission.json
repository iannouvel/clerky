    "prompt": "You are provided with the text of a clinical note from a patient encounter and a set of clinical guidelines. Your task is to:\n\n1. Cross-check the clinical note against each provided guideline:\n2. Identify areas in the clinical note that do not fully adhere to the guideline recommendations.\n3. Note any parts of the note that could be improved based on the guidelines.\nInclude the full text of each guideline in your response:\n4. For every guideline you reference, include its complete text.\n5. Next to each suggested change, provide a short reference to the guideline (e.g., the guideline's name or identifier).\n6. Return the clinical note as HTML-formatted code:\n\nThe clinical note should be output as valid HTML.\nAny text in the clinical note that has been adjusted or needs adjustment (in light of the guidelines) should be wrapped in <i></i> tags (to display in italics).\nEnsure that the guideline reference appears immediately following the italicized adjustment for clarity.\nYour final output should therefore contain:\nThe complete text of each guideline used, with clear references.\nThe HTML-formatted clinical note where adjustments appear in italics with the respective guideline reference.\n\nFor example, in the following clinical note text:\nSummary:\nPatient presents with irregular menstrual cycles, intense cramps, and heavier flow, raising concerns for underlying conditions.\n\nBody:\nPatient reports irregular menstrual cycles, increased cramps, and heavier flow.\nNo history of ovarian cysts or endometriosis.\nFurther investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted.\n\nPerform pelvic exam to assess reproductive organs.\nConsider imaging studies for detailed evaluation.\nDiscuss family planning goals and contraceptive needs.\nCollaborate to determine the most appropriate management approach.\n\nAn adjustement in light of this guideline (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline - https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng73) would be to this sentence\nFurther investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted. A family history of endometriosis would make the diagnosis more likely (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline)\n\nHere is the note text: **Summary:**- Female, 30 years old, BMI 38, weight 100 kg.- Presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain.- History of one uneventful pregnancy, hypertension, and no known drug allergies.**Assessment and Advice:**Mrs. Smith, a 30-year-old female teacher with a BMI of 38, presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and worsening pelvic pain over the past few weeks.
