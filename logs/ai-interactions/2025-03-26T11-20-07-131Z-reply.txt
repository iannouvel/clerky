### **Examination Findings**  
**General:** Pale conjunctivae (possible anaemia), obese.  
**Abdominal:** Soft, tender suprapubically; no guarding/rebound. Fundus not palpable.  
**Speculum Exam:** Active bleeding noted, cervix appears closed, no lesions.  
**Bimanual Exam:** Uterus enlarged (~8 weeks), cervical motion tenderness negative, no adnexal masses.  

**Bedside Tests:**  
- Urine hCG: Positive.  
- Hb: 9.2 g/dL (low).

### **Differential Diagnoses**  
1. **Threatened miscarriage** (most likely given history and closed cervix).  
2. **Incomplete miscarriage** (if products retained).  
3. **Ectopic pregnancy** (less likely but must exclude due to risk factors: multiparity, prior PID).  

---

### **Management Plan**  
1. **Immediate:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUSS) to confirm viability/location of pregnancy.  
   - Group & Save (given anaemia and bleeding risk).  
   - Oral progesterone if viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed.  

2. **Long-term:**  
   - **If miscarriage confirmed:** Discuss surgical (ERPC) vs. medical (misoprostol) management.  
   - **If viable:** High-risk obstetric referral (due to BMI, diabetes, hypertension).  
   - **Contraception counselling:** Given rapid repeat pregnancies and comorbidities.  

3. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Smoking cessation referral (teratogenic + miscarriage risk).  
   - Dietitian input for BMI/diabetes optimisation.  

4. **Follow-up:**  
   - TVUSS results within 48 hours.  
   - Hb repeat in 1 week.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Explained risks of obesity/hypertension in pregnancy.  
- Advised against pregnancy until comorbidities optimised.  
- Addressed emotional distress; offered counselling.  

**Consent:** Patient agreed to TVUSS and bloods.
