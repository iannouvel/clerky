A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter (Testing Purposes Only)**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Fictional Name]  
- Age: 25 years  
- Weight: 75 kg  
- BMI: 27 (height 1.67 m)  
- Parity: G2P1 (1 previous term delivery, 1 first-trimester miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 3-month history of worsening dysmenorrhoea and intermenstrual bleeding. She also reports chronic pelvic pain, exacerbated during intercourse (dyspareunia).  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- The dysmenorrhoea has progressively worsened over the past year, now requiring regular NSAID use.  
- Intermenstrual bleeding occurs 1–2 times per cycle, lasting 2–3 days, with small-volume fresh bleeding.  
- Pelvic pain is described as a deep, dragging sensation, worse on the left side.  
- No post-coital bleeding or abnormal discharge reported.  
- Denies urinary or bowel symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Iron-deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron, now resolved).  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 16).  
- No other major surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12.  
- Regular 28-day cycles, but heavy flow (changing pads every 2–3 hours on heavy days).  
- Last menstrual period: 1 week ago.  
- Previous pregnancies:  
  - Term vaginal delivery 3 years ago (no complications).  
  - First-trimester miscarriage 1 year ago (managed expectantly).  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 6 months ago).  
- Current contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception).  

**Drug History:**  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN for pain (takes 2–3 times per week).  
- No regular medications.  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- Works as a teacher.  
- Non-smoker.  
- Alcohol: 4–5 units per week.  
- No recreational drug use.  
- In a stable relationship; partner is supportive.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- The patient is concerned that her symptoms may indicate endometriosis or fibroids, as her mother had similar issues.  
- She is anxious about fertility implications given her previous miscarriage.  
- Hopes for a clear diagnosis and effective pain management.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General inspection: Well-appearing, no pallor.  
- Abdominal examination: Soft, non-distended. Mild tenderness in left iliac fossa, no palpable masses.  
- Speculum examination: Cervix appears healthy, no contact bleeding.  
- Bimanual examination: Uterus anteverted, normal size. Left adnexal tenderness noted, with possible nodularity in the pouch of Douglas. No palpable masses.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Suspected endometriosis** – Given chronic dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and adnexal tenderness.  
2. **Intermenstrual bleeding** – Possible anovulatory cycles or cervical polyp (though not visualised on speculum exam).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess for endometriomas, adenomyosis, or fibroids.  
   - Pelvic MRI if ultrasound inconclusive.  
   - Consider diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist despite initial management.  
2. **Medical Management:**  
   - Trial of combined hormonal contraceptive (after counselling) to reduce menstrual bleeding/pain.  
   - If no improvement, discuss GnRH analogues (with add-back therapy).  
3. **Fertility Counselling:**  
   - Reassure that endometriosis does not always impair fertility but offer early referral to a gynaecology specialist if conception is desired.  
4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  
   - Advised to track symptoms using a pain/bleeding diary.  

**Patient Advice:**  
- Encouraged to continue NSAIDs as needed but avoid excessive use.  
- Provided with endometriosis support resources.  
- Emergency contact details given if pain becomes severe/unmanageable.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await ultrasound results.  
- Consider gynaecology referral if symptoms persist or worsen.
