She reports receiving a letter indicating \"high-grade changes\" (CIN 2/3) on her Pap smear and HPV-positive status (type not specified). She denies current vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pelvic pain but admits to occasional postcoital spotting over the past 6 months, which she attributed to \"hormonal changes.\" She has no history of STIs and has been monogamous with her current partner for 5 years. Her last Pap smear was 3 years ago (reported as normal). She completed the HPV vaccine series in her 20s.  \n\n**Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Hypothyroidism (stable on levothyroxine).  \n- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  \n- No prior cervical procedures.  \n\n**Medications:** Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, occasional ibuprofen for headaches.  \n**Allergies:** NKDA.  \n**Family History:** Mother with breast cancer (age 60); no cervical/gynecologic cancers.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  \n- Works as a teacher; reports moderate stress.  \n\n*(Missing Pertinent Information:* Sexual history details [e.g., age of first intercourse, lifetime partners], contraception use, prior STI testing, or partner’s HPV status.)  \n\n---\n\n**Objective:**  \n**Vitals:** BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile.  \n**General:** Well-appearing, no distress.  \n**Pelvic Exam (Limited Documentation):**  \n- External: Normal vulvar anatomy, no lesions.  \n- Speculum: Cervix appears grossly normal; no active bleeding.  \n- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa without masses.  \n*(Missing:* Cervical motion tenderness, detailed description of cervical appearance [e.g., ectropion, scarring], or documentation of whether a colposcopy was performed today.)  \n\n---\n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 2/3)** per recent screening, HPV-associated.  \n2. **Postcoital Bleeding** – Likely related to CIN, though other causes (e.g., cervicitis, polyp) not fully ruled out.  \n\n*(Missing Differential:* No consideration of concurrent vaginal atrophy [given age], infection, or other cervical pathology.)  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Colposcopy with Biopsy:** Scheduled for next week to confirm histologic grade. Discussed potential need for excision (e.g., LEEP) if CIN 3 is confirmed.  \n2. **HPV Vaccination:** Reinforced that vaccination does not treat existing infection but advised her daughter (age 15) to complete the series.  \n3. **Follow-Up:** Return for results in 2 weeks. If LEEP is needed, will coordinate with gynecologic surgery team.  \n4. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Advised abstinence until after colposcopy to reduce bleeding risk.  \n   - Emphasized smoking cessation (though she denies smoking) due to HPV progression risks.  \n   - No discussion of partner testing or condom use to reduce transmission.  \n\n*(Missing:* No clear plan for investigating postcoital bleeding if biopsies are benign, nor discussion of fertility implications [though patient is parous].)  \n\n**Signed:**  \nDr. Smith  \n*[Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
