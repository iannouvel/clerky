      "newValue": "**Summary of Antenatal Care Guidelines:** - **Antenatal care** spans from conception to birth, delivered locally by midwives, with individualized care plans. - **Booking appointment** includes risk assessment, health promotion, and consent for screening (e.g., Chlamydia/Gonorrhea for ≤24-year-olds). Blood/urine tests should be offered; declines must be documented. - **Consent** for blood products and antenatal screening must be discussed and recorded. - **Documentation** should include test results, risk assessments, and care plans. Partners should be involved if desired. - **Urinalysis** at each appointment checks for proteinuria/UTIs; recurrent UTIs warrant obstetric review. - **Consultant-led care** is based on risk assessments, with specialist referrals for complex conditions. - **Safeguarding:** Address mental health, domestic abuse, FGM, and vulnerabilities promptly. - **Lifestyle advice:** Offer smoking cessation, alcohol guidance, and weight management (BMI <30). - **Fetal monitoring:** Essential to reduce stillbirth risk; growth scans as needed. - **High-risk groups:** Closer monitoring for minority ethnic, deprived, or migrant women; ensure language support. - **Continuity of care** and clear communication are vital, especially for complex cases. - **Referrals:** Unexplained bleeding <16 weeks to EPAC; ≥16 weeks to labor ward. *References: MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC guidelines.*",
