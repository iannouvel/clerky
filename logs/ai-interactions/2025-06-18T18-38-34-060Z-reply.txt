In emergencies, proceed to the nearest hospital with a labour ward. Neonatal care varies by gestational age, so assess clinical status and transfer to the appropriate facility if preterm labour is suspected. Reorganized perinatal networks ensure expert care availability. Timely assessment and transfer are critical for improving neonatal survival and outcomes",
