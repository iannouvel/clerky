Monitor proteinuria. - **Chronic Hypertension:** Avoid planned birth before 37 weeks unless BP ≥160/110 mmHg or other indications. Postnatal BP monitoring for 2-5 days. - **Gestational Hypertension:** Secondary care assessment; antihypertensives (labetalol, nifedipine, methyldopa). No early birth before 37 weeks unless indicated. - **Pre-eclampsia:** Target BP ≤135/85 mmHg; severe cases managed in HDU. IV magnesium sulphate for eclampsia. **Acute Severe Hypertension (≥160/110 mmHg):** - **First-line:** IV labetalol (max 300 mg). - **Second-line:** Oral nifedipine (caution with magnesium sulphate). - **Third-line:** IV hydralazine (max 30 mg). **Fetal Monitoring:** - Growth scans + Doppler for gestational hypertension. - Cardiotocography if clinically indicated. **Postnatal Care:** - Daily BP checks; continue antihypertensives if needed. - Discuss cardiovascular risk reduction. **Referral Criteria:** - Diastolic ≥90 mmHg, PET symptoms, or proteinuria (++/more). **Contraindications:** Avoid labetalol in asthma/COPD. Avoid diazepam/phenytoin for eclampsia. **Flowchart:** Community midwives refer for diastolic ≥90 mmHg, PET symptoms, or proteinuria. Repeat BP/urinalysis if trace/+ protein",
