Provide trauma-informed care and support for gender dysphoria. **Clinical Recommendations:** 1. **Pre-conception & Antenatal Care:** Discuss hormone therapy, surgeries, and conception support. 2. **Intrapartum Care:** - For catheterization, confirm urethral location post-lower surgery. Use standard-length catheters if needed. - Follow aseptic technique; stabilize tissues during insertion. 3. **Postnatal Care:** - Offer choice between side-room or shared ward accommodation. - Monitor chest health (e.g., mastitis risk post-top surgery). - Discuss postnatal depression (higher risk if previously on testosterone). - Support infant feeding (breast/chestfeeding possible if nipples remain). - Address contraception and testosterone resumption post-birth. - Note: UK birth registration records gestational parent as \"Mother.\" **Communication:** Use patient-preferred anatomical terms (e.g., \"chestfeeding\"). Follow NMC/NICE guidelines for respectful, individualized care. **Definitions:** Clarifies terms like gender identity, lower surgery, and transition. **Appendix:** Includes \"My Language Preferences\" form for documenting pronouns and anatomical terms.
