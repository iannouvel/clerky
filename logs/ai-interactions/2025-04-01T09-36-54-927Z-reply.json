She also reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) for the past two months.  <br><br><strong>History of Presenting Complaint:</strong>  <br>- Pelvic pain is described as dull and cramping, radiating to the lower back, worse during menstruation.  <br>- Menstrual cycles are regular (28-day cycle) but now last 7-8 days with excessive clotting. Previously, her cycles lasted 5 days with moderate flow.  <br>- Dyspareunia is deep and occurs primarily with deep penetration. No post-coital bleeding reported.  <br>- No associated urinary or bowel symptoms.  <br>- No recent weight loss, fever, or vaginal discharge.  <br><br><strong>Past Medical History:</strong>  <br>- Iron deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron supplements, now resolved).  <br>- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  <br><br><strong>Past Surgical History:</strong>  <br>- Caesarean section x 2 (first for fetal distress, second elective due to previous section).  <br>- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (right ovary, 3 years ago).  <br><br><strong>Gynaecological History:</strong>  <br>- Menarche at age 12.  <br>- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  <br>- Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  <br>- Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently. Previously used combined oral contraceptive pill (stopped due to headaches).  <br><br><strong>Drug History:</strong>  <br>- Paracetamol as needed for pain (no regular use).  <br>- No current regular medications.  <br><br><strong>Allergy History:</strong>  <br>- No known drug allergies.  <br><br><strong>Social History:</strong>  <br>- Non-smoker.  <br>- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  <br>- Works as a primary school teacher.  <br>- Lives with partner and three children.  <br><br><strong>Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:</strong>  <br>- <strong>Ideas:</strong> Ms. Doe is concerned that her symptoms may be due to fibroids or endometriosis, as her sister has a history of the latter.  <br>- <strong>Concerns:</strong> She is worried about fertility implications if further surgery is needed.  <br>- <strong>Expectations:</strong> She hopes for symptom relief and reassurance about future pregnancy plans.  <br><br><strong>Examination Findings:</strong>  <br>- <strong>General:</strong> Well-appearing, no pallor.  <br>- <strong>Abdominal:</strong> Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  <br>- <strong>Speculum Examination:</strong> Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions or discharge.  <br>- <strong>Bimanual Examination:</strong> Uterus slightly enlarged (approximately 10-week size), non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild tenderness in the posterior fornix.  <br><br><strong>Assessment:</strong>  <br>1. <strong>Adenomyosis vs. Endometriosis:</strong> Given her history of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, dyspareunia, and tender retroverted uterus, adenomyosis or endometriosis are likely.  <br>2. <strong>Fibroids:</strong> Uterine enlargement could suggest fibroids, though bimanual exam did not reveal obvious nodules.  <br><br><strong>Management Plan:</strong>  <br>1. <strong>Investigations:</strong>  <br>   - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred) to assess uterine structure, adenomyosis, fibroids, or endometriomas.  <br>   - Full blood count (FBC) to check for anaemia.  <br>   - Consider CA-125 if endometriosis is strongly suspected (though non-specific).  <br>2. <strong>Medical Management:</strong>  <br>   - Trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill or Mirena IUD) to reduce bleeding and pain.  <br>   - NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for dysmenorrhoea.  <br>3. <strong>Surgical Consideration:</strong>  <br>   - If symptoms persist, diagnostic laparoscopy may be warranted to assess for endometriosis.  <br>4. <strong>Follow-Up:</strong>  <br>   - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  <br>   - Discuss long-term contraception if desired.  <br><br><strong>Patient Counselling:</strong>  <br>- Reassured that her symptoms are manageable and unlikely to affect fertility at this stage.  <br>- Advised to track symptoms in a pain/bleeding diary.  <br>- Encouraged to return sooner if pain becomes severe or if new symptoms arise.  <br><br><strong>Dictated by:</strong> Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  <br><strong>Date:</strong> [Today’s date]  <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This is a fictional dictation for educational/testing purposes only.
