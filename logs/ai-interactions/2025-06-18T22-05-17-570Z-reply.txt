      "newValue": "**Summary of Remifentanil PCA in Labour Guideline:** Remifentanil PCA is a safe, effective alternative for labor analgesia when epidurals are contraindicated or fail. Key safety measures include reduced bolus dose, 1:1 midwifery care, and longer lockout. **Indications:** Epidural contraindications or maternal request (if staffing allows). **Contraindications:** Inadequate staffing, opioid allergy, recent opioid use, gestation <36 weeks. **Requirements:** Patient education, continuous midwifery care, dedicated IV cannula, oxygen saturation monitoring. **Complications:** Desaturation, respiratory depression, drowsiness, CTG changes. **Monitoring:** Continuous SaOâ‚‚, CTG, sedation scoring, respiratory rate. **PCA Protocol:** - No loading dose or background infusion; max 800mcg/hour. - Anaesthetist must be present for initial bolus and first 15 minutes. - Dedicated cannula; flush after removal. - Patient-only button use; naloxone must be available. - Use during delivery/repairs; oxygen for desaturation. - Manage side effects (cyclizine for nausea, chlorpheniramine for pruritus). **Patient Education:** Explain fast-acting relief, timing with contractions, and side effects. Remifentanil is safe for neonates. **Documentation:** Complete PCA chart with settings, observations, and side-effect management. Continue monitoring for 15 minutes post-PCA",
