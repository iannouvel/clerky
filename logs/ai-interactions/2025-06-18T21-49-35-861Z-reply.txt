      "newValue": "**Summary of Newborn Feeding Guideline:** - **Breastfeeding Support:** Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged, with 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. Early expression is advised if mother and baby are separated. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts; cup/tube feeding for larger volumes. Formula supplementation should be limited and responsive. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Mothers receive instructions on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is preferred in hospitals. - **Safety & Support:** Emphasize safe sleeping (cot by bed, avoid sofas) and recognize feeding cues. Rooming-in is encouraged. - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Complex breastfeeding issues or tongue-tie require referral. Incident reporting for re-admitted newborns with feeding problems. - **Parent Education:** Promote skin-to-skin bonding, responsive feeding, and local parenting support. Avoid nipple confusion by minimizing formula use unless medically indicated. (Word count: 200)",
