Home birth requires safety discussions and documentation. **Postnatal Care:** Assess VTE risk, support breastfeeding, and continue weight management. **Post-Bariatric Surgery Pregnancy:** - Delay pregnancy for ≥1 year post-surgery; use LARC for contraception. - Monitor nutrition (supplements: folic acid 5mg, B12, vitamin D). - Screen for GDM via blood glucose monitoring (OGTT contraindicated). - Watch for surgical complications (e.g., internal hernia, band slippage). - No evidence for early induction or cesarean preference; encourage breastfeeding. **Specialist Equipment:** Ensure appropriate beds, BP cuffs, and scales for accurate assessments",
