Past Medical History: - No known medical conditions. - No previous surgeries. - No known allergies. Medications: - No regular medications. - Denies recent use of over-the-counter or recreational drugs. Social History: - Non-smoker. - Occasional alcohol (last drink 1 week ago). - No current employment (student). - Lives with parents. Examination Findings: - General: Alert, appears slightly pale. - Vitals: - BP: 98&#x2F;62 mmHg (left arm, sitting) - HR: 110 bpm (regular) - RR: 16&#x2F;min - SpO₂: 98% (room air) - Temp: 36.7°C - Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, no murmurs. - Respiratory: Clear, equal air entry. - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses. - Neurological: No focal deficits, normal gait (not formally assessed). Notable Omissions (for testing purposes): - No documented fetal heart rate assessment (if applicable). - No recorded lying&#x2F;standing BP comparison. - No detailed fluid intake&#x2F;output history. - No urinalysis performed. - No assessment for signs of DVT.

Immediate: - IV access obtained, bloods sent for FBC, U&amp;E, glucose (awaiting results). - Encourage oral fluids if tolerated. - Bed rest with gradual mobilisation. 2. Monitoring: - Repeat BP&#x2F;HR hourly. - Consider lying&#x2F;standing BP if symptoms recur. 3. Follow-up: - If symptoms resolve, discharge with advice to increase fluid&#x2F;salt intake. - If persistent tachycardia&#x2F;hypotension, consider ECG and further cardiac review. - Advise to return if recurrent episodes or worsening symptoms.

- No associated headache, visual disturbances, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or contractions.  
- No recent travel, immobility, or drug use.  
- Examination revealed tachycardia, mild pallor, and normal respiratory/abdominal findings.  
- Differential includes vasovagal episode, orthostatic hypotension, dehydration, anemia, or early pregnancy-related cardiovascular changes.  
- Advised bed rest, gradual mobilisation, and increased oral fluids.  

**Plan:**  
1. Immediate:  
   - Maintain IV access; monitor FBC, U&E, glucose results.  
   - Encourage oral fluid intake if tolerated.  
   - Bed rest with gradual mobilisation.  
2. Monitoring:  
   - Repeat BP/HR hourly.  
   - Perform lying/standing BP if symptoms recur.  
3. Follow-up:  
   - Discharge if symptoms resolve, with advice to increase fluid/salt intake.  
   - Consider ECG/cardiac review if persistent tachycardia/hypotension.  
   - Advise return for recurrent/worsening symptoms.  
4. Contingencies:  
   - Escalate to senior obstetrician if collapse recurs; consider sepsis screening.  
   - If third-trimester gestation confirmed, initiate pre-eclampsia workup.
