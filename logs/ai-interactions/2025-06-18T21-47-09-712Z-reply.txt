      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Stillbirth risks** are higher in Black and Asian babies and in deprived areas. Induction of labor (IOL) is recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce risks. - **Counseling**: Provide clear information on IOL methods (membrane sweep, balloon catheter, dinoprostone, oxytocin), risks, benefits, and alternatives. Offer membrane sweeps from 38–39 weeks. - **Contraindications**: Avoid routine IOL in cases of precipitate labor, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Assessments**: Use Bishop Score for cervical readiness. Monitor maternal/fetal wellbeing, including CTG, contractions, and fetal heart rate. - **Methods**: - **Balloon catheter**: Outpatient/inpatient use criteria; remove after 12 hours for ARM. - **Dinoprostone**: Monitor for hyperstimulation; terbutaline if needed. - **Oxytocin**: Titrate infusion rate; use in second stage if contractions inadequate. - **Special cases**: Preterm labor, fetal demise, diabetes, obesity, or previous cesarean require individualized plans. - **PROM management**: Offer IOL or expectant management; monitor for infection. If labor doesn’t start within 24 hours, deliver where neonatal care is available. - **Failed IOL**: Reassess after 24–48 hours; consider cesarean or further attempts. - **Complications**: Manage hyperstimulation with fetal assessment/tocolysis; suspect uterine rupture if severe pain/hypotension occurs. - **Documentation**: Record all procedures, consent, and monitoring (e.g., CTG, Bishop Score).
