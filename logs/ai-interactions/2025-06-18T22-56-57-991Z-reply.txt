Declination must be documented, with a blank sample card sent to the lab. - **Sample Collection:** - Taken on day 5 (day 0 = birth), using an automated incision device. - Heel cleaned with water; fill all four circles with single drops. - Transport to lab within 24 hours. - **Special Cases:** - Preterm babies (<32 weeks): Routine day 5 sample + repeat at 28 days/discharge. - Transfusions: For sickle cell, sample must be taken *before* transfusion. - **Follow-Up:** - Results communicated to parents within 6-8 weeks. - Health visitors ensure results are documented and followed up. - **Avoidable Repeats:** Midwifery/neonatal teams must arrange repeats within 72 hours if needed. - **Documentation:** Record all steps in maternity/paediatric notes and the Personal Child Health Record (PCHR). **Key Points:** Screening is strongly recommended; parents may decline. Timely sample collection and transport are critical. Special protocols apply for preterm/transfused infants. Health visitors oversee result delivery",
