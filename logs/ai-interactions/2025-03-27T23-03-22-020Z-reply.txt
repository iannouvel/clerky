- Age: 32 years  
- BMI: 26  
- Gravida: 5 (Para 3, miscarriage 1, termination 1)  
- Presenting complaints:  
  - Heavy, irregular vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks  
  - Pelvic pain (worse during menstruation and intercourse)  
  - Dyspareunia  
  - Fatigue and lightheadedness (attributed to blood loss)  
- History of iron-deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism  
- History of endometriosis and prior PID  
- Enlarged, irregular uterus on exam (suggestive of fibroids)  

### Details:  
- Heavy menstrual bleeding: Prolonged (10â€“14 days per cycle), soaking pads every 2 hours.  
- Pelvic pain: Dull, constant, exacerbated by menstruation and intercourse.  
- No fever, urinary, or bowel symptoms.  
- Last menstrual period 3 weeks ago with intermittent bleeding since.  
- Exam findings: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia), suprapubic tenderness, uterus enlarged (12-week size) with irregular contour.  
- Investigations ordered: FBC (anemia), TFTs (levothyroxine optimization), pelvic ultrasound (fibroids/endometrial thickness), possible endometrial biopsy.  
- Management includes tranexamic acid for bleeding, NSAIDs for pain, and hormonal options (progestin-only pill or Mirena IUD).  
- Surgical options (myomectomy/hysteroscopic resection) considered if fibroids confirmed.  
- Reassurance given regarding low cancer risk, with emphasis on iron supplementation and contraception counseling.  

### Plan:  
1. Symptomatic relief:  
   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS during heavy bleeding.  
   - Mefenamic acid for pain/dysmenorrhea.  
2. Hormonal management:  
   - Initiate progestin-only pill for cycle regulation.  
   - Consider Mirena IUD if endometrial biopsy normal.  
3. Investigations:  
   - FBC, TFTs, pelvic ultrasound.  
   - Endometrial biopsy if ultrasound indicates hyperplasia.  
4. Follow-up:  
   - Review in 2 weeks with results.  
   - Discuss endometriosis management if pain persists.  
5. Lifestyle advice:  
   - Iron-rich diet and regular supplements.  
   - Gradual exercise to address fatigue.  
6. Surgical referral if needed:  
   - Gynaecology referral if medical management fails.  
   - Myomectomy or hysteroscopic resection for confirmed fibroids.
