After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless new concerns arise. - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Urgently refer if glucose >11.0 mmol/L (anytime) or fasting glucose â‰¥5.6 mmol/L. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7 mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Monitor closely if on corticosteroids or with hyperemesis. - **Labor & delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Post-delivery, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Fetal monitoring**: Include 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidance, prioritizing those with GDM. - **Emergency care**: Diabetic emergencies require immediate attention. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure guideline adherence",
