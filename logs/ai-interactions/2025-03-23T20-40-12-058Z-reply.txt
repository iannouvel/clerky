**Examination Findings:**  
- General examination: Well-appeared, no pallor or lymphadenopathy  
- Abdominal examination: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- Speculum examination: Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions, but slight contact bleeding noted  
- Bimanual examination: Uterus slightly enlarged and tender, no adnexal masses or tenderness  

---

**Differential Diagnoses:**  
1. Endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy (given age, irregular bleeding, and post-coital bleeding)  
2. Adenomyosis (given pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, and tender uterus)  
3. Cervical pathology (e.g., polyp or erosion)  

---

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness and uterine anatomy  
   - Endometrial biopsy to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy  
   - Cervical smear and HPV testing  
   - Full blood count and thyroid function tests  

2. **Treatment:**  
   - Discussed removal of the copper IUD, as it may contribute to heavy bleeding  
   - Consider hormonal therapy (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral progestins) if endometrial biopsy is benign  
   - Referral to gynaecology clinic for further evaluation and management  

3. **Patient Education:**  
   - Reassured Ms. Doe that while her symptoms warrant investigation, they are not definitively indicative of cancer  
   - Advised her to monitor symptoms and report any worsening or new symptoms  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 2 weeks with investigation results  
   - Arrange gynaecology clinic appointment  

---

**Conclusion:**  
Ms. Doe’s symptoms are concerning and require thorough investigation to rule out serious pathology. She has been counselled on the next steps and reassured that a management plan will be tailored based on the results.
