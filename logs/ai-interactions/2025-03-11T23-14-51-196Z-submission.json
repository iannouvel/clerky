      "Endometrial hyperplasia should be classified using the WHO system and diagnosed via endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens, particularly LNG-IUS, are first-line for hyperplasia without atypia lasting at least 6 months with follow-up biopsies. Surgical management may be needed in some cases, while atypical hyperplasia warrants total hysterectomy. HRT use should be cautious. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to polyps should be completely removed. Regular surveillance is recommended. LNG-IUS is preferred over oral progestogens for its efficacy and fewer side effects. Hysterectomy is advised for atypical hyperplasia, with fertility preservation counseling. Women on tamoxifen should be monitored for hyperplasia and consider LNG-IUS. Endometrial polyps should be completely removed. Research gaps include biomarker utility and weight loss effects on regression. Endometrial thickness should be monitored, and individualized treatment decisions are crucial.",
      "Breech presentation at term: Mgmt: Offer ECV if no contraindication, counsel on risks/benefits of ECV, vaginal breech delivery vs. C-section. Delivery risks: C-section reduces perinatal mortality, planned vaginal breech birth has higher mortality risk. Maternal complications: C-section increases future pregnancy risks. Vaginal breech delivery safety depends on case selection, operator skill, intrapartum management. Position for delivery can be semirecumbent or all-fours. Assist delivery without traction if delay or poor fetal condition. Preterm breech birth: Individualized management, C-section if maternal/fetal compromise. Twin pregnancy: C-section for first twin, not routine for second twin. Support for vaginal breech delivery service. Recommendations for future research and audit.",
      "Antenatal care for women with a previous cesarean birth should include a checklist for VBAC or ERCS, with planned VBAC offered to most women with a single prior lower segment cesarean. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical cesarean scar, with a success rate of 72-75% and previous vaginal delivery predicting success. Induction or augmentation of labor increases uterine rupture risk, and ERCS should be performed after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis. VBAC may not be suitable for certain complications, and counselling by the maternity team is essential. Multiple prior cesareans increase risks of placenta praevia and accreta, with VBAC offered after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Factors increasing uterine rupture risk during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, post-date pregnancy, maternal age over 40, obesity, and decreased myometrial thickness. Antenatal counseling should be individualized, with consideration of outcomes and future reproductive preferences. ERCS has more complications than VBAC, with risks of stillbirth and neonatal respiratory morbidity. The NICHD study showed increased adverse perinatal outcomes with planned VBAC compared to ERCS, and successful VBAC predictors include previous vaginal delivery. Induction and augmentation of VBAC labor increase risks, and ERCS should follow guidelines for perioperative care. Delaying ERCS to 39+0 weeks reduces respiratory morbidity risk, with corticosteroids considered if needed before 39 weeks. Preincision antibiotics reduce maternal infection risk, and thromboprophylaxis should follow RCOG guidance. Special circumstances require cautious VBAC consideration, with induction from 41+0 weeks recommended to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates in twin pregnancies are similar to singletons, and antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is crucial. Further research is needed on identifying VBAC success predictors and risks in women with prior cesareans. Patient decision aids and personalized tools assist in mode of delivery choices, considering maternal and neonatal outcomes.",
      "Breech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with buttocks, legs, or feet closest to the cervix; types include frank, complete, footling, and kneeling breech. Suspected cases should be monitored, with confirmed cases offered ECV at 36-37 weeks; contraindications include placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers. Those declining ECV should discuss birth options like planned caesarean or vaginal breech birth; risks to both should be considered. Risk factors for vaginal breech birth include hyperextended neck, estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and fetal compromise; caesarean is recommended if identified. Labor and birth should occur in units with immediate surgical and neonatal support; continuous CTG monitoring is advised in labor. Maternal observations and pain relief options should be available, with interventions for slow progress or poor fetal condition. Delivery maneuvers should be individualized based on experience, with caesarean recommended for preterm or twin breech presentations. Maternal factors like previous LSCS, high BMI, age >40, and obstetric complications may also warrant caesarean section.",
      "In pregnancies complicated by diabetes, maintaining maternal glycemic levels between 70 and 125 mg/dL during labor is crucial to reduce adverse outcomes. Factors influencing glycemic control include labor metabolic demands, food intake restrictions, and dextrose-containing IV fluids. Maternal hyperglycemia correlates with fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Individualized glucose monitoring and insulin management based on diabetes type are recommended, with options for continuous glucose monitoring and intrapartum intravenous insulin protocols. Neonatal hypoglycemia due to maternal hyperglycemia requires monitoring and intervention. Insulin pump users can continue during labor; if not, standard insulin infusion protocols apply. Metformin should be paused upon admission for delivery. Scheduled cesarean births involving insulin require close glucose monitoring and insulin correction. Postpartum insulin dosing is typically 30-35% of antenatal doses, with adjustments based on capillary glucose levels. Insulin degludec may be withheld postpartum to prevent hypoglycemia. Close monitoring and insulin regimen adjustments are essential postpartum, with potential lower insulin needs during breastfeeding. Metformin is suitable postpartum for type 2 diabetes, compatible with breastfeeding. Gestational diabetes may not necessitate postpartum medication. Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is advised. For gestational diabetes in labor, subcutaneous insulin is the initial approach, escalating to infusion if glucose levels exceed 125 mg/dL persistently. Regular monitoring for diabetes development postpartum is essential.",
      "Diagnosis of anaemia in pregnancy includes Hb <110 g/l in the first trimester, <105 g/l in the second/third trimester, and <100 g/l postpartum. Oral iron is first-line for iron deficiency; consider parenteral iron if oral iron is not tolerated or effective. Active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained when possible; group and screen samples should be <3 days old. ABO-, RhD-, and K- compatible red cell units are recommended. Cell salvage is advised for significant blood loss; anti-D immunoglobulin should be given for RhD-negative women. FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets should be administered based on clinical and hematological criteria. Tranexamic acid may be considered for major obstetric hemorrhage. Blood transfusions should be based on clinical assessment and Hb levels. Iron deficiency should be promptly treated to reduce transfusion need. PBM strategies aim to optimize Hb preoperatively, avoid overtransfusion, use cell salvage, and employ evidence-based transfusion triggers. Future research should focus on coagulation abnormalities in obstetric hemorrhage and point of care testing.",
      "Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory disease in women of reproductive age, presents with pain and infertility, diagnosed through clinical examination and imaging, confirmed by laparoscopy if needed. Treatment options include NSAIDs, hormone therapy, and surgery, with excision recommended for lesions; referral to specialized centers for deep endometriosis; post-surgery hormone therapy for pain improvement; antibiotic prophylaxis for oocyte retrieval in endometrioma; avoid ovarian suppression solely for fertility; long-term hormone treatment for symptom prevention; fertility preservation discussions for extensive ovarian endometriosis; consider fertility implications of endometriosis; manage symptoms with continuous OCPs, progestogens, or GnRH agonists; surgical interventions like excision for deep endometriosis; consider patient preferences and risks for surgery; ongoing research for diagnostic criteria and management; early diagnosis and treatment reduce pain and infertility risks; positive surgical outcomes for deep endometriosis; specialized centers optimize outcomes; surgical treatment improves symptoms; preoperative hormone treatment not recommended; postoperative hormone treatment for pain; compare laparoscopy and empirical treatment outcomes; shared decision-making for surgical vs. medical treatment; adjunct therapies for pain relief; psychological interventions promising; ovarian suppression therapy ineffective for fertility; surgery improves pregnancy rates; ART efficacy uncertain; cystectomy superior for endometrioma; hormone treatment post-surgery prevents recurrence; multiple medication options for recurrent endometriosis; consider all treatments for recurring pain; careful diagnosis in adolescents; hormonal contraceptives first-line for pain relief; GnRH agonists as second-line; surgical removal by experienced surgeons; consider combination therapy post-surgery; symptoms may persist after menopause; surgical treatment recommended for postmenopausal women; aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women; diagnosis and treatment for abdominal wall and thoracic endometriosis; asymptomatic endometriosis does not require treatment; primary prevention with a healthy lifestyle; genetic testing not recommended; no significant overall cancer risk with endometriosis; monitoring ovarian malignancy not beneficial; shared decision-making for pain management; vigilance during pregnancy for symptoms.",
      "Assisted Vaginal Birth at RSCH PRH is indicated for women in labor needing assistance, with a goal to mimic spontaneous birth with minimal morbidity. Rates are stable at 10-15%, with interventions to reduce operative vaginal birth needs. Risks of Ventouse and forceps delivery should be compared, and clear communication is vital for preparation. Verbal consent is required for delivery room procedures, while written consent is needed for theatre. Analgesia options include epidural/spinal analgesia and pudendal block; bladder care should include recommending an in-out catheter if needed. Aseptic techniques, neonatal resuscitation, and proper instrumentation application are crucial. Post-delivery, thorough inspection of trauma, antibiotics, and analgesia are recommended, along with bladder care monitoring. Documentation of benefits, risks, indications, analgesia, and instrument use is essential, with debriefing to discuss future birth plans and individualized care for tears or pelvic floor issues. Support and debriefing services should be offered postnatally.",
      "Endometriosis is diagnosed in reproductive-aged women with symptoms like pain and infertility, treated with NSAIDs, hormone therapies (e.g., GnRH agonists), and surgical options like excision over ablation; Danazol and certain drugs are not recommended. Referral to expertise centers is advised for deep endometriosis, while hysterectomy is considered for non-conceiving women unresponsive to other treatments. Laparoscopy may improve pregnancy rates in endometriosis-associated infertility; intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation can increase pregnancy rates, with ART as an option. Antibiotic prophylaxis during oocyte retrieval is considered in women with endometrioma. Long-term hormone therapy may prevent endometriosis recurrence, and adolescent diagnosis involves hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line therapy. Early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy increases risks of bone density loss, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Surgical removal is preferred for extrapelvic endometriosis, with imaging and laparoscopy aiding diagnosis. Hormone treatments and surgery are recommended for pain relief, with combined hormonal contraceptives effective; GnRH agonists reduce pain but may have side effects, and add-back therapy can prevent bone loss. Excision is preferred over ablation, with PSN beneficial for pain relief and cystectomy recommended for ovarian endometrioma. Segmental bowel resection is an option for deep endometriosis, with no need for regular monitoring. Lifestyle changes may help prevent endometriosis, and early diagnosis can improve quality of life. Patients may benefit from referral to specialized centers for comprehensive management, with surgical interventions improving pain and quality of life, albeit with significant complications, especially with rectal surgery. Hysterectomy may be considered for endometriosis-associated pain, and nerve-sparing laparoscopy can reduce the risk of urinary retention. Excision techniques are preferred over ablation, with patient selection for surgery considering prognostic factors. Medical therapies post-surgery can be considered for pain management, with shared decision-making essential between medical and surgical treatments. Non-medical management strategies may offer relief, though more research is needed. In infertility management, ovarian suppression treatment is not recommended, and postoperative hormone therapy may be considered for pain relief without negatively impacting fertility, with operative laparoscopy an option guided by various factors including the Endometriosis Fertility Index. In ART, both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols are suitable, with antibiotic prophylaxis recommended during oocyte retrieval in women with endometriomas. Surgical therapies as an adjunct to ART may be effective, particularly for peritoneal endometriosis, and fertility preservation should be discussed in severe cases. Women with endometriosis are at increased risk of pregnancy complications, with surgery-related and patient-related factors as risk factors for recurrence, for which surgical techniques and hormone therapy post-surgery are recommended. For adolescents, hormonal contraceptives or progestogens are first-line therapy, with surgical removal considered if medical treatments fail. Symptoms may persist after menopause, with surgical treatment recommended, and aromatase inhibitors can be considered for postmenopausal pain. Abdominal wall endometriosis is diagnosed using imaging, while thoracic endometriosis syndrome is diagnosed clinically. Surgical removal is preferred for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, with hormone treatment for thoracic endometriosis. Asymptomatic endometriosis does not require treatment, and genetic testing should only be done in research settings. Reassurance on low cancer risks and advice on general cancer prevention are recommended, with varying effects of hormone treatments on cancer risk needing further research. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy is not recommended without additional risk factors, and early and meticulous surgical intervention may reduce ovarian cancer risk. Prevention strategies are crucial, and the guideline development process involves evidence collection and consensus meetings, with recommendations graded as 'strong' or 'weak' based on GRADE, and revision set for 2025.",
      "To diagnose endometriosis, assess deep involvement of the bowel, bladder, or ureter; interpret pelvic MRI scans by a gynaecological imaging expert; consider laparoscopy for suspected cases even with normal ultrasounds; and perform systematic inspection and possibly biopsy during laparoscopy. Treat based on symptoms rather than stage; consider outpatient follow-up and hormonal or surgical management. Offer laparoscopic excision, not ablation, for endometriomas; excision or ablation plus adhesiolysis for non-bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis; and laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or drainage and ablation for endometriomas to enhance spontaneous pregnancy chances. Discuss laparoscopic surgery risks and benefits for deep endometriosis in conceiving women; avoid hormonal treatment alone or with surgery for conceiving women. Consider alternative pain management for exhausted options or conception priority. Research is needed on pain management programs, isolated peritoneal disease treatment efficacy, lifestyle interventions, support interventions, and hormonal treatment impact on fertility outcomes in endometriosis.",
      "In obstetric ultrasound examinations, fetal sex determination is crucial, respecting parental wishes regarding disclosure; efforts should be made to determine fetal sex, with re-examination or referral if undetermined. Reports should include a visible alert for fetal sex information. Fetal genitalia assessment is vital in routine second-trimester ultrasounds, and direct communication of fetal sex to patients is recommended.",
      "Caesarean Section Protocol: MP050 includes guidance for any woman/person needing a caesarean section. Classifications include emergency, urgent, scheduled, and elective caesareans. Documentation, WHO Safety Surgical Checklist completion, and considerations for intra-operative cell salvage, blood transfusion, PPI/Sodium Citrate, antibiotics, and surgical techniques are emphasized. Specific interventions include delayed cord clamping, cord milking, cord blood sampling, and oxytocin administration. Monitoring parameters include wound assessment, VTE risk assessment, and discussions on future pregnancies. Contraindications include routine suturing of peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue closure, staple use, wound drains, and forceps unless necessary. Risk factors include BMI ≥35 kg/m2 for negative pressure wound therapy. Monitoring frequency varies from 6 to 24 hours post-birth for wound dressing removal. Responsibilities lie with midwives, obstetricians, and management for adherence and review of the protocol.",
      "Diagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform seizures by a neurologist; assessment of epilepsy types for maternal and fetal risks; differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnancy; management of AEDs by a clinician for fetal risk and seizure control; importance of folic acid intake and minimizing AED exposure to reduce malformations; regular antenatal care with epilepsy care team; monitoring AED levels in pregnancy; prompt management of seizures in labor; prioritizing pain relief options in labor for women with epilepsy; continued AED use and monitoring for seizure triggers in postnatal care; effective contraception for stabilization; awareness of disability legislation. Preconception counseling for WWE on AED risks and benefits; classification of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome for appropriate treatment; differential diagnosis considering eclampsia, cardiac, metabolic, and intracranial conditions; minimizing sodium valproate exposure to reduce neurodevelopment impact; detailed discussion on risks and benefits of AED polytherapy prior to pregnancy planning; verbal and written information on prenatal screening, AED effects on fetus, and breastfeeding; regular antenatal care with epilepsy care team; assessment for seizure risk factors, AED adherence, and seizure frequency; vitamin K supplementation for newborns exposed to enzyme-inducing AEDs; benzodiazepines for labor seizures; caution with pethidine use in labor; no contraindications for labor induction in WWE on AEDs; continued AED use postnatally; monitoring neonates for AED adverse effects; breastfeeding encouraged; safety advice for postpartum period; screening for depression; effective contraception for AED users; awareness of equality legislation; research focus on monitoring strategies and AED effects on offspring.",
      "Pregnant women traveling to malaria endemic areas should postpone travel if possible; if unavoidable, they should seek guidance on malaria risks and prevention strategies. Awareness of risk, bite prevention, chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Mefloquine is recommended in the second and third trimesters in chloroquine-resistant areas; atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are also options in certain areas. Chloroquine and proguanil are safe but ineffective in chloroquine-resistant areas. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Quinine and clindamycin are recommended treatments for pregnant women; standby treatment should be initiated if malaria is suspected. Emergency standby treatment instructions should be given to pregnant travelers without access to medical care. Monitoring for adverse effects of prophylactic drugs and seeking medical care promptly are essential.",
      "Cord prolapse is diagnosed when the umbilical cord descends through the cervix alongside or beyond the presenting part with ruptured membranes. Incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%, higher in breech presentations, with risk factors including long cord and breech presentation. Immediate interventions like bladder filling are crucial; in hospitals, perform a category 1 caesarean birth within 30 minutes for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns, while in community settings, transfer to a labor ward immediately. Staff training, incident form monitoring, and postnatal debriefing are recommended to reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Chronic pelvic pain is a complex condition that requires a thorough initial assessment to identify contributing factors and develop a comprehensive management plan in partnership with the patient. Diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be followed, with consideration for referral to other healthcare professionals if a non-gynaecological component is suspected. Investigations may include abdominal and pelvic examinations, screening for infections, transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), MRI, and diagnostic laparoscopy if needed. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatments for cyclical pain, antispasmodics for IBS, analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications. Self-management techniques and support from organizations are valuable. Monitoring should include tracking symptoms and functional goals. Red flag symptoms should be noted for further evaluation. Referral to a specialist may be necessary if pain is not controlled adequately. Contraindications and risk factors should be considered, and a multidisciplinary approach may be beneficial for managing chronic pelvic pain effectively.",
      "Uterine fibroids in reproductive-age females present with abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure symptoms, fertility issues, and pain. Management includes expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection, and medical therapy with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestin-releasing intrauterine devices. Second-tier options consist of GnRH agonists, uterine artery embolization, and tranexamic acid. Surgical interventions like hysterectomy and myomectomy are available, with laparoscopic myomectomy preferred for specific criteria. UAE and GnRH analogs are recommended for patients with bulk or pain symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors and androgenic compounds are not advised. Monitoring for sustained reduction in menstrual bleeding is crucial, with laparoscopic myomectomy showing less blood loss compared to open abdominal myomectomy. Further randomized trials are needed to compare surgical outcomes. Contraindications include bleeding disorders for endometrial ablation. Patients should be counseled on treatment options based on symptom severity and fertility desires.",
      "BPS: Initial assess incl med hx, exam, bladder diary, UTI test. Mgmt: Diet modif, stress mgmt, analgesia. Consider intravesical tx if needed.",
      "Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is diagnosed when a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showing neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with early pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy symptoms. Initial evaluation includes history, physical exam, and TVUS, with further workup based on findings. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and TVUS are needed for selected cases. Management depends on hemodynamic stability and pregnancy desires, with unstable patients needing immediate surgical intervention and stable patients potentially undergoing expectant management with regular hCG and TVUS monitoring. Proactive intervention is considered for undesired pregnancies, while caution is advised for patients with persistent hCG elevations or nonpregnancy-related causes. Hemodynamically unstable patients, rare etiologies, and desired pregnancies have distinct management approaches.",
      "Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy is crucial to prevent mortality; symptoms include flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. Urgent investigations include thick and thin blood films, malaria rapid antigen tests, and other tests. Treatment for non-falciparum malaria is chloroquine; for falciparum malaria, admit to hospital and use IV artesunate or quinine. Regular monitoring and management of malaria in pregnancy is essential. Severe malaria in pregnancy should be treated with IV artesunate if available, otherwise use IV quinine. Quinine monotherapy is not recommended for uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy; use quinine with clindamycin. Clindamycin is slow-acting and may not add value to IV artesunate. Treatment should not be delayed; seek expert consultation for IV artesunate if needed. IV artesunate is not currently licensed in the UK but can be obtained from specialist centers or Idis Pharma if needed. Clindamycin should not be used in pregnancy. Patients may deteriorate under treatment, at which point, management should be upgraded to account for severity. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters, ahead of quinine and clindamycin. Atovaquone-proguanil alone and atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate were safe and efficacious for uncomplicated P. falciprum in the second and third trimesters. Artemether-lumefantrine treatment in pregnancy showed disappointing efficacy. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is not recommended in pregnancy. Weekly chloroquine can be given to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale before delivery. Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax should be treated similarly to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs are often reduced in late pregnancy, leading to under-dosing. The persistence of Plasmodium falciparum in the placenta after apparently adequate therapy with quinine has been described, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance in monitoring and treatment to prevent adverse outcomes.",
      "Female genital mutilation (FGM) management involves awareness of short- and long-term complications such as haemorrhage, urinary retention, infection, scarring, dyspareunia, and obstetric complications; understanding legal responsibilities including mandatory reporting for girls under 18; and familiarity with the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset. Assessment during pregnancy, referral to specialists, and de-infibulation pre-pregnancy are key. Postnatal care should include follow-up for de-infibulation. Referral to designated consultants or midwives, individual risk assessment using an FGM safeguarding tool, hepatitis C screening, high obstetric risk management, and documentation of FGM history are essential. Notify child protection midwife for baby girls and offer postnatal follow-up post-de-infibulation. Vigilance for clinical signs, accurate recording, clear referral pathways, psychological assessment, and adherence to legal processes are crucial. Training on FGM management, safe environments, and global epidemiology awareness are recommended. Contraindications include clitoral reconstruction and re-infibulation, while de-infibulation is advised before pregnancy. Postnatal debrief, research on stillbirth rates, and audit on healthcare worker training and referrals are suggested for comprehensive care.",
      "ICP: Consider ICP in pregnant women with itching, bile acid >19 micromol/L. Active management with early birth reduces adverse outcomes. No routine treatments improve outcomes or reduce bile acid levels. Postnatal resolution confirmed with normal liver tests. Risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acids >100 micromol/L. Close monitoring, no routine additional tests. Ursodeoxycholic acid not recommended for perinatal outcomes.",
      "Failed Intubation in the Obstetric Patient (RSCH PRH only) MP044 protocol applies to those needing general anesthesia in the peri-partum period; Anaesthetists, Midwives & Obstetricians must adhere to this guidance and exercise professional judgment; Differences in pregnant patients include physiological changes, consideration of maternal and fetal status, and human factors; An algorithmic approach is needed for difficult airway management; OAA/DAS algorithms for managing unanticipated difficult airways in pregnant patients are utilized.",
      "Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do not need investigations if endometrial thickness is <11 mm on ultrasound; further investigations should be individualized based on ultrasound findings and personal risk for endometrial cancer. Most endometrial cancer patients present with postmenopausal bleeding; endometrial thickness <11 mm has low malignancy risk. Patients with thickening and risk factors may need assessments; hormone therapies in continuous combined formulation do not increase cancer risk. Routine ultrasound is not recommended for endometrial cancer screening; tamoxifen patients without symptoms do not need routine ultrasound. Endometrial biopsy is accurate for global thickening; invasive procedures have low but significant risk. Endometrial sampling should not be extrapolated to asymptomatic women; those with thickness >11 mm and positive findings need sampling or further investigations based on risk factors. Postmenopausal women with <11 mm thickening and no bleeding or risk factors do not need invasive investigations; transvaginal ultrasound is not for screening. Women with >11 mm thickening should have hysterosonogram, hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, or monitoring; management for cervical stenosis should be individualized. Risk factors for hyperplasia include menopausal status, polycystic ovary syndrome, long menstrual history, infertility, and Lynch syndrome; estrogen-progesterone therapy post-menopause may increase hyperplasia risk. Endometrial cancer is common in postmenopausal women with postmenopausal bleeding; >11 mm thickness or increased vascularity may warrant biopsy. Hormone therapies affect endometrial thickness; levonorgestrel intrauterine system with estrogen, tibolone, and tissue selective estrogen complex are options. Tamoxifen is associated with thicker endometrium; aromatase inhibitors reduce thickness. Cervical stenosis can complicate biopsy; misoprostol is recommended for preoperative ripening.",
      "The NICE antenatal care guideline emphasizes involving partners in care decisions, comprehensive care provision, and risk assessment for pregnant women. Recommendations include assessing risk factors for conditions like venous thromboembolism, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia at the first antenatal appointment and monitoring blood pressure and proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Symphysis fundal height should be measured after 24 weeks, with ultrasound scans considered for concerns. Discussion on fetal movements, breech presentation, birth preferences, and prolonged pregnancy options is advised. Interventions for nausea and vomiting include ginger for mild-to-moderate cases and antiemetics for more severe symptoms. Lifestyle advice, antacids, and alginates are recommended for heartburn. Treatments for vaginal discharge include antifungals and antibiotics. Physiotherapy and lumbopelvic belts are suggested for pelvic girdle pain. Unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks warrants secondary care review.

      "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) presents in late pregnancy with itching and elevated bile acids, associated with perinatal risks like preterm birth and stillbirth; diagnosis involves bile acid testing. Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth guided by bile acid levels; fetal monitoring during labor is advised. Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is common. Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the mainstay treatment, potentially reducing preterm birth risk; refractory cases may require specialist referral. Follow-up monitoring postpartum is crucial. Fetal monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Recurrence risk in future pregnancies is high, and individuals with ICP are at increased risk of metabolic disease. Contraception with combined estrogen-progestin is endorsed postpartum. Differential diagnoses include AFLP, autoimmune hepatitis, and HELLP syndrome. Recommendations for iatrogenic birth are based on non-fasting bile acid levels.",
      "For diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with early pregnancy complications, consider offering a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age with non-specific symptoms; refer women with positive tests and specific symptoms for further assessment; exclude ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors; use ultrasound to diagnose intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies; provide written information for monitoring pregnancies of unknown location. For a woman with >63% increase in serum hCG levels after ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, offer transvaginal ultrasound; confirm intrauterine pregnancy for routine care; if not confirmed, refer for gynaecologist review. For >50% decrease in hCG after 48 hours, provide support, counselling information, and repeat pregnancy test in 14 days; for other hCG changes, refer to early pregnancy assessment within 24 hours. Offer systemic methotrexate for unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancies meeting specific criteria; offer surgery if methotrexate not acceptable or for certain conditions; offer anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis for Rh-negative women undergoing surgery. Conduct research on psychological impact of different treatments for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Standardize practices based on evidence to improve diagnosis and reduce risks. Implement medical and expectant management for miscarriage to reduce surgical interventions and costs. Opt for expectant management for clinically stable women with tubal ectopic pregnancy when appropriate. Early pregnancy loss affects many women's quality of life, with high rates of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies; improvement in diagnosis and management is crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths.",
      "Pregnancy loss, or miscarriage, is a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 20 weeks gestation, commonly occurring in the first trimester. Diagnosis involves transvaginal ultrasound confirming intrauterine gestation and excluding ectopic pregnancy, with criteria based on gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity. Ultrasound at seven weeks gestation is recommended to identify embryonic cardiac activity. Criteria include a gestational sac ≥25 mm without a yolk sac or embryo, embryo with crown-rump length (CRL) ≥7 mm without cardiac activity, and absence of embryo with heartbeat within 21 days. Challenges include gestational duration discrepancy, multiple gestations, and pregnancy of unknown location. Additional findings suggesting nonviable pregnancy include expanded or empty amnion, irregular gestational sac, subchorionic hematoma, and chorionic bump. Live pregnancy indicators include gestational sac with yolk sac only and normal amnion. Stringency varies among studies, with false-positive rate (FPR) consideration important in diagnosis, dependent on sonographer expertise and equipment quality.",
      "The guideline recommends laparoscopic management by experienced laparoscopists for non-obstetric abdominal conditions in pregnancy like acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. Laparoscopy is safe for both mother and fetus, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. Factors influencing surgical approach include expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference. Maternal risks include potential vascular and organ trauma, necessitating careful anaesthetic management and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is typically recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Surgery can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation, with multidisciplinary team management. Intraoperative monitoring may be necessary, and caution is advised in steroid administration for maternal sepsis. Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended, with gas insufflation pressures of 12 mmHg. Laparoscopic appendectomy has a higher risk of spontaneous miscarriage, especially in the first trimester. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cystectomy offer benefits like faster recovery and fewer complications. Adnexal masses can be safely managed laparoscopically by trained professionals, with the choice of approach based on local expertise and circumstances. Adnexal torsion requires cystectomy and ovarian fixation to prevent recurrence. More high-grade evidence is needed, and national databases may aid in research due to challenges in conducting trials for these conditions.",

      "Antenatal care for Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth involves using a checklist for VBAC or ERCS counseling and decision-making; VBAC is suitable for most women with a singleton pregnancy and prior lower segment caesarean delivery, with contraindications being previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar; Labour for women with two or more prior caesareans should be in a center with immediate surgical delivery capability; VBAC success rate is 72-75%, enhanced by previous vaginal delivery; VBAC should occur in a well-equipped delivery suite with continuous monitoring, as induction or augmentation of labor increases uterine rupture risk; ERCS after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis is recommended; VBAC may not be suitable in certain circumstances like post-dates or twin gestation; VBAC after senior obstetrician counseling can be offered to women with two or more prior caesarean deliveries; Antenatal counseling should address factors increasing uterine rupture risk, and decision-making should consider risks and benefits of VBAC versus ERCS; Consider corticosteroids if ERCS is pre-39 weeks; Thromboprophylaxis method per RCOG guidance; NICE induction of labor guideline recommends induction from 41+0 weeks; Monitoring for uterine rupture signs and symptoms is crucial during VBAC; Patient decision-making aids and personalized care are important; Future research should focus on high/low-risk VBAC prediction and stillbirth prevention in prior caesarean deliveries.",
      "Clinical guidance for inducing labor includes discussing birth preferences early in pregnancy; offering expectant management until 37+0 weeks for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes; considering risks and individual circumstances for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks but before 37+0 weeks; immediate induction for term prelabor rupture of membranes with positive group B streptococcus test; offering expectant management for up to 24 hours for term prelabor rupture of membranes; discussing induction methods with women who had previous cesarean birth; not generally recommending induction for breech position babies; monitoring uterine activity and fetal condition regularly; stopping induction if hyperstimulation occurs; considering Bishop score for induction options; offering amniotomy and oxytocin infusion for Bishop score of more than 6; managing complications like uterine hyperstimulation and cord prolapse; auditing mothers and babies to reduce risks; and providing further research on optimal timing of induction and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Contraindications include fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise and breech position with declined external cephalic version. Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation than pharmacological methods, and hyperstimulation can be treated with tocolysis. Women with intrauterine fetal death should be cared for one-to-one and monitored, especially those with scarred uterus at increased risk of uterine rupture. Mechanical methods may be safe for women with previous cesarean birth. Interventions depend on cervical readiness and include dinoprostone, misoprostol, and mechanical methods to support decision-making and provide guidance on labor induction.",
      "Cervical cerclage is recommended for women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births or a cervix measuring 25mm or less before 24 weeks with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth. Transabdominal cerclage may be considered after unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage. Emergency cerclage can delay birth before 34 weeks. Contraindications include active preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, vaginal bleeding, PPROM, fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Complications may include PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labor, infection, bleeding, bladder or cervical damage, and maternal pyrexia. Antibiotic prophylaxis is discretionary, and cerclage removal is typically done between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks. Delayed removal may increase sepsis risk. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies, Mullerian anomalies, previous cervical surgery, or incidental short cervix on ultrasound. Monitoring should be individualized, and adjuvant management tailored based on clinical circumstances. Further research is needed on suture material efficacy and the role of additional cervical occlusion.",

      "Varicella-zoster contact should be clarified for pregnant women, with initial contact managed by the GP. For those with uncertain chickenpox history or from tropical regions, VZV IgG should be checked; no action is needed if present, while VZIG is recommended if absent. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their GP immediately, avoid contact until lesions crust over, and may be prescribed aciclovir; hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Delivery should be individualized, and risks to the fetus include FVS, warranting fetal medicine specialist referral. Amniocentesis may detect varicella DNA in the fetus. Neonatal risks can be reduced by delaying delivery after maternal rash onset, and VZIG prophylaxis is crucial for exposed newborns. Breastfeeding is safe. Monitoring includes VZV IgG testing and ultrasound for FVS; prophylaxis with VZIG is essential for susceptible pregnant women. Contraindications include severe infection and fetal varicella before 28 weeks. Symptomatic treatment and hygiene are advised, with aciclovir considered based on gestational age and timing of rash onset. Delivery should be delayed if rash appears within 7 days. Further research is recommended for screening and treatment strategies, with referrals to specialists and neonatologists for affected cases.",
      "ECV: Procedure to turn breech baby to head-down position. Success ~50%, reduces C-section chance. Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve success.",
      "Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term is the rupture of fetal membranes before regular contractions. Management involves deciding on labor induction or expectant management; induction with oxytocin is preferred for those eligible, while hospitalization is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used when indicated, but avoid prophylactic antibiotics unless specific criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not always require antibiotics. Induction reduces neonatal infection rates, and antibiotic prophylaxis for PROM at term lacks significant benefits. Positive GBS culture warrants antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management includes infection and fetal well-being monitoring, with delivery for specific indications. Antibiotics are not needed for negative GBS culture; manage unknown GBS status based on risk assessment. Maternal and fetal monitoring is crucial in expectant management of term PROM.",
      "Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation anticipating preterm birth, including those with twins or triplets, and in cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. For planned caesarean births between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, a discussion about corticosteroids is recommended. Consideration for corticosteroids is advised for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids may be considered, with caution in late preterm births. Women with diabetes should not be excluded, but close monitoring and additional insulin are recommended. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth persists after seven days. The recommended dose is 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate intramuscularly. Corticosteroids are most effective within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours. Caution is advised in late preterm births and in the presence of fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage. Antenatal corticosteroids may have risks including neonatal hypoglycemia, maternal blood glucose effects, and long-term consequences. Avoid delays in serious maternal or fetal conditions, and balance their use in systemic infections. Limit corticosteroid courses to three in pregnancy and consider future research on their effectiveness and safety in various conditions.",

Variable conversion to laparotomy rates exist, but postoperative complications are lower with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Long-term outcome data is needed for future evaluations.",
      "Initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women involve referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases; conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign masses. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings guide malignancy risk assessment, with referral for specific suspicious ultrasound findings. Yearly ultrasound follow-up is advised for simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm; persistent or increasing cysts may require further imaging or surgery, especially for mature cystic teratomas. Laparoscopic management is preferred for benign cysts, with experienced surgeons recommended. Aspiration of cysts is less effective, and spillage should be avoided to prevent malignancy. Tertiary tests for ovarian cancer detection include three-dimensional vascularity quantification. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy post-laparoscopy. Various studies evaluate risk indices, sonography quality, and differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Expectant management is suitable for asymptomatic simple cysts. Hormonal treatment is not effective for functional cysts. Surgical approach should consider cyst size, with laparoscopic excision preferred for better outcomes. Monitoring parameters include ultrasound follow-up frequency and assessment of cyst growth. Contraindications include ineffective hormonal treatment and inadequate surgical expertise.",
      "Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy; main causes are placenta praevia and placental abruption. Clinical presentations range from spotting to massive haemorrhage; underestimated blood loss is common. Assess for signs of shock and manage in hospital with resuscitation and emergency operative delivery facilities. Triage includes history, bleeding assessment, maternal cardiovascular status, and fetal wellbeing; maternal stabilization is priority in major haemorrhage. Investigate with blood tests and ultrasound; monitor fetal wellbeing with heart rate assessment and ultrasound. Hospitalize for heavier bleeding; consider corticosteroids for preterm birth risk. Avoid tocolytics in major APH or abruption. Alter antenatal care post-APH with increased surveillance. Delivery timing based on maternal/fetal condition; caesarean for praevia with compromise. RhD-negative women should receive Anti-D Ig. Massive APH requires multidisciplinary management and blood products as needed. Neonates need senior assessment. Postpartum, anticipate hemorrhage and manage actively; obstetric skill drills recommended for APH scenarios. Audit topics include corticosteroid use, Anti-D Ig administration, growth scans referral, third stage labor management, and team training. Future research areas include prevention of abruption, timing of delivery post-unexplained APH, and outcomes of blood product use in APH management. Massive APH management involves designated personnel, ABCD pathway, communication, resuscitation, monitoring, and delivery to control bleeding. Fluid therapy and blood product administration aim to maintain specific hemoglobin, platelets, coagulation parameters, and fibrinogen levels.",
      "Clinical guidance for managing unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves assessing women for endometrial cancer risk factors and bleeding patterns, offering examinations and investigations as needed, adjusting HRT regimens, and optimizing HRT to reduce bleeding episodes. Recommendations include assessing compliance, considering low-dose preparations, offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options, and adjusting progestogen dose or type based on individual factors. Endometrial assessment should be considered if bleeding persists, with options such as the levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device for endometrial protection. Referral for ultrasound is recommended based on certain criteria, and adjustments in HRT should be made if bleeding continues. Monitoring parameters include history details, examination findings, and ultrasound results, with recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options provided based on findings. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases, with hysterectomy as a last resort. Women with endometrial cancer risk factors should be counseled about progestogenic component use, and contraceptive needs should be assessed to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may help reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes. Regular monitoring and adjustments in HRT regimens are crucial for managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT effectively.",

      "Diagnostic criteria for genital herpes in pregnancy include suspected or confirmed infection with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2. Clinical presentations vary, with risk factors including maternal infection type, duration of rupture of membranes, and mode of delivery. Management involves treating first episode genital herpes with aciclovir, considering symptomatic relief with paracetamol and lidocaine gel, and offering vaginal delivery with suppressive aciclovir from 36 weeks gestation to reduce lesions and shedding. Caesarean section is advised for third trimester acquisitions to prevent neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can differentiate primary from recurrent infections, influencing management decisions. Recurrent genital herpes management is based on clinical assessment, with caesarean section recommended for primary episode lesions at delivery and vaginal delivery for recurrent lesions. Daily suppressive aciclovir is recommended for women with HIV and HSV co-infection. Neonatal management involves informing the neonatal team, appropriate testing, and efforts to prevent postnatal transmission. Monitoring includes lumbar puncture for HSV PCR if necessary, and starting aciclovir 20 mg/kg tds for 10 days while awaiting results. Contraindications include high-risk obstetric indications for caesarean section within 6 weeks of delivery.",
      "Gynaecology departments should offer outpatient hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding, reproductive issues, and IUD procedures; provide pre-appointment information on benefits, risks, and analgesia; consider vaginoscopy as the standard technique; prefer mechanical tissue removal systems over bipolar electrodes; use saline at low pressure; avoid routine conscious sedation; obtain informed consent and perform safety checks, excluding pregnancy; discuss findings and offer recovery area post-procedure; consider NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, or antispasmodics for pain management; avoid routine cervical dilatation; consider local anesthesia based on approach; monitor conscious sedation closely if used; use smaller diameter hysteroscopes for reduced pain and better outcomes; avoid routine antibiotic prophylaxis; document findings systematically; and collect data for quality assurance.
