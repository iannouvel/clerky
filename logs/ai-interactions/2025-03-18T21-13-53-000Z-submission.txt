Please ensure the material is entirely fictional and does not provide any real medical advice or information. 
The scenario should cover 2 complex obstetric or 2 complex gynaecological issues.
Please ensure variables such as age, weight and history are varied.

The clinican should explain the examination findings (the type of examination would be determined by the history).
In response to their history and examination findings, the clinician should  provide specific management advice and guidance.
