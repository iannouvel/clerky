Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower neonatal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, provide analgesia, bladder care, and thromboprophylaxis. Document thoroughly and offer postnatal follow-up discussions. - **Psychological support**: Refer to midwife counselors for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events and adhere to duty of candour. - **Audit & reporting**: Complete incident reports as needed and monitor compliance with RCOG standards\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
