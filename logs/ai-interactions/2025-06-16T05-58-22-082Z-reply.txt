  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 29-year-old G2P1 at 32+1 weeks gestation presenting with regular uterine contractions and threatened preterm labor\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Thompson presented to triage at 3am with a 4-hour history of regular, painful abdominal tightening occurring every 5-7 minutes. She describes the pain as cramping, similar to period pain but more intense, radiating to her lower back. She also reports increased vaginal discharge over the past 24 hours, initially clear but now slightly blood-tinged. No frank bleeding, no gush of fluid, fetal movements remain good. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with term delivery. No significant medical history. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy (ceased). Current medications: folic acid, iron supplements for mild anemia. Recent throat infection treated with penicillin 2 weeks ago, now resolved.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears uncomfortable during contractions. Vital signs: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, temp 37.1°C. Abdomen palpable contractions every 6 minutes lasting 45-60 seconds, moderate intensity. Fundal height 31cm (appropriate). CTG shows baseline 140 bpm with good variability, contractions clearly visible every 6 minutes. Speculum examination reveals cervix 2cm dilated, 70% effaced, soft, central position. Minimal blood-stained discharge, no obvious rupture of membranes. Digital examination confirms cervical findings. Fetal fibronectin test positive. Recent bloods: Hb 10.1 g/dL, WCC 12.1 x10⁹/L, CRP 8 mg/L, MSU pending.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of established preterm labor. Immediate admission to delivery suite. Tocolysis with nifedipine commenced to delay delivery and allow time for interventions. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone 12mg IM) given, repeat dose in 24 hours for fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate considered for neuroprotection if delivery appears imminent. Group B streptococcus status unknown - high vaginal swab sent and prophylactic antibiotics considered. Pediatric team alerted regarding potential preterm delivery. Attempt to prolong pregnancy for at least 48 hours to complete steroid course. Continuous fetal monitoring and maternal observations 4-hourly.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### MP031 Pre-term labour\n\nSince the guideline content for \"MP031 Pre-term labour\" is not available, I cannot provide specific recommendations based on that guideline. However, I can offer general suggestions based on standard clinical practice for preterm labor management. If you can provide the guideline content, I'd be happy to analyze the clinical note against those specific recommendations.\n\nFor now, here are some general observations about the clinical note:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document GBS status from previous pregnancy if available, as this affects antibiotic prophylaxis decisions\nReason: Standard practice recommends GBS prophylaxis for preterm labor if status is positive or unknown\n\n2. [Different management plan] - Consider administering magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection now rather than waiting until delivery appears imminent\nReason: Current evidence supports early administration when preterm delivery is likely within 24 hours\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document Bishop score calculation to better quantify cervical status\nReason: Helps predict likelihood of delivery and response to tocolysis\n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Provide clear counseling about risks/benefits of interventions and likely neonatal outcomes\nReason: Essential for informed consent in preterm labor situations\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Consider documenting fetal position/presentation\nReason: Helpful for delivery planning though not critical at this stage\n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Document discussion about potential NICU admission for neonate\nReason: Helps prepare parents emotionally for likely outcomes\n\nTo provide more specific recommendations aligned with the MP031 guideline, I would need access to the actual guideline content. The current note appears comprehensive but may benefit from these additional elements. Would you be able to provide the full text of the MP031 guideline?\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 154 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: MP031 Pre-term labour\n\n\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified. For each suggestion, include detailed context with relevant quoted text from the guideline to help the user understand the reasoning behind the recommendation.",
