Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, ensure documentation, and provide postnatal planning. Address bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. - **Psychological support**: Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions.
