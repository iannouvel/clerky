Please determine the significant clinical issues within this clinical scenario. 
Format each issue as a brief, clear statement.

Rules:
Each issue should be a single line
Maximum number of characters per issue is 60.
If two issues are associated, include them as a single line to avoid repetition - for example, if the patient has multiple symptoms associated with one issue (like painful, irregular heavy periods), the have that as one issue: 'Painful, irregular heavy periods' instead of 3 diferent issues
Do not list the issues with numbers, just simple text

Use the following as an exampled of the type of list I'd like to have returned:

Painful, irregular heavy periods
Subfertility
Considering diagnostic laparoscopy ?endometriosis

Clinical scenario:
{{text}}

Please identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:
1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., "Anaemia" and "Iron level monitoring" should merge into "Anaemia")
2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., "Previous C-section" and "Potential need for C-section" should merge)
3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise
4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate
5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line

Clinical Summary:
Patient: Hi, I'm here for my appointment today.

Healthcare Professional: Hello, how have you been feeling since we last met?

Patient: I've been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles and severe cramps.

Healthcare Professional: Have you noticed any changes in your flow or any other symptoms?

Patient: Yes, my flow has been heavier, and I've been feeling more fatigued than usual.

Healthcare Professional: It sounds like you may be dealing with a hormonal imbalance. We may need to run some tests to investigate further.

Patient: Okay, I'm a bit worried about that. Also, I've been trying to conceive without success for the past year.

Healthcare Professional: I understand your concerns. We can discuss fertility testing options and potential treatments to help you achieve your goal of becoming pregnant.

Patient: That would be great. I've also been experiencing some pelvic pain and discomfort during intercourse.

Healthcare Professional: Pelvic pain can have various causes, including infections or endometriosis. We should perform a pelvic exam and possibly imaging studies to determine the underlying issue.

Patient: Thank you for your help. I really hope we can address these issues and find some solutions.

Healthcare Professional: Of course, we will work together to investigate your symptoms thoroughly and come up with a personalized treatment plan to improve your health and well-being.
