They are not \ndesigned to be prescriptive and you are not expected to use them in exclusion of \ndiscussions with senior colleagues. \n \nEvidence used to inform these guidelines had been drawn from RCOG, BASHH or NICE \nguidelines. Where applicable other references are quoted. \n \nSCOPE \nThis guideline applies to women attending with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, \nwhich may be managed as an inpatient or outpatient. It covers recommendations on \ndiagnosis, treatment, and health promotion principles required for effective \nmanagement. \n \nRESPONSIBILITIES \n \nGynaecologists, Nurses & Midwives: \n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \n To use their professional judgement in application of this guidance \n \nManagement: \n To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and national \nrecommendations \n To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n1.0 Objective Standards \n1.1 Definition \n The clinical syndrome associated with ascending infection from the endocervix, \ncausing endometritis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and/or pelvic \nperitonitis. \n \n1.2 Epidemiology \nThe incidence of PID is unknown and probably grossly underestimated as figures \nare either based on inpatient episodes or cases treated in GUM outpatients. \nMany cases are treated in primary care and ~50% women have sub-clinical or \nunrecognised disease. It is estimated to account for 1:60 GP visits by females \nunder 45 years. \n \nRates are probably increasing, reflecting increasing incidence of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, particularly Chlamydia. Behavioural factors that increase \nthe risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as younger age at first sexual \nintercourse, multiple sexual partners, and frequency of partner change, are all \nassociated with increased risk of PID. \n \n1.3 Pathogenesis \nPID is commonly initiated by an STI, which predisposes to further colonisation by \norganisms that would normally be non-pathogenic. The isolation of anaerobes \ntends to be associated with more severe disease and anaerobes are invariably \npresent in tubo-ovarian abscesses. The risk of PID is also increased by other \nfactors that breech cervical host defences, such as IUCD insertion, childbirth, \nmiscarriage, surgical procedures, and TOP. \n \n2.0 Isolation Rates \n \n Chlamydia trachomatis: 40% (14-65%) using EIA, DIF & culture (higher with \nNAATs) \n Neisseria gonorrhoea: 14% \n Anaerobes: 60% \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n Mycoplasma: 10-15% \n No organisms isolated: 25-50% \nComplications \n Infertility (risk after 1 episode 8%, 2 episodes \n 9.5%, 3 episodes 40%), \n Ectopic pregnancy (9.5 times more likely) \n Chronic pelvic pain (9.8 times more likely) \n \nWith each infection, host defences become increasingly damaged and the risk of \ncomplications rises with each subsequent insult. \n3.0 Diagnosis \nPID may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Even when present, clinical symptoms and signs \nlack sensitivity or specificity (positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis is 65-90% \ncompared to laparoscopic diagnosis). \n \nTesting for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the lower genital tract is recommended since a \npositive result support diagnosis. The absence of infection at this site does not exclude PID \nhowever. \n \nAn elevated ESR or CRP also supports diagnosis but is non-specific \nThe absence of endocervical or vaginal pus cells has a good negative predictive value (95%) \nfor a diagnosis of PID but their presence is non-specific (poor positive predictive value - \n17%) \n \n3.1 Sexual History \n The number of sexual partners within the last 3 months \n The duration of each relationship \n The date of last sexual intercourse with each partner \n Whether barrier contraception used within each relationship \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n4.0 Clinical Features \nThe following features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID \n4.1 Symptoms \n Lower abdominal pain, usually bilateral \n Deep dyspareunia \n Abnormal vaginal bleeding, including post coital, inter-menstrual and \nmenorrhagia \n Abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, which is often purulent \n \n 4.2 Signs \n Lower abdominal tenderness, which is usually bilateral \n Adnexal tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination \n Cervical motion tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination \n Fever >38°C \n \nA diagnosis of PID, and empirical treatment, should be considered and offered in any young \nwoman (under 25 years of age) who is sexually active and has recent onset of bilateral lower \nabdominal pain associated with local tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination, in whom \npregnancy has been excluded. \n \n 4.2.1 Complicating Factors \n IUCD - Removal of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with \nbetter short term clinical outcomes. The decision to remove the IUCD should \nbe balanced against the risk of pregnancy in those who have had otherwise \nunprotected intercourse in the preceding seven days. Hormonal emergency \ncontraception may be appropriate for some women in this situation \n HIV - women with HIV may have more severe symptoms associated with PID, \nbut respond well to standard antibiotic therapy. No change in treatment \nregime is required. \n Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome - this comprises right upper quadrant pain \nassociated with perihepatitis. Although laparoscopic division of hepatic \nadhesions has been performed, there is insufficient clinical trial evidence to \nmake specific recommendations for treatment beyond those for \nuncomplicated PID \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n5.0 Investigations \n Urinalysis, including pregnancy test \n Bloods, including FBC and CRP \n Observations, temperature \n Routine swabs \no Endocervical Chlamydia & gonorrhoea \no High vaginal swab (black charcoal) \n Pelvic Ultrasound, particularly if symptoms/signs of moderate/severe \ndisease \n6.0 Management \nIt is likely that delaying treatment increases the long term sequelae, such as ectopic \npregnancy, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, a low threshold for empiric \ntreatment is recommended. Broad spectrum antibiotics are required to cover N. \ngonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and a variety of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria commonly \nfound in the upper genital tract in women with PID. \nTreatment must be effective (>95% cure rate), easy to take, have low side effects, and be \ngiven promptly. \n \nIf gonococcus diagnosed on NAATs the patient should be reviewed by genitourinary \nmedicine so cultures can be taken for gonorrhoea & contact tracing carried out. Please \ncontact the liaison Health Advisor on 07789 995086 or ext. 4716 \n\n6.1 Outpatient Management \nPatients seen in A&E and treated as outpatient must be provided with emergency \ndrug packs. \n \n6.2 Inpatient Management \n If any of the following features are present, consider admission, IV antibiotics \nand/or laparoscopy: \n \nSevere or atypical disease\n \n \nTemp> 38\no\nC\n \n \nNausea & vomiting, \n \n \nPeritonism \n \n \nWBC >15\n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n Pregnant or adolescent patient \n If the diagnosis is uncertain, pelvic abscess suspected or there is a \npossibility of a surgical emergency \n If the patient has not responded to out-patient therapy, or is intolerant to \noral therapy \n6.3 General Advice \n Rest advised for those with severe disease. \n Both patient and partner should abstain from sexual contact until \ncompletion of treatment and review \n Explanation of the treatment and its possible adverse effects \n Patient must avoid alcohol if being treated with metronidazole \n Potential OCP interactions with antibiotics (advise to abstain from sexual \ncontact whilst on antibiotics) \n Importance of compliance to treatment \n Importance of follow up \n All patients must be asked to give consent for follow up for themselves and \nsexual contacts. \n It is essential that sexual partners also receive treatment, whether or not an \norganism is identified on tests (they should contact CNC for treatment) \n7.0 Patient information \n \nEnsure patients receive patient information leaflet - click here for RCOG \nleaflet (https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patient-information-\nleaflets/gynaecology/pi-acute-pid.pdf). \n \nWe should discuss long term sequelae of PID with the patient, including the following: \n Following treatment, fertility is usually maintained but there remains a risk of \nfuture infertility, chronic pelvic pain or ectopic pregnancy \n Clinically more severe disease is associated with a greater risk of sequelae \n Repeated episodes of PID are associated with an exponential increase in the \nrisk of infertility \n The earlier treatment is given, the lower the risk of future fertility problems \n Future use of barrier contraception will significantly reduce risk of PID \n The need to screen/treat her sexual contacts for infection to prevent her \nbecoming re-infected \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n8.0 Analgesia \nAll patients should be offered adequate analgesia and anti-emetics eg: \n Metoclopramide oral / IM 10mg TDS or cyclizine 50mg IM/PO TDS \n Ibuprofen 400mg TDS \n Paracetamol oral / IV 1g QDs\n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n9.0 Antibiotic Treatment Regimens \n9.1 Antibiotic guidance \n 1st Line Penicillin Allergy \nOutpatient \n \nNon-pregnant \nOfloxacin\n \noral 400mg bd for 14 \ndays \n+ \nMetronidazole oral 400mg bd for 5 days \n \nPregnant \nOr Ofloxacin \nContraindicated \nCeftriaxone 500mg IM stat \n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \n+ \nClarithromycin oral 500mg bd for \n14 days \n+ \nMetronidazole oral 400mg bd for 5 days \nInpatient \n\nNon-Pregnant \nCeftriaxone IV 2g od for 14 days \n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \n+ \nOfloxacin IV 400mg bd for 14 days \n+ \nMetronidazole IV 500mg tds for 14 days \n\n Pregnant \nOr Ofloxacin \nContraindicated \nCeftriaxone IV 2g od for 14 days \n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \n+ \nClarithromycin IV 500mg bd for \n14 days \n+ \nMetronidazole IV 500mg tds for \n14 days \n*\nUK gonorrhoea resistance to quinolones in heterosexual women is about 15% \ntherefore if patient is high risk for gonorrhoea (patient’s partner has \ngonorrhoea, clinically severe disease, following sexual contact abroad), discuss \nalternative regimens with genitourinary medicine. \n \n9.2 Penicillin Allergy \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \nReaction Which antibiotic can be given \n Penicillin Cephalosporin Other beta-\nlactams \nAnaphylaxis No No No \nUrticaria No No No \nPruritic rash (immediate) No No No \nLaryngeal oedema/ \nangioedema/bronchospasm \nNo No No \nMinor rash (non- confluent, \nnon-pruritic, restricted to \nsmall area of the body) \nWith caution in \nserious infection \nYes Yes \nRash occurring > 72 hours \npost penicillin exposure \nWith caution in \nserious infection \nYes Yes \nNausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoaea \nYes Yes Yes \n\n9.3 IV TO ORAL SWITCH \n \n IV antibiotics should be switched to oral equivalents and complete 14 days \nafter 48 hours if:- \n Temperature < 38°c for at least 24 hours \n Clinical improvement observed \n WCC & CRP improving \n Haemodynamically stable \n Oral route viable (no evidence of malabsorption, vomiting or unsafe \nswallow) \n \n10.0 NICE guidance on drug choice during very early pregnancy \n(before a positive pregnancy test) \n \n PARACETAMOL: experience suggests this can be used at any time during \npregnancy or breastfeeding [NTIS, 2004; Schaefer et al, 2007]. \n NSAIDS: The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS, formerly the National \nTeratology Information Service [NTIS]), reviewed safety data of NSAIDs from \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \npublished research and post marketing surveillance systems. They concluded that \n'the available data do not indicate that exposure to ibuprofen before 30 weeks of \npregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects or \nspontaneous abortions' [NTIS, 2004]. \n ANTIBIOTICS: The RCOG recommends that the risk of giving any of their \nrecommended antibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (before a positive \npregnancy test) is low, since significant drug toxicity results in failed implantation \n[RCOG, 2009], and BASHH states that the risk of giving any of the recommended \nantibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (prior to a pregnancy test becoming \npositive) is justified by the need to provide effective therapy and the low risk to \nthe fetus [BASHH, 2011a]. \n CEFTRIAXONE has not specifically been studied during pregnancy. However, the \nrisk associated with use of cephalosporins during pregnancy is thought to be low \nand, although data are limited for individual agents such as ceftriaxone, the \ncephalosporins as a class are considered to be an appropriate choice during \npregnancy [NTIS, 2008b]. Although ceftriaxone crosses the placental barrier, it \nhas not been associated with adverse events on fetal development in laboratory \nanimals [ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2009]. \n DOXYCYCLINE is contraindicated beyond the 15th week of gestation because, \nfrom the 16th week of pregnancy it causes tooth and bone discolouration and \ninhibits bone growth. However, it can be used in the first trimester. Inadvertent \nfirst-trimester use of tetracyclines occurs frequently and has not been associated \nwith an increased risk of congenital malformations [Schaefer et al, 2007]. \n METRONIDAZOLE has been in clinical use for a long time, and experience \nsuggests that it is not teratogenic in humans [Schaefer et al, 2007]. A recent \nprospective controlled study in 228 women exposed to metronidazole in \npregnancy, 86% of whom had first trimester exposure, confirms these findings \n[Schaefer et al, 2007]. \n OFLOXACIN has only limited pregnancy-exposure data. Quinolones have caused \narthropathy in animal studies. However, a recent study (most of the data are on \nciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but some are on ofloxacin) did not find that \nquinolone use in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an \nincreased risk of malformations or other adverse effects on pregnancy outcome \n[Schaefer et al, 2007]. \n There are fewer published data on the use of AZITHROMYCIN rather than \nERYTHROMYCIN during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The limited published data \nand follow-up data collected by the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS, \nformerly the National Teratology Information Service [NTIS]), do not \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \ndemonstrate an increased risk of congenital malformations following exposure to \nazithromycin in human pregnancy [NTIS, 2008a]. \n11.0 IUCD and PID \nRemoval of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with better short term clinical \noutcomes. The decision to remove the IUCD should be balanced against the risk of \npregnancy in those who have had otherwise unprotected intercourse in the preceding seven \ndays. Hormonal emergency contraception may be appropriate for some women in this \nsituation (BASHH). \n \n11.1 NICE guidance on IUCD and PID: \n Evidence on whether or not to remove intrauterine contraception in a woman who has \npelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is limited and conflicting. There are no long term data on \nthe effects on fertility. \n Expert opinion differs regarding the management of women with PID who have \nintrauterine contraception: \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), does not routinely \nrecommend the removal of intrauterine contraception. The Faculty's Clinical \nEffectiveness Unit supports the continued use of intrauterine contraception and \nappropriate antibiotic treatment if PID is suspected; there is no need to remove \nthe device unless symptoms fail to resolve within 72 hours, or the woman wants \nit removed [FFPRHC, 2006; FSRH, 2007]. \n The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG, 2009] advises \nthat consideration should be given to removing the device, especially if \nsymptoms have not resolved within 72 hours. \n The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends considering \nremoving the device if the woman develops PID. They advise balancing the \ndecision to remove the device against the risk of pregnancy if the woman has \nhad sexual intercourse in the preceding 7 days [BASHH, 2011a]. \n The World Health Organisation - selected practice recommendations for \ncontraceptive use state that [WHO, 2004]: \no There is no need for removal of the intrauterine contraception if the \nwoman wishes to continue its use. \no If the woman wishes removal, it should be removed after antibiotic \ntreatment has been started. \no If the infection does not improve, generally the course would be to \nremove the device and continue antibiotic treatment. If the device is not \nremoved, the antibiotic should also be continued. In both cases the \nwoman should be monitored closely. \n12.0 Follow Up \n \nAll patients with a suspected diagnosis of PID should be referred to the liaison \nhealth advisors at the Claude Nicole Centre (CNC) (This involves faxing the PID \nproforma to 01273 664720). \n \nFor moderate to severe disease treated as an outpatient, patients should be re-assessed \nat 48h and be investigated further if not responding to treatment. This should be \nundertaken by the gynaecology team. \n \nFor patients who require prolonged inpatient stays or with severe disease, review by \nthe health advisors may be possible on the ward. \n \nAll patients will be reviewed at two weeks, by CNC, to assess: \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n \n Treatment compliance for both her and current sexual partner \n Clinical progress \n Whether patient has had sexual intercourse before review \n Whether partner(s) have received treatment \n To address any concerns the patient may have \n To re-iterate safer sex messages \n \n13.0 Training \nPlease refer to the Training Needs Analysis document for details on staff training in \nrelation to this protocol. \n \n14.0 Monitoring Compliance \nPlease refer to the Monitoring and Auditing document for details on monitoring \ncompliance for this protocol \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \n \nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \n\n15.0 References \n \nThe guidance in this document is based on best practice and current RCOG clinical \nguidelines \nhttp://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded- \nfiles/T32PelvicInflamatoryDisease2008MinorRevision.pdf. \nhttp://www.bashh.org/documents/3205 \nhttp://www.ffprhc.org.uk/admin/uploads/CEUGuidanceDrugInteractionsHormonal. \npdf \n \nNational Teratology Information Service – personal communication 7\nth \nAugust & 7\nth\n \nSeptember 2009 \n \nIn addition some primary research has been used \n1.

They are not \\ndesigned to be prescriptive and you are not expected to use them in exclusion of \\ndiscussions with senior colleagues. \\n \\nEvidence used to inform these guidelines had been drawn from RCOG, BASHH or NICE \\nguidelines. Where applicable other references are quoted. \\n \\nSCOPE \\nThis guideline applies to women attending with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, \\nwhich may be managed as an inpatient or outpatient. It covers recommendations on \\ndiagnosis, treatment, and health promotion principles required for effective \\nmanagement. \\n \\nRESPONSIBILITIES \\n \\nGynaecologists, Nurses & Midwives: \\n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance \\n To use their professional judgement in application of this guidance \\n \\nManagement: \\n To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and national \\nrecommendations \\n To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n1.0 Objective Standards \\n1.1 Definition \\n The clinical syndrome associated with ascending infection from the endocervix, \\ncausing endometritis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and/or pelvic \\nperitonitis. \\n \\n1.2 Epidemiology \\nThe incidence of PID is unknown and probably grossly underestimated as figures \\nare either based on inpatient episodes or cases treated in GUM outpatients. \\nMany cases are treated in primary care and ~50% women have sub-clinical or \\nunrecognised disease. It is estimated to account for 1:60 GP visits by females \\nunder 45 years. \\n \\nRates are probably increasing, reflecting increasing incidence of sexually \\ntransmitted diseases, particularly Chlamydia. Behavioural factors that increase \\nthe risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as younger age at first sexual \\nintercourse, multiple sexual partners, and frequency of partner change, are all \\nassociated with increased risk of PID. \\n \\n1.3 Pathogenesis \\nPID is commonly initiated by an STI, which predisposes to further colonisation by \\norganisms that would normally be non-pathogenic. The isolation of anaerobes \\ntends to be associated with more severe disease and anaerobes are invariably \\npresent in tubo-ovarian abscesses. The risk of PID is also increased by other \\nfactors that breech cervical host defences, such as IUCD insertion, childbirth, \\nmiscarriage, surgical procedures, and TOP. \\n \\n2.0 Isolation Rates \\n \\n Chlamydia trachomatis: 40% (14-65%) using EIA, DIF & culture (higher with \\nNAATs) \\n Neisseria gonorrhoea: 14% \\n Anaerobes: 60% \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n Mycoplasma: 10-15% \\n No organisms isolated: 25-50% \\nComplications \\n Infertility (risk after 1 episode 8%, 2 episodes \\n 9.5%, 3 episodes 40%), \\n Ectopic pregnancy (9.5 times more likely) \\n Chronic pelvic pain (9.8 times more likely) \\n \\nWith each infection, host defences become increasingly damaged and the risk of \\ncomplications rises with each subsequent insult. \\n3.0 Diagnosis \\nPID may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Even when present, clinical symptoms and signs \\nlack sensitivity or specificity (positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis is 65-90% \\ncompared to laparoscopic diagnosis). \\n \\nTesting for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the lower genital tract is recommended since a \\npositive result support diagnosis. The absence of infection at this site does not exclude PID \\nhowever. \\n \\nAn elevated ESR or CRP also supports diagnosis but is non-specific \\nThe absence of endocervical or vaginal pus cells has a good negative predictive value (95%) \\nfor a diagnosis of PID but their presence is non-specific (poor positive predictive value - \\n17%) \\n \\n3.1 Sexual History \\n The number of sexual partners within the last 3 months \\n The duration of each relationship \\n The date of last sexual intercourse with each partner \\n Whether barrier contraception used within each relationship \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n4.0 Clinical Features \\nThe following features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID \\n4.1 Symptoms \\n Lower abdominal pain, usually bilateral \\n Deep dyspareunia \\n Abnormal vaginal bleeding, including post coital, inter-menstrual and \\nmenorrhagia \\n Abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, which is often purulent \\n \\n 4.2 Signs \\n Lower abdominal tenderness, which is usually bilateral \\n Adnexal tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination \\n Cervical motion tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination \\n Fever >38°C \\n \\nA diagnosis of PID, and empirical treatment, should be considered and offered in any young \\nwoman (under 25 years of age) who is sexually active and has recent onset of bilateral lower \\nabdominal pain associated with local tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination, in whom \\npregnancy has been excluded. \\n \\n 4.2.1 Complicating Factors \\n IUCD - Removal of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with \\nbetter short term clinical outcomes. The decision to remove the IUCD should \\nbe balanced against the risk of pregnancy in those who have had otherwise \\nunprotected intercourse in the preceding seven days. Hormonal emergency \\ncontraception may be appropriate for some women in this situation \\n HIV - women with HIV may have more severe symptoms associated with PID, \\nbut respond well to standard antibiotic therapy. No change in treatment \\nregime is required. \\n Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome - this comprises right upper quadrant pain \\nassociated with perihepatitis. Although laparoscopic division of hepatic \\nadhesions has been performed, there is insufficient clinical trial evidence to \\nmake specific recommendations for treatment beyond those for \\nuncomplicated PID \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n5.0 Investigations \\n Urinalysis, including pregnancy test \\n Bloods, including FBC and CRP \\n Observations, temperature \\n Routine swabs \\no Endocervical Chlamydia & gonorrhoea \\no High vaginal swab (black charcoal) \\n Pelvic Ultrasound, particularly if symptoms/signs of moderate/severe \\ndisease \\n6.0 Management \\nIt is likely that delaying treatment increases the long term sequelae, such as ectopic \\npregnancy, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, a low threshold for empiric \\ntreatment is recommended. Broad spectrum antibiotics are required to cover N. \\ngonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and a variety of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria commonly \\nfound in the upper genital tract in women with PID. \\nTreatment must be effective (>95% cure rate), easy to take, have low side effects, and be \\ngiven promptly. \\n \\nIf gonococcus diagnosed on NAATs the patient should be reviewed by genitourinary \\nmedicine so cultures can be taken for gonorrhoea & contact tracing carried out. Please \\ncontact the liaison Health Advisor on 07789 995086 or ext. 4716 \\n\\n6.1 Outpatient Management \\nPatients seen in A&E and treated as outpatient must be provided with emergency \\ndrug packs. \\n \\n6.2 Inpatient Management \\n If any of the following features are present, consider admission, IV antibiotics \\nand/or laparoscopy: \\n \\nSevere or atypical disease\\n \\n \\nTemp> 38\\no\\nC\\n \\n \\nNausea & vomiting, \\n \\n \\nPeritonism \\n \\n \\nWBC >15\\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n Pregnant or adolescent patient \\n If the diagnosis is uncertain, pelvic abscess suspected or there is a \\npossibility of a surgical emergency \\n If the patient has not responded to out-patient therapy, or is intolerant to \\noral therapy \\n6.3 General Advice \\n Rest advised for those with severe disease. \\n Both patient and partner should abstain from sexual contact until \\ncompletion of treatment and review \\n Explanation of the treatment and its possible adverse effects \\n Patient must avoid alcohol if being treated with metronidazole \\n Potential OCP interactions with antibiotics (advise to abstain from sexual \\ncontact whilst on antibiotics) \\n Importance of compliance to treatment \\n Importance of follow up \\n All patients must be asked to give consent for follow up for themselves and \\nsexual contacts. \\n It is essential that sexual partners also receive treatment, whether or not an \\norganism is identified on tests (they should contact CNC for treatment) \\n7.0 Patient information \\n \\nEnsure patients receive patient information leaflet - click here for RCOG \\nleaflet (https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patient-information-\\nleaflets/gynaecology/pi-acute-pid.pdf). \\n \\nWe should discuss long term sequelae of PID with the patient, including the following: \\n Following treatment, fertility is usually maintained but there remains a risk of \\nfuture infertility, chronic pelvic pain or ectopic pregnancy \\n Clinically more severe disease is associated with a greater risk of sequelae \\n Repeated episodes of PID are associated with an exponential increase in the \\nrisk of infertility \\n The earlier treatment is given, the lower the risk of future fertility problems \\n Future use of barrier contraception will significantly reduce risk of PID \\n The need to screen/treat her sexual contacts for infection to prevent her \\nbecoming re-infected \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n8.0 Analgesia \\nAll patients should be offered adequate analgesia and anti-emetics eg: \\n Metoclopramide oral / IM 10mg TDS or cyclizine 50mg IM/PO TDS \\n Ibuprofen 400mg TDS \\n Paracetamol oral / IV 1g QDs\\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n9.0 Antibiotic Treatment Regimens \\n9.1 Antibiotic guidance \\n 1st Line Penicillin Allergy \\nOutpatient \\n \\nNon-pregnant \\nOfloxacin\\n \\noral 400mg bd for 14 \\ndays \\n+ \\nMetronidazole oral 400mg bd for 5 days \\n \\nPregnant \\nOr Ofloxacin \\nContraindicated \\nCeftriaxone 500mg IM stat \\n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \\ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \\n+ \\nClarithromycin oral 500mg bd for \\n14 days \\n+ \\nMetronidazole oral 400mg bd for 5 days \\nInpatient \\n\\nNon-Pregnant \\nCeftriaxone IV 2g od for 14 days \\n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \\ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \\n+ \\nOfloxacin IV 400mg bd for 14 days \\n+ \\nMetronidazole IV 500mg tds for 14 days \\n\\n Pregnant \\nOr Ofloxacin \\nContraindicated \\nCeftriaxone IV 2g od for 14 days \\n(omit if penicillin allergy, IgE mediated e.g anaphylaxis, if \\ngonococcus diagnosed on NAAT, discuss with GUM) \\n+ \\nClarithromycin IV 500mg bd for \\n14 days \\n+ \\nMetronidazole IV 500mg tds for \\n14 days \\n*\\nUK gonorrhoea resistance to quinolones in heterosexual women is about 15% \\ntherefore if patient is high risk for gonorrhoea (patient’s partner has \\ngonorrhoea, clinically severe disease, following sexual contact abroad), discuss \\nalternative regimens with genitourinary medicine. \\n \\n9.2 Penicillin Allergy \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\nReaction Which antibiotic can be given \\n Penicillin Cephalosporin Other beta-\\nlactams \\nAnaphylaxis No No No \\nUrticaria No No No \\nPruritic rash (immediate) No No No \\nLaryngeal oedema/ \\nangioedema/bronchospasm \\nNo No No \\nMinor rash (non- confluent, \\nnon-pruritic, restricted to \\nsmall area of the body) \\nWith caution in \\nserious infection \\nYes Yes \\nRash occurring > 72 hours \\npost penicillin exposure \\nWith caution in \\nserious infection \\nYes Yes \\nNausea, vomiting, \\ndiarrhoaea \\nYes Yes Yes \\n\\n9.3 IV TO ORAL SWITCH \\n \\n IV antibiotics should be switched to oral equivalents and complete 14 days \\nafter 48 hours if:- \\n Temperature < 38°c for at least 24 hours \\n Clinical improvement observed \\n WCC & CRP improving \\n Haemodynamically stable \\n Oral route viable (no evidence of malabsorption, vomiting or unsafe \\nswallow) \\n \\n10.0 NICE guidance on drug choice during very early pregnancy \\n(before a positive pregnancy test) \\n \\n PARACETAMOL: experience suggests this can be used at any time during \\npregnancy or breastfeeding [NTIS, 2004; Schaefer et al, 2007]. \\n NSAIDS: The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS, formerly the National \\nTeratology Information Service [NTIS]), reviewed safety data of NSAIDs from \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\npublished research and post marketing surveillance systems. They concluded that \\n'the available data do not indicate that exposure to ibuprofen before 30 weeks of \\npregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects or \\nspontaneous abortions' [NTIS, 2004]. \\n ANTIBIOTICS: The RCOG recommends that the risk of giving any of their \\nrecommended antibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (before a positive \\npregnancy test) is low, since significant drug toxicity results in failed implantation \\n[RCOG, 2009], and BASHH states that the risk of giving any of the recommended \\nantibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (prior to a pregnancy test becoming \\npositive) is justified by the need to provide effective therapy and the low risk to \\nthe fetus [BASHH, 2011a]. \\n CEFTRIAXONE has not specifically been studied during pregnancy. However, the \\nrisk associated with use of cephalosporins during pregnancy is thought to be low \\nand, although data are limited for individual agents such as ceftriaxone, the \\ncephalosporins as a class are considered to be an appropriate choice during \\npregnancy [NTIS, 2008b]. Although ceftriaxone crosses the placental barrier, it \\nhas not been associated with adverse events on fetal development in laboratory \\nanimals [ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2009]. \\n DOXYCYCLINE is contraindicated beyond the 15th week of gestation because, \\nfrom the 16th week of pregnancy it causes tooth and bone discolouration and \\ninhibits bone growth. However, it can be used in the first trimester. Inadvertent \\nfirst-trimester use of tetracyclines occurs frequently and has not been associated \\nwith an increased risk of congenital malformations [Schaefer et al, 2007]. \\n METRONIDAZOLE has been in clinical use for a long time, and experience \\nsuggests that it is not teratogenic in humans [Schaefer et al, 2007]. A recent \\nprospective controlled study in 228 women exposed to metronidazole in \\npregnancy, 86% of whom had first trimester exposure, confirms these findings \\n[Schaefer et al, 2007]. \\n OFLOXACIN has only limited pregnancy-exposure data. Quinolones have caused \\narthropathy in animal studies. However, a recent study (most of the data are on \\nciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but some are on ofloxacin) did not find that \\nquinolone use in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an \\nincreased risk of malformations or other adverse effects on pregnancy outcome \\n[Schaefer et al, 2007]. \\n There are fewer published data on the use of AZITHROMYCIN rather than \\nERYTHROMYCIN during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The limited published data \\nand follow-up data collected by the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS, \\nformerly the National Teratology Information Service [NTIS]), do not \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\ndemonstrate an increased risk of congenital malformations following exposure to \\nazithromycin in human pregnancy [NTIS, 2008a]. \\n11.0 IUCD and PID \\nRemoval of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with better short term clinical \\noutcomes. The decision to remove the IUCD should be balanced against the risk of \\npregnancy in those who have had otherwise unprotected intercourse in the preceding seven \\ndays. Hormonal emergency contraception may be appropriate for some women in this \\nsituation (BASHH). \\n \\n11.1 NICE guidance on IUCD and PID: \\n Evidence on whether or not to remove intrauterine contraception in a woman who has \\npelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is limited and conflicting. There are no long term data on \\nthe effects on fertility. \\n Expert opinion differs regarding the management of women with PID who have \\nintrauterine contraception: \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), does not routinely \\nrecommend the removal of intrauterine contraception. The Faculty's Clinical \\nEffectiveness Unit supports the continued use of intrauterine contraception and \\nappropriate antibiotic treatment if PID is suspected; there is no need to remove \\nthe device unless symptoms fail to resolve within 72 hours, or the woman wants \\nit removed [FFPRHC, 2006; FSRH, 2007]. \\n The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG, 2009] advises \\nthat consideration should be given to removing the device, especially if \\nsymptoms have not resolved within 72 hours. \\n The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends considering \\nremoving the device if the woman develops PID. They advise balancing the \\ndecision to remove the device against the risk of pregnancy if the woman has \\nhad sexual intercourse in the preceding 7 days [BASHH, 2011a]. \\n The World Health Organisation - selected practice recommendations for \\ncontraceptive use state that [WHO, 2004]: \\no There is no need for removal of the intrauterine contraception if the \\nwoman wishes to continue its use. \\no If the woman wishes removal, it should be removed after antibiotic \\ntreatment has been started. \\no If the infection does not improve, generally the course would be to \\nremove the device and continue antibiotic treatment. If the device is not \\nremoved, the antibiotic should also be continued. In both cases the \\nwoman should be monitored closely. \\n12.0 Follow Up \\n \\nAll patients with a suspected diagnosis of PID should be referred to the liaison \\nhealth advisors at the Claude Nicole Centre (CNC) (This involves faxing the PID \\nproforma to 01273 664720). \\n \\nFor moderate to severe disease treated as an outpatient, patients should be re-assessed \\nat 48h and be investigated further if not responding to treatment. This should be \\nundertaken by the gynaecology team. \\n \\nFor patients who require prolonged inpatient stays or with severe disease, review by \\nthe health advisors may be possible on the ward. \\n \\nAll patients will be reviewed at two weeks, by CNC, to assess: \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n \\n Treatment compliance for both her and current sexual partner \\n Clinical progress \\n Whether patient has had sexual intercourse before review \\n Whether partner(s) have received treatment \\n To address any concerns the patient may have \\n To re-iterate safer sex messages \\n \\n13.0 Training \\nPlease refer to the Training Needs Analysis document for details on staff training in \\nrelation to this protocol. \\n \\n14.0 Monitoring Compliance \\nPlease refer to the Monitoring and Auditing document for details on monitoring \\ncompliance for this protocol \\n\\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS \\nMaternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\nDate of Issue: May Review Date: May \\n \\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease GP003 \\n\\n15.0 References \\n \\nThe guidance in this document is based on best practice and current RCOG clinical \\nguidelines \\nhttp://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded- \\nfiles/T32PelvicInflamatoryDisease2008MinorRevision.pdf. \\nhttp://www.bashh.org/documents/3205 \\nhttp://www.ffprhc.org.uk/admin/uploads/CEUGuidanceDrugInteractionsHormonal. \\npdf \\n \\nNational Teratology Information Service – personal communication 7\\nth \\nAugust & 7\\nth\\n \\nSeptember 2009 \\n \\nIn addition some primary research has been used \\n1.
