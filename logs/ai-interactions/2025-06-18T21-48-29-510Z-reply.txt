Hepatitis B vaccination for baby if indicated. - **Perinatal Care**: Avoid pethidine/diamorphine in opiate-dependent mothers; do not give naloxone. - **Postnatal Care**: Keep mother and baby together. Observe for withdrawal; start scoring and pharmacological treatment if needed. - **Opiate withdrawal**: Start morphine (125 mcg/kg/day, 4x daily) and wean based on NAS scores. - **Non-opiate withdrawal**: Phenobarbitone for alcohol, chlorpromazine for benzodiazepines. - **Breastfeeding**: Assess safety based on maternal medication. - **Discharge Criteria**: Stable NAS scores, normal feeding/sleeping, no morphine dose changes for 36 hours. Ensure social support and follow-up. - **Audit/Monitoring**: Track antenatal tasks, NAS scoring, and discharge planning. **Patient Information**: Provide counseling and educational materials on NAS",
