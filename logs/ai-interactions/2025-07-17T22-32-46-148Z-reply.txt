  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\n**Medical Clerking – SBAR Format**  \n\n**SITUATION:**  \n- **Patient:** 38-year-old female (G3P2)  \n- **Presenting Complaint:** Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) for 6 months, worsening over last 2 cycles with flooding/clots. Now presents with fatigue and dizziness.  \n- **Key Issue:** Symptomatic anaemia (Hb 82 g/L on GP FBC) secondary to menorrhagia. No acute haemodynamic instability.  \n\n**BACKGROUND:**  \n- **Obstetric/Gynae Hx:**  \n  - LMP: 7 days ago (prolonged 10-day bleeding). Regular 28-day cycles.  \n  - No intermenstrual/postcoital bleeding.  \n  - Previous LSCS x2 (elective). No miscarriages.  \n- **Medical Hx:** Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD). No known bleeding disorders.  \n- **Drugs:** Levothyroxine, NSAIDs PRN for dysmenorrhoea. No anticoagulants.  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA  \n- **Family Hx:** No Hx of gynae malignancies or bleeding disorders.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **Observations:**  \n  - BP 112/68, HR 88, SpO2 98% RA, Temp 36.7°C.  \n  - CRT <2s, no pallor on conjunctival inspection.  \n- **Examination:**  \n  - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n  - PV: Not performed (awaiting USS). No active bleeding on inspection.  \n- **Investigations:**  \n  - **GP FBC (today):** Hb 82 (↓), MCV 78 (↓), Ferritin 12 (↓) – microcytic anaemia.  \n  - **Pending:** TVUSS (to exclude fibroids/adenomyosis), TFTs (ensure euthyroid), coagulation screen (if indicated).  \n- **Differentials:**  \n  1. Fibroids (leiomyoma) – most likely.  \n  2. Adenomyosis.  \n  3. Thyroid dysfunction (unlikely if compliant).  \n  4. Coagulopathy (e.g., von Willebrand’s) – less likely but consider if no structural cause.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Immediate:**  \n   - Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 200mg BD) for anaemia.  \n   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS during menses.  \n   - Consider hormonal therapy (e.g., POP or Mirena IUS) if no contraindications post-USS.  \n2. **Investigations:**  \n   - Urgent TVUSS (booked for tomorrow).  \n   - Repeat FBC in 2/52 to monitor Hb.  \n   - TFTs, coagulation screen if USS inconclusive.  \n3. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Gynae clinic in 2/52 with USS results.  \n   - Advise ED re attendance if syncope/severe bleeding.  \n   - Consider endometrial biopsy if >40y or USS abnormal.  \n\n**Impression:** Secondary anaemia due to menorrhagia – likely structural cause. Exclude malignancy in line with NICE guidelines.  \n\n---  \n*Note: Fictional case for educational purposes.*\n\nGuideline Analysis:\nClinical transcript analysis for guideline compliance check against: UHS Anaemia in pregnancy guideline.

Pregnancy \n1.0 Aim \n \nTo provide evidence based and up to date guidance for healthcare professionals in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of anaemia during pregnancy and in the postnatal period. This \nguidance also covers guidance for pregnant women and people who are at risk of becoming \niron deficient, or who are non-anaemic with iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anaemia has \nbeen linked to poor maternal and fetal outcomes. \n \n2.0 Scope \n \nThis guideline applies to: \n \n• Midwives \n• Obstetricians \n• General Practitioners \n \n3.0 Introduction \n \nAnaemia is defined as a low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. The lower limit of current \nreference range is two standard deviations below the mean in a healthy population (WHO, \n2015). The definitions in pregnancy are: \n \n Hb <110 g/l in the first trimester \n Hb <105 g/l in second and third trimester \n Hb <100 g/l postpartum. \n \nPrevalence \n \n• Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy. \n• Globally, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and is the \nleading cause of anaemia. An estimated 40% of women and people worldwide are \nanaemic (WHO, 2015). \n• In the UK Nair et al conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 14,001 women \nand people with singleton pregnancies >24 weeks at Guy’s and St Thomas and \nWolverhampton hospitals between 2013 and 2015. They found that 46% of \nwomen and people had anaemia at some point during their pregnancy (Nair \net al., 2015). \n \n4.0 Abbreviations used in this guideline \n \nBJH - British Journal of Haematology EBL - Estimated blood loss \nFBC - Full blood count Fe - Iron \nGI - Gastrointestinal Hb - Haemoglobin \nHSR - Hypersensitivity reaction TIBC - Total iron-binding capacity \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 5 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\nIM - Intra Muscular \nIOL - Induction of labour \nIV - Intravenous \nMCH - Mean corpuscular haemoglobin \nMCHC - Mean corpuscular haemoglobin \nconcentration \nMCV - Mean cell volume \nMEOWS - Modified Early Obstetric \nWarning Score \nMET - Medical emergency team \nOD - Once a day \nPPH - Postpartum Haemorrhage \nPO - By mouth \nRBC - Red Blood Cells \nRDA - Recommended daily amount \nSLE - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus \nIBW - Ideal birth weight \nMIS - Maternity Information System eg \nBadgernet \n \n5.0 Responsibilities \n \nMidwives & obstetricians have a responsibility to: \n \n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. \n• To use their professional judgement in application of this guideline. \n \nManagement have a responsibility to: \n \n• To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations. \n• To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. \n\n6.0 Background \n6.1 Causes of anaemia in pregnancy \nIron Deficiency \nThe most common cause of anaemia during pregnancy is deficiency of iron. In iron \ndepletion, the body's stored iron is reduced and individuals are at greater risk of anaemia in \nsituations of increased demand, such as pregnancy. Iron utilisation is significantly increased \nduring pregnancy, as iron is required for fetal growth and development and for maternal and \nbirthing parent erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, can cause maternal \nand birthing parent fatigue. Anaemia is also associated with poorer maternal and birthing \nparent and perinatal outcomes including preterm birth, small for gestational age neonates, \nperinatal death, maternal and birthing parent postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) and need for \nblood transfusion. \n \nOther cause of anaemia \n \nLess common causes of anaemia include vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the presence of \na variant haemoglobin or thalassaemia, inflammatory disorders such as Crohn’s or ulcerative \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 6 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\ncolitis, malabsorption, haemolysis and blood loss. If there are uncertainties seek medical \nadvice. \n\nB12 related anaemia \n \nIn the young maternal and birthing parent population with a reasonably normal diet this is an \nunlikely cause of anaemia. Serum B12 levels are physiologically reduced in pregnancy (table \nbelow) and confirming significant deficiency is not reliably possible in pregnancy (BJH). \nSenior medical advice should be sought if there are particular reasons why B12 anaemia \nmight be present (other red blood cell changes (macrocytosis), previous gastric surgery or \nconditions influencing normal gastric secretion and absorption and ileal small bowel \ndisease). \n \nAdvice from the British Journal of haematology concludes that during pregnancy, in the \npresence of a strong suspicion of underlying deficiency, a short course of empirical \nhydroxocobalamin should be given, with further investigations post-partum – either one \nintramuscular 1 mg hydroxocobalamin or oral cyanocobalamin 50-150 micrograms daily. \n \nVitamin B12 , cobalamin (serum) \nUnits \nNon-pregnant \nAdult \nFirst Trimester Second Trimester Third Trimester \nng/L \n279 - 966 118 - 438 130 - 656 99 – 526 \npmol/L \n206 - 713 87 - 323 96 - 484 73 – 388 \n\n6.2 Clinical signs and symptoms \n \nAnaemia may be asymptomatic, and therefore only diagnosed at routine screening. The \nsigns and symptoms of anaemia are non-specific. However, fatigue is the most common \nsymptom reported by patients. Other symptoms include dizziness, syncope, palpitations, \nshortness of breath and headaches. These symptoms may occur even in women and people \nwith low Fe (iron) stores but as yet normal Hb. \n\n6.3 Consequences of anaemia \n \nMaternal and birthing parent anaemia has been associated with a significantly higher risk of \nperinatal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight and pre‐term birth, and maternal and \nbirthing parent morbidity and mortality. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 7 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\n7.0 Diagnosis \n7.1 Screening \n \nAll women and people are recommended to have a FBC taken at booking and 28 weeks, to \nscreen for anaemia. If a woman and person is found to be anaemic at screening they should \nbe started on oral iron, this is helpful for both diagnosis and management. A rise in Hb \nshould be seen after 2-3 weeks when it should be rechecked: this supports the diagnosis of \niron deficiency. \n \nAnaemia in pregnancy is diagnosed if: \n \n• Hb <110 g/l in the first trimester \n• Hb <105 g/l in second and third trimester \n\n7.2 Haemoglobinopathy \n \nWomen and people with a known haemoglobinopathy should have a serum ferritin taken to \nidentify concomitant iron deficiency and exclude iron loading states. In these patients oral \niron should not be started without a ferritin result and they should be referred to the maternal \nmedicine consultant. Anaemia can be ‘normal’ for people with haemoglobinopathies. \n\n7.3 Non-anaemic women and people at risk of iron deficiency \n \nAt booking women and people who are at high risk for iron deficiency should be identified. \nThe British Haematology Society gives guidance on the management of women and people \nat risk of iron deficiency. Their advice states that this group of women and people should be \nstarted on a prophylactic dose of iron empirically or have serum ferritin checked first and iron \nreplaced if ferritin <30 even if Hb is in normal range (Pavord et al., 2020). This should be \nwith oral Iron. \n \nFerritin of <30 is indicative of iron deficiency. \n \nRisks of iron deficiency include: \n \n• Previous anaemia \n• Multiparity > or equal to 3 \n• Twin pregnancy \n• <1 year since last pregnancy \n• Poor diet \n• Vegetarian/vegan diet \n• Pregnant teenagers \n• Recent history of significant bleeding \n• Declines blood products \n• Previous bariatric surgery \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 8 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\nNon‐anaemic women and people where serum ferritin analysis may be necessary: \n \n• High risk of bleeding during pregnancy or at birth. \n• Women and people declining blood products, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. \n• Women and people for whom providing compatible blood is challenging. \n\n7.4 Laboratory testing \nRed cell indices \nA low Hb, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell \nhaemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are suggestive of iron deficiency, but need to be \ninterpreted with caution in view of the physiological increase of MCV in pregnancy, of around \n6 fl (Chanarin et al, 1977). Microcytic, hypochromic indices may also occur in \nhaemoglobinopathies. \n \nFerritin <30 \n \nA low ferritin (<30) despite having a normal Hb is diagnostic of iron deficiency. These women \nand people should be started on oral iron. However if the woman and person is symptomatic \nthey may be considered for an iron infusion as first line. These patients should be discussed \nwith a consultant if any concerns. Beware that a normal ferritin level does not exclude iron \ndeficiency because it is an acute phase protein which can be raised in pregnancy. \nUnselected routine screening with ferritin is not recommended. \n \nOther biomarkers \n \nTransferrin saturation, serum Fe, TIBC etc. have not been formally evaluated in pregnancy \nand should not be used therefore do not request. \n\n8.0 Management of iron deficiency in pregnancy \n8.1 Dietary Advice \n \nAll women and people should receive dietary advice at their booking appointment. In \npregnancy the physiological iron requirements increase from 1-2 mg to 6 mg per day, with \nincreasing demand as pregnancy progresses. The recommended daily intake (RDA) of iron \nin pregnancy is 27 mg (twice that of a non-pregnant woman and person). Once a woman \nand person becomes iron-deficient it is not possible to ensure that repletion is through diet \nalone and oral supplementation is needed. \n \nIron Rich Foods include: \n \n• Meat \n• Nuts \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 9 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\nRecommended dose of oral Iron: \n200mg Ferrous sulphate / 210mg Ferrous Fumarate orally once per day in the \nmorning on empty stomach with vitamin C \nNote: This can be reduced to an alternate day dosage if patient is having difficulty with \nside effects \n \n• Beans \n• Dried fruit \n• Wholegrain foods \n• Fortified breakfast cereals \n• Soybean flour \n• Most dark green leafy vegetables \n \nReducing tea and coffee intake can also help to improve iron levels. Over the counter iron \nsupplements are not sufficient once iron deficiency has occurred. \n\n8.2 Oral Iron Replacement \n \nIf anaemia is diagnosed, oral iron replacement therapy should be recommended: \n\nOral iron preparations are safe and effective but often have significant side effects. Recent \nstudies have shown that a lower daily or alternate day dose is associated with better \nabsorption with less side-effects. Therefore an elemental iron dose of 40-80 mg each \nmorning or alternate day is recommended. Preparations are shown in the table below. \nHigher doses are not necessarily absorbed and have worse side effects due to the excess \nunabsorbed iron remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nIRON SALT PREPARATION ELEMENTAL IRON CONTENT* \nFerrous Fumarate 210 mg 65 mg \nFerrous Gluconate 300 mg 35 mg \nFerrous Sulphate 200 mg 65 mg \nFerrous Feredetate 190 mg/5ml 27.5 mg/5ml \nPregaday® \n(includes 350mcg Folic acid) \n322mg \n100mg \nFor vegetarians or vegans: please note that there can be animal derived excipients in solid \nform iron preparations eg gelatin shellac and lactose. Please discuss with pharmacist for a \nsuitable alternative. \n8.3 Side effects of oral iron \n \nTypical side effects include gastric irritation, nausea, and disturbed bowel function. Side \neffects are normally directly related to the elemental dose of iron in each preparation. \nTherefore, it is recommended that dose should be reduced to alternate day dosing if a \n\nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\npatient is having difficulty with side effects with daily dose. Advise women and people that it \nis common for their stool to change colour on iron therapy. \n \nWomen and people should be warned about the most likely side effects and given written \ninformation about iron supplements in pregnancy. Advice should be given to take oral iron \nsupplementation on an empty stomach, with water or a source of vitamin C to enhance \nabsorption. \n\n8.4 Hb Monitoring \n \nFBC should be re-checked 2-3 weeks after commencing oral iron. If iron deficiency is the \ncause of anaemia a patient’s Hb should rise after treatment with compliance with daily oral \niron for 2-3 weeks. \n \nThe timing of further checks will depend upon the degree of anaemia and period of \ngestation. Once the Hb is in the normal range, treatment should be continued for a further 3 \nmonths and until at least until 6 weeks postpartum to replenish iron stores. \n \nCompliance \n \nIn cases of a poor response on oral iron, maternal and birthing parent compliance should be \nchecked. If there is good compliance and poor response alternative causes of anaemia \nshould be considered. Discussion with senior medical staff is recommended if there are \nuncertainties. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 10 of 23 \n\nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 \nmia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 \nPage 11 of 23 \nHb ≥110 g/L \n•Commence Ferrous Sulphate 200mg OD. \n•Advise to take with water or a source of Vitamin \nC (e.g. orange juice) on an empty stomach.

Oral \ntherapy is preferred and should be tried first if there is no reason to the contrary. If IV iron \ntherapy is required, the woman and person should be advised that oral iron therapy should \nbe withheld for 5 days post IV iron infusion. Hb levels should be rechecked in 3-4 weeks post \niron therapy. \n \n9.1 Indications \n \nIV iron therapy is indicated when there is non-compliance and or intolerance of oral \npreparations, proven malabsorption (which includes post-bariatric surgery), GI diseases \nsuch as Crohns/ulcerative colitis or in late gestation (>34 weeks) where a more rapid Hb \nresponse is required (Pavord et al., 2020). IV iron is also indicated where there is a poor \nresponse to oral Iron. \n \nThresholds for IV iron therapy should be individualised according to medical and obstetric \nfactors, but should be considered in the third trimester in women and people who present \nafter 34 weeks’ gestation with confirmed iron deficiency and a Hb<100 g/l. Ideally IV iron \ntherapy should be administered 3-4 weeks prior to birth to allow time for absorption. \n \nAny woman and person consented for IV iron therapy should be given the Trusts patient \ninformation leaflet ‘'Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia with intravenous iron' available on \nthe intranet. \n \nIV iron therapy should not be administered out of hours to reduce the risk in cases where \nthere is an adverse reaction. \n \n9.2 Contraindications \n \n• History of anaphylaxis or serious reactions to parenteral iron therapy. \n• Risk of hypersensitivity reactions are enhanced in patients with known allergies \nincluding drug allergies and in patients with a history of severe asthma, eczema or \natopic allergy. There is also increased risk in women and people with active \nimmune or inflammatory conditions (e.g. SLE, rheumatoid arthritis). \n• First trimester of pregnancy (if indicated in 1\nst\n trimester discuss with senior medical \nstaff). \n• Active acute or chronic bacteraemia. \n• Decompensated liver disease. \n \n9.3 Preparation used \n \nThe preparation currently in use is Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos (previously \nknown as Monofer) which should be prescribed as per the trust guideline after informed \nconsent from patient – see (Appendix 1). \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 13 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\n9.4 During the Infusion & techniques to minimise the risk of iron staining \n \n• Please use the IV iron Nurse Checklist (Appendix 2) for the prescribing, \nmonitoring of the infusion and discharge checklist. The Patient Information Leaflet \nmust be provided to all women and people receiving IV iron therapy. \n• Avoid intravenous iron administration via cannulation at sites of flexion (e.g. \nantecubital fossa, wrist) or on the back of the hand. The distal veins of the forearm \nare the preferred site. If site of flexion is only option, use smaller cannula and slow \ndown infusion. \n• Use an appropriate cannula size (20- to 24-gauge). \n• Minimise the number of cannulation attempts- ask for help if difficult to cannulate. \n• Secure the cannula and use an extension set to minimise catheter movement. \n• Never cover the injection site with a bandage. \n• Ensure the patency of the vein before administration – cannula must flush easily. \nIf patency is uncertain, do not administer intravenous iron, re-site cannula. \n• Do not give infusions at night-time or if patient is unable to report symptoms. \n• The cannula should be monitored throughout the infusion for any signs of \nextravasation. Iron infusions can cause permanent staining in the event of \nextravasation (See Appendix 2). \n• CTG monitoring is advised during administration of IV iron. This is because fetal \nbradycardia may occur following administration of IV iron doses; this is usually \ntransient and a consequence of a hypersensitivity reaction in the mother and \n/birthing parent. If unresolved, an emergency caesarean birth may be required. \n• Record baseline observations of pulse, blood pressure, respiration rate and \ntemperature, and repeat after 15 minutes, and at the end of the infusion. Record \nall observations on MEOWS score on MIS. \n• Monitor women and people carefully for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity \nreactions during and following each administration of iron infusion. These include \nurticaria, rashes, itching, nausea and shivering. Administration must be stopped \nimmediately if any of these signs occur (see also section 9.5). Acute severe \nanaphylactic reactions are uncommon but usually occur within the first few \nminutes of administration and are generally characterised by sudden onset \nrespiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. If this is to occur call \nfor medical help immediately, consider calling the Medical Emergency Team \n(MET) and treat as per anaphylaxis protocol. \n• Parenteral iron should be used with caution in presence of acute or chronic \ninfection. \n• Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos (previously known as Monofer) should not \nbe used in patients with on-going bacteraemia. \n• Parenteral iron should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and \nmanage anaphylactic reactions are immediately available in an environment with \nfull resuscitation facilities. \n• Hypotensive episodes may occur if intravenous injection is administered too \nrapidly. \n• The patient should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes \nfollowing an iron infusion. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 14 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\n• Delayed reactions may also occur and include arthralgia, myalgia and sometimes \nfever. Onset varies from several hours up to 4 days after administration. \nSymptoms last two to four days and settle spontaneously or following use of \nsimple analgesics. In addition, exacerbation of joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis \ncan occur and local reactions may cause pain and inflammation at or near \ninjection site and a local phlebitic reaction. \n \n9.5 Management of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) \n \nMild/moderate (also known as a Fishbane reaction): \n \n• Stay calm, stop the infusion. \n• Monitor patients for signs of developing a severe hypersensitivity reaction. This is \nextremely rare and isolated symptoms generally resolve without intervention. \n• It is usually safe to restart when the symptoms pass (usually around 10 mins) but \nat half the rate, so over 1 hour instead of 30 mins. \n• It is unnecessary to treat Mild/Moderate HSR’s unless urticaria occurs and this \ncan be treated in the usual way with anti-histamine if indicated. Mild/moderate \nhypersensitivity reactions do not require adrenaline. \n \nSevere Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis: \n \n• Stop the infusion immediately. \n• Call for urgent medical assistance- put out a MET call (2222 adult medical \nemergency). \n• Treat as per Resusitation Council UK Anaphylaxis algorithm 2021 \n• For anaphylaxis Adrenaline 1 in 1000 (1mg in 1ml) 500 micrograms IM \ninjection should already be prescribed on the IV Infusion Administration of Ferric \nDerisomaltose Pharmacosmos (appendix 2). \n• Monitor observations continuously. \n• Ensure a DATIX is completed. \n \n9.6 Acute Management of iron extravasation (iron staining) \n(See appendix 3) \n \n• If the patient complains of pain, swelling, soreness at the injection site or there is \nany obvious swelling or discolouration, stop the infusion immediately and \nassess the site. Disconnect the giving set. \n• Aspirate any residual drug from the cannula DO NOT FLUSH. \n• Remove the cannula. \n• Document volume of infused fluid. \n• Apply a cold pack if there is swelling or soreness, keep arm level for as long as \npossible to avoid spread of stain, consider drawing around stain to assess spread. \n• Inform Obs Reg and arrange outpatient follow up - dermatology referral may be \nneeded if severe. \n• Ensure a DATIX is completed. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 15 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\n10.0 Management at birth \n \nThere should be efforts to maximise Hb prior to labour. Iron deficiency anaemia alone \nshould not influence the mode and timing of birth. There is no place for offering routine \nInduction of labour (IOL), based on iron deficiency anaemia alone. \n \nMaternal anaemia increases the risk of PPH and has an association with postpartum sepsis. \nWomen and people with an Hb <100 approaching term should be considered for iron \ninfusion ideally 3-4 weeks prior to birth to allow time for absorption and have an \nindividualised care plan in place (consider IV access in labour, birth in an obstetrician led \nunit, and active management in the third stage of labour). Hb should be checked on \nadmission to hospital. \n \n11.0 Postnatal care \n \nWomen and people with a blood loss >500 ml, who are symptomatic of anaemia or who had \nuncorrected antenatal anaemia should have their Hb checked within 48 hours of birth. \nInterpretation of results should take into account intrapartum events and likely further \nredistribution of intra and extravascular volumes. \n \n11.1 Management \n \n• Hb ≥ 100 g/L: continued healthy diet and lifestyle. Consider plans for \nbreastfeeding. \n• Hb <100 g/L, haemodynamically stable with mild or no symptoms: offer oral iron \nreplacement for at least 3 months (Ferrous sulphate 200mg PO OD) or alternate \nday dosing if not tolerated. \n• Hb <100 g/L, with mild/moderate symptoms of anaemia (exaggerated fatigue, \ndizziness on standing, etc.): consider IV iron therapy or blood transfusion. Senior \nmedical advice or review recommended. \n\nUHS-CG-0008-2023 Anaemia during Pregnancy v1.0 Oct 2023 Page 16 of 23 \nPlease check the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. \n\nHb <100 and \nhemodynamically \nstable, asymptomatic, \nor mildly symptomatic \nEstimated Blood loss (EBL)>500, \nuncorrected anaemia prior to \ndelivery, or symptomatic of \nanaemia \nFBC within 48 hours \npostpartum \nIV iron should be \nconsidered to avoid \nblood transfusion \nOral iron OD for at least \n3 months- alternate day \ndosing if not tolerated \n\n11.2 Summary of postnatal management of anaemia \n\n12.0 Blood transfusion \n \nDecision for transfusion should be by careful evaluation, and oral or IV iron replacement \nshould be considered as alternatives. Women and people who do receive a RBC transfusion \nshould be given full explanation of why transfusion is needed (risk vs benefits); option for \nalternative treatment should be explained. This discussion needs to be documented along \nwith clear documentation of consent on MIS. \nHb <100 and very \nsymptomatic, or do \nnot tolerate/respond \nto oral Iron \nHb >100 continue healthy \nlifestyle.
