Couples aware of carrier status should be referred for further assessment. - **Process**: Samples taken at booking, sent to lab within one working day. Results typically available within 3 days (longer for rare disorders). - **Results Categories**: Non-carrier, inconclusive, clinically significant disorder, or genetic carrier. - **Fatherâ€™s Sample**: Required if indicated; results determine risk (e.g., if both parents are carriers, 1 in 4 chance of affected baby). - **Declined Screening**: Document reason; option to screen later via community midwife. - **Follow-Up**: Failsafe check within 10 days to ensure results are acted upon. At-risk couples referred for counseling and prenatal diagnosis. - **Postnatal Testing**: Available for babies of high-risk couples who declined prenatal testing. - **Patient Information**: Provide written/verbal details at booking. NHS programme addresses sickle cell and thalassaemia, autosomal recessive conditions affecting hemoglobin. - **Support**: Refer carrier women to specialists; contact designated leads or external resources for further assistance",
