Denies dyspareunia but reports reduced libido.  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:**  \n- **Medical:** Hypothyroidism (well-controlled on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily), no diabetes/hypertension.  \n- **Surgical:** Appendectomy (age 20), bilateral breast reduction (age 35).  \n- **Gynaecological:** Regular cycles prior to menopause, no history of STIs or abnormal smears.  \n- **Obstetric:** G2P2 (both term deliveries, birth weights 3.2 kg and 3.5 kg).  \n\n### **Drug History:**  \n- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic pain (no regular analgesia).  \n- No hormonal therapy.  \n\n### **Allergies:**  \n- Penicillin (rash).  \n\n### **Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- Works as a schoolteacher; married with two teenage children.  \n- Exercises 3x/week (yoga and swimming).  \n\n### **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about \"cancer\" due to postmenopausal bleeding and family history (mother had endometrial cancer at 60).  \n- **Concerns:** Anxiety about invasive tests.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"clear answers\" and prefers \"minimally invasive options if possible.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor/jaundice.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - **Speculum:** Small amount of dark blood in vault; cervix appears normal.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly enlarged (8–10 weeks size), non-tender; no adnexal masses.  \n- **PR Exam:** No rectal masses, blood-stained glove.  \n\n---\n\n### **Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - **Transvaginal ultrasound:** Assess endometrial thickness and uterine morphology.  \n   - **Endometrial biopsy:** Rule out hyperplasia/malignancy given postmenopausal bleeding and family history.  \n   - **CA-125:** If pelvic pain persists (low threshold for further imaging).  \n\n2. **Interim Advice:**  \n   - Avoid NSAIDs until biopsy results (risk of masking inflammation).  \n   - Pelvic floor physiotherapy referral for chronic pain component.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Review results in 2 weeks. If biopsy abnormal, discuss hysteroscopy ± hysterectomy.  \n   - Counselling on HRT risks/benefits if symptoms suggest genitourinary syndrome of menopause.  \n\n**Prognosis:** Reassured that most causes of postmenopausal bleeding are benign but emphasized importance of exclusionary testing.  \n\n---  \n**End of Dictation**  \n\n*Note: This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only.
