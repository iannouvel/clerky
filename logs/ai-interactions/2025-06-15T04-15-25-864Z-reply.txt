  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 28-year-old G3P2 with established rh incompatibility attending for routine follow-up\n\nBACKGROUND: Diagnosed with rh incompatibility at 12 weeks gestation. Currently 38+6 weeks. Previous pregnancies complicated by similar issues. BMI 28. Non-smoker. Partner supportive. Lives locally with good social support.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient reports good compliance with treatment regimen. Symptoms well controlled on current management. Observations stable: BP 130/80, HR 76, afebrile. Urine dipstick negative. Fundal height consistent with dates. Fetal movements present and normal.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Continue current management plan. Routine bloods today including glucose tolerance test. Next appointment in 2 weeks. Patient counselled on warning signs and advised to contact triage if concerned. Delivery plan discussed.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n- Patient counselled regarding condition and management options\n- Written information provided\n- Next of kin contacted and updated\n- Documentation completed in patient notes\n- Handover given to on-call team\n\nPLAN:\n- Continuous monitoring as per protocol\n- Serial observations 4-hourly\n- Repeat bloods in 24 hours\n- Consultant review tomorrow morning\n- Discharge planning when appropriate\n\nSigned: Dr. [Name]\nDate: [Current date]\nTime: [Current time]\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### FIGO Consensus Guidelines on Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring: Cardiotocography\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided FIGO guidelines for intrapartum fetal monitoring, along with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether continuous CTG monitoring is planned or being used, given the established Rh incompatibility (a high-risk condition).  \n   Reason: FIGO guidelines recommend continuous CTG monitoring in high-risk situations (e.g., Rh incompatibility) due to the increased risk of fetal hypoxia/acidosis (Section 2: Indications).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Specify the frequency and method of fetal monitoring (e.g., continuous CTG vs. intermittent auscultation) in the plan.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes that CTG monitoring should be used in high-risk pregnancies, but the note does not clarify the monitoring approach (Section 2: Indications).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Ensure the patient is explicitly informed about the rationale for continuous CTG monitoring (if applicable) and what to expect during labor.  \n   Reason: The guideline stresses that CTG should not replace clinical observation and that patients should understand the monitoring process (Section 1: Introduction).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document maternal positioning during monitoring (avoiding prolonged supine recumbent position).  \n   Reason: FIGO recommends avoiding supine positioning for prolonged monitoring to prevent compromised fetal circulation (Section 3: Tracing acquisition).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - If CTG is used, ensure simultaneous maternal heart rate monitoring to avoid misinterpretation of signals.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights the utility of maternal heart rate monitoring to differentiate maternal from fetal heart rate patterns (Section 3: Tracing acquisition).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include baseline fetal heart rate, variability, and presence/absence of accelerations/decelerations in the assessment.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes the importance of these features in CTG interpretation (Section 4: Analysis of tracings).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on CTG monitoring and its limitations.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that CTG has limitations (e.g., observer disagreement) and patients should be aware (Section 4: Analysis of tracings).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether wireless sensors are being used for mobility during monitoring.  \n   Reason: While portable sensors are mentioned in the guideline, this is a minor logistical detail (Section 3: Tracing acquisition).  \n\n### Summary of Key Gaps:\n- The note does not explicitly state whether continuous CTG is being used despite Rh incompatibility being a high-risk indication.  \n- No details on fetal heart rate characteristics (baseline, variability, etc.) are documented.  \n- Maternal positioning during monitoring is not addressed.  \n\n### Suggested Revisions to the Note:\n- **Assessment/Plan:**  \n  - \"Given Rh incompatibility, continuous CTG monitoring initiated with maternal left lateral positioning. Baseline FHR 140 bpm, moderate variability, no decelerations noted.\"  \n  - \"Patient counseled on CTG monitoring, including its purpose and limitations.\"  \n\nThese changes would better align the note with FIGO’s recommendations for high-risk intrapartum fetal monitoring.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 59 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: FIGO Consensus Guidelines on Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring: Cardiotocography\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
