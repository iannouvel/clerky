Key recommendations: - **Screening & Testing**: Pregnant women with haemoglobinopathies should be referred to the antenatal screening coordinator midwife, with partner testing offered after abnormal results. - **Thalassaemia**: Thalassaemia trait poses no risk, but major/intermedia cases require haematologist involvement due to increased maternal/fetal risks. - **Sickle Cell Disease**: Increased risk of crisis (third trimester), pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Manage crises with IV hydration, analgesia, and obstetric/anesthetic referral. - **Labour**: No contraindication to normal obstetric practice; continuous fetal monitoring advised. - **Postnatal Care**: High risk for venous thromboembolism; consider low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. Professional judgement should guide protocol application. Management ensures accessibility and regular review",
