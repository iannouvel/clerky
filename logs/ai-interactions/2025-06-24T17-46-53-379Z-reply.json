The average birthweight at term is known to be increasing and is \nthought to be due to more prevalent maternal and birthing parent obesity, increased maternal \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 5 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nand birthing parent age and reduction in smoking. There are risks associated with LGA and \nfetal macrosomia, including increased maternal and birthing parent and neonatal morbidity, \nrisk of caesarean birth, shoulder dystocia, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), fourth degree \nperineal tears and admission to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU). \n \n 6.0 Key points \n \n A large baby may either be appropriately large or be macrosomic, causes of which \ninclude excess calorie intake, maternal and birthing parent diabetes, and obesity. \n \n A ‘large for dates’ pregnancy might be the first presentation of gestational \ndiabetes, which can also cause polyhydramnios (see Diabetes in Pregnancy \nGuideline). \n \n If the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) on scan is disproportionally raised >95\nth\n \ncentile (compared to the head circumference), discuss a low glycaemic index diet, \noffer a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) to women and people (who have not \npreviously had a GTT) and offer 36/40 scan to those women and people not found \nto be diabetic. \n \n Ultrasound derived estimated fetal weight estimates have an error of 10 - 25%, \nespecially in the late third trimester. \n \n A suspected diagnosis of a large fetus can cause anxiety for the mother/birthing \nparent and therefore give as much information to her and discuss options \navailable. This includes discussing the influence of the suspected large baby on \nthe woman and person’s birth preferences, with the understanding of the \nevidenced 10-20% error. Women and people should also be made aware that \nthere is no consensus around planned mode of delivery and/or induction of labour. \n \n7.0 Antenatal Management as per intergrowth measurements \n \n Fundal height measurement should be started from 26-28 weeks and plotted on \nthe intergrowth charts for SFH, and monitored and plotted thereafter at every \nantenatal appointment (preferably by the same person). Once regular serial growth \nscans are commenced, SFH measurements should be stopped, however this is \nnot the case for ad hoc growth scans when SFH measurements should be \ncontinued. It should be documented on MIS that this is the reason SFH \nmeasurement is not being performed. Saving babies’ lives Care Bundle v3.1 \n A single plot above the 90th centile on the intergrowth chart is not an indication for \nan ultrasound scan, unless there are other concerns. \n Consistent growth above the 90\nth\n centile without other concerns is not an indication \nfor an ultrasound scan. \n The key factor is to refer when fundal height plots are defining a curve significantly \nmore steep than the reference curves on the intergrowth chart – see below. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 6 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n8.0 Example of excessive fetal growth \n\nIf a LGA fetus is suspected based on the criteria above on an intergrowth chart, the woman \nand person should be referred for an ultrasound scan for fetal biometry and liquor volume \nwith an antenatal clinic appointment for review. \n \nThe clinical interpretation of the scan results should be informed by a full obstetric history, \ndietary history and clinically relevant information e.g. maternal and birthing parent stature. A \nmanagement plan might include dietary modification and screening for gestational diabetes. \nWhen counselling about birth options it is important to factor in previous births and the \nrelative size of the fetus and mother and birthing parent. The risks should be discussed in \ncontext with an emphasis on the metabolic risks to the fetus, the physical risks to the \nmother/birthing parent and fetus associated with birth, and the known risk of scanning error. \nThe options for birth are expectant management, induction of labour or caesarean birth. The \ninformation should be shared with the woman and people in an appropriate manner, bearing \nin mind the limitations of ultrasound biometry, and addressing any concerns that she/they \nraise. This should provide them with a balanced view in order to make an informed decision. \nWomen and birthing people should be informed that there is no consensus as yet as to \nwhether induction of labour significantly reduces the complications associated with shoulder \ndystocia, and that induction of labour is considered a known risk factor for shoulder dystocia. \n. \n. \n. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 7 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \n9.0 Fetal Macrosomia from 38 weeks \nThe risks and benefits of induction of labour (IOL) must be discussed with the woman and \nperson. Refer to ‘Induction and Augmentation of Labour (Including Use of Oxytocin) \nGuideline’. \nIOL at term can be offered for fetal macrosomia from the consultant ANC if the EFW on USS \nis above > 90th centile. Timing of this needs to be discussed with the woman and person and \nshould include a discussion about the risk of shoulder dystocia at different fetal weights \nrather than simply centiles. An estimate of risks at different weights is: \n 5% (1 in 20) in birthweight of 4000 – 4250g (8lb 13oz to 9lb 6oz) \n 9% (1 in 12) in birthweight of 4250 – 4500g (9lb 6oz to 9lb 15oz) \n 14% (1 in 7) in birthweight 4500 – 4750g (9lb 15oz to 10lb 7oz) \n 21% (1 in 5) in birthweight 4750g – 5000g (10lb 7oz to 11lb) (Nesbitt 1998) \nUsing this information, it would be reasonable to offer induction when the EFW is predicted to \nbe around 4kg. If the woman or person declines IOL and wants to consider expectant \nmanagement, repeat scan in 2 weeks to reassess growth. If size increases beyond 5000g \narrange discussion of mode of birth. \n \nWomen and birthing people should be informed that there is uncertainty about the risks and \nbenefits of induction of labour verses expectant management, but: \n \n Rate of shoulder dystocia is reduced compared with expectant management. \n There is evidence that risk of perinatal death, brachial plexus injury or need for \nemergency caesarean birth is unchanged between induction of labour and \nexpectant management. \n Induction of labour increases the rate of 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n degree tears. \n \nWomen and people should also be advised to consider the impact of induction of labour on \ntheir birth experience and on their baby. \n \nDiscuss the options for birth with the woman and person, taking into account their individual \ncircumstances and her preferences, and respect their decision. Support recruitment into \nclinical trials, if available. \n \n9.1 Polyhydramnios \nIf polyhydramnios is confirmed, consider causes:- \n1. Idiopathic \n2. Maternal (gestational diabetes, GDM) \n3. Fetal (tracheo-oesophageal fistula [TOF] – may be absent stomach on ultrasound, \nalthough presence of stomach does not exclude diagnosis). \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 8 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nGuidance on who to perform Oral Glucose Tolerance Test’s (OGTT) is in the trust guideline \non diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes (see Diabetes in Pregnancy \nGuideline). It depends if patient has pre-pregnancy risk factors for GDM and whether they \nhave had previous OGTTs. If TOF suspected by absent stomach (and after GDM excluded) \nconsider referral to fetal medicine as there is around 50% chance of other abnormalities and \n5% association with aneuploidy. \nPaediatric alerts do not need to be sent for isolated mild polyhydramnios. \nFor severe polyhydramnios at less than 34 weeks gestation it may be appropriate to discuss \nwith one of the fetal medicine consultants about merits of amnio-drainage. \n \n10.0 Caesarean birth \n \nIn some cases, the risk of an emergency caesarean birth for true CPD (Cephalic Pelvic \nDisproportion) or concerns raised by the woman and person around significant perineal \ntrauma may be sufficiently high to justify a planned caesarean birth. This should be a \nconsultant decision with a threshold of an estimated birth weight of 4.5kg or more. Women \nand birthing people should be advised that caesarean birth is an acceptable choice if there \nare significant concerns regarding the risk of shoulder dystocia. \n\n11.0 Informed discussion with the woman and person presenting with a large \nfor gestational age baby \n \n(For guidance on suspected fetal macrosomia in women and people with pre-existing or \ngestational diabetes see CG1109 Diabetes in pregnancy-guideline.) \n \nUsing the table below discuss with pregnant women and people without diabetes and with \nsuspected fetal macrosomia that: \n \n• The options for birth are expectant management, induction of labour or caesarean \nbirth. \n• There is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of induction of labour compared to \nexpectant management, but: \n- With induction of labour the risk of shoulder dystocia is reduced compared \nwith expectant management. \n- With induction of labour the risk of third- or fourth-degree perineal tears is \nincreased compared with expectant management. \n- There is evidence that the risk of perinatal death, brachial plexus injuries in \nthe baby, or the need for emergency caesarean birth is the same between \nthe 2 options. \n• They will also need to consider the impact of induction on their birth \nexperience and on their baby. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 9 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nDiscuss the options for birth with the woman or person, taking into account their individual \ncircumstances and her/their preferences, and respect their decision. \n \nOutcome Induction of \nlabour \nExpectant \nManagement \nRisk Difference \nShoulder \nDystocia \nAbout 410 babies \nwould per 10,000 \nwould be expected \nto have a shoulder \ndystocia (so 9,590 \nwould not). \nAbout 680 babies \nper 10,000 would \nbe expected to \nhave a shoulder \ndystocia (so \n9,320 would not). \n\nAbout 270 more babies per \n10,000 whose mother and \nbirthing parent's birth was \nmanaged expectantly would \nbe expected to have a \nshoulder dystocia; so for 9,730 \nthe outcome would be the \nsame irrespective of the \nmanagement strategy. \nThird or fourth \ndegree perineal \ntears \nAbout 260 per \n10,000 women and \npeople would be \nexpected to have \nthird or fourth \ndegree tears (so \n9,740 would not) \nAbout 69 per \n10,000 women \nand people would \nbe expected to \nhave third or \nfourth degree \ntears (so 9,931 \nwould not) \nAbout 191 women and people \nwhose labour was induced \nwould be expected to have \nthird or fourth degree tears; so \nfor 9,809 the outcome would \nbe the same irrespective of \nthe management strategy. \nNICE NG207 2021 \n11.1 Risks of vaginal birth with a macrosomic baby \n \nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \nOne in 10 babies who experience shoulder \ndystocia will have stretching of the nerves in \nthe neck. This is called brachial plexus injury \nand can causes loss of movement in the \nbaby's arm. The most common type of \nbrachial plexus injury is Erb's palsy. For one \nin 10 babies with a brachial plexus injury, the \nloss of movement will be permanent. \nSometimes the labour can be longer for \nbigger babies. In the UK 15 in 100 women \nand people who are planning to have a \nvaginal birth will need to have an emergency \ncaesarean birth. Some women and people \nmay need to have a forceps or ventouse \n(suction) birth. \nIn babies who experience shoulder dystocia, \none in 10 may have a fracture to their \ncollarbone. Four in 100 babies who \nexperience shoulder dystocia may have a \nfracture to their arm. These heal well. \nSometimes women and people with a big \nbaby may experience heavier bleeding after \nthe baby is born. In rare cases, some women \nand people may need a blood transfusion. \nVery rarely, a baby may suffer brain damage \nif they did not get enough oxygen during the \nbirth because of shoulder dystocia. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 10 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n11.2 Risks of induction of labour with a macrosomic baby \n \nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \nInducing labour at 38 weeks is safe for the \nbaby. There is some evidence that inducing \nlabour earlier can lead to jaundice in the \nbaby. This usually has no long-term effects. \nOften women and people who have labour \ninduced will find their labour is longer and more \npainful than for women who go into labour \nnaturally. \n If the woman and person has a vaginal birth \nthe risks are shown in table above. Having \nlabour induced can increase the risk of a tear \nto the vagina that extends into the back \npassage. \n Sometimes if the woman and person is \ninduced they may need an emergency \ncaesarean birth, and the risks of this are \nshown in table below. \n \n11.3 Risks of caesarean birth \n \nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \nOne in 10 babies may experience breathing \ndifficulties. Some of these babies will need \nto have treatment for this in the neonatal \nunit. \nNine in 100 women and people report \npersistent pain at the wound site and in \ntheir abdomen for a few months following a \ncaesarean birth. \nOne to two babies in 100 will have a cut to \ntheir skin. \nFive in 100 women and people will need to \nbe readmitted to hospital following a \ncaesarean birth. This might be because \ntheir wound is not healing or because they \nhave an infection. \nSome women and people report that it \ntakes longer to bond with their baby after a \nCaesarean birth. \nSix in 100 women and people will have an \ninfection after a caesarean birth. The \ninfection may involve the scar, their bladder \nor kidneys, or the lining of their womb. \n One in 1000 women and people may have \nan injury to their bladder or bowel during a \ncaesarean birth. This will need repairing. \n Five in 1000 women and people bleed \nheavily (haemorrhage) during a caesarean \nbirth. Some of these women and people will \nneed to have a blood transfusion. In some \ncases, a woman and person may need to \nhave a hysterectomy (where the womb is \nremoved) to control the bleeding. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 11 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Five in 1000 women and people may need \nto have further surgery after their caesarean \nbirth. \n Six in 10,000 women and people will have a \nblood clot in their leg or lung following a \ncaesarean birth. \n One in four women and people who have a \ncaesarean birth will need another \ncaesarean birth if they attempt a vaginal \nbirth in their next pregnancy. \nIf they have a caesarean birth and decide to \ntry a vaginal birth in their next pregnancy, \nthey would need extra monitoring in labour \nas there is a risk (one in 200 women and \npeople) that the scar in the uterus can open \nduring labour. \n If the woman and person has a caesarean \nbirth in this pregnancy, in their next \npregnancy there is increased chance of a \nstillbirth. This is uncommon. \n If the woman and person has a caesarean \nbirth in this pregnancy and the placenta is \nlow in their next pregnancy, there is an \nincreased chance that the placenta will not \ncome away easily after the baby has been \nborn. This can cause serious bleeding and \nmay mean they need to have a \nhysterectomy. This is uncommon, but the \nchance increases with each caesarean \nbirth. \n \n12.0 Post birth \n \nWith any of the scenarios presented above it may be reasonable to explore with the woman \nand person how they may feel and/or feels, following the baby’s birth if in fact the baby when \nborn was not large (10-20% error of scanning). The woman and person’s birth preferences \nwill have been important to them and if a joint decision was made in line with a suspected \nlarge baby rather than their initial preference then they may feel disappointed with the choice \nmade suspecting their baby to be large. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 12 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n13.0 Audit \n \nSuggested audit question: \n \n Has the fundal height measurement should be charted from 26-28 weeks and plotted \non the intergrowth charts. \n \n If the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) on scan is disproportionally raised >95\nth\n \ncentile (compared to the head circumference), has: \no A low glycaemic index diet been discussed \no A Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) been offered to women and people (who \nhave not previously had a GTT) \no A 36/40 scan to offered those women and people not found to be diabetic \n \n If fetal macrosomia from 38 weeks, has the risks and benefits of induction of labour \n(IOL) been be discussed with the woman and person. \n\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 13 of 13 \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nReferences \n \nAye SS, Miller V, Saxena S, Farhan M.

  "response": "### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Document whether a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) was offered or performed, given the macrosomic baby and lack of documented diabetes screening.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (CG1192, Section 7.0) recommends offering a GTT if the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) is >95th centile, especially in cases of suspected macrosomia, to rule out gestational diabetes as a contributing factor.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer statistics on shoulder dystocia risks based on estimated fetal weight (EFW) ranges (e.g., 5% at 4–4.25 kg, 9% at 4.25–4.5 kg, etc.).  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.0) emphasizes discussing specific risks at different weight thresholds to support informed decision-making. The note mentions macrosomia but lacks detailed risk stratification.  \n\n**Different management plan** - Explicitly document a consultant-led discussion regarding the option of cesarean section (CS) for EFW ≥4.5 kg, as per the guideline threshold.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 10.0) states CS should be considered for EFW ≥4.5 kg, requiring consultant involvement. The note does not confirm this discussion occurred.  \n\n---\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Include a discussion about the 10–20% error rate in ultrasound weight estimation and its implications for birth planning.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 6.0) highlights the importance of addressing scanning inaccuracies to manage patient expectations.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Document whether polyhydramnios was assessed, given the macrosomia and reduced fetal movements.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.1) recommends evaluating polyhydramnios in LGA cases, as it may indicate underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes or TOF).  \n\n---\n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Reiterate the option of expectant management with repeat growth scans if IOL is declined, as per the guideline’s 2-week follow-up recommendation.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.0) advises repeat scans for ongoing assessment if IOL is deferred, but this is secondary to immediate risks.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Clarify if the patient was counseled about the increased risk of 3rd/4th-degree tears with IOL.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 11.0) notes this risk, but it is less critical than shoulder dystocia discussions.  \n\n---\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Mention the potential for postpartum disappointment if the baby’s actual weight differs significantly from estimates.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 12.0) suggests this discussion, but it is minor compared to acute clinical risks.  \n\n**Formatting** - Standardize the documentation of CTG findings (e.g., \"STV 5\" vs. \"stable FHR\") for clarity.  \n**Reason**: This is a minor improvement for consistency but does not impact guideline adherence.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nThe note aligns well with the guideline’s emphasis on shared decision-making but lacks documentation of diabetes screening, detailed risk quantification, and consultant input for CS. Addressing these gaps would enhance compliance and patient safety.",

There are risks associated with LGA and \\nfetal macrosomia, including increased maternal and birthing parent and neonatal morbidity, \\nrisk of caesarean birth, shoulder dystocia, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), fourth degree \\nperineal tears and admission to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU). \\n \\n 6.0 Key points \\n \\n A large baby may either be appropriately large or be macrosomic, causes of which \\ninclude excess calorie intake, maternal and birthing parent diabetes, and obesity. \\n \\n A ‘large for dates’ pregnancy might be the first presentation of gestational \\ndiabetes, which can also cause polyhydramnios (see Diabetes in Pregnancy \\nGuideline). \\n \\n If the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) on scan is disproportionally raised >95\\nth\\n \\ncentile (compared to the head circumference), discuss a low glycaemic index diet, \\noffer a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) to women and people (who have not \\npreviously had a GTT) and offer 36/40 scan to those women and people not found \\nto be diabetic. \\n \\n Ultrasound derived estimated fetal weight estimates have an error of 10 - 25%, \\nespecially in the late third trimester. \\n \\n A suspected diagnosis of a large fetus can cause anxiety for the mother/birthing \\nparent and therefore give as much information to her and discuss options \\navailable. This includes discussing the influence of the suspected large baby on \\nthe woman and person’s birth preferences, with the understanding of the \\nevidenced 10-20% error. Women and people should also be made aware that \\nthere is no consensus around planned mode of delivery and/or induction of labour. \\n \\n7.0 Antenatal Management as per intergrowth measurements \\n \\n Fundal height measurement should be started from 26-28 weeks and plotted on \\nthe intergrowth charts for SFH, and monitored and plotted thereafter at every \\nantenatal appointment (preferably by the same person). Once regular serial growth \\nscans are commenced, SFH measurements should be stopped, however this is \\nnot the case for ad hoc growth scans when SFH measurements should be \\ncontinued. It should be documented on MIS that this is the reason SFH \\nmeasurement is not being performed. Saving babies’ lives Care Bundle v3.1 \\n A single plot above the 90th centile on the intergrowth chart is not an indication for \\nan ultrasound scan, unless there are other concerns. \\n Consistent growth above the 90\\nth\\n centile without other concerns is not an indication \\nfor an ultrasound scan. \\n The key factor is to refer when fundal height plots are defining a curve significantly \\nmore steep than the reference curves on the intergrowth chart – see below. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 6 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n8.0 Example of excessive fetal growth \\n\\nIf a LGA fetus is suspected based on the criteria above on an intergrowth chart, the woman \\nand person should be referred for an ultrasound scan for fetal biometry and liquor volume \\nwith an antenatal clinic appointment for review. \\n \\nThe clinical interpretation of the scan results should be informed by a full obstetric history, \\ndietary history and clinically relevant information e.g. maternal and birthing parent stature. A \\nmanagement plan might include dietary modification and screening for gestational diabetes. \\nWhen counselling about birth options it is important to factor in previous births and the \\nrelative size of the fetus and mother and birthing parent. The risks should be discussed in \\ncontext with an emphasis on the metabolic risks to the fetus, the physical risks to the \\nmother/birthing parent and fetus associated with birth, and the known risk of scanning error. \\nThe options for birth are expectant management, induction of labour or caesarean birth. The \\ninformation should be shared with the woman and people in an appropriate manner, bearing \\nin mind the limitations of ultrasound biometry, and addressing any concerns that she/they \\nraise. This should provide them with a balanced view in order to make an informed decision. \\nWomen and birthing people should be informed that there is no consensus as yet as to \\nwhether induction of labour significantly reduces the complications associated with shoulder \\ndystocia, and that induction of labour is considered a known risk factor for shoulder dystocia. \\n. \\n. \\n. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 7 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\n9.0 Fetal Macrosomia from 38 weeks \\nThe risks and benefits of induction of labour (IOL) must be discussed with the woman and \\nperson. Refer to ‘Induction and Augmentation of Labour (Including Use of Oxytocin) \\nGuideline’. \\nIOL at term can be offered for fetal macrosomia from the consultant ANC if the EFW on USS \\nis above > 90th centile. Timing of this needs to be discussed with the woman and person and \\nshould include a discussion about the risk of shoulder dystocia at different fetal weights \\nrather than simply centiles. An estimate of risks at different weights is: \\n 5% (1 in 20) in birthweight of 4000 – 4250g (8lb 13oz to 9lb 6oz) \\n 9% (1 in 12) in birthweight of 4250 – 4500g (9lb 6oz to 9lb 15oz) \\n 14% (1 in 7) in birthweight 4500 – 4750g (9lb 15oz to 10lb 7oz) \\n 21% (1 in 5) in birthweight 4750g – 5000g (10lb 7oz to 11lb) (Nesbitt 1998) \\nUsing this information, it would be reasonable to offer induction when the EFW is predicted to \\nbe around 4kg. If the woman or person declines IOL and wants to consider expectant \\nmanagement, repeat scan in 2 weeks to reassess growth. If size increases beyond 5000g \\narrange discussion of mode of birth. \\n \\nWomen and birthing people should be informed that there is uncertainty about the risks and \\nbenefits of induction of labour verses expectant management, but: \\n \\n Rate of shoulder dystocia is reduced compared with expectant management. \\n There is evidence that risk of perinatal death, brachial plexus injury or need for \\nemergency caesarean birth is unchanged between induction of labour and \\nexpectant management. \\n Induction of labour increases the rate of 3\\nrd\\n and 4\\nth\\n degree tears. \\n \\nWomen and people should also be advised to consider the impact of induction of labour on \\ntheir birth experience and on their baby. \\n \\nDiscuss the options for birth with the woman and person, taking into account their individual \\ncircumstances and her preferences, and respect their decision. Support recruitment into \\nclinical trials, if available. \\n \\n9.1 Polyhydramnios \\nIf polyhydramnios is confirmed, consider causes:- \\n1. Idiopathic \\n2. Maternal (gestational diabetes, GDM) \\n3. Fetal (tracheo-oesophageal fistula [TOF] – may be absent stomach on ultrasound, \\nalthough presence of stomach does not exclude diagnosis). \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 8 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\nGuidance on who to perform Oral Glucose Tolerance Test’s (OGTT) is in the trust guideline \\non diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes (see Diabetes in Pregnancy \\nGuideline). It depends if patient has pre-pregnancy risk factors for GDM and whether they \\nhave had previous OGTTs. If TOF suspected by absent stomach (and after GDM excluded) \\nconsider referral to fetal medicine as there is around 50% chance of other abnormalities and \\n5% association with aneuploidy. \\nPaediatric alerts do not need to be sent for isolated mild polyhydramnios. \\nFor severe polyhydramnios at less than 34 weeks gestation it may be appropriate to discuss \\nwith one of the fetal medicine consultants about merits of amnio-drainage. \\n \\n10.0 Caesarean birth \\n \\nIn some cases, the risk of an emergency caesarean birth for true CPD (Cephalic Pelvic \\nDisproportion) or concerns raised by the woman and person around significant perineal \\ntrauma may be sufficiently high to justify a planned caesarean birth. This should be a \\nconsultant decision with a threshold of an estimated birth weight of 4.5kg or more. Women \\nand birthing people should be advised that caesarean birth is an acceptable choice if there \\nare significant concerns regarding the risk of shoulder dystocia. \\n\\n11.0 Informed discussion with the woman and person presenting with a large \\nfor gestational age baby \\n \\n(For guidance on suspected fetal macrosomia in women and people with pre-existing or \\ngestational diabetes see CG1109 Diabetes in pregnancy-guideline.) \\n \\nUsing the table below discuss with pregnant women and people without diabetes and with \\nsuspected fetal macrosomia that: \\n \\n• The options for birth are expectant management, induction of labour or caesarean \\nbirth. \\n• There is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of induction of labour compared to \\nexpectant management, but: \\n- With induction of labour the risk of shoulder dystocia is reduced compared \\nwith expectant management. \\n- With induction of labour the risk of third- or fourth-degree perineal tears is \\nincreased compared with expectant management. \\n- There is evidence that the risk of perinatal death, brachial plexus injuries in \\nthe baby, or the need for emergency caesarean birth is the same between \\nthe 2 options. \\n• They will also need to consider the impact of induction on their birth \\nexperience and on their baby. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 9 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\nDiscuss the options for birth with the woman or person, taking into account their individual \\ncircumstances and her/their preferences, and respect their decision. \\n \\nOutcome Induction of \\nlabour \\nExpectant \\nManagement \\nRisk Difference \\nShoulder \\nDystocia \\nAbout 410 babies \\nwould per 10,000 \\nwould be expected \\nto have a shoulder \\ndystocia (so 9,590 \\nwould not). \\nAbout 680 babies \\nper 10,000 would \\nbe expected to \\nhave a shoulder \\ndystocia (so \\n9,320 would not). \\n\\nAbout 270 more babies per \\n10,000 whose mother and \\nbirthing parent's birth was \\nmanaged expectantly would \\nbe expected to have a \\nshoulder dystocia; so for 9,730 \\nthe outcome would be the \\nsame irrespective of the \\nmanagement strategy. \\nThird or fourth \\ndegree perineal \\ntears \\nAbout 260 per \\n10,000 women and \\npeople would be \\nexpected to have \\nthird or fourth \\ndegree tears (so \\n9,740 would not) \\nAbout 69 per \\n10,000 women \\nand people would \\nbe expected to \\nhave third or \\nfourth degree \\ntears (so 9,931 \\nwould not) \\nAbout 191 women and people \\nwhose labour was induced \\nwould be expected to have \\nthird or fourth degree tears; so \\nfor 9,809 the outcome would \\nbe the same irrespective of \\nthe management strategy. \\nNICE NG207 2021 \\n11.1 Risks of vaginal birth with a macrosomic baby \\n \\nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \\nOne in 10 babies who experience shoulder \\ndystocia will have stretching of the nerves in \\nthe neck. This is called brachial plexus injury \\nand can causes loss of movement in the \\nbaby's arm. The most common type of \\nbrachial plexus injury is Erb's palsy. For one \\nin 10 babies with a brachial plexus injury, the \\nloss of movement will be permanent. \\nSometimes the labour can be longer for \\nbigger babies. In the UK 15 in 100 women \\nand people who are planning to have a \\nvaginal birth will need to have an emergency \\ncaesarean birth. Some women and people \\nmay need to have a forceps or ventouse \\n(suction) birth. \\nIn babies who experience shoulder dystocia, \\none in 10 may have a fracture to their \\ncollarbone. Four in 100 babies who \\nexperience shoulder dystocia may have a \\nfracture to their arm. These heal well. \\nSometimes women and people with a big \\nbaby may experience heavier bleeding after \\nthe baby is born. In rare cases, some women \\nand people may need a blood transfusion. \\nVery rarely, a baby may suffer brain damage \\nif they did not get enough oxygen during the \\nbirth because of shoulder dystocia. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 10 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n11.2 Risks of induction of labour with a macrosomic baby \\n \\nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \\nInducing labour at 38 weeks is safe for the \\nbaby. There is some evidence that inducing \\nlabour earlier can lead to jaundice in the \\nbaby. This usually has no long-term effects. \\nOften women and people who have labour \\ninduced will find their labour is longer and more \\npainful than for women who go into labour \\nnaturally. \\n If the woman and person has a vaginal birth \\nthe risks are shown in table above. Having \\nlabour induced can increase the risk of a tear \\nto the vagina that extends into the back \\npassage. \\n Sometimes if the woman and person is \\ninduced they may need an emergency \\ncaesarean birth, and the risks of this are \\nshown in table below. \\n \\n11.3 Risks of caesarean birth \\n \\nRisks to baby Risks to woman and person \\nOne in 10 babies may experience breathing \\ndifficulties. Some of these babies will need \\nto have treatment for this in the neonatal \\nunit. \\nNine in 100 women and people report \\npersistent pain at the wound site and in \\ntheir abdomen for a few months following a \\ncaesarean birth. \\nOne to two babies in 100 will have a cut to \\ntheir skin. \\nFive in 100 women and people will need to \\nbe readmitted to hospital following a \\ncaesarean birth. This might be because \\ntheir wound is not healing or because they \\nhave an infection. \\nSome women and people report that it \\ntakes longer to bond with their baby after a \\nCaesarean birth. \\nSix in 100 women and people will have an \\ninfection after a caesarean birth. The \\ninfection may involve the scar, their bladder \\nor kidneys, or the lining of their womb. \\n One in 1000 women and people may have \\nan injury to their bladder or bowel during a \\ncaesarean birth. This will need repairing. \\n Five in 1000 women and people bleed \\nheavily (haemorrhage) during a caesarean \\nbirth. Some of these women and people will \\nneed to have a blood transfusion. In some \\ncases, a woman and person may need to \\nhave a hysterectomy (where the womb is \\nremoved) to control the bleeding. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 11 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Five in 1000 women and people may need \\nto have further surgery after their caesarean \\nbirth. \\n Six in 10,000 women and people will have a \\nblood clot in their leg or lung following a \\ncaesarean birth. \\n One in four women and people who have a \\ncaesarean birth will need another \\ncaesarean birth if they attempt a vaginal \\nbirth in their next pregnancy. \\nIf they have a caesarean birth and decide to \\ntry a vaginal birth in their next pregnancy, \\nthey would need extra monitoring in labour \\nas there is a risk (one in 200 women and \\npeople) that the scar in the uterus can open \\nduring labour. \\n If the woman and person has a caesarean \\nbirth in this pregnancy, in their next \\npregnancy there is increased chance of a \\nstillbirth. This is uncommon. \\n If the woman and person has a caesarean \\nbirth in this pregnancy and the placenta is \\nlow in their next pregnancy, there is an \\nincreased chance that the placenta will not \\ncome away easily after the baby has been \\nborn. This can cause serious bleeding and \\nmay mean they need to have a \\nhysterectomy. This is uncommon, but the \\nchance increases with each caesarean \\nbirth. \\n \\n12.0 Post birth \\n \\nWith any of the scenarios presented above it may be reasonable to explore with the woman \\nand person how they may feel and/or feels, following the baby’s birth if in fact the baby when \\nborn was not large (10-20% error of scanning). The woman and person’s birth preferences \\nwill have been important to them and if a joint decision was made in line with a suspected \\nlarge baby rather than their initial preference then they may feel disappointed with the choice \\nmade suspecting their baby to be large. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 12 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n13.0 Audit \\n \\nSuggested audit question: \\n \\n Has the fundal height measurement should be charted from 26-28 weeks and plotted \\non the intergrowth charts. \\n \\n If the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) on scan is disproportionally raised >95\\nth\\n \\ncentile (compared to the head circumference), has: \\no A low glycaemic index diet been discussed \\no A Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) been offered to women and people (who \\nhave not previously had a GTT) \\no A 36/40 scan to offered those women and people not found to be diabetic \\n \\n If fetal macrosomia from 38 weeks, has the risks and benefits of induction of labour \\n(IOL) been be discussed with the woman and person. \\n\\nCG1192 Large for Gestational Age Guideline v6.0 November 2023 Page 13 of 13 \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nReferences \\n \\nAye SS, Miller V, Saxena S, Farhan M.

Your task is to analyze if the given clinical note follows the specified guideline and suggest improvements.\",\n  \"guideline_id\": \"cg1192-large-for-gestational-age-pdf\",\n  \"guideline_title\": \"CG1192 Large for Gestational Age\"\n}\n\nA: ### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Document whether a Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) was offered or performed, given the macrosomic baby and lack of documented diabetes screening.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (CG1192, Section 7.0) recommends offering a GTT if the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) is >95th centile, especially in cases of suspected macrosomia, to rule out gestational diabetes as a contributing factor.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer statistics on shoulder dystocia risks based on estimated fetal weight (EFW) ranges (e.g., 5% at 4–4.25 kg, 9% at 4.25–4.5 kg, etc.).  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.0) emphasizes discussing specific risks at different weight thresholds to support informed decision-making. The note mentions macrosomia but lacks detailed risk stratification.  \n\n**Different management plan** - Explicitly document a consultant-led discussion regarding the option of cesarean section (CS) for EFW ≥4.5 kg, as per the guideline threshold.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 10.0) states CS should be considered for EFW ≥4.5 kg, requiring consultant involvement. The note does not confirm this discussion occurred.  \n\n---\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Include a discussion about the 10–20% error rate in ultrasound weight estimation and its implications for birth planning.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 6.0) highlights the importance of addressing scanning inaccuracies to manage patient expectations.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Document whether polyhydramnios was assessed, given the macrosomia and reduced fetal movements.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.1) recommends evaluating polyhydramnios in LGA cases, as it may indicate underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes or TOF).  \n\n---\n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Reiterate the option of expectant management with repeat growth scans if IOL is declined, as per the guideline’s 2-week follow-up recommendation.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 9.0) advises repeat scans for ongoing assessment if IOL is deferred, but this is secondary to immediate risks.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Clarify if the patient was counseled about the increased risk of 3rd/4th-degree tears with IOL.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 11.0) notes this risk, but it is less critical than shoulder dystocia discussions.  \n\n---\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Mention the potential for postpartum disappointment if the baby’s actual weight differs significantly from estimates.  \n**Reason**: The guideline (Section 12.0) suggests this discussion, but it is minor compared to acute clinical risks.  \n\n**Formatting** - Standardize the documentation of CTG findings (e.g., \"STV 5\" vs. \"stable FHR\") for clarity.  \n**Reason**: This is a minor improvement for consistency but does not impact guideline adherence.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nThe note aligns well with the guideline’s emphasis on shared decision-making but lacks documentation of diabetes screening, detailed risk quantification, and consultant input for CS. Addressing these gaps would enhance compliance and patient safety.\n\n--- Token Usage Report ---\nPrompt tokens: 6715\nCompletion tokens: 690\nTotal tokens: 7405\nEstimated cost: $0.003702",
