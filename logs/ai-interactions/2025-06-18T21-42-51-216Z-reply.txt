      "newValue": "**Summary of Fetal Heart Monitoring Guidelines:** - **Monitoring Methods:** Intermittent auscultation (low-risk pregnancies) or continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) for high-risk cases (e.g., hypertension, breech presentation). - **Antenatal Monitoring:** Dawes-Redman Criteria apply from 26 weeks; discontinue CTG after 10 minutes if criteria met; obstetric review needed if not met by 60 minutes. - **Intrapartum Monitoring:** Regular CTG review, considering maternal/fetal risk factors. Escalate concerns promptly for abnormal traces. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders). Avoid if expedited birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Paired samples recommended for concerning labors or SGA/FGR cases. Analyze promptly; document results. - **Poor CTG Quality:** Troubleshoot transducer issues, reposition, or switch to fetal scalp electrode (FSE). - **Documentation & Storage:** CTG traces must be stored for 25 years. - **Human Factors:** Team communication and clinical context are critical for interpretation. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; requires training. Not diagnosticâ€”supports clinical judgment. *Key: Prioritize patient preferences, clinical context, and timely intervention.*",
