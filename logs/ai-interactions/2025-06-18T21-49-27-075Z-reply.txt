Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. - **Support for mothers** includes early milk expression if separated, responsive feeding assessments, and help with positioning/attachment. - **Alternative feeding methods** (finger/cup feeding) are used to avoid teat confusion; formula supplementation is limited and medically justified. - **Formula feeding guidance** covers safe preparation, responsive practices, and avoiding overfeeding. - **Safety measures** include safe sleep practices (cot by bed) and supervised skin-to-skin contact. - **Neonatal unit care** focuses on parent-infant bonding, breastmilk provision, and parental partnership. - **Staff responsibilities**: Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring**: Babies weighed at birth, day 5, and day 10. Feeding problems prompt assessments, referrals (e.g., tongue-tie), and incident reporting if re-admitted. - **Parenting support** includes education on feeding cues, local resources, and rooming-in to encourage maternal care. *Key message*: Individualized care promotes breastfeeding while respecting maternal choice, with strict adherence to safety and training protocols",
