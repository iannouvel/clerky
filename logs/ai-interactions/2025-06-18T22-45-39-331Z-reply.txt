However, based on the context and terms like \"Trust and National recommendations,\" \"British Standards,\" and the protocol numbering style (e.g., MP039, MP060), it is likely from an NHS Trust or a similar UK-based healthcare institution. Since no specific organization name (e.g., NHS, NICE, WHO, RCOG) is clearly stated in the provided text, I cannot return a definitive answer. If you have additional context or a title page, that may help identify the publisher. For now, no organization name can be extracted from this passage alone",
