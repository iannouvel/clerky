Key stakeholders include mortuary, histopathology, crematorium, and clinical staff. **Key Recommendations:** - **Options for disposal:** Hospital-arranged cremation, private burial/cremation, or home burial. - **Non-recognizable fetus:** Provide information, obtain consent, and follow mortuary transfer protocols (waterproof pad, wrapping, labeled box with forms). - **Recognizable fetus:** Offer funeral arrangement options and ensure proper documentation. - **Post-mortem & cytogenetics:** Obtain consent for examinations and send remains to designated labs if needed. - **Compliance:** Staff must follow procedures, use correct forms, and participate in annual audits. The guideline stresses dignity, consent, and clear processes for handling fetal remains",
