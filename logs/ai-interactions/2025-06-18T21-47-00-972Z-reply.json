Monitor fetal wellbeing (CTG) and maternal observations. - **Oxytocin use**: Start after counseling, titrate for adequate contractions, and monitor for hyperstimulation (terbutaline if needed). - **Special cases**: Preterm labor, fetal demise, previous cesarean, diabetes, obesity, or maternal request require individualized plans. - **PROM management**: Offer induction after 24 hours of expectant management; monitor for infection (avoid routine swabs/CRP). - **Failed induction**: Reassess within 24–48 hours; consider cesarean if no progress. - **Complications**: Suspected uterine rupture warrants immediate cesarean; hyperstimulation requires fetal assessment and tocolysis. - **Documentation**: Record all procedures (balloon placement, ARM, oxytocin dosing) and outcomes. **Monitoring**: Regular CTG, maternal vitals, and contraction patterns during induction/augmentation\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
