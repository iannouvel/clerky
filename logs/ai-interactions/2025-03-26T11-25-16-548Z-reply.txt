- No known diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x2 (first for fetal distress, second elective due to previous scar).  
- Dilation & curettage x1 (for incomplete miscarriage).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, cycles previously regular (28-day intervals).

- **Abdominal:** Soft, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa, no guarding/rigidity.  
- **Speculum:** Minimal blood in vault, cervix appears closed.  
- **Bimanual:** Cervical motion tenderness negative, left adnexal fullness (no overt mass).  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Suspected Ectopic Pregnancy (high index suspicion given history).**  
2. **Differential:** Ovarian cyst complication, pelvic inflammatory disease (less likely).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Urgent Investigations:**  
   - Serum beta-hCG (quantitative).  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess pregnancy location/adnexa.  
   - FBC, group & save (given bleeding history).  
2. **Immediate Advice:**  
   - Attend ED if severe pain/dizziness occurs.  
   - Avoid intercourse until cleared.  
3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review results within 24 hours.  
   - If ectopic confirmed, discuss methotrexate vs. surgical options.
