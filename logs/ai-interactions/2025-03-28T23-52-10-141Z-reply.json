She is concerned about possible pregnancy but also reports a history of irregular cycles.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Miss X has had five prior pregnancies: three live births (all delivered vaginally at term), one spontaneous miscarriage at 10 weeks, and one termination of pregnancy at 8 weeks gestation.  - She reports inconsistent contraceptive use (primarily condoms) and no long-acting reversible contraception.  - She denies current breast tenderness, nausea, or urinary symptoms but reports fatigue and mild dyspnoea on exertion.  - No recent unprotected intercourse confirmed, but admits to occasional lapses in barrier use.  Past Medical History:  - Obesity (BMI 54)  - Gestational diabetes in last pregnancy  - Iron-deficiency anaemia (on intermittent oral iron)  - No known cardiac or respiratory conditions  Past Surgical History:  - No major surgeries  - All vaginal deliveries without significant perineal trauma  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12  - Cycles previously irregular (every 35-60 days)  - No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or abnormal smears  Drug History:  - Oral iron (ferrous sulfate) PRN  - No regular medications  - Denies illicit drug use  Allergy History:  - NKDA  Social History:  - Lives with extended family  - Currently not in education or employment  - Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 14)  - Occasional alcohol (denies binge drinking)  - No recreational drug use  Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Believes she may be pregnant again but is unsure due to irregular cycles.  - Concerns: Worried about impact on health given her weight and prior gestational diabetes. Also anxious about judgement from family.  - Expectations: Wants clarity on pregnancy status and advice on contraception.  Examination Findings:  - General: Obese (BMI 54), no pallor or jaundice.  - Cardiovascular: HS dual, no murmurs.  - Respiratory: Mild tachypnoea, no wheeze or crepitations.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, difficult to palpate uterus due to adiposity. No palpable masses.  - Pelvic Examination (deferred initially due to patient discomfort, offered ultrasound first):    - Speculum exam not performed (patient declined).    - Bimanual not attempted due to body habitus and distress.  Investigations:  1. Urine hCG: Positive.  2. Transabdominal Ultrasound: Challenging due to adiposity, but fetal pole visualised (~14 weeks gestation).  3. Bloods: Hb 98 g/L (anaemic), random glucose 8.2 mmol/L (elevated).  Management Plan:  1. Pregnancy Counselling:     - Discussed options (continuation vs termination) given risks (maternal obesity, gestational diabetes recurrence, thromboembolism risk).     - Referred to specialist obstetric team for high-risk antenatal care.     - Advised early OGTT and thromboprophylaxis assessment.  2. Contraception:     - Long-term contraception strongly advised post-pregnancy (e.g., implant/IUD).     - Risks of rapid repeat pregnancy discussed.  3. Lifestyle & Comorbidities:     - Smoking cessation referral given.     - Dietetic input for weight optimisation.     - Commenced on folic acid 5mg and prophylactic LMWH pending review.  4. Follow-Up:     - Urgent obstetric clinic appointment.     - Repeat Hb and glucose monitoring.  Patient reassured and encouraged to involve family/support network. Safety netting advice given regarding red flag symptoms (e.g., PV bleeding, severe pain).  Dictated by: [Clinician Name]  For testing purposes only – fictional case."
