Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact post-birth, and early milk expression if separated. Assess feeding within the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes to avoid teat confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, ready-made formula for medical needs, and clear instructions on preparation. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleeping (cot beside bed, avoid sofa co-sleeping). - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments; refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive annual training; compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Supplementation:** Limit formula use; if medically needed, offer small amounts via cup/tube while encouraging breastmilk expression. Emphasis is on individualized care, maternal choice, and reducing unnecessary supplementation",
