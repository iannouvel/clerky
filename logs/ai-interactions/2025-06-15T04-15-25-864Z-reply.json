Baseline FHR 140 bpm, moderate variability, no decelerations noted.\"  \n  - \"Patient counseled on CTG monitoring, including its purpose and limitations.\"  \n\nThese changes would better align the note with FIGO’s recommendations for high-risk intrapartum fetal monitoring.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 59 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: FIGO Consensus Guidelines on Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring: Cardiotocography\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
