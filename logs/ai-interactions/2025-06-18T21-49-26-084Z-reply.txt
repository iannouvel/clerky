      "newValue": "**Summary of Newborn Feeding Guideline:** - **Breastfeeding support** is prioritized, emphasizing **exclusive breastfeeding** for optimal outcomes. **Skin-to-skin contact** post-birth aids initiation. - **Expressing milk** early is advised if mother-baby separation occurs. **Responsive feeding** and recognizing cues are key. - **Supplementation** should be limited; alternatives like **finger or cup feeding** avoid teat confusion. Formula use requires medical justification. - **Formula feeding guidance** includes safe preparation, responsive practices, and ready-made formula for hospital use. - **Parent-infant bonding** is encouraged via skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, and safe sleep practices (cot beside bed, no sofa-sharing). - **Staff responsibilities**: Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive **mandatory training** annually. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly standards. - **Monitoring**: Newborns weighed at birth, day 5, and day 10. Feeding issues prompt assessments, referrals (e.g., tongue-tie), and incident reporting if re-admitted. - **Maternal support**: Laid-back positioning, breast compression for sleepy babies, and avoiding formula unless medically indicated to protect milk supply and reduce infection/allergy risks.
