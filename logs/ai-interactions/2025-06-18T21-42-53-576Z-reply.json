Address poor CTG quality by repositioning transducers or using fetal scalp electrodes (FSE). - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, preterm <34 weeks). Avoid if expedited birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Perform when fetal concerns arise, especially for SGA/FGR cases. Paired samples (artery/vein) should be analyzed promptly; delayed clamping (up to 60 sec) is still possible. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; ensure 10 minutes of quality data. Results update every 2 minutes (max 60 mins). Not diagnostic—clinical judgment remains key. - **Human Factors:** Effective communication and holistic clinical assessment are critical for CTG interpretation and management. *Key: Prioritize patient preferences, escalate concerns promptly, and document thoroughly.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
