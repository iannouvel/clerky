May be considered after 2 uncomplicated caesareans. - **Antenatal Care:** Consultant-led Birth Options clinic for counseling. Documented discussion on mode/place of birth, risks, and benefits. - **Intrapartum Care:** Continuous fetal monitoring recommended. Birth plan must be documented. Birthing pool use permitted with monitoring. - **Induction:** Options discussed at 40 weeks; continuous monitoring advised. - **Risks/Benefits of VBAC vs. ERCS:** - **VBAC:** Shorter recovery, 72-75% success rate, 0.5% uterine rupture risk, 5% anal sphincter injury, 8/10,000 HIE risk. - **ERCS:** Avoids uterine rupture but has higher maternal death risk (13/100,000), longer recovery, and increased future placental risks. - **Infant Outcomes:** VBAC has higher HIE risk; ERCS has lower HIE risk but higher transient respiratory morbidity (4-5%). Staff must provide evidence-based counseling and document preferences. Compliance monitored via Badgernet",
