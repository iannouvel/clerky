A: ### Summary:  
- Age: 63  
- BMI: 24.5  
- Gravida: 2, Para: 2  
- Gestational age: 39 weeks + 3 days  
- Presenting complaint: Active labor with regular contractions (every 3 minutes, lasting 60 seconds, moderate intensity).  
- Rupture of membranes 2 hours prior, clear amniotic fluid.  
- Fetal heart rate monitoring: Baseline 150 bpm, recurrent late decelerations, minimal variability, no accelerations.  

### Details:  
- Patient in active labor with reassuring baseline FHR but concerning recurrent late decelerations and minimal variability.  
- No documentation of fetal movement patterns prior to admission.  
- Maternal fever or recent infections not assessed.  
- Prior delivery history (mode, complications) not clarified.  
- Tocodynamometer placement and uterine activity pattern not confirmed.  
- Immediate interventions: Repositioning, IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, discontinuation of oxytocin (if infusing).  
- Further assessment planned: Scalp stimulation, fetal blood sampling if decelerations persist (equipment availability unconfirmed).  
- Obstetrician and anesthesia team notified for potential urgent delivery.  
- Maternal vital signs not repeated since admission.  
- Patient preferences for intervention (cesarean vs. operative vaginal delivery) not discussed.  
- Consent for procedures not yet obtained.  

### Plan:  
1. Reposition patient to left lateral tilt.  
2. Administer IV normal saline bolus.  
3. Provide supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 10L/min.  
4. Discontinue oxytocin if infusing.  
5. Perform scalp stimulation to assess fetal response.  
6. Consider fetal blood sampling if decelerations persist (verify equipment availability).  
7. Notify obstetrician and anesthesia team for potential urgent delivery.  
8. Continuous FHR monitoring with reassessment in 15 minutes.  
9. Repeat maternal vital signs (blood pressure, temperature).  
10. Obtain consent for potential procedures.  
11. Prepare for urgent delivery if FHR abnormalities persist or worsen.
