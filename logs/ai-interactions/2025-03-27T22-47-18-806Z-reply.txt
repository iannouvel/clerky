### Summary:  
- **Age**: 36 years  
- **BMI**: 44 (obesity class III)  
- **Gravida 1, Para 1** (prior uncomplicated vaginal delivery)  
- **Presenting complaints**:  
  - Irregular heavy menstrual bleeding (6 months) with clots and fatigue.  
  - Secondary subfertility (18 months).  
- **PMH**: PCOS, gestational diabetes (diet-controlled), depression (sertraline).  
- **No prior gynaecological surgery**.  

### Detailed Issues & Advice:  
1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding**:  
   - Cycles irregular (21–45 days), prolonged bleeding (7–10 days), heavy flow (6–8 pads/day), clots, fatigue.  
   - No post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding.  
   - Pelvic exam: slightly bulky uterus, no masses.  
   - Plan: Tranexamic acid + cyclical norethisterone; consider endometrial ablation/Mirena IUS if medical therapy fails.  

2. **Subfertility**:  
   - Prior spontaneous conception; no pelvic pain/dyspareunia.  
   - Obesity (BMI 44) likely contributing factor.  
   - Plan: Weight management (dietitian/bariatric referral), ovulation induction (clomiphene citrate if anovulatory), HSG for tubal patency.  

3. **Anaemia**:  
   - Fatigue/dizziness suggestive; iron supplementation if Hb low.  

4. **PCOS follow-up**:  
   - Bloods: testosterone, HbA1c, TSH, prolactin.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound for endometrial thickness/ovarian morphology.  

### Plan:  
1. **Investigations**:  
   - FBC, HbA1c, TSH, prolactin, testosterone.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound ± hysteroscopy if abnormal.  
   - Day 21 progesterone, HSG for fertility workup.  

2. **Heavy bleeding management**:  
   - Start tranexamic acid + cyclical norethisterone.  
   - Surgical options if refractory (endometrial ablation/Mirena IUS).  

3. **Subfertility management**:  
   - Refer to dietitian/bariatric team for weight loss.  
   - Clomiphene citrate if anovulatory (post-tubal patency confirmation).  

4. **Anaemia**: Iron supplementation if indicated.  

5. **Follow-up**:  
   - Review results in 2 weeks.  
   - Advise cycle tracking with ovulation kits.
