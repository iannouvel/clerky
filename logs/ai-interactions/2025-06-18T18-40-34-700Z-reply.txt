      "newValue": "**Summary of Antenatal Care Guidelines:** - **Antenatal care** spans from conception to birth, delivered locally by midwives, with individualized care plans. - **Booking appointments** involve risk assessments (medical, obstetric, psychiatric, social history), health promotion, and informed consent for screenings (e.g., Chlamydia/Gonorrhea for those â‰¤24). Declined tests must be documented. - **Consultant review** is advised for pre-existing conditions. Blood/urine tests (e.g., urinalysis for proteinuria/UTIs) should be offered, with recurrent UTIs referred to obstetrics. - **Safeguarding:** Address mental health, domestic abuse, FGM, and vulnerabilities. Provide language support for non-English speakers. - **Lifestyle advice:** Offer smoking cessation, alcohol guidelines, and weight management (BMI <30). Monitor fetal growth to reduce stillbirth risk. - **Symptom management:** Address nausea, heartburn, pelvic pain, and vaginal bleeding (refer to EPAC if <16 weeks; labor ward if >16 weeks). - **High-risk groups:** Closer monitoring for ethnic minorities, deprived areas, and migrants. Ensure unbiased information and continuity of care. - **Documentation:** Maintain records (screening results, risk assessments) and coordinate care for complex cases. - **References:** Follow MBRRACE-UK 2023 and UK NSC guidelines for asymptomatic bacteriuria. *(Senior Midwife, Worthing Hospital/St Richards Hospital)*",
