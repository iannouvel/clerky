Initially manageable with dietary modifications, symptoms have progressively worsened over the past week. She reports vomiting 8-12 times daily, unable to keep down any food or fluids for the past 3 days. She has lost 4kg since her booking appointment 2 weeks ago (pre-pregnancy weight 58kg). She feels dizzy when standing, has not passed urine for 12 hours, and feels extremely weak. No abdominal pain, no bleeding, no fever. This is her first pregnancy, conceived naturally after 6 months of trying. No significant medical history, no regular medications except folic acid which she cannot keep down. Family history of hyperemesis in maternal grandmother. Works as a nurse but has been off work for 1 week due to symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell. Vital signs: BP 98/65 mmHg (booking BP 115/75), HR 108 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Mucous membranes dry, skin turgor reduced, ketotic smell on breath. Weight 54kg (4kg loss from booking). Abdomen soft, mild epigastric tenderness, no guarding. Urinalysis shows 3+ ketones, 2+ protein, specific gravity >1.030. Bloods reveal: Na+ 128 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, urea 8.2 mmol/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L, Hb 14.8 g/dL (hemoconcentration). LFTs mildly deranged: ALT 56 U/L, bilirubin 28 μmol/L. Transvaginal ultrasound confirms single viable fetus measuring 9+3 weeks with fetal heart rate 171 bpm.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission for IV fluid resuscitation and antiemetic therapy. IV Hartmann's solution commenced, electrolyte replacement (potassium and magnesium supplements). Antiemetics: ondansetron 8mg BD, cyclizine 50mg TDS, consider metoclopramide. Thiamine supplementation to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy. NBM initially then gradual reintroduction of clear fluids as tolerated. Daily weights and fluid balance monitoring. Serial electrolyte monitoring. Nutritional assessment - may require enteral feeding if prolonged. Psychological support given impact on quality of life. Aim for symptom control and weight stabilization before discharge with community midwife follow-up.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] uhsussex-nausea-and-vomiting-in-pregnancy-hyperemesis-gravidarum-2025-pdf\nTitle: UHSussex - Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy + Hyperemesis Gravidarum - 2025.pdf\nContent: Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum\n\nThis guideline supports the management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in General Practice and specialist care settings in Sussex. NVP affects up to 90% of pregnant people and can be successfully managed in General Practice. HG is a severe form of NVP that may require specialist support. Prompt effective management improves quality of life and pregnancy outcomes.\n\nMedication to manage symptoms of NVP and HG:\n- Antiemetic medications can be taken in all trimesters of pregnancy.\n- Use pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate or cyclizine for first-time pregnancies.\n- Consider combinations of antiemetics for non-responders.\n- Consider thiamine for patients with severe symptoms.\n- Use the PUQE scoring system to assess severity.\n\nPractice points for General Practitioners:\n- Consider alternative causes if symptoms start after 16 weeks of pregnancy.\n- Regularly monitor renal function, weight, hydration, and vitamin levels.\n- Assess mental health and consider referral if necessary.\n- Offer counselling and validate the severity of symptoms.\n- Prescribe antiemetics as needed and refer for specialist support if required.\n\nPractice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management):\n- Review risks and consider LMWH as per local guidelines.\n- Use antiemetic medication guidance and consider corticosteroids if needed.\n- Ensure appropriate nutrition, hydration, and management of concurrent conditions.\n- Offer serial scans for people with continued symptoms in late pregnancy.\n- Provide support groups information and advise on future pregnancies.\n\nHow to refer for specialist support/ambulatory care:\n- Contact specialist centers for support and referrals.\n- Consider termination of pregnancy only after exploring all treatment options.\n- Offer counselling before and after any decision regarding termination.\n\nUseful resources and signposting information:\n- Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum\n- RCOG pregnancy sickness patient information leaflet\n- Pregnancy Sickness Support organization\n- UK Teratology Information Service\n- Specialist Pharmacy Service\n- HER Foundation\n\nAppendix 1: Summary for General Practitioners\n- Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum\n\nAppendix 2: Summary for Management in General Practice\n\nAppendix 3: Summary for Ambulatory Care\n\nAppendix 4: Summary for Emergency Department Staff\n\nAppendix 5: Summary for Inpatient Care\n\nNote: Trust may be using IV thiamine - see local policy.",

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Document PUQE (Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis) score to objectively assess severity of hyperemesis gravidarum.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends using the PUQE scoring system to assess severity (referenced in "Medication to manage symptoms of NVP and HG").  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider adding pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as first-line antiemetic, either alone or in combination with doxylamine, per guideline recommendations for first-time pregnancies.  
   Reason: The guideline states, "Use pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate or cyclizine for first-time pregnancies" (referenced in "Medication to manage symptoms of NVP and HG").  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written patient information (e.g., RCOG pregnancy sickness leaflet) and signpost to support organizations (e.g., Pregnancy Sickness Support).  
   Reason: The guideline lists these as useful resources (referenced in "Useful resources and signposting information").  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Assess and document mental health status (e.g., anxiety, depression) due to the psychological impact of hyperemesis.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends assessing mental health and considering referral if necessary (referenced in "Practice points for General Practitioners").  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) if symptoms persist despite first-line antiemetics, as per secondary care recommendations.  
   Reason: The guideline suggests considering corticosteroids if needed (referenced in "Practice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management)").  

3. **Additional information needed** - Document discussion about thromboprophylaxis (e.g., LMWH) given dehydration and immobility.  
   Reason: The guideline advises reviewing risks and considering LMWH as per local guidelines (referenced in "Practice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management)").  

### Less Important Recommendations  
1. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss potential need for enteral feeding (e.g., NG tube) earlier in counseling to set expectations.  
   Reason: The guideline emphasizes appropriate nutrition management (referenced in "Practice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management)").  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document fetal well-being reassurance (e.g., ultrasound findings) in the patient’s notes to reinforce counseling.  
   Reason: The guideline highlights the importance of validating symptom severity (referenced in "Practice points for General Practitioners").  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest keeping a symptom diary post-discharge to track progress.  
   Reason: While not explicitly mentioned in the guideline, this could help with outpatient follow-up.  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document family history details more comprehensively (e.g., maternal grandmother’s hyperemesis treatment).  
   Reason: This is minor but could provide additional context for severity assessment.  

### Summary  
The clinical note largely aligns with the guideline but would benefit from:  
- Objective severity scoring (PUQE).  
- First-line antiemetic use (pyridoxine ± doxylamine).  
- Better documentation of mental health and patient resources.  
- Consideration of corticosteroids if symptoms persist.  

These changes would enhance compliance with the UHSussex 2025 guideline.
