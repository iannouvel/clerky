Regular checks of the resuscitaire (heater, oxygen supply, suction, masks, etc.) are mandatory. - **Drug Dosing**: Weight-based dosing for adrenaline (0.2 ml/kg IV/IO), bicarbonate (2–4 ml/kg of 4.2%), glucose 10% (2.5 ml/kg), and 0.9% sodium chloride (10 ml/kg). ETT sizes and lengths are specified by weight/gestation. - **Preterm Infants (<26 weeks)**: Individualized decision-making with parental involvement. Options include resuscitation, comfort care, or survival-focused care, guided by gestational age and viability. - **Flowchart**: Follow Resuscitation Council UK’s Newborn Life Support (NLS 2021) algorithm. - **Documentation**: Includes checklists for equipment (e.g., oxygen cylinders, suction, masks, blades) and protocols for emergency communication. - **Training**: Staff must undergo regular neonatal life support training and competency assessments.
