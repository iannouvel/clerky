It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing prevention, monitoring, and timely intervention. **Key Recommendations:** - **Prevention:** Anticipate hypothermia in at-risk infants; maintain a warm environment and encourage skin-to-skin contact. - **At Birth:** Dry the baby immediately, promote skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding. - **Low Temperature Management:** Use skin-to-skin contact, continuous monitoring, and a hot cot if needed. - **Hot Cot Use:** Keep it pre-warmed, monitor temperature closely, and gradually reduce heat once stable. - **Ongoing Care:** Discontinue monitoring if temperature stabilizes; prioritize feeding. - **Parental Communication:** Explain procedures and management to parents. - **Audit:** Compliance and outcomes are tracked via the Maternity Audit Document. Staff must follow these steps while applying professional judgment",
