committed to the well-being and safety of \nwomen and children who present to this organisation. This guideline outlines the legislation, \nprinciples and guidance that inform the practise of all health care professionals in all areas \nthat deliver services to women and their children in relation to the practice of Female Genital \nMutilation (FGM). \n \n2.0 Aim \n \nThis guideline aims to provide support and advice to all staff who have a responsibility to \nsafeguard children and protect and support adults from the abuses associated with FGM. \n \n3.0 Abbreviations used in this document \n \nFGM - Female Genital Mutilation \nHSCIC - Health & Social Care Information \nCentre \nWHO - World Health Organisation FGM-IS - FGM Information Sharing \n \n4.0 Definition \n \nFGM comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female \ngenitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. \nIt has no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways. \n \nFGM is most often carried out on girls between infancy and fifteen years of age. It is also \nreferred to as cutting, female circumcision, cutting and infibulation. It has no health benefits \nand is a severe form of violence against women and girls. \n \n5.0 Types of FGM \n \nThe four FGM types defined by the World Health Organisation (2016) are: \n \n• Type 1 – Partial or total removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy) and/or the prepuce. \n• Type 2 – Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without \nexcision of the labia majora (excision). \n• Type 3 – Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting \nand appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision \nof the clitoris (infibulation). \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 5 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n• Type 4 – All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical \npurposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising, scraping and \ncauterization. \n \n6.0 The legal and regulatory responsibilities of UK health professionals \n \nAll health professionals should be aware of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 which \nmakes it illegal (regardless of their nationality or residence status) to: \n \n• Perform FGM in England and Wales (Section 1 of the 2003 Act). \n• Assist a girl to carry out FGM on herself in England and Wales (Section 2 of the \n2003 Act). \n• Assist (from England or Wales), a non-UK person to carry out FGM outside the UK \non a UK national or UK resident (Section 3 of the 2003 Act). \n• If the mutilation takes place in England or Wales, the nationality or residence \nstatus of the victim is irrelevant. \n• If an offence under sections 1,2 or 3 of the 2003 Act is committed against a girl \nunder the age of 16, each person who is responsible for the girl at the time the \nFGM occurred could be guilty of an offence under Section 3A of the 2003 Act. \n• The 2003 Act places a mandatory duty on health and social care professionals and \nteachers to notify the police where they discover that FGM has been carried out on \na girl under 18 years of age during the course of their work. \n6.1 Serious Crime Act 2015 \n \n• Introduced a new offence of failing to protect a girl from FGM. \n• Provided lifelong anonymity for victims. \n• Introduced an FGM protection order which might include surrendering a person’s \npassport. \n• Introduced mandatory reporting to the police for cases where FGM is identified in a \nperson under 18 years of age. \n \n7.0 Prevalence \n \nFGM is practised in at least 30 African countries (appendix 7). The single most important risk \nfactor determining whether a person undergoes a ritual procedure is her country of origin. \nThe majority of women who come from Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone will have \nsome form of FGM. The global incidence of FGM is over 200 million and every year some 3 \nmillion girls and women are at risk of FGM (WHO). \n \nPrevalence in the UK is difficult to estimate because of the hidden nature of the crime. \nHowever, it is estimated that over 20 000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk from FGM in \nthe UK each year and that 66 000 women in the UK are living with the consequences of FGM \n(NSPCC, 2016). \nThere is likely to be an uneven distribution of cases of FGM around the country, with more \noccurring in those areas of the UK with larger communities from the practising countries. \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 6 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nSince October 2014, the Health and Social Care Information Centre have regularly published \nofficial statistics relating to the number of patients treated in the NHS. All reports are \npublished at www.hscic.gov.uk/fgm and since January 2015, these have included some \nstatistics relating to patient numbers at local acute trust level. \n \n8.0 Safeguarding \n \nFGM is not an issue that can be decided on by personal preference – it is an illegal, \nextremely harmful practice and a form of child abuse and violence against women and girls. \n \nSafeguarding girls at risk of harm of FGM poses specific challenges because the families \ninvolved may give no other cause for concern with regard to their parenting responsibilities or \nrelationships with their children. However there still remains a duty for all professionals to act \nto safeguard people at risk. \n \nThere are four key issues to consider: \n \n1. An illegal act being performed on a female, regardless of age. \n2. The need to safeguard girls and young women at risk of FGM. \n3. The risk to girls and young women where a relative has undergone FGM. \n4. Situations where a girl may be removed from the country to undergo FGM. \n \nAnyone who has concerns about a child’s welfare should make a referral to the local \nauthority children’s social care. If professionals believe that an individual has undergone \nFGM, they must consider the risks to other girls and women who may be related to or living \nwith her and / or her family. \n \n9.0 Mandatory reporting \n \nFrom October 31\nst\n 2015 a mandatory duty to report cases of FGM was introduced through \nthe Serious Crime Act 2015. \n \nAll regulated health or social care professionals must report cases of FGM to the police if: \n \n• A girl under 18 tells them they have had FGM. \n• They see physical signs that a girl has had FGM. \n \nThis applies to registered professionals in NHS and private healthcare settings, during the \ncourse of their work. \n \n9.1 How to report FGM \n \nIf you are concerned that a child may have had FGM or be at risk of it, and they tell you that \nthey have FGM or you observe physical signs that appear to show FGM, the mandatory \nreporting duty applies and you must call 101 (the police non-emergency number) to make a \nreport. \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 7 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nYou must: \n \n• Report the case as soon as possible (at latest before the end of the next working \nday). \n• Record all decisions and actions. \n• Be prepared for a police officer to call you back. \n• Inform your local safeguarding lead of the case. \n \nFor Further information and guidance refer to: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fgm-mandatory-reporting-in-healthcare \n \n10.0 Guidance \n \nAppendix 4 and appendix 6 are pathways that offer professionals guidance to identify and \nconsider risks relating to female genital mutilation, and to support the discussion with the \npatient and family members. \nThey should be used it to help assess whether the patient you are treating is either at risk of \nharm in relation to FGM or has had FGM, and whether your patient has children who are \npotentially at risk of FGM, or if there are other children in the family/close friends who might \nbe at risk. \n \nIf, when asking questions based on this guide, any answer gives you cause for concern, you \nshould continue the discussion in this area, and consider asking other related questions to \nfurther explore this concern. Please remember either the assessment or the information \nobtained must be recorded within the patient’s healthcare record. The templates also require \nthat you record when and by whom it and at what point in the patient’s pathway this has been \ncompleted. \n \nHaving used the guide, you will need to decide: \n• Do you need to make a referral through the local safeguarding processes, and is \nthat an urgent or standard referral? \n• Do you need to seek help from my local safeguarding lead or other professional \nsupport before making your decision? You may wish to consult with a colleague at \na Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub, Children’s Social Services or the local Police \nForce for additional support. \n• If you do not believe the risk has altered since your last contact with the family, or if \nthe risk is not at the point where you need to refer to an external body, then you \nmust ensure you record and share information about your decision accordingly. \nFor further copies of risk assessment tools visit: \nhttp://www.westsussexscb.org.uk/professionals/female-genital-mutilation/ \n \nOr they can be found on the Trust intranet at: \nhttp://nww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk/safety/child-protection-and- \nsafeguarding/prevent/ \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 8 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nPatient and staff information leaflets can also be found on the Trust intranet. \n \n11.0 Mandatory recording \n \nThere is a mandatory requirement for trusts to submit patient specific details whenever FGM \nis identified or when patients have been treated in relation to FGM. Although the data set \ncontains person identifiable information these data are only used for data quality purposes. \nPersonal details collected via this data collection are not disclosed or used for any other \npurpose. \n \nData is currently collected from Sexual Health, Gynaecology and Paediatric services, on the \nbasis these areas are most likely to encounter FGM but officially, all specialties should be \ncovered by the data collection. \n \n11.1 Female Genital Mutilation Datasets \n \nThe Female Genital Mutilation Enhanced Dataset began collecting data on 1 April 2015. \n \nThe Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) is collecting data on FGM within \nEngland on behalf of the Department of Health and NHS England. This is to support the \nDepartment of Health’s and NHS England FGM Prevention Programme. The data is \ncollected to improve the NHS response to FGM and to help commission the services to \nsupport women who have experienced FGM as well as safeguarding women and girls at risk \nof FGM. \n \n11.2 What does it measure? \n \nThe FGM Enhanced Information Standard (SCCI 2026) instructs all clinicians to record into \nclinical notes when a patient with FGM is identified, and what the type of FGM is. \n \nData should be submitted every time the woman or girl has treatment related to her FGM or \ngives birth to a baby girl, and every time FGM is identified (by a clinician or self-reported), not \njust the first time. \n \nThe dataset includes: patient demographic data, specific FGM information, referral and \ntreatment information. \n \nThe FGM Datasets use the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definitions for the four types \nof FGM. \n \n11.3 Patient objections \n \nIf a patient raises an objection within the care delivery setting (i.e. within the GP surgery or \nthe hospital), the local organisation must consider this objection within their own processes, \nand ensure they record within the healthcare record the outcome of this decision (i.e. \nwhether or not to disclose information to HSCIC). \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 9 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nIf the objection is not raised at this point, and the patient's information is submitted, they can \nstill choose to contact HSCIC at a later date to raise an objection at the following email \naddress: enquiries@hscic.gov.uk. The objection will be automatically enforced and the \npatient's data will be removed from the dataset. If the objection is raised with the HSCIC, \nthey do not automatically have to accept this request and remove the information. However, \ndue to commitments made by the Secretary of State for Health, patient objections for FGM \ndata collection must always be treated as an automatic 'stop processing' request. This is a \nGovernment policy decision that goes beyond the law's requirements. \n \nThe FGM mandatory recording dataset tool can be found: \nhttp://nww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk/safety/child-protection-and- \nsafeguarding/fgm/?from_search=FGM \n \nLocally all cases of FGM are reported to Information.Team@wsht.nhs.uk \n \n12.0 FGM Information Sharing (FGM-IS) \n \nFGM-IS is a national IT system for health that allows clinicians across England to note on a \ngirl's record within the NHS Summary Care Record application that they are potentially at risk \nof FGM. The FGM-IS allows the potential risk of FGM to be shared confidentially with health \nprofessionals across all care settings until a girl is 18 years old. Authorised health \nprofessionals with the relevant security permissions on their NHS Smartcard are able to \naccess FGM Information Sharing. \nThe main groups of health professionals who use the system to add or view information are \nthose most likely to observe and identify the warning signs associated with the potential risk \nof FGM. This system can be viewed by clinicians working in the organisation including \nclinical staff working in sexual health, maternity, gynaecology and A&E. For further details of \nthis system and responsibilities details can be found at FGM enhanced dataset: NHS staff \nresponsibilities - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk). \n \n13.0 Maternity specific guidance \n13.1 Identification of FGM \n \n13.1.1 At booking \n \nAll women, irrespective of their country of origin, should be sensitively asked for a history of \nFGM at their booking antenatal visit so that FGM can be identified early in the pregnancy. It \nmust be appreciated that these women do not choose to undergo FGM and come from areas \nwhere this is considered the “norm”. Therefore, they need to be treated in a non- \njudgemental manner. \n \nIf required, an interpreter who is not a family member is recommended, giving careful \nconsideration to the sensitive nature of FGM as well as professional issues (i.e. \nconfidentiality). \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 10 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nSome suggested lead questions may be: “Have you been closed?” or “Did you have the cut \nor the operation as a child?” Further questions could be: “Do you have any problems passing \nurine or with menstruation?” or “How long does it take to pass urine?” \n \nIdentification of FGM must be fully recorded within the maternity information system. \n \n13.1.2 Antenatal care \n \nOnce FGM has been identified it is important that the woman receives support, information, \nadvice and counselling. The midwife should offer referral to a consultant with adequate \nexperience in the field of FGM. Some women will prefer to see a female doctor. Where \npossible this request should be accommodated. There is a designated lead on both sites for \nFGM and antenatal clinic will ensure appropriate referral. \n \nReferral must be done as early as possible (to enable antenatal intervention if necessary). If \na woman declines a referral this should be documented. It is imperative that these women \nare treated in a kind and sympathetic manner. \n \nAt this initial appointment an assessment should be carried out by the named consultant \nusing the proforma (Appendix 2) to record the type of FGM and the plan for de-infibulation. \n \n13.1.3 De-infibulation \n \nWomen with type 3 FGM will require antenatal de-infibulation for a vaginal birth. This should \nbe offered antenatally and should ideally be performed at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \nboth reduces the risk of miscarriage and allows time for healing before birth. If this is \ndeclined they should be seen again at 30 weeks for further discussion regarding plans \nsurrounding birth. The decision on this and procedure must be carried out by a senior \nobstetrician with adequate experience in this field. \n \nThe procedure may be performed under a local or regional anaesthesia depending on \nmaternal choice following an informed discussion. Adequate analgesia is essential to limit the \nrisk of further psychological harm. \n \nBefore de-infibulation, the following should be carried out: \n \n• MSU for bacteriuria. \n• Group and save (due to potential risk of haemorrhage). \n \nTechnique for de-infibulation: \n \n• Identify urethra and insert urinary catheter if possible. \n• Infiltrate infibulation scar with local anaesthetic whilst placing surgical forceps \nbehind the scar to prevent injury to underlying tissues. \n• Incise along midline infibulation scar either with scissors or a knife and extend \nanteriorly until the external urethral meatus is visible. \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 11 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n• Cutting diathermy can be used to reduce bleeding. \n• Use fine absorbable suture material. \n• Consider prophylactic antibiotics \n \nIntrapartum de-infibulation can be carried out in the first stage if there is inadequate access \nfor vaginal examinations but this will increase the risk of bleeding. An epidural must be \noffered. It is preferable to perform intrapartum de-infibulation as the head is crowning to \nreduce the chance of bleeding. In this situation the on-call Consultant should attend and \nshould supervise or perform the repair. Ideally consent for this should be taken antenatally. \n \nIt is important to remember that de-infibulation does not restore physical or emotional \nnormality. \n \nNote: it is possible that obstetricians / midwives may be asked to re-infibulate a woman \nfollowing a vaginal birth. Any postnatal repair, whether following spontaneous tearing or \ndeliberate de-infibulation, should ensure bleeding is controlled, but must not reproduce the \noriginal infibulation or result in a vaginal opening that makes intercourse difficult or \nimpossible. Infibulation under any circumstances is a criminal offence in the UK. The WHO \nrecommends suturing of raw edges to prevent spontaneous re-infibulation, but this should be \ndone with a continuous locked stitch to allow the raw edges to heal independently. \n \n13.1.4 Potential Complications of FGM \n \nThe following are potential difficulties or complications that may occur during the antenatal or \nintrapartum period and should be discussed antenatally with the woman and her partner: \n \n• An increased risk of urinary tract infection \n• Difficulty performing internal examinations \n• Difficulty in catheterising the bladder \n• Difficulty in applying a fetal scalp electrode \n• Delay in second stage \n• Risk of spontaneous perineal laceration \n• The need for an anterior midline episiotomy \n• Experience of “flashbacks” to time of FGM during vaginal examination \n \n13.1.5 Intrapartum Care \nMode of birth \nCaesarean birth is not absolutely indicated unless de-infibulation is not possible, this decision \nmust be made with the woman by the named lead Consultant for women with FGM. \n \nWomen with profound psychological effects (particularly if FGM was carried out in \nadolescence) may request an elective caesarean, however most women with FGM would \nprefer a vaginal birth and are successful. \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 12 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nRecommendations for vaginal births \n \n• Birth on the labour ward. \n• IV access and group and save. \n• Epidural analgesia is recommended if anterior episiotomy will be required in labour \n• The Birth Centre can be considered if successful de-infibulation and the woman \nhas had a previous vaginal birth without complications. \n \n13.1.6 Postnatal Care \n \nThe aim of postnatal care should be to provide support for the women and her baby for any \nphysical and psychological complications that may arise. The midwife should provide this in \nthe postnatal period with appropriate referral after this time. If de-infibulation has occurred \nthe woman will experience changes in micturition, menstruation and coitus. \n \nIt is also important to consider whether child protection is an issue when a female child is \nborn (see Appendix 5). \n \n14.0 Support & advice \n \nFemale Genital Mutilation Risk and Safeguarding Guidance for professionals' (2015) \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418564/29038 \n00_DH_FGM_Accessible_v0.1.pdf \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fgm-mandatory-reporting-in-healthcare \n \nHome Office: Mandatory Reporting procedural information \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mandatory-reporting-of-female-genital- \nmutilation-procedural-information \n \nSafeguarding women and girls at risk of FGM \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-women-and-girls-at-risk-of-fgm \n \nFemale Genital Mutilation: Multi- Agency Practice Guidelines \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/female-genital-mutilation-guidelines \n \nHealth Education England FGM e-Learning programme \nwww.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/female-genital-mutilation/ \n \nNSPCC FGM Helpline 0800 028 3550 \nfgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk \n \nNHS Choices FGM webpage for professionals \nwww.nhs.uk/fgmguidelines \n \nPan Sussex Child Protection and Safeguarding Procedures \nhttp://sussexchildprotection.procedures.org.uk \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 13 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nWSSCB – www.westsussexscb.org.uk \n \nWorking Together to Safeguard Children (2015) \nhttp://www.workingtogetheronline.co.uk/ \n \nFGM enhanced dataset: NHS staff responsibilities - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 14 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAudit \n \nSuggested auditable questions: \n \nAll women, irrespective of their country of origin, have been sensitively asked for a history of \nFGM at their booking antenatal visit so that FGM can be identified early in the pregnancy. \n \nAny cases of FGM have been reported to the police by the healthcare professional if: \n \n• A girl under 18 tells them they have had FGM. \n• They see physical signs that a girl has had FGM. \nAll cases of FGM must be: \n• Reported as soon as possible (at latest before the end of the next working day). \n• Recorded and all decisions and actions documented. \n• The health professional should be prepared for a police officer to call them back. \n• Local safeguarding lead must be informed of the case. \n \nAny women who have had FGM have been referred for obstetric review with the designated \nlead for FGM. \n \nDefibrillation should be offered around 20 weeks and re-offered at 30 weeks if declined. \n\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 15 of 26 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nReferences \n \nBritish Medical Association (1996) Female Genital Mutilation: Caring for Patients and Child \nProtection.

(SRH & WH) is committed to the well-being and safety of \\nwomen and children who present to this organisation. This guideline outlines the legislation, \\nprinciples and guidance that inform the practise of all health care professionals in all areas \\nthat deliver services to women and their children in relation to the practice of Female Genital \\nMutilation (FGM). \\n \\n2.0 Aim \\n \\nThis guideline aims to provide support and advice to all staff who have a responsibility to \\nsafeguard children and protect and support adults from the abuses associated with FGM. \\n \\n3.0 Abbreviations used in this document \\n \\nFGM - Female Genital Mutilation \\nHSCIC - Health & Social Care Information \\nCentre \\nWHO - World Health Organisation FGM-IS - FGM Information Sharing \\n \\n4.0 Definition \\n \\nFGM comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female \\ngenitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. \\nIt has no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways. \\n \\nFGM is most often carried out on girls between infancy and fifteen years of age. It is also \\nreferred to as cutting, female circumcision, cutting and infibulation. It has no health benefits \\nand is a severe form of violence against women and girls. \\n \\n5.0 Types of FGM \\n \\nThe four FGM types defined by the World Health Organisation (2016) are: \\n \\n• Type 1 – Partial or total removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy) and/or the prepuce. \\n• Type 2 – Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without \\nexcision of the labia majora (excision). \\n• Type 3 – Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting \\nand appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision \\nof the clitoris (infibulation). \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 5 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n• Type 4 – All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical \\npurposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising, scraping and \\ncauterization. \\n \\n6.0 The legal and regulatory responsibilities of UK health professionals \\n \\nAll health professionals should be aware of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 which \\nmakes it illegal (regardless of their nationality or residence status) to: \\n \\n• Perform FGM in England and Wales (Section 1 of the 2003 Act). \\n• Assist a girl to carry out FGM on herself in England and Wales (Section 2 of the \\n2003 Act). \\n• Assist (from England or Wales), a non-UK person to carry out FGM outside the UK \\non a UK national or UK resident (Section 3 of the 2003 Act). \\n• If the mutilation takes place in England or Wales, the nationality or residence \\nstatus of the victim is irrelevant. \\n• If an offence under sections 1,2 or 3 of the 2003 Act is committed against a girl \\nunder the age of 16, each person who is responsible for the girl at the time the \\nFGM occurred could be guilty of an offence under Section 3A of the 2003 Act. \\n• The 2003 Act places a mandatory duty on health and social care professionals and \\nteachers to notify the police where they discover that FGM has been carried out on \\na girl under 18 years of age during the course of their work. \\n6.1 Serious Crime Act 2015 \\n \\n• Introduced a new offence of failing to protect a girl from FGM. \\n• Provided lifelong anonymity for victims. \\n• Introduced an FGM protection order which might include surrendering a person’s \\npassport. \\n• Introduced mandatory reporting to the police for cases where FGM is identified in a \\nperson under 18 years of age. \\n \\n7.0 Prevalence \\n \\nFGM is practised in at least 30 African countries (appendix 7). The single most important risk \\nfactor determining whether a person undergoes a ritual procedure is her country of origin. \\nThe majority of women who come from Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone will have \\nsome form of FGM. The global incidence of FGM is over 200 million and every year some 3 \\nmillion girls and women are at risk of FGM (WHO). \\n \\nPrevalence in the UK is difficult to estimate because of the hidden nature of the crime. \\nHowever, it is estimated that over 20 000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk from FGM in \\nthe UK each year and that 66 000 women in the UK are living with the consequences of FGM \\n(NSPCC, 2016). \\nThere is likely to be an uneven distribution of cases of FGM around the country, with more \\noccurring in those areas of the UK with larger communities from the practising countries. \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 6 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nSince October 2014, the Health and Social Care Information Centre have regularly published \\nofficial statistics relating to the number of patients treated in the NHS. All reports are \\npublished at www.hscic.gov.uk/fgm and since January 2015, these have included some \\nstatistics relating to patient numbers at local acute trust level. \\n \\n8.0 Safeguarding \\n \\nFGM is not an issue that can be decided on by personal preference – it is an illegal, \\nextremely harmful practice and a form of child abuse and violence against women and girls. \\n \\nSafeguarding girls at risk of harm of FGM poses specific challenges because the families \\ninvolved may give no other cause for concern with regard to their parenting responsibilities or \\nrelationships with their children. However there still remains a duty for all professionals to act \\nto safeguard people at risk. \\n \\nThere are four key issues to consider: \\n \\n1. An illegal act being performed on a female, regardless of age. \\n2. The need to safeguard girls and young women at risk of FGM. \\n3. The risk to girls and young women where a relative has undergone FGM. \\n4. Situations where a girl may be removed from the country to undergo FGM. \\n \\nAnyone who has concerns about a child’s welfare should make a referral to the local \\nauthority children’s social care. If professionals believe that an individual has undergone \\nFGM, they must consider the risks to other girls and women who may be related to or living \\nwith her and / or her family. \\n \\n9.0 Mandatory reporting \\n \\nFrom October 31\\nst\\n 2015 a mandatory duty to report cases of FGM was introduced through \\nthe Serious Crime Act 2015. \\n \\nAll regulated health or social care professionals must report cases of FGM to the police if: \\n \\n• A girl under 18 tells them they have had FGM. \\n• They see physical signs that a girl has had FGM. \\n \\nThis applies to registered professionals in NHS and private healthcare settings, during the \\ncourse of their work. \\n \\n9.1 How to report FGM \\n \\nIf you are concerned that a child may have had FGM or be at risk of it, and they tell you that \\nthey have FGM or you observe physical signs that appear to show FGM, the mandatory \\nreporting duty applies and you must call 101 (the police non-emergency number) to make a \\nreport. \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 7 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nYou must: \\n \\n• Report the case as soon as possible (at latest before the end of the next working \\nday). \\n• Record all decisions and actions. \\n• Be prepared for a police officer to call you back. \\n• Inform your local safeguarding lead of the case. \\n \\nFor Further information and guidance refer to: \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fgm-mandatory-reporting-in-healthcare \\n \\n10.0 Guidance \\n \\nAppendix 4 and appendix 6 are pathways that offer professionals guidance to identify and \\nconsider risks relating to female genital mutilation, and to support the discussion with the \\npatient and family members. \\nThey should be used it to help assess whether the patient you are treating is either at risk of \\nharm in relation to FGM or has had FGM, and whether your patient has children who are \\npotentially at risk of FGM, or if there are other children in the family/close friends who might \\nbe at risk. \\n \\nIf, when asking questions based on this guide, any answer gives you cause for concern, you \\nshould continue the discussion in this area, and consider asking other related questions to \\nfurther explore this concern. Please remember either the assessment or the information \\nobtained must be recorded within the patient’s healthcare record. The templates also require \\nthat you record when and by whom it and at what point in the patient’s pathway this has been \\ncompleted. \\n \\nHaving used the guide, you will need to decide: \\n• Do you need to make a referral through the local safeguarding processes, and is \\nthat an urgent or standard referral? \\n• Do you need to seek help from my local safeguarding lead or other professional \\nsupport before making your decision? You may wish to consult with a colleague at \\na Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub, Children’s Social Services or the local Police \\nForce for additional support. \\n• If you do not believe the risk has altered since your last contact with the family, or if \\nthe risk is not at the point where you need to refer to an external body, then you \\nmust ensure you record and share information about your decision accordingly. \\nFor further copies of risk assessment tools visit: \\nhttp://www.westsussexscb.org.uk/professionals/female-genital-mutilation/ \\n \\nOr they can be found on the Trust intranet at: \\nhttp://nww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk/safety/child-protection-and- \\nsafeguarding/prevent/ \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 8 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nPatient and staff information leaflets can also be found on the Trust intranet. \\n \\n11.0 Mandatory recording \\n \\nThere is a mandatory requirement for trusts to submit patient specific details whenever FGM \\nis identified or when patients have been treated in relation to FGM. Although the data set \\ncontains person identifiable information these data are only used for data quality purposes. \\nPersonal details collected via this data collection are not disclosed or used for any other \\npurpose. \\n \\nData is currently collected from Sexual Health, Gynaecology and Paediatric services, on the \\nbasis these areas are most likely to encounter FGM but officially, all specialties should be \\ncovered by the data collection. \\n \\n11.1 Female Genital Mutilation Datasets \\n \\nThe Female Genital Mutilation Enhanced Dataset began collecting data on 1 April 2015. \\n \\nThe Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) is collecting data on FGM within \\nEngland on behalf of the Department of Health and NHS England. This is to support the \\nDepartment of Health’s and NHS England FGM Prevention Programme. The data is \\ncollected to improve the NHS response to FGM and to help commission the services to \\nsupport women who have experienced FGM as well as safeguarding women and girls at risk \\nof FGM. \\n \\n11.2 What does it measure? \\n \\nThe FGM Enhanced Information Standard (SCCI 2026) instructs all clinicians to record into \\nclinical notes when a patient with FGM is identified, and what the type of FGM is. \\n \\nData should be submitted every time the woman or girl has treatment related to her FGM or \\ngives birth to a baby girl, and every time FGM is identified (by a clinician or self-reported), not \\njust the first time. \\n \\nThe dataset includes: patient demographic data, specific FGM information, referral and \\ntreatment information. \\n \\nThe FGM Datasets use the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definitions for the four types \\nof FGM. \\n \\n11.3 Patient objections \\n \\nIf a patient raises an objection within the care delivery setting (i.e. within the GP surgery or \\nthe hospital), the local organisation must consider this objection within their own processes, \\nand ensure they record within the healthcare record the outcome of this decision (i.e. \\nwhether or not to disclose information to HSCIC). \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 9 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nIf the objection is not raised at this point, and the patient's information is submitted, they can \\nstill choose to contact HSCIC at a later date to raise an objection at the following email \\naddress: enquiries@hscic.gov.uk. The objection will be automatically enforced and the \\npatient's data will be removed from the dataset. If the objection is raised with the HSCIC, \\nthey do not automatically have to accept this request and remove the information. However, \\ndue to commitments made by the Secretary of State for Health, patient objections for FGM \\ndata collection must always be treated as an automatic 'stop processing' request. This is a \\nGovernment policy decision that goes beyond the law's requirements. \\n \\nThe FGM mandatory recording dataset tool can be found: \\nhttp://nww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk/safety/child-protection-and- \\nsafeguarding/fgm/?from_search=FGM \\n \\nLocally all cases of FGM are reported to Information.Team@wsht.nhs.uk \\n \\n12.0 FGM Information Sharing (FGM-IS) \\n \\nFGM-IS is a national IT system for health that allows clinicians across England to note on a \\ngirl's record within the NHS Summary Care Record application that they are potentially at risk \\nof FGM. The FGM-IS allows the potential risk of FGM to be shared confidentially with health \\nprofessionals across all care settings until a girl is 18 years old. Authorised health \\nprofessionals with the relevant security permissions on their NHS Smartcard are able to \\naccess FGM Information Sharing. \\nThe main groups of health professionals who use the system to add or view information are \\nthose most likely to observe and identify the warning signs associated with the potential risk \\nof FGM. This system can be viewed by clinicians working in the organisation including \\nclinical staff working in sexual health, maternity, gynaecology and A&E. For further details of \\nthis system and responsibilities details can be found at FGM enhanced dataset: NHS staff \\nresponsibilities - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk). \\n \\n13.0 Maternity specific guidance \\n13.1 Identification of FGM \\n \\n13.1.1 At booking \\n \\nAll women, irrespective of their country of origin, should be sensitively asked for a history of \\nFGM at their booking antenatal visit so that FGM can be identified early in the pregnancy. It \\nmust be appreciated that these women do not choose to undergo FGM and come from areas \\nwhere this is considered the “norm”. Therefore, they need to be treated in a non- \\njudgemental manner. \\n \\nIf required, an interpreter who is not a family member is recommended, giving careful \\nconsideration to the sensitive nature of FGM as well as professional issues (i.e. \\nconfidentiality). \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 10 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nSome suggested lead questions may be: “Have you been closed?” or “Did you have the cut \\nor the operation as a child?” Further questions could be: “Do you have any problems passing \\nurine or with menstruation?” or “How long does it take to pass urine?” \\n \\nIdentification of FGM must be fully recorded within the maternity information system. \\n \\n13.1.2 Antenatal care \\n \\nOnce FGM has been identified it is important that the woman receives support, information, \\nadvice and counselling. The midwife should offer referral to a consultant with adequate \\nexperience in the field of FGM. Some women will prefer to see a female doctor. Where \\npossible this request should be accommodated. There is a designated lead on both sites for \\nFGM and antenatal clinic will ensure appropriate referral. \\n \\nReferral must be done as early as possible (to enable antenatal intervention if necessary). If \\na woman declines a referral this should be documented. It is imperative that these women \\nare treated in a kind and sympathetic manner. \\n \\nAt this initial appointment an assessment should be carried out by the named consultant \\nusing the proforma (Appendix 2) to record the type of FGM and the plan for de-infibulation. \\n \\n13.1.3 De-infibulation \\n \\nWomen with type 3 FGM will require antenatal de-infibulation for a vaginal birth. This should \\nbe offered antenatally and should ideally be performed at around 20 weeks of gestation. This \\nboth reduces the risk of miscarriage and allows time for healing before birth. If this is \\ndeclined they should be seen again at 30 weeks for further discussion regarding plans \\nsurrounding birth. The decision on this and procedure must be carried out by a senior \\nobstetrician with adequate experience in this field. \\n \\nThe procedure may be performed under a local or regional anaesthesia depending on \\nmaternal choice following an informed discussion. Adequate analgesia is essential to limit the \\nrisk of further psychological harm. \\n \\nBefore de-infibulation, the following should be carried out: \\n \\n• MSU for bacteriuria. \\n• Group and save (due to potential risk of haemorrhage). \\n \\nTechnique for de-infibulation: \\n \\n• Identify urethra and insert urinary catheter if possible. \\n• Infiltrate infibulation scar with local anaesthetic whilst placing surgical forceps \\nbehind the scar to prevent injury to underlying tissues. \\n• Incise along midline infibulation scar either with scissors or a knife and extend \\nanteriorly until the external urethral meatus is visible. \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 11 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n• Cutting diathermy can be used to reduce bleeding. \\n• Use fine absorbable suture material. \\n• Consider prophylactic antibiotics \\n \\nIntrapartum de-infibulation can be carried out in the first stage if there is inadequate access \\nfor vaginal examinations but this will increase the risk of bleeding. An epidural must be \\noffered. It is preferable to perform intrapartum de-infibulation as the head is crowning to \\nreduce the chance of bleeding. In this situation the on-call Consultant should attend and \\nshould supervise or perform the repair. Ideally consent for this should be taken antenatally. \\n \\nIt is important to remember that de-infibulation does not restore physical or emotional \\nnormality. \\n \\nNote: it is possible that obstetricians / midwives may be asked to re-infibulate a woman \\nfollowing a vaginal birth. Any postnatal repair, whether following spontaneous tearing or \\ndeliberate de-infibulation, should ensure bleeding is controlled, but must not reproduce the \\noriginal infibulation or result in a vaginal opening that makes intercourse difficult or \\nimpossible. Infibulation under any circumstances is a criminal offence in the UK. The WHO \\nrecommends suturing of raw edges to prevent spontaneous re-infibulation, but this should be \\ndone with a continuous locked stitch to allow the raw edges to heal independently. \\n \\n13.1.4 Potential Complications of FGM \\n \\nThe following are potential difficulties or complications that may occur during the antenatal or \\nintrapartum period and should be discussed antenatally with the woman and her partner: \\n \\n• An increased risk of urinary tract infection \\n• Difficulty performing internal examinations \\n• Difficulty in catheterising the bladder \\n• Difficulty in applying a fetal scalp electrode \\n• Delay in second stage \\n• Risk of spontaneous perineal laceration \\n• The need for an anterior midline episiotomy \\n• Experience of “flashbacks” to time of FGM during vaginal examination \\n \\n13.1.5 Intrapartum Care \\nMode of birth \\nCaesarean birth is not absolutely indicated unless de-infibulation is not possible, this decision \\nmust be made with the woman by the named lead Consultant for women with FGM. \\n \\nWomen with profound psychological effects (particularly if FGM was carried out in \\nadolescence) may request an elective caesarean, however most women with FGM would \\nprefer a vaginal birth and are successful. \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 12 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nRecommendations for vaginal births \\n \\n• Birth on the labour ward. \\n• IV access and group and save. \\n• Epidural analgesia is recommended if anterior episiotomy will be required in labour \\n• The Birth Centre can be considered if successful de-infibulation and the woman \\nhas had a previous vaginal birth without complications. \\n \\n13.1.6 Postnatal Care \\n \\nThe aim of postnatal care should be to provide support for the women and her baby for any \\nphysical and psychological complications that may arise. The midwife should provide this in \\nthe postnatal period with appropriate referral after this time. If de-infibulation has occurred \\nthe woman will experience changes in micturition, menstruation and coitus. \\n \\nIt is also important to consider whether child protection is an issue when a female child is \\nborn (see Appendix 5). \\n \\n14.0 Support & advice \\n \\nFemale Genital Mutilation Risk and Safeguarding Guidance for professionals' (2015) \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418564/29038 \\n00_DH_FGM_Accessible_v0.1.pdf \\n \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fgm-mandatory-reporting-in-healthcare \\n \\nHome Office: Mandatory Reporting procedural information \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mandatory-reporting-of-female-genital- \\nmutilation-procedural-information \\n \\nSafeguarding women and girls at risk of FGM \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-women-and-girls-at-risk-of-fgm \\n \\nFemale Genital Mutilation: Multi- Agency Practice Guidelines \\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/female-genital-mutilation-guidelines \\n \\nHealth Education England FGM e-Learning programme \\nwww.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/female-genital-mutilation/ \\n \\nNSPCC FGM Helpline 0800 028 3550 \\nfgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk \\n \\nNHS Choices FGM webpage for professionals \\nwww.nhs.uk/fgmguidelines \\n \\nPan Sussex Child Protection and Safeguarding Procedures \\nhttp://sussexchildprotection.procedures.org.uk \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 13 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nWSSCB – www.westsussexscb.org.uk \\n \\nWorking Together to Safeguard Children (2015) \\nhttp://www.workingtogetheronline.co.uk/ \\n \\nFGM enhanced dataset: NHS staff responsibilities - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 14 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nAudit \\n \\nSuggested auditable questions: \\n \\nAll women, irrespective of their country of origin, have been sensitively asked for a history of \\nFGM at their booking antenatal visit so that FGM can be identified early in the pregnancy. \\n \\nAny cases of FGM have been reported to the police by the healthcare professional if: \\n \\n• A girl under 18 tells them they have had FGM. \\n• They see physical signs that a girl has had FGM. \\nAll cases of FGM must be: \\n• Reported as soon as possible (at latest before the end of the next working day). \\n• Recorded and all decisions and actions documented. \\n• The health professional should be prepared for a police officer to call them back. \\n• Local safeguarding lead must be informed of the case. \\n \\nAny women who have had FGM have been referred for obstetric review with the designated \\nlead for FGM. \\n \\nDefibrillation should be offered around 20 weeks and re-offered at 30 weeks if declined. \\n\\nCG14020 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guideline v3.0 June 2022 Page 15 of 26 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nReferences \\n \\nBritish Medical Association (1996) Female Genital Mutilation: Caring for Patients and Child \\nProtection.
