Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower neonatal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, or large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound if fetal head position is uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, provide analgesia, bladder care, and thromboprophylaxis. Document thoroughly and plan postnatal follow-up. - **Psychological support**: Offer counseling for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
