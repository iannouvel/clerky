      "newValue": "**Summary of Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme Guidelines:** - **Screening Offer:** All pregnant individuals should be offered screening for Down’s (T21), Edwards’ (T18), and Patau’s (T13) syndromes. - **Tests Available:** - *Combined test* (first trimester) screens for T21, T18/T13, or all three. - *Quadruple test* (14+2 to 20+0 weeks) screens for T21 only. - **Informed Choice:** Pre-test information must be provided, with interpreters for non-English speakers. Choices (including declining screening) must be documented. - **Process:** - NT scans and blood tests are performed per protocol. - Results categorized as *low chance* (communicated via letter within 2 weeks) or *high chance* (direct contact by midwife within 1 working day). - **High-Chance Results:** Offer follow-up within 3 days, including diagnostic testing (amniocentesis/NIPT) with counseling on miscarriage risk. - **Increased NT (>3.5mm):** Requires fetal cardiac scan and anomaly scan; offer combined screening and invasive testing. - **Anomaly Detection:** Refer to fetal medicine/specialist teams; document all discussions and decisions. - **Audit:** Annual reporting on test coverage, turnaround times, and performance. - **Staff:** Ensure training, interpreter use, and failsafe checks (e.g., weekly database reviews for missing results). *Emphasis on patient autonomy, clear communication, and timely follow-up.* (199 words)",
