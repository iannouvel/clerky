Manage outpatient if stable, with corticosteroids for preterm risk. - **Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS):** High risk with prior CS and placenta praevia. Screen early; multidisciplinary care is essential. - **Placental abruption:** Manage based on severity (minor/major). Monitor for maternal/fetal compromise and DIC. - **Vasa praevia:** Timely delivery (CS) if confirmed. - **Acute management:** Resuscitate, involve anaesthetists early, and assess bleeding severity, fetal status, and gestation. - **Recurrent bleeding:** Refer to senior obstetrician; exclude cervical cancer via speculum exam. - **Intrapartum hemorrhage:** Identify cause (e.g., uterine rupture) and initiate emergency measures. - **Post-hemorrhage:** Monitor for PPH and other complications. **Audit Standards:** Consultant attendance at CS for placenta praevia and documented management plans for praevia/accreta",
