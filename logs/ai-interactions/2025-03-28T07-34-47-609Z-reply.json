She also reports a 4-month history of secondary amenorrhea prior to the onset of bleeding.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - The bleeding is described as &quot;flooding,&quot; requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1–2 pads hourly on heavy days).  - Associated with passage of large clots and intermittent cramping pain, rated 7&#x2F;10 in severity.  - No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  - Last menstrual period (LMP) was approximately 6 months ago, followed by amenorrhea until recent bleeding.  - Denies unprotected intercourse in the last year.  Past Medical History:  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin)  - Hypertension (on lisinopril)  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – diagnosed age 28  - Depression (on sertraline)  Past Surgical History:  - Appendectomy (age 20)  - Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) for incomplete miscarriage (age 32)  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche age 13, cycles historically irregular (every 35–90 days).  - No history of sexually transmitted infections.  - Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  - Contraception: Condoms intermittently, no hormonal contraception in the last 5 years.  Drug History:  - Metformin 1g BD  - Lisinopril 10mg OD  - Sertraline 50mg OD  - No recent NSAID use  Allergies:  - Penicillin (rash)  Social History:  - Smokes 10 cigarettes&#x2F;day (15 pack-year history)  - Occasional alcohol (1–2 units&#x2F;week)  - Lives with partner and two children  - Sedentary occupation, reports difficulty with physical activity due to weight and joint pain  Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried that bleeding may be &quot;something serious like cancer&quot; due to family history (mother had endometrial cancer at 55).  - Concerns: Anxious about needing surgery, given her weight and diabetes.  - Expectations: Wants clarity on the cause and treatment options, including &quot;whether hormones or an operation is needed.&quot;  Examination Findings:  - General: Obese, no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  - Speculum: Active bleeding noted, cervix appears nulliparous with no visible lesions.  - Bimanual: Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  Assessment:  1. Complex Gynaecological Issue 1: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) secondary to likely endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.     - Risk factors: obesity, PCOS, anovulation, diabetes.  2. Complex Gynaecological Issue 2: Chronic pelvic pain with possible adenomyosis (given bulky uterus and history of D&amp;C).  Management Plan:  1. Investigations:     - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and adnexae.     - Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle) to exclude hyperplasia&#x2F;malignancy.     - HbA1c and full blood count (FBC) to assess anemia and diabetic control.  2. Immediate:     - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS for heavy bleeding.     - Counsel on weight loss impact on symptoms and surgical risks.  3. Follow-Up:     - Urgent gynaecology clinic review with results.     - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD) if hyperplasia benign.     - Smoking cessation referral.  Patient Counseled:  - Risks of untreated AUB (anemia, cancer progression).  - Importance of biopsy despite discomfort.  - Weight loss as a long-term priority to reduce recurrence risk.  Next Steps:  - Expedited TVUS and biopsy arranged.  - GP to monitor blood pressure and HbA1c.
