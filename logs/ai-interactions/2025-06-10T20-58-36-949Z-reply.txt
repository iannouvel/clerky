Routine use of other investigations, including for hepatitis C, is no longer recommended. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP. Postnatal resolution of ICP should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after birth. The risk of stillbirth in ICP increases when serum bile acid concentrations are 100 micromol/L or more. Women with ICP have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They should have regular monitoring for these conditions. Women with ICP also have a small increased chance of developing hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases later in life. Women with moderate or severe ICP have a higher chance of preterm birth, meconium stained amniotic fluid, and their baby requiring neonatal care.\n\nActive management with planned early birth is recommended for women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Women with ICP should be monitored closely, with regular liver function tests and bile acid measurements. Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised. Drug treatments for ICP, such as topical emollients and antihistamines, can help alleviate symptoms but do not improve pregnancy outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes. Other treatments for ICP should only be considered in research studies or under specialist care. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies.\n\nDietary fat absorption is impaired in women with ICP, but routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms such as steatorrhoea are present. Women with ICP should consider planned birth based on peak bile acid concentration and other risk factors. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered to women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more. Standard analgesia and anaesthesia options should be offered for women with uncomplicated ICP during birth. Follow-up should be arranged at least 4 weeks postpartum for women with uncomplicated ICP to confirm resolution. ICP does not impact the choice of contraception or hormone replacement therapy. Women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and should have baseline liver function tests and bile acid concentrations checked at booking blood investigations.\n\nIn subsequent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests and bile acid concentrations should be performed to establish normal levels. Repeat testing should only be done if clinically indicated. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:\n- Identify prognostic tools for adverse perinatal outcomes in women with ICP\n- Determine if women with ICP should be tested for gestational diabetes\n- Investigate effective treatments for itching and prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes\n\nAUDITABLE TOPICS:\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered appropriate timing of birth\n- Proportion of women with uncomplicated raised bile acid concentrations receiving additional investigations\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered ursodeoxycholic acid\n- Proportion of women with severe ICP offered continuous fetal monitoring during labor\n\nUSEFUL LINKS AND SUPPORT GROUPS:\n- Information for healthcare professionals on maternal medication use in pregnancy\n- Information for women and families from ICP Support and RCOG\n- Information for women and families on medication use in pregnancy\n\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS:\nJG, CLK, and LC have declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nFUNDING INFORMATION:\nAll individuals involved in developing the Green-top Guidelines are unpaid volunteers except for RCOG staff.

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Different management plan** - Avoid routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) unless specifically for symptom relief, as it does not improve perinatal outcomes.  
   Reason: The guideline states "Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP" and "Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes."  

2. **Different management plan** - Re-evaluate the need for twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans, as these do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.  
   Reason: The guideline explicitly states "Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP."  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient more explicitly about the lack of evidence for UDCA in improving pregnancy outcomes, while acknowledging its potential for symptom relief.  
   Reason: The guideline emphasizes that treatments do not improve pregnancy outcomes, and patient counseling should reflect this.  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether baseline bile acid levels were checked at booking, as this is recommended for future reference in subsequent pregnancies.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends "In subsequent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests and bile acid concentrations should be performed to establish normal levels."  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing severe or atypical cases with a hepatologist, though this case does not currently appear severe.  
   Reason: The guideline advises "Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP."  

3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer information on the increased risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and ensure monitoring for these conditions.  
   Reason: The guideline states "Women with ICP have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They should have regular monitoring for these conditions."  

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting a more detailed social history regarding support systems postpartum, given the increased risk of neonatal care needs.  
   Reason: The guideline notes that women with ICP have a higher chance of their baby requiring neonatal care.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer written information on ICP Support and RCOG resources for further reading.  
   Reason: The guideline lists "Information for women and families from ICP Support and RCOG" as a useful resource.  

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient has a family history of hepatobiliary diseases, though this is not critical for management.  
   Reason: The guideline mentions a small increased chance of hepatobiliary diseases later in life, but this does not impact current management.  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Consider discussing long-term follow-up for hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases, though this is less urgent.  
   Reason: The guideline notes a small increased lifetime risk, but this is not a focus of acute management.  

### Summary of Key Adjustments Needed:
- **De-emphasize UDCA** unless the patient prioritizes symptom relief over unproven perinatal benefits.  
- **Reduce fetal surveillance intensity** (e.g., CTGs/growth scans) unless other indications exist, as they do not prevent stillbirth in ICP.  
- **Strengthen counseling** on risks (e.g., pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes) and realistic expectations of treatments.  
- **Align delivery timing** with bile acid levels (e.g., earlier delivery if ≥100 µmol/L) as the primary risk-stratification tool.  

These changes would better align the note with the 2022 BJOG guideline’s emphasis on avoiding unnecessary interventions while focusing on bile acid–guided delivery timing and symptom management.
