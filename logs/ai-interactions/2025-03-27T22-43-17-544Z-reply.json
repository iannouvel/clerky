Heavy flow (soaking 6–8 pads/day) with clots. Reports fatigue and dizziness, suggestive of anaemia.  \n- **Subfertility:** One prior uncomplicated pregnancy 5 years ago (spontaneous conception, vaginal delivery). Now trying for a second child with no success. No history of pelvic pain or dyspareunia.  \n- **No post-coital bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding.**  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Obesity (BMI 44)**  \n- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed aged 28** (irregular cycles, hirsutism)  \n- **Gestational diabetes** in prior pregnancy (diet-controlled)  \n- **Depression (on sertraline 50mg OD)**  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Appendicectomy (age 20)**  \n- **No prior gynaecological surgery**  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Sertraline 50mg OD  \n- Folic acid 400mcg OD (preconception)  \n- No regular analgesia  \n\n**Allergies:**  \n- **NKDA**  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Mother: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension  \n- No family history of gynaecological cancers  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Occasional alcohol (2–3 units/week)  \n- Works full-time in an office setting  \n- Lives with husband and 5-year-old child  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns & Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried that her weight is affecting fertility and bleeding. Concerned about possible fibroids or cancer.  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about difficulty conceiving and impact of heavy bleeding on daily life.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants investigations and treatment to regulate cycles and improve fertility.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese (BMI 44), no pallor, no signs of hyperandrogenism.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic exam:**  \n  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly bulky, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  \n- **No evidence of infection or cervical motion tenderness.**  \n\n**Investigations Ordered:**  \n1. **Blood tests:** FBC (anaemia screen), HbA1c (glucose control), TSH, prolactin, testosterone (PCOS follow-up).  \n2. **Pelvic ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, and rule out fibroids/polyps.  \n3. **Hysteroscopy (if ultrasound abnormal):** For further evaluation of heavy bleeding.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding:**  \n   - **Medical:** Tranexamic acid (if not contraindicated) + progesterone therapy (cyclical norethisterone).  \n   - **Surgical (if medical therapy fails):** Consider endometrial ablation or Mirena IUS (if fertility not immediate goal).  \n2. **Subfertility:**  \n   - **Weight management:** Referral to dietitian + bariatric team (BMI 44 increases pregnancy risks).  \n   - **Ovulation induction (if anovulatory):** Clomiphene citrate (after excluding tubal blockage).  \n   - **Further tests:** Day 21 progesterone (luteal phase), HSG (tubal patency).  \n3. **Anaemia:** Iron supplementation if Hb low.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review ultrasound and blood results in 2 weeks.  \n- Discuss fertility options based on findings.  \n- Advised to track cycles with ovulation kits.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. **Complex PCOS with obesity-related subfertility.**  \n2. **Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely anovulatory vs. structural cause).**  \n\n**Plan Documented By:** Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
