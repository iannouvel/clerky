In neonatal units, \"kangaroo care\" enhances oxygen levels, reduces stress, and aids growth. Uninterrupted SSC should begin immediately after birth, including post-caesarean, to support instinctive behaviors and breastfeeding initiation. Antenatal discussions should encourage SSC. Babies naturally seek the breast and self-attach during SSC, which also calms them. Hospitals must prioritize SSC, document observations, and ensure safety by monitoring the baby’s airway and well-being. Partners should be involved in care. SSC benefits both mother and baby, requiring institutional support for optimal outcomes",
