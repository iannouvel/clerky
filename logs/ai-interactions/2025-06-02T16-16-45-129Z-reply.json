      "The guidelines provide guidance on best clinical practice in the treatment and management of women living with HIV during pregnancy and postpartum, and their infants. Recommendations include the use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent vertical transmission of HIV, mode of delivery, and management of specific patient populations. Changes in recommendations include updated prevalence data on HIV in pregnancy, updated advice on infant feeding, expanded section on psychosocial care, and new data on antiretroviral safety. All women are recommended to start treatment and remain on lifelong treatment.\n\n- Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team\n- Pregnant women living with HIV should be offered peer support\n- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken\n- Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV\n- Pregnant women who are newly diagnosed with HIV do not require any additional baseline investigations\n- HIV resistance testing should be completed before initiation of treatment\n- In women conceiving on cART, there should be a minimum of one CD4 cell count at baseline and one at delivery\n- Women who commence cART in pregnancy should have regular CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load tests\n- Women conceiving on effective cART should continue treatment\n- All pregnant women should start ART during pregnancy\n- Tenofovir DF or abacavir with emtricitabine or lamivudine is recommended as a nucleoside backbone\n- An integrase inhibitor-based regimen should be considered in certain patients\n- Women presenting after 28 weeks should commence cART without delay\n- Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the woman is known\n\nWomen with HIV should defer invasive diagnostic tests until viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. If immediate testing is necessary, cART and nevirapine should be given. For mode of delivery, vaginal delivery is supported for viral load <50 copies/mL, while CS is recommended for viral load ≥400 copies/mL. PLCS is recommended for viral load between 50-399 copies/mL. For preterm SROM, intramuscular steroids should be given and delivery timing discussed. Zidovudine infusion is recommended for viral load >1000 copies/mL. All women with HIV should give birth in a facility with pediatric care. Water births are supported for viral load <50 copies/mL. Infant PEP duration is based on risk level and maternal viral load. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended for infants with HIV. Immunizations should follow national guidelines. Formula feeding is recommended for infants born to women with HIV. Lactation suppression is advised if viral load is >50 copies/mL. Breastfeeding is supported for virologically suppressed women. Infant HIV status should be monitored with molecular diagnostics and antibody testing. Postpartum care should include cART continuation, support services assessment, mental health evaluation, contraception discussion, and cervical cytology. Testing partners and older children for HIV is recommended for newly diagnosed women.\n\nEP commenced within 4 hours of delivery.  \n12 Proportion of HIV infected infants reported back to delivering obstetric unit for review  \n13 Proportion of infants born to women living with HIV who have HIV antibody testing for seroreversion \nperformed at age 22–24 months.  \n14 Proportion of infants reviewed postpartum by 6 weeks.  \n15 Proportion of mothers reviewed postpartum by 6 weeks.  \n16 Proportion with documented mental health assessment at booking, and at 4 –6 weeks postpartum.  \n\nA key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimise a woman’s own health. Furthermore, one \nof the major successes in the management of individuals living with HIV has been the prevention of vertical \ntransmission of HIV. With the widespread implementation of routine antenatal screening for HIV, vertical \ntransmission is now a rare occurrence in the UK. Practice continues to evolve based on observational data, theoretical considerations, and expert opinion. These guidelines aim to provide practical guidance for healthcare workers in managing pregnancy in the context of HIV. \n\nParticular areas of focus include psychosocial, infant feeding, neonatal, and postnatal management. The guidelines emphasize the need for antenatal HIV care to be delivered by a multidisciplinary team and recommend mental health assessment at booking and 4 –6 weeks postpartum. Infant feeding advice has been updated, and the use of cabergoline in non-breastfeeding women is discussed. The guidelines also address postpartum management of women living with HIV. \n\nThe guidelines provide guidance on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum, with a focus on reducing vertical transmission rates and improving outcomes for both mothers and infants.\n\n4. The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after pregnancy  \n4.1 Psychosocial issues around HIV and pregnancy  \n- Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).  \n- Pregnant women living with HIV should be offered peer support.  \n- Some women may experience psychosocial challenges during and/or after pregnancy.  \n- HIV is associated with a higher risk of poor mental health.  \n- Women living with HIV may experience significant psychosocial barriers to accessing care.  \n- Postnatal depression prevalence among women living with HIV is reported to be between 30% and 53%.  \n- Factors associated with postnatal depression in women living with HIV include past history of mental health issues, financial concerns, lack of social support, and HIV-related stigma.  \n- The link between gender-based violence and HIV is well established.  \n4.1.1 Social issues  \n- Women living with HIV may have issues relating to social support and immigration.  \n- Dispersal in pregnant women is generally inappropriate, and treatment for HIV is freely available regardless of immigration status.  \n- Antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal services are required to be considered 'immediately necessary'.  \n- Advice can be sought from various organizations for access to healthcare in the UK.  \n4.1.2 Psychosocial care  \n- Engagement in care from an MDT is crucial for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV.  \n- Confidentiality processes impact adherence to ART.  \n- Adherence to medication is vital for the success of ART.  \n- Reassurance about confidentiality is important for women living with HIV.  \n- HIV status should be included in the birth plan.  \n4.1.3 The antenatal HIV MDT  \n- The minimum team should comprise an HIV specialist, obstetrician, specialist midwife, and pediatrician.  \n- Peer support workers are a valuable component of care for women living with HIV.  \n4.1.4 The psychosocial care of women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy  \n- Women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy may require the support of an MDT.  \n- Prompt linkage to HIV care is beneficial for newly diagnosed pregnant women.  \n- Confidence in disclosing an HIV diagnosis varies among women and cultural factors may influence disclosure.  \n- Talking about HIV should be encouraged in all women.  \n- HIV testing of existing children should be raised with all women.  \n4.2 Perinatal mental health assessment  \n- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken at booking, and 4-6 weeks postpartum and 3-4 months postpartum.  \n- Existing NICE guidance on the detection of antenatal and postnatal depression should be followed by HIV MDTs.\n\n5.1 Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. For women living with HIV already engaged in care who become pregnant, sexual health screening is suggested. Genital tract infections should be treated according to guidelines. Screening for STIs is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV. Cervical cytology should be managed as per guidelines, with routine cytology deferred until postpartum. Contraception should be discussed antenatally. Pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV do not require additional baseline investigations. Resistance testing should be completed before treatment initiation. CD4 cell counts should be monitored throughout pregnancy.\n\nDuring pregnancy, women on cART should have regular HIV viral load tests, liver function tests, and interventions if viral load is not suppressed. Women conceiving on cART should continue treatment, with exceptions for certain regimens. Women on dolutegravir should take folic acid, and all women should start folic acid before pregnancy. It is recommended to continue cART throughout pregnancy and lifelong. Recommended and alternative agents in pregnancy are listed in Table 6.1.\n\nThe writing group recommends discussing therapy options with pregnant women to individualize treatment based on their concerns and preferences. Recommended nucleoside backbone combinations for HIV in pregnancy include tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine. Zidovudine monotherapy is not recommended. Treatment should be initiated in pregnant women with baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL by the start of the second trimester. Integrase inhibitor-based regimens are recommended for women with high baseline viral load or treatment failure. Raltegravir and dolutegravir can be used from 6 weeks' gestation. Late-presenting women after 28 weeks should start cART immediately, with consideration for raltegravir or dolutegravir-containing regimens.\n\nIn untreated women presenting in labor at term, a stat dose of nevirapine should be given along with oral zidovudine, lamivudine, and raltegravir. Intravenous zidovudine should also be administered during labor. In preterm labor, if the infant cannot absorb oral medications, consider adding double-dose tenofovir DF. Women presenting in labor without a documented HIV result should have an urgent HIV test and treatment should be initiated immediately to prevent vertical transmission. \n\nData on teratogenicity and neonatal outcomes of ART in pregnancy are based on various studies. Some antiretrovirals have shown no increased risk of birth defects, while others have inconclusive data. The use of dolutegravir in pregnancy has shown conflicting results, with some studies reporting an increased risk of neural tube defects. Pregnant women on dolutegravir should be informed of these risks and supported in their decision-making. \n\nRates of preterm delivery in women with HIV remain high, with some studies implicating boosted PIs. However, data on the association between antiretroviral agents and preterm delivery are complex and vary between populations. Studies have shown conflicting results, with some not finding an association between cART and preterm delivery.\n\nAn association between PI-containing cART and PTD has been reported in several studies. The timing of cART initiation, particularly in the first trimester, has also been linked to an increased risk of PTD. Studies have shown that lopinavir/r should be avoided, while atazanavir/r may be preferred if a PI is indicated. Randomized controlled trials have not specifically addressed the impact of ART on PTD rates. The pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals in pregnancy can be affected by physiological changes, but most NRTIs do not require dose adjustments. NNRTIs such as rilpivirine and efavirenz have been studied in pregnancy, with recommendations for monitoring and potential dose adjustments. Integrase inhibitors like raltegravir have shown variable levels during pregnancy, but no adverse events have been observed in infants. PIs, particularly cobicistat-boosted regimens, may have lower exposure during pregnancy and should be used cautiously. Overall, the data on cART and PTD remain complex, emphasizing the importance of safety in pregnancy.\n\nSwitch from cobicistat to ritonavir when initiating PIs during pregnancy. Protein binding reductions in the third trimester can increase free drug levels. No dose adjustment is needed for lopinavir/r in pregnancy. Atazanavir may require a dose increase to 400 mg in the third trimester. Consider twice daily darunavir dosing in pregnancy. Limited data on PI formulations in pregnancy. Enfuvirtide does not cross the placenta. Stopping ART postpartum is not recommended. A boosted PI-based regimen is recommended in women with HIV-2. Vertical transmission of HIV-2 is less common than HIV-1. Use ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimen and tenofovir with darunavir/r for HIV-2. Limited data on enfuvirtide, tipranavir, and maraviroc in pregnancy.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy for pregnant women living with HIV or hepatitis B: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Referral to a specialist is necessary to address all aspects of care, including effects on pregnancy, antiretroviral management, and prevention of vertical transmission. The prevalence of HBV co-infection in pregnant women varies by region and ethnicity. While there is no evidence of increased vertical transmission of HBV in co-infection compared to mono-infection, the impact of HIV on HBV disease progression is significant. Routine monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Treatment with antiretrovirals active against HBV should be continued during pregnancy. Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and lamivudine are recommended as the backbone of an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-naïve patients with HIV/HBV co-infection. Tenofovir DF should be added to cART if not already included, and lamivudine/emtricitabine may be omitted if necessary. Tenofovir alafenamide can be considered after the first trimester.\n\nLamivudine or emtricitabine should not be used as the only active drug against HBV in cART. Emtricitabine is the preferred option to be given with tenofovir DF in women with HBV and HIV. Tenofovir DF is effective at suppressing HBV DNA in mono- and co-infected patients. Liver enzymes should be monitored frequently after starting cART. HAV vaccine is recommended for all HAV non-immune women with HBV and HIV. cART active against both HBV and HIV should be continued postpartum. Neonatal immunisation with or without HBIG should commence within 24 hours of delivery. Maternal cART together with prompt post-delivery neonatal immunoprophylaxis is the ideal approach for preventing vertical transmission of HBV. All pregnant women with active HCV and HIV should be managed jointly with a clinician experienced in the management of these co-infections. LFTs should be repeated regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry are relatively contraindicated during pregnancy. In chronic HCV infection, there is unlikely to be a significant change in the HCV viral load during pregnancy.\n\nTreatment of HCV infection is not recommended during pregnancy. Ribavirin is teratogenic and should be discontinued immediately if pregnancy occurs during treatment. DAAs in pregnant women have unknown effects. Thyroid function testing should be included in routine blood tests during IFN therapy. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be avoided in male partners of pregnant women. Women with co-infection should discontinue HCV therapy when pregnancy is confirmed. Effective contraception should be used during and after ribavirin therapy. Pregnant women with both HCV and HIV should not be treated with ribavirin-based DAA therapies. Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all women with both HCV and HIV. HAV vaccination is recommended for non-immune women with both HCV and HIV. Normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if effective cART is being received. cART should be continued postpartum in all women with both HIV and HCV.\n\n8.1.1 Fetal ultrasound imaging should be performed as per national guidelines regardless of maternal HIV status. \n8.1.2 The combined screening test for fetal aneuploidies and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for those who screen as high risk is recommended as this has the best sensitivity and specificity and will minimize the number of women who may need invasive testing. \n8.1.3 Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the woman is known, and should ideally be deferred until HIV viral load has been adequately suppressed to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. \n8.1.4 If not on cART and the invasive diagnostic test procedure cannot be delayed until viral suppression is achieved, it is recommended that women should commence cART to include raltegravir and be given a single dose of nevirapine 2 –4 hours prior to the procedure.\n\nNo transmissions were observed in women with undetectable plasma viral load during amniocentesis. External cephalic version is recommended for breech presentation. Mode of delivery should be based on plasma viral load results at 36 weeks. Vaginal delivery is supported for viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, while PLCS is recommended for viral loads ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL. Limited data suggest no increased risk of vertical transmission with certain obstetric procedures. Vaginal birth after CS can be considered for women with viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL.\n\nIn a consultant-led maternity unit, a trial of labour with proper monitoring and rapid recourse to CS if needed has good outcomes for both the woman and neonate. For women attempting VBAC, 70% achieve vaginal delivery with a low uterine rupture rate. CS for prevention of vertical transmission should be done between 38 and 39 weeks' gestation. Timing of CS is crucial to balance the risks of TTN and labor onset. Immediate delivery within 24 hours is recommended for term pre-labour SROM. For women with SROM and a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate induction or CS is recommended. In cases of preterm SROM, decisions should be made in consultation with the full MDT. Intravenous zidovudine infusion is recommended for certain circumstances. Multiple pregnancies in women with HIV should be managed according to obstetric need. Women with HIV are recommended to give birth in a facility with direct access to pediatric care. Water births should be discussed with caution, especially for women with HIV.\n\nInfant PEP should be started within 4 hours of delivery. Zidovudine monotherapy for the infant is recommended for very low-risk cases, while combination PEP should be used for high-risk cases. Neonatal PEP should be started as soon as possible after birth, and within 4 hours. Maternal viral load at the time of delivery is crucial in determining the level of risk and treatment approach.\n\nIn the last version of the BHIVA pregnancy guidelines, 4 weeks of oral zidovudine was recommended for all infants except in specific HIGH-RISK circumstances relating to detectable or unknown maternal viral load at the time of delivery. This strategy has been successful in reducing vertical transmission rates in the UK and Ireland. In Germany, a 2-week neonatal zidovudine strategy has been recommended for over 10 years without increased transmission. French cohort data supports the safety of reducing neonatal PEP duration. BHIVA guidelines recommend a 2-week course of zidovudine in VERY LOW RISK situations. European cohort data shows that maternal cART initiated more than 10 weeks before delivery reduces transmission risk. For LOW RISK situations, 2 weeks of zidovudine is recommended if specific criteria are met. For HIGH RISK situations, combination therapy in neonates has shown reduced transmission rates. Combination PEP use in neonates has increased over time, with no advantage of combination PEP over single-drug prophylaxis noted. The choice of triple combination PEP for neonates should be based on specific criteria and expert advice. Intravenous ART in neonates is limited to zidovudine, with specific dosing regimens for premature infants. All infant PEP should be initiated within 4 hours of delivery.\n\nImmediate administration of PEP is especially important where the woman has not received any ART. For infants born to women on fully suppressive cART, zidovudine monotherapy PEP remains reasonable, even where the woman has a previous history of zidovudine exposure with resistance. Neonatal zidovudine monotherapy remains a reasonable approach for infants born to women with a plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, even if there is a previous history of zidovudine resistance. If a woman is known to have HIV-2 infection, follow the same advice as for HIV infant PEP but if HIGH RISK, nevirapine will not be effective. Seek expert advice. PEP should not be given beyond 2 weeks for VERY LOW-RISK or 4 weeks for LOW-RISK infants even if the infant is breastfed. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended from 1 month of age if HIV PCR screening is positive at any stage or if the infant is confirmed to be diagnosed with HIV. Immunisations should be given as per the national schedule. Breastfeeding advice for women with HIV living in the UK recommends formula feeding to eliminate the risk of postnatal transmission. Women not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of viral load >50 HIV RNA copies/mL, should be offered cabergoline to suppress lactation. Women who are virologically suppressed on cART with good adherence and who choose to breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should be informed about the risks.\n\nLow risk of transmission of HIV through breastfeeding in this situation and the requirement for extra maternal and infant clinical monitoring. When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding. Maternal cART is advised to minimize HIV transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the woman’s health. Women who choose to breastfeed should be advised of the small ongoing risk of HIV transmission. They should be supported in their decision if they fulfill specific criteria. Women who breastfeed with a known detectable HIV viral load should be referred to social care as this places their infant at significant risk of HIV infection. Healthcare providers requiring advice on the use of medicines during the breastfeeding period can contact the UK Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service. Women should inform partners/families and healthcare providers about their HIV status. Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on specific occasions for both breastfed and non-breastfed infants. Management of infants diagnosed with HIV should include starting cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and urgent referral to a specialist center. Follow national guidance for the management of maternal HBV and HCV in pregnancy. Timely routine vaccination should be ensured for HIV exposed but uninfected (HEU) children.\n\nGuidelines for the management of HIV infection in pregnant women recommend risk-adapted transmission prophylaxis to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission. Effective antiretroviral therapy starting before conception has been shown to prevent perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Shortened zidovudine regimens can also help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Additionally, combination neonatal prophylaxis has been used successfully to reduce transmission rates. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy has led to further declines in mother-to-child transmission rates.\n\nHIV during breastfeeding. All women recommended to continue cART postpartum. Support services should be assessed and referrals made without delay. Postnatal follow-up within 4-6 weeks is essential. Mental health assessment and support should be provided. Contraceptive needs should be discussed and ART may be changed to optimize contraception choice. Cytology should be scheduled 3 months post-delivery. Testing of partner and/or older children should be completed for women newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy.\n\nClinical guideline on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa.

For infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and ≤2 kg, the dose is 4 mg/kg twice a day. Duration of oral dosing depends on the risk level. Intravenous dosing is different for infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and <34/40 gestation. Lamivudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir, Nevirapine, Raltegravir, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Enfuvirtide, and Co-trimoxazole are all part of combination therapy with specific dosing instructions. PCP prophylaxis with Co-trimoxazole is recommended for HIV-infected infants starting at 4 weeks of age.",
      "Management of Bladder Pain Syndrome\nInitial clinical assessment should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, completion of a bladder diary, and testing for urinary tract infections. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Severity of BPS can be classified using validated symptom scores and visual analogue scales for pain. Initial management may include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Intravesical treatments such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, and dimethyl sulfoxide may be considered if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Further treatment options should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Referral to secondary care should be considered for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Physiotherapy and psychological support may be beneficial for patients with refractory BPS. Long-term follow-up in secondary care may be necessary until symptoms are controlled. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin.\n\nPelvic pain should be thoroughly investigated, including history of physical or sexual abuse. Physical examination should rule out bladder distension, hernias, and trigger points. Baseline investigations include bladder diary, food diary, and urine tests. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Conservative treatments include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Pharmacological treatments may include oral amitriptyline or cimetidine if conservative treatments fail.\n\nMultimodal therapy may be considered if single drugs are unsuccessful, but should be commenced by consultants with special expertise and consideration of multidisciplinary input. Intravesical treatments, such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, dimethyl sulfoxide, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate, may be added or substituted if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Options should be individualized based on clinical team expertise. Further treatment options, such as cystoscopic fulguration, neuromodulation, oral cyclosporin A, cystoscopy, and major surgery, should be considered after referral to a pain clinic and discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. Treatments not recommended include oral hydroxyzine, oral pentosan polysulfate, long-term antibiotics, intravesical resiniferatoxin, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, high-pressure long-duration hydrodistension, and long-term oral glucocorticoids. Referral to a physiotherapist, pain team, or clinical psychologist should be considered for additional support. Patients should be followed up periodically in secondary care until symptoms are controlled, with consideration for shared care between the pain team and urogynaecology. Support groups can provide additional resources for patients.\n\nThe effect of pregnancy on the severity of BPS symptoms can be variable. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin. DMSO should be avoided in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects. Limited information is available on changes in symptoms during pregnancy. Patients with mild symptoms may experience worsening during pregnancy, while those with severe symptoms may see improvement. Oral amitriptyline is the safest oral treatment option in pregnancy. Heparin is the safest intravesical treatment. Lidocaine crosses the placenta, and corticosteroids may have long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Sacral nerve stimulators should be turned off during pregnancy. There is limited evidence on a genetic predisposition for BPS. DMSO should be avoided during pregnancy. Recommendations for future research include creating a standardized assessment questionnaire and assessing the role of conservative treatments for BPS. Useful links and support groups are available for BPS patients.\n\n43. Shorter B, Lesser M, Moldwin RM, Kushner L. Effect of comestibles on symptoms of interstitial cystitis.

      "Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\nTransvaginal ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice for tubal ectopic pregnancy.\nTubal ectopic pregnancies should be positively identified by visualizing an adnexal mass.\nA serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) level is useful for planning management.\nUltrasound is the primary diagnostic modality for caesarean scar pregnancy.\nDefined criteria exist for diagnosing various types of ectopic pregnancies.\nSurgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options are available for different types of ectopic pregnancies.\nWomen with ectopic pregnancies should be offered anti-D immunoglobulin.\nLong-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy should be discussed with patients.\nWomen should be offered support and counseling during treatment for ectopic pregnancy.\nProviders of early pregnancy care should have access to appropriate management options.\nClinicians managing ectopic pregnancies must have received appropriate training.\n\nClinicians must have appropriate training for ultrasound-guided needle techniques in medical management. If unable to perform full surgical procedures for ectopic pregnancy, support must be available. Virtual reality simulators can aid in training for salpingectomy. Ectopic pregnancies include various types, but not pregnancy of unknown location. Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking. Ultrasound is the primary tool for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy, with specific criteria for identification. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are useful for management planning. Cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies have defined ultrasound criteria for diagnosis. Interstitial pregnancy occurs in the fallopian tube and has specific ultrasound criteria for diagnosis.\n\nA single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. At presentation, based on clinical symptoms and ultrasound scan, if there is suspicion of interstitial pregnancy, a single serum b-hCG should be carried out. The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy: visualization of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body, gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus and completely surrounded by myometrium, and a vascular pedicle adjoining the gestational sac to the unicornuate uterus. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. Ovarian ectopic pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose with certainty preoperatively, so the diagnosis should be considered whenever ultrasound findings are suspicious. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. A heterotopic pregnancy is diagnosed when the ultrasound findings demonstrate an intrauterine pregnancy and a coexisting ectopic pregnancy. Heterotopic pregnancy should be considered in all women presenting after assisted reproductive technologies, in women with an intrauterine pregnancy complaining of persistent pelvic pain, and in those women with a persistently raised b-hCG level following miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.\n\nCG levels greater than 5000 iu/l are significant predictors of failure in ectopic pregnancies. Methotrexate treatment success is higher with smaller increases in b-hCG levels prior to administration. A decrease in b-hCG levels from day 1 to day 4 after methotrexate administration is associated with higher success rates. Methotrexate should be the first-line management for women with specific criteria. Expectant management is a reasonable option for selected women with minimal pain and low b-hCG levels. Success rates for expectant management are dependent on case selection and lower initial b-hCG levels are associated with higher success rates. Management options for cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies should be tailored based on individual factors and gestational age. Surgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options are available for different types of ectopic pregnancies.\n\nInic acid rescue regimen was successful with a 91% success rate. Various methods for treatment include transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration followed by methotrexate injection, endoscopic approaches, and hysteroscopic resection. Selective UAE with methotrexate has been used for reducing hemorrhage. Laparoscopic removal is recommended for cornual pregnancies. Definitive surgical treatment is preferred for ovarian pregnancies. Laparoscopic removal is an option for early abdominal pregnancy, while advanced cases require laparotomy. Management of heterotopic pregnancies should consider the prognosis of the intrauterine pregnancy. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy. Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy show no difference in fertility rates between management methods. Support and counseling should be offered to women undergoing treatment, including access to patient support groups and local bereavement counseling services. Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial for women undergoing treatment with methotrexate. It is recommended to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again after methotrexate treatment. Plans for follow-up should be clearly recorded, and written information on treatment options and support services should be provided.\n\nThe manufacturers of methotrexate recommend a 3-month window after use before conception due to the length of time that it may remain present in some organs and because of concern for subsequent pregnancy and fetal development. A small cohort study showed a higher than expected major malformation rate in women who conceived within 3 months of methotrexate exposure. However, conception within 3 months of methotrexate should not be considered an indication for termination. Providers of early pregnancy care should offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service with direct access for women referred by general practitioners and accident and emergency departments. Women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be managed in dedicated early pregnancy clinics with access to all appropriate management options. Laparoscopic salpingotomy is not part of the core training of gynaecologists, and appropriate support from senior staff trained in all surgical techniques should be available. Clinicians managing women with ectopic pregnancy must have received appropriate training in surgical, ultrasound, and medical management techniques. Virtual reality simulators can be used as a training tool for surgical procedures. The need for anti-D in women with nontubal ectopic pregnancies, methotrexate for the treatment of ovarian ectopic pregnancy, long-term fertility following management of nontubal ectopic pregnancies, and other research topics are recommended for future studies. Auditable topics include the proportion of women offered all relevant management options for ectopic pregnancy and the percentage of women provided with information containing support group details.

      "External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position. It has a success rate of approximately 50% and reduces the chance of a caesarean section. ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation. Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve the success rates of ECV. Regional analgesia may be considered for women unable to tolerate ECV without pain relief. The success of an ECV attempt can be predicted to some extent, but models should not be routinely used. ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of ECV.\n\nIn nulliparous women with a low chance of spontaneous version, ECV from 36 weeks of gestation seems pragmatic. ECV may be considered intrapartum with caution. ECV after one caesarean delivery appears to have no greater risk. ECV has a very low complication rate. ECV should be performed by trained practitioners. ECV can be a painful procedure. Methods to improve ECV uptake and success rates are needed.

      "Management of Breech Presentation\nGreen-top Guideline No. 20b\nMarch 2017\n\nExecutive summary of recommendations\nWomen with a breech presentation at term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) unless there is an absolute contraindication. They should be advised on the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery.\n\nWomen who have a breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of ECV should be counseled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section.\n\nWomen should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. The reduced risk is due to the avoidance of stillbirth after 39 weeks of gestation, the avoidance of intrapartum risks, and the risks of vaginal breech birth.\n\nWhen planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39+0 weeks of gestation, and approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth.\n\nPlanned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications but has not been shown to increase the risk of long-term morbidity.\n\nWomen should be informed that caesarean section increases the risk of complications in future pregnancies, including the risks of opting for vaginal birth after caesarean section, the increased risk of complications at repeat caesarean section, and the risk of an abnormally invasive placenta.\n\nWomen should be informed that caesarean section has been associated with a small increase in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies although this may not be causal.\n\nWomen with breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of ECV should be counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section. Women should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. When planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39 weeks of gestation, and approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth. Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care may allow planned vaginal breech birth to be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. Planned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications, but has not been shown to increase the risk of long-term morbidity. Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way that ensures a proper understanding of the absolute as well as relative risks of their different options. Women should also be informed about the maternal complications associated with planned caesarean section, including risks in future pregnancies. Caesarean section has been associated with a small increase in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies.\n\nThe safety of vaginal breech delivery depends on case selection, operator skill, and intrapartum management. Factors affecting safety include antenatal assessment for risk factors, such as hyperextended neck on ultrasound or high estimated fetal weight. Skilled birth attendants are essential, and intrapartum management should be based on the stage of labor and availability of expertise. Continuous fetal monitoring may improve outcomes. Delivery in a hospital with immediate access to a cesarean section is recommended. Adherence to a protocol for management reduces neonatal morbidity. The position for delivery during vaginal breech birth can be semirecumbent or all-fours. Assistance during the active second stage should be provided without traction if there is delay or poor fetal condition.\n\nAll maneuvers to avoid fetal trauma should be followed, such as grasping the fetus around the pelvic girdle and avoiding hyperextension of the neck. Selective episiotomy is recommended over routine episiotomy. Signs that delivery should be assisted include lack of tone or color, or delay, commonly due to extended arms or neck. Intervention to expedite breech birth is required if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or significant delays in delivery. The position of the fetus should be monitored and managed carefully during delivery. In cases of preterm breech birth, individualized management based on various factors is recommended. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. The decision about mode of delivery for preterm breech babies should be made by an experienced obstetrician following a thorough clinical evaluation. In cases of twin pregnancy with breech presentation, planned caesarean section for the first twin is recommended, while routine caesarean section for the second twin is not recommended. Organizational and governance arrangements should be in place to support a routine vaginal breech delivery service, including simulation equipment for training and guidelines for case selection and management.\n\nBreech birth supports adherence to a strict management protocol and the presence of skilled birth attendants. Recommendations for future research include evaluation of all-fours position for vaginal breech birth, the role of pelvimetry in planning vaginal breech delivery, and the effect of epidural analgesia on vaginal breech birth. Auditable topics include documentation of discussion regarding mode of delivery, vaginal delivery rates in women planning vaginal breech delivery, rate of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes following planned and actual breech birth, and percentage of staff who have undergone training in vaginal breech delivery.\n\nClinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. Each guideline is developed using a standardized methodology. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using a specific scheme, with different levels of evidence and recommendations. The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2020.",
      "Management of Inherited Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy\n\nHaemophilia\n- Clinicians should be aware of the different phenotypes and severities of haemophilia.\n- Known or potential female carriers may have low factor VIII/IX levels, increasing the risk of bleeding during procedures or delivery.\n- Baseline factor levels should be determined before pregnancy.\n- Genetic counselling should be provided to women at risk.\n- Options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered to carriers of severe haemophilia.\n- Antenatal care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team.\n- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.\n- A clear plan for intrapartum care should be in place.\n- The timing and mode of delivery should be decided jointly between the woman and the healthcare team.\n\nvon Willebrand disease (VWD)\n- VWD is classified based on the deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF).\n- Women with VWD have an increased risk of bleeding during pregnancy.\n- Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed and VWF levels checked.\n- Safe management requires a multidisciplinary approach.\n- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.\n\nWhere invasive procedures are required, if VWF activity or factor VIII levels are less than 0.50 iu/ml, women should receive haemostatic support in the form of DDAVP, where responsive, or VWF-containing concentrates. Treatment should be with DDAVP in preference to blood-derived factor concentrates where possible. Fluid intake should be restricted to 1 litre for 24 hours following DDAVP administration to prevent maternal hyponatraemia. Clinicians should be aware that patients with type 2B VWD may develop thrombocytopenia following DDAVP treatment. If VWF replacement therapy is required, a concentrate containing factor VIII and VWF, manufactured from a safe plasma source with adequate viral testing and inactivation procedures should be used. Target peak VWF activity levels should be 1.0 iu/ml and levels maintained above 0.5 iu/ml until haemostasis is secured. For most antenatal procedures, a single preoperative treatment is sufficient, but in some cases, a second dose may be required at 12 –24 hours, depending on the nature of the procedure and the measured levels. The timing of treatment should be as near to delivery as possible, and pre- and post-treatment levels of VWF activity and factor VIII levels should be measured and repeated after delivery, or if labour is prolonged. Tranexamic acid should be considered in combination with treatment for all those with VWF activity less than 0.5 iu/ml, or as sole therapy for those with levels above 0.5 iu/ml if clinically indicated. Platelet transfusions, as well as VWF factor replacement, may sometimes be required in type 2B VWD. The mode of delivery should be guided by obstetric indications. For fetuses at risk of having type 2 or 3 VWD, FBS, external cephalic version, fetal scalp monitoring, ventouse delivery and midcavity forceps should be avoided.\n\nFor patients with type 1 VWD, where VWF activity has been normalised by pregnancy or treatment, central neuraxial anaesthesia can be offered. For patients with type 2 disease, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless VWF activity is more than 0.5 iu/ml and the haemostatic defect has been corrected. For patients with type 2N VWD, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless factor VIII level is more than 0.5 iu/ml. Prior to delivery, all women should be given the opportunity to discuss analgesia with a senior obstetric anaesthetist. In patients where an epidural catheter has been placed, consideration should be given to the need for repeat treatment prior to catheter removal. Intramuscular injections and postnatal NSAIDs are only suitable in the short term when VWF activity and factor VIII are more than 0.5 iu/ml.\n\nIt is important to ensure that VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at more than 0.5 iu/ml for at least 3 days following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and at least 5 days following instrumental delivery or after caesarean section. Women with VWD should be considered for tranexamic acid for the postpartum period. If thromboprophylaxis is indicated, LMWH may be given to inpatients with adequate correction of VWF:RCo and factor VIII levels. Women with VWD should be made aware of the risk of delayed bleeding and be encouraged to report excessive bleeding. A plan for the diagnostic testing of the neonate following delivery, including cord blood sampling, should be included in the maternal pregnancy management plan. Cord blood samples for VWF activity should be taken for babies at risk of type 2 and 3 VWD. For neonates at risk of type 2 or 3 VWD, vitamin K should be given orally. Neonates with type 3 VWD should be considered for routine cranial imaging prior to discharge and for short-term prophylaxis with factor concentrate if there has been significant potential trauma at delivery.\n\nIII de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.\n\nFibrinogen disorders\nWhat is the nature and inheritance of aﬁbrinogenaemia, hypoﬁbrinogenaemia and dysﬁbrinogenaemia?\nClinicians should be aware that ﬁbrinogen disorders can be autosomal recessive (aﬁbrinogenaemia) or autosomal dominant (with quantitative and/or qualitative defects) and are associated with a variable clinical phenotype.\n\nWhat are the risks in pregnancy to mother and baby?\nClinicians should be aware that severe ﬁbrinogen de ﬁciency may be associated with bleeding, but quantitative and qualitative de ﬁciency can also be associated with thrombosis and pregnancy loss.\n\nWhat is the management of pregnancy and delivery?\nIf functional ﬁbrinogen less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. Higher doses of ﬁbrinogen concentrate are likely to be required to maintain ﬁbrinogen activity as pregnancy progresses. Consider additional ﬁbrinogen concentrate for established labour to ensure ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1.5 g/litre for at least 3 days. Tranexamic acid can be used for minor bleeding.\n\nThe bleeding phenotype in haemophilia can be predicted from factor levels, with severe cases requiring regular prophylaxis. Inhibitors to clotting factor treatments can cause significant morbidity. Female carriers are at increased risk of bleeding during procedures and at delivery. Neonates with haemophilia are at risk of bleeding complications. Factor levels in carriers are variable and may increase during pregnancy. Antenatal care should involve a multidisciplinary team and aim for factor levels of at least 0.5 iu/ml. Genetic counselling should be provided to carriers, and options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered. Intrapartum care should be planned in advance for carriers and affected babies. Consideration should be given to mode of delivery to minimize risks.\n\nPrecautions required for vaginal delivery include avoiding the use of external cephalic version in pregnancies where the fetus has a bleeding disorder. A joint decision on the timing and mode of delivery should be made between the woman and the multidisciplinary team. For affected male babies, especially those with severe haemophilia, a planned lower segment caesarean section should be discussed. Spontaneous labour is preferred for vaginal delivery, with measures in place to ensure expertise and necessary resources are available. The use of ventouse and midcavity forceps should be avoided for male babies at risk of haemophilia. Fetal blood sampling and fetal scalp electrode should be avoided in babies expected to have severe or moderate haemophilia. The optimal mode of delivery for a carrier may be affected by obstetric considerations and individual factors, including bleeding risk and reproductive expectations. Analgesia and anaesthesia should be managed safely, with factor VIII/IX levels considered for neuraxial anaesthetic techniques. Haemostatic management during labour includes using DDAVP or factor concentrate to raise clotting factor levels if necessary. Tranexamic acid may be considered for women with low normal levels or in conjunction with DDAVP. Treatment should be given as close to delivery as possible.\n\n4.12 Postpartum management:\n- Recommend/offer active management of the third stage of labour to minimize the risk of PPH.\n- Maintain factor VIII/IX levels above 0.5 iu/ml for 3 days post-vaginal delivery or 5 days post-instrumental delivery or caesarean section.\n- Continue tranexamic acid postpartum until lochia is minimal.\n- Avoid pharmacological thromboprophylaxis when factor level is 0.6 iu/ml or less, but consider in women with thrombotic risk factors.\n- Haemophilia center should maintain contact with the woman post-discharge to report any increase in postpartum blood loss.\n- Carriers of hemophilia should be identified as at increased risk of PPH and offered uterotonics for the third stage of labour.\n- Maintain haemostatic levels in the initial postpartum period.\n- Consider tranexamic acid use in PPH, with no long-term adverse outcomes for breastfeeding children.\n- Assess risk of venous thromboembolism vs. PPH in normalizing factor levels.\n- Carriers of hemophilia may have increased duration of lochia and should be monitored for any increase in blood loss.\n\n4.13 Neonatal management:\n- Plan for diagnostic testing of the neonate, including cord blood sampling.\n- Interpret coagulation results in neonates against age-adjusted reference ranges.\n- Recommend cord blood sampling and testing for male babies born to carrier mothers.\n- Inform parents of neonates diagnosed with hemophilia and arrange for follow-up at a hemophilia center.\n- Administer vitamin K to neonates with low factor levels.\n- Consider cranial ultrasound prior to discharge in neonates with severe or moderate hemophilia.\n- Consider cranial MRI in neonates with symptoms of ICH.\n- Provide information on symptoms and signs of ICH to parents.\n- Consider short-term prophylaxis in severe and moderate hemophilia neonates.\n- Manage clinical bleeding events in neonates with hemophilia according to treatment guidelines.\n\nDuring pregnancy and childbirth, women with VWD have a significantly increased risk of bleeding, with antepartum hemorrhage increased ten-fold and primary PPH occurring in 15-30% of women. Perineal hematoma is more common in women with VWD, but there is no increased risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, or fetal complications. Neonatal VWF levels are increased at birth, providing some protection against bleeding. Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed, and VWF levels should be monitored throughout pregnancy. DDAVP is safe for use in pregnancy and delivery, but caution should be exercised in certain subtypes of VWD. VWF concentrates may be necessary in cases where DDAVP is contraindicated. Intrapartum management should focus on maintaining VWF activity levels and may involve tranexamic acid or platelet transfusions. Analgesia and anesthesia should be carefully managed based on the type of VWD and VWF activity levels. Central neuraxial anesthesia is generally safe in women with normal VWF activity levels. Intramuscular injections and NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with low VWF levels.\n\nPostpartum management should ensure VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at specific levels following delivery. Women with VWD may consider tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis may be necessary in some cases. Follow-up is crucial to monitor bleeding risk. Neonates at risk of VWD should undergo diagnostic testing. Factor XI deficiency is an autosomal disorder with variable inheritance patterns. Factor XI levels do not typically increase during pregnancy. Factor XI-deficient women are at increased risk of PPH. Treatment options include tranexamic acid, factor XI concentrate, and FFP. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for factor XI deficiency. Factor XI inhibitors may occur after treatment. Tranexamic acid alone may be sufficient for managing factor XI deficiency. FFP with factor XI activity should be used if needed.\n\nFactor XI or tranexamic acid is not usually required antenatally unless an invasive procedure is undertaken or if there is bleeding following miscarriage or surgical procedure. Delivery plans need to be individualized. Prophylactic factor XI replacement should be considered if homozygous/compound heterozygous, previous history of PPH or general bleeding history. Otherwise, management can be expectant, with tranexamic acid alone and factor replacement reserved for excess bleeding. Due to the unpredictable nature of bleeding and the likely unchanged factor XI level during pregnancy, treatment plans around labor and delivery need to be individualized. Central neuraxial anesthesia should not be given to women with low factor XI levels with a known bleeding phenotype, where the phenotype is not clear or when there is a severe reduction in level. Clinicians should be aware that rare bleeding disorders include inherited deficiencies of fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, X, XI and XIII, combined factor V and factor VIII deficiencies, and congenital deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors. Genetic counseling should be provided, with the understanding that most rare inherited bleeding disorders are autosomal recessive in inheritance and heterozygote carriers are usually asymptomatic. Clinicians should appreciate that coagulation factor levels can change during pregnancy. Treatment plans may need to be modified according to the nature of individual bleeds or procedures, and to the background bleeding phenotype of each case. Central neuraxial anesthesia, postpartum pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and NSAIDs should usually be avoided in women with severe deficiencies as it may be difficult to guarantee consistent normalization of hemostasis even after treatment. If factor II activity is less than 0.2 iu/ml and there is significant bleeding, established labor or prior to caesarean section, give prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg to achieve factor II activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. For significant bleeding or delivery in women with factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml, 15–25 ml/kg FFP should be considered once in established labor or before caesarean section. For factor VII activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester with prior history of bleeding, consider recombinant factor VIIa 15 –30 micrograms/kg every 4 –6 hours for at least 3 or 5 days following caesarean section. For delivery in women with factor X activity less than 0.3 iu/ml in the third trimester who have a history of bleeding and all those who require caesarean section, use prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg (or factor X concentrate if available) to achieve factor X activity more.\n\nConsider further prothrombin complex concentrate 10 –20 iu/kg once daily to maintain factor X activity more than 0.3 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Antenatal prophylaxis maybe considered in women with a history of recurrent bleeding or adverse pregnancy outcome using prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –30 iu/kg two or three times a week to maintain trough factor X more than 0.01 iu/ml.\n\nDuring pregnancy, increased intensity prophylaxis is required using factor XIII plasma concentrate or recombinant factor XIII (if A-subunit de ﬁciency). Dosing frequency should be increased from every 28 days to every 14 –21 days to maintain factor XIII more than 0.2 iu/ml. For delivery, consider additional factor XIII concentrate 10 –40 iu/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section, depending on the interval since last prophylaxis.\n\nFor delivery in women with combined factor V+VIII de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.\n\nSevere ﬁbrinogen deﬁciency (aﬁbrinogenaemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder and is associated with mild-to-severe bleeding. If functional ﬁbrinogen is less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. \n\nThe spectrum of bleeding in patients with platelet function disorders varies and may ﬁrst present in pregnancy. Women known to have a platelet dysfunction disorder should receive prepregnancy counselling from a multidisciplinary specialist team with expertise in caring for patients with platelet function disorders.\n\nBernard Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is caused by genetic abnormality of an important platelet adhesion receptor (GP Ib-IX-V receptor) and is often associated with a severe bleeding phenotype. BSS is associated with signiﬁcant risk of primary and secondary PPH, and wound haematoma. Management of delivery, therefore, requires careful planning with the multidisciplinary team.\n\n- Platelet transfusions and/or recombinant factor VIIa should be given prophylactically at delivery for patients with a history of bleeding.\n- Tranexamic acid should be given from the onset of established labour and continued through the postpartum period until lochia is minimal.\n- Central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided.\n- Antenatal bleeding in women with GT is mild, but postpartum bleeding can be severe and occur up to 20 days after delivery.\n- Prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to delivery has only shown partial success in reducing PPH.\n- Recombinant factor VIIa is licensed for use in patients with GT who have antibodies to GP IIb/IIIa and/or HLA, and with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions.\n- DDAVP has not been shown to be effective in GT.\n- Maternal alloimmunisation to fetal platelet antigens may cause fetal thrombocytopenia and risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n- Platelet transfusions can lead to alloimmunisation with a risk of fetal maternal alloimmunisation.\n- Women with inherited bleeding disorders who request termination of pregnancy require multidisciplinary management in a unit with 24-hour access to blood products and specialist hematological advice.\n\nReferral hospital in Rafsanjan, Iran. The optimal mode of delivery for the hemophilia carrier expecting an affected infant is clinically significant. Maternal obesity and maternal health are important factors to consider. The impact of multiple cesarean deliveries on maternal morbidity is noteworthy. Risks of induction of labor in uncomplicated term pregnancies should be evaluated. The risks and benefits of epidural analgesia in patients with bleeding disorders should be carefully considered. Safety of intramuscular injection of hepatitis B vaccine in hemophiliacs is crucial. Prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage in women with bleeding disorders is essential. Identification and management of women with inherited bleeding disorders is important. Development of the human coagulation system in premature infants is a significant consideration. Perinatal management of newborns with hemophilia is a critical aspect of care. The impact, diagnosis, and treatment of bleeding disorders are essential components of care.\n\nClinical guidelines for von Willebrand disease diagnosis and management, including pregnancy and delivery, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor changes, and bleeding risks. Treatment options, genetic factors, and bleeding assessment tools are also discussed.

The limitations of fetal sexing by cffDNA analysis must be explained to patients prior to testing. Fetal sex should be confirmed by US at 20 weeks of gestation. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in at-risk fetuses. CVS may be offered between 11 and 13+6 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis may be offered after 15 weeks of gestation for PND when CVS is not available or at > 34 weeks of gestation to inform clinical management plans for delivery of an at-risk fetus. An independent maternal blood sample should be provided to the laboratory for confirmatory mutation analysis alongside the PND sample. Amniocentesis in late pregnancy is recommended to inform clinical management of childbirth. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in order to inform the delivery of at-risk fetuses. PGD, an IVF-based process, is an option for couples at risk of transmitting a heritable disorder to their offspring. Noninvasive PND for disease-specific diagnosis is not yet available in general clinical practice. Risk stratification of bleeding risk for the fetus/neonate is categorized into high, medium, mild, and unlikely to be at risk levels based on specific diagnoses. Neonatal bleeding risks and management are outlined based on factor deficiencies and platelet activity in normal term neonates.",
      "Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease\nAll pregnant women should be provided with an appropriate information leaflet. Universal bacteriological screening is not recommended. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical risk factors for GBS disease. IAP should be offered to women with a previous baby affected by GBS disease. Antenatal treatment for GBS carriage is not recommended. Method of induction should not vary based on GBS carrier status. Membrane sweeping is not contraindicated in GBS carriers. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for planned caesarean sections without labor. Immediate IAP should be offered to known GBS carriers at term. Pyrexial women in labor should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. IAP is recommended for confirmed preterm labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at labor onset is not recommended. Birth in a pool is not contraindicated for known GBS carriers. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. Breastfeeding should be encouraged regardless of GBS status. Parents should seek medical advice if the baby shows abnormal behavior. Term babies of mothers who received IAP do not require special observation. Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated promptly. Evaluation of babies for infection indicators should be done at birth.\n\nThere is no clear evidence to show that routine testing for GBS in pregnancy would do more good than harm. Screening is not recommended for all pregnant women due to inaccuracies in testing and potential risks associated with unnecessary treatment. Clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease, such as previous GBS infection, preterm birth, and prolonged rupture of membranes. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy. In cases where GBS is detected incidentally or following intentional testing, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered. Women with known GBS carriage should receive immediate antibiotic prophylaxis and induction of labor to reduce the risk of EOGBS disease. In cases of intrapartum pyrexia, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered to cover GBS.\n\nIAP is recommended for women in confirmed preterm labor. IAP is not recommended for women not in labor and having a preterm planned caesarean section with intact membranes. The risk of EOGBS disease in infants of women who deliver preterm is higher, justifying the use of IAP in all cases of preterm labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at the onset of labor is not recommended. Water birth is not contraindicated for GBS-positive women if appropriate IAP is offered. Bacteriological testing for GBS carriage is not recommended for women with preterm rupture of membranes. Swabs for GBS carrier status should be transported to the laboratory in non-nutrient transport medium and processed promptly. Enriched culture medium tests are recommended for testing GBS carriage. Benzylpenicillin is recommended for IAP. Cephalosporin should be used in women with known or suspected penicillin allergy. Women with known GBS colonization who decline IAP should have their baby closely monitored after birth. Adverse effects of IAP should be considered. Vaginal cleansing in labor does not reduce the risk of neonatal GBS disease. Parents and carers should seek urgent medical advice if a newborn shows abnormal behavior or symptoms of infection. Term babies whose mothers received adequate IAP do not require special observation at birth. Well babies at risk of EOGBS disease whose mothers did not receive adequate IAP should be monitored closely for signs of infection. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for asymptomatic term infants without risk factors.\n\nThe incidence of EOGBS disease in asymptomatic term infants without known antenatal risk factors in the UK is estimated at 0.2 cases/1000 births. Routine postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated with penicillin and gentamicin within an hour of the decision to treat.

      "Care of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy\nGreen-top Guideline No. 72\nNovember 2018\n\nPrepregnancy care\n- Primary care services should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to optimise their weight before pregnancy.\n- Women of childbearing age with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should receive information and advice about the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and be supported to lose weight before conception and between pregnancies.\n- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily.\n- Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, but routine vitamin D supplementation remains uncertain.\n\nProvision of antenatal care\n- Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics.\n- Maternity units should have a documented environmental risk assessment regarding the availability of facilities to care for pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater.\n- Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a moving and handling risk assessment carried out in the third trimester of pregnancy.\n- All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured at the antenatal booking visit.\n- There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain in obese women.\n\nInformation giving during pregnancy\n- Pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy.\n- Dietetic advice should be provided early in pregnancy.\n- Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy.\n\nRisk assessment during pregnancy in women with obesity\n- Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment.\n- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater have a pre-existing risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.\n- Women should be screened for mental health problems in pregnancy.\n\nSpecial considerations for screening, diagnosis and management of maternal disease in women with obesity\n- All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes.\n- An appropriate size of cuff should be used for blood pressure measurements in women with obesity.\n- Women with more than one moderate risk factor may benefit from taking 150 mg aspirin daily.\n- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater have a pre-existing risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.\n\nWomen with class 1 obesity or greater having a caesarean section should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery. Women undergoing caesarean section with more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of infection and wound separation. There is a lack of evidence to recommend routine use of negative pressure dressing therapy, barrier retractors, and subcutaneous drains in obese women undergoing caesarean sections. Maternal obesity should be considered when deciding on postnatal contraception. Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight management services. A waiting period of 12-18 months after bariatric surgery is recommended before attempting pregnancy. Women with previous bariatric surgery should have consultant-led antenatal care and nutritional surveillance during pregnancy. Women with obesity should receive folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy. Obese women are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and may benefit from supplementation.\n\niometry scan and were analysed\nfor the primary endpoint. The neonatal whole-body bone mineral content of infants born to mothersassigned to cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day did not signiﬁcantly differ from that of infants born to mothersassigned to placebo. However, supplementation of women with cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day during pregnancy did demonstrate that this dosage was sufﬁcient to ensure that most pregnant women were vitamin D replete and it was safe.\nProvision of antenatal care\nCare of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear local policies and guidelines for care available. Maternity services must develop and implement robust processes to manage the risks associated with obesity, and consistently provide sensitive, comprehensive, and appropriate multidisciplinary care. Specific recommendations include a requirement for all women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater to have multidisciplinary care, a documented antenatal consultation about the intrapartum risks and to be advised to deliver in a consultant-led unit for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater. Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater.\nMeasuring weight, height and BMI\nAll pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing women during the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnel required during labour and birth.\nInformation giving during pregnancy\nAll pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and how they may be minimised. Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in the pregnancy. Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment. Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a documented risk assessment in the third trimester of pregnancy by an appropriately qualified professional to consider.\n\nTissue viability issues should involve the use of a validated scale to support clinical judgment. A BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 and immobility are risk factors for developing pressure sores. A documented assessment of pressure ulcer risk using a validated scale is recommended, with reassessment if there is a change in clinical status. Plans for skin assessment, skin care, repositioning frequency, and pressure redistributing devices should be put in place for those at risk. Pregnant women with a booking BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is a significant risk factor for gestational diabetes and hypertensive complications of pregnancy. Women with obesity should be offered screening and diagnostic tests for mental health problems. Pregnant women with obesity have an increased risk of structural anomalies and should be offered screening and diagnostic tests despite limitations in visualizing fetal structures.\n\n11. Fetal surveillance\n- Serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) recommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation.\n- Women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound.\n- Ultrasound can be considered as an alternative method for assessing fetal presentation.\n- Various methods of estimating fetal growth have been assessed, but all are technically more difficult in women with obesity.\n- Intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women should follow NICE recommendations.\n- Obese pregnant women are at increased risk of stillbirth and prolonged pregnancy.\n\n12. Planning labour and birth\n- Planning for labour and birth requires ongoing review of antenatal progress and potential complications.\n- Women with maternal obesity should have an informed discussion with their obstetrician and anaesthetist about a birth plan.\n- Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.\n- Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birth without increasing adverse outcomes.\n- The decision for a woman with maternal obesity to have a planned caesarean section should involve a multidisciplinary approach.\n- Induction of labour may be considered when macrosomia is suspected.\n- Parents should have a discussion about the options of induction of labour and expectant management when macrosomia is suspected.\n\nWomen with obesity and a previous caesarean section should have an individualized decision for VBAC following informed discussion and consideration of all relevant clinical factors. Obesity is a risk factor for unsuccessful VBAC, with Class III obesity associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labor and neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is also associated with an increased risk of serious maternal morbidity. Continuous midwifery care is recommended for obese women in established labor, with extra vigilance required for care of pressure areas and fetal heart rate monitoring. Intrapartum care for obese women should follow NICE guidelines, with considerations for venous access, active management of the third stage of labor, and specific surgical techniques for performing cesarean section. Postoperative wound care for obese women should include prophylactic antibiotics and suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of wound infection. Breastfeeding initiation and maintenance may be more challenging for obese women and dedicated support is needed. Postnatal contraception advice should be tailored for women with obesity, and long-term health risks for both mother and child should be discussed and addressed.\n\nSupport in the community for minimal interpregnancy weight gain includes postpartum weight loss support and referral to weight management services. Women with previous bariatric surgery should wait 12-18 months before attempting pregnancy to stabilize weight and address nutritional deficiencies. Studies show lower risks of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and macrosomia in women who have had bariatric surgery, but higher risks of small-for-gestational-age newborns. Women with previous bariatric surgery should receive consultant-led antenatal care, nutritional surveillance, and screening for deficiencies during pregnancy. They should also be referred to a dietician for specialized nutritional needs. Pregnancy can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies in women with malabsorptive procedures, requiring vitamin and mineral supplementation.

Complications of cesarean delivery in the massively obese parturient.\n\nObesity is an independent risk factor for infectious morbidity in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Extreme obesity is associated with postcesarean maternal complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis may help prevent infection after cesarean section. Superficial wound disruption after cesarean delivery may be affected by the depth and closure of subcutaneous tissue. Wound drainage and the use of a plastic sheath wound retractor may reduce surgical site infections and wound disruptions in obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Maternal weight status, diet, and supplement use can impact breastfeeding and complementary feeding. Delayed lactogenesis II and barriers to breastfeeding are concerns for obese women. Interventions for promoting breastfeeding and support for healthy breastfeeding mothers are important. Postpartum weight retention can be reduced through a correspondence intervention. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can develop after gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is associated with various pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, slower labor progress, caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, wound infection, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Stillbirth and neonatal death are also risks associated with maternal obesity.\n\n8) \n33.0% \nMedian prevalence in obese women.",

      "Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease\n\nHow do molar pregnancies present to the clinician?\nClinicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancy. The most common presentation is irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. Less common presentations include hyperemesis, excessive uterine enlargement, hyperthyroidism, early-onset pre-eclampsia, and abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts. Very rarely, women can present with haemoptysis or seizures due to metastatic disease affecting the lungs or brain.\n\nHow are molar pregnancies diagnosed?\nThe definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination.\n\nRemoval of a molar pregnancy\nWhat is the best method for removal of a molar pregnancy?\nSuction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Ultrasound guidance during removal and curettage may be of use to minimize the chance of perforation and to ensure that as much tissue as possible is removed. Suction curettage is also the method of choice for removal of partial molar pregnancies except when the size of fetal parts deters the use of suction curettage and then medical removal can be used. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended following removal of a molar pregnancy.\n\nIs it safe to prepare the cervix prior to surgical removal?\nPreparation of the cervix immediately prior to uterine removal is safe.\n\nCan oxytocic infusions be used during surgical removal?\nExcessive vaginal bleeding can be associated with surgical management of molar pregnancy, and the involvement of an experienced clinician is advised. The use of oxytocic infusion prior to completion of the removal is not recommended. If the woman is experiencing significant hemorrhage prior to or during removal, surgical removal should be expedited, and the need for oxytocin infusion weighed up against the risk of tissue embolization.\n\nIn what circumstances should a repeat surgical removal be indicated and what is the timing?\nThere is almost always a role for urgent surgical management for the woman who is experiencing heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise, particularly in the presence of retained pregnancy tissue on ultrasound. Outside the context of acute compromise, there should be consultation with the relevant GTD referral center before performing surgical management for the second time in the same pregnancy. \n\nHistological examination of pregnancy tissue in the diagnosis of GTD\nShould pregnancy tissue from all miscarriages be examined histologically?\nThe histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia if no fetal parts are identified at any stage of the pregnancy. Women who receive care for a miscarriage should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after miscarriage. \n\nShould pregnancy tissue be sent for examination after abortion?\nThere is no need to routinely send pregnancy tissue for histological examination following therapeutic abortion, provided that fetal parts have been identified at the time of surgical abortion or on prior ultrasound examination. Women who undergo medical abortion should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\n\nHow should women with an elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin after a possible pregnancy event be managed?\nReferral to a GTD center should be considered for all women with persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) either after an ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, or after two consecutive treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\n\nWhich women should be investigated for GTN after a non-molar pregnancy?\nAny woman who develops persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event is at risk of having GTN. A urine hCG test should be performed in all cases of persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding lasting more than 8 weeks after a pregnancy event. Symptoms from metastatic disease, such as dyspnea and hemoptysis, or new onset of seizures or paralysis, can occur very rarely.\n\nBiopsy of secondary deposits in the vagina can cause major hemorrhage and is not recommended.\n\nHow should suspected ectopic molar pregnancy in women be managed?\nCases of women with ectopic pregnancy suspected to be molar in nature should be managed as any other case of ectopic pregnancy. If there is a local tissue diagnosis of ectopic molar pregnancy, the tissue should be sent to a center with appropriate expertise for pathological review.\n\nHow is twin pregnancy of a viable fetus and presumptive coexistent molar pregnancy managed?\nWomen diagnosed with a combined molar pregnancy and viable twin, or where there is diagnostic doubt, should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center. In the situation of a twin pregnancy where there is one viable fetus and the other pregnancy is molar, the woman should be counseled about the potential increased risk of perinatal morbidity and the outcome for GTN. Prenatal invasive testing for\n\nThe incidence of GTD is associated with age at conception, being higher in the extremes of age. GTN may develop after a molar pregnancy, a non-molar pregnancy, or a live birth. Clinicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancy, which include irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. The definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination. Suction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Preparation of the cervix prior to uterine removal is safe. Repeat surgical removal may be indicated in cases of heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise. The histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.\n\n- Pregnancy tissue does not need to be routinely sent for histological examination after therapeutic abortion if fetal parts have been identified.\n- Women who undergo medical abortion should do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\n- Referral to a GTD center should be considered for women with persistently elevated hCG after excluding ectopic pregnancy or after two treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\n- Persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event should prompt investigation for GTN.\n- Women with suspected ectopic molar pregnancy should be managed like any other case of ectopic pregnancy.\n- Women with combined molar pregnancy and viable twin should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center.\n- Women with PSTT or ETT should be registered and cared for within a GTD center.\n- Women with atypical PSN should have their histology reviewed centrally for further management.\n- All women diagnosed with GTD should be registered at GTD centers for follow-up.\n- Follow-up for GTD should be based on hCG levels and may include chemotherapy.\n- Women with GTN may be treated with single-agent or multi-agent chemotherapy based on the FIGO scoring system.\n- Surgery may be considered for PSTT and ETT as they are less sensitive to chemotherapy.\n- The recommended interval between a complete or partial molar pregnancy and trying for another pregnancy should be followed.\n\nWomen following a successful pregnancy after a previous molar pregnancy are advised not to conceive until their follow-up is complete. Chemotherapy recipients are advised to wait 1 year before conceiving. Women who have a pregnancy after a molar pregnancy that did not require treatment for GTN do not need to send a post-pregnancy hCG sample. The risk of another molar pregnancy is low, and women are not at increased risk of maternal complications. However, women exposed to a molar pregnancy prior to the index birth have an increased risk of preterm birth, large-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. The long-term outcome for women treated for GTN is generally excellent, with a high cure rate and successful pregnancies achieved in about 80% of cases. Women should be cautious about premature menopause after treatment with combination agent chemotherapy. It is important to avoid pregnancy until hCG levels return to normal, and contraception guidance can be found through the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health. Exogenous estrogens and fertility drugs may be used after hCG levels normalize. Hormone replacement therapy is safe to use after GTD. Support is available for women and families affected by GTD. Treatment centres are recommended for GTD care. Further research is needed on predicting molar pregnancy outcomes, refining chemotherapy resistance predictions, and managing multi-relapsed disease.

Trainees should achieve expertise in spontaneous vaginal birth before training in assisted birth. Training in vacuum and forceps birth is essential, with competency demonstrated before unsupervised births. Complex assisted births should be performed by experienced operators or under supervision. Training is crucial for patient safety. The goal of assisted birth is to expedite birth with minimal morbidity. Familiarize with theoretical knowledge and skills, supplemented by simulation training. Competence should be assessed using OSATS. High-risk assisted births should be conducted in settings with immediate access to cesarean birth. Choose instruments based on clinical circumstances and skill level. Vacuum and forceps have different benefits and risks. Birth by vacuum and forceps can lead to maternal and neonatal complications. Maternal outcomes include episiotomy, tears, OASI, postpartum hemorrhage, and incontinence. Neonatal complications include intracranial and subgaleal hemorrhage.\n\nPerinatal outcomes:\n- Cephalhaematoma, facial or scalp lacerations, retinal haemorrhage, jaundice, subgaleal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, cervical spine injury, skull fracture, facial nerve palsy, and fetal death are all potential risks associated with vacuum and forceps deliveries.\n- The ‘Od on’ device is not recommended for routine use until fully evaluated.\n- Alternative techniques for rotational assisted vaginal birth should be considered, with Kielland’s forceps showing lower failure rates and neonatal trauma compared to rotational vacuum birth.\n- Enhanced skills in assisted vaginal birth may reduce the need for second stage caesarean births.\n- Vacuum-assisted birth should be discontinued if there is no evidence of progressive descent or if there are repeated ‘pop-offs’ of the instrument.\n- Sequential use of instruments is associated with increased neonatal morbidity and should be approached with caution.\n- Failed forceps birth is associated with an increased risk of neonatal traumatic injury.\n- Episiotomy should be discussed with the woman as part of the preparation for assisted vaginal birth.\n\nThe evidence supports the use of mediolateral episiotomy at assisted vaginal birth to prevent OASI, especially for nulliparous women and birth via forceps. When performing a mediolateral episiotomy, the cut should be at a 60-degree angle initiated when the head is distending the perineum. Routine episiotomy may not be better than a restrictive policy at assisted vaginal birth. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given after assisted vaginal birth to reduce maternal infection. Good hygiene and aseptic techniques are recommended. Reassess women after birth for venous thromboembolism risk and consider thromboprophylaxis. Offer NSAIDs and paracetamol for pain relief after birth. Educate women about the risk of urinary retention and monitor voiding. Offer physiotherapy-directed strategies to reduce the risk of urinary incontinence. Shared decision making and good communication can reduce psychological morbidity after birth. Inform women of the high probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent labors following assisted vaginal birth. Individualize care for women with perineal tears or ongoing pelvic floor morbidity.\n\nWomen who have required more complex assisted vaginal births in theatre have an 80% chance of achieving a spontaneous vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Careful review of future plans is recommended for women who have experienced a third- or fourth-degree tear. Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information for counselling in subsequent pregnancies and adverse outcomes should trigger an incident report. Obstetricians have a duty to be honest with patients when things go wrong and should participate in adverse event reporting and reviews. Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework for women, families, and staff during serious adverse events.\n\n41.

      "Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests offered to pregnant women for various reasons. The additional risk of miscarriage following these tests is below 0.5%. Amniocentesis should not be performed before 15 weeks of gestation, while CVS should not be performed before 10 weeks. Women with multiple pregnancies have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage. Screening for blood-borne viruses should be reviewed before an invasive test. Care for women undergoing these procedures should be organized according to guidance. It is important to provide information on aftercare and options for continuing or terminating the pregnancy based on test results. Additional risks associated with these tests include infection, failed procedures, and fetal injury. Training and maintaining good practice for these procedures are essential for reducing risks.\n\nMaintain competency with Maternal Fetal Medicine subspecialty training, fetal medicine Advanced Skills TrainingModules or equivalent international qualification. Seek support from a more experienced operator if anticipated/encountered difficulties. Review practice where an operator’s annual loss rate of normal babies exceeds 3% for either amniocentesis or CVS. Severe maternal sepsis is a very rare complication. Infection may arise from organisms present on the skin, ultrasound probe, gel, or via needle puncture of the bowel. Perform amniocentesis after 15+0 weeks’ gestation. CVS should not be performed before 10+0 weeks’ gestation. CVS should be performed from 11+0 weeks’ gestation to reduce the risk of technical challenges. Women considering amniocentesis or CVS in multiple pregnancies should receive detailed counseling and pregnancy mapping. Third-trimester amniocentesis may be offered for newly identified fetal structural anomalies, suspected fetal infection, and fetal growth restriction. Review screening results for bloodborne viruses when considering invasive testing. Optimize antiretroviral treatment to aim for an undetectable viral load prior to amniocentesis or CVS. The risk of mother to child transmission of HIV is very low for women on highly active antiretroviral therapy with undetectable viral loads. The risk of mother to child transmission of Hepatitis B is low with a viral load less than 6.99 log copies/ml but increases with higher viral loads. There is no evidence of the risk of mother to child transmission of Hepatitis C based on limited data available.\n\nAmniocentesis has shown a significant increase in mother-to-child transmission of HBV when HBV DNA is over 500 copies/ml. There is currently no evidence of risk of mother-to-child transmission following amniocentesis for Hepatitis C.\n\nAmniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling in HIV-infected pregnant women: a multicentre case series.

      "Key recommendations:\n- Consider ICP in pregnant women with itching and raised bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.\n- Additional investigations not recommended unless itch is severe or associated with comorbidities.\n- Discuss severe or atypical cases with a hepatologist.\n- Confirm ICP postnatally with resolution of symptoms and normal liver function tests.\n- Risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acid concentrations: advise on planned birth timing accordingly.\n- Risk of stillbirth higher in twin pregnancies with ICP.\n- Ultrasound and CTG do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.\n- Risk factors and comorbidities may increase stillbirth risk in ICP.\n- No treatments improve pregnancy outcomes or reduce bile acid concentrations.\n- Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.\n\nAdditional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended in every woman with suspected ICP, but could be considered on an individual basis. Routine use of other investigations, including for hepatitis C, is no longer recommended. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP. Postnatal resolution of ICP should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after birth. The risk of stillbirth in ICP increases when serum bile acid concentrations are 100 micromol/L or more. Women with ICP have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They should have regular monitoring for these conditions. Women with ICP also have a small increased chance of developing hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases later in life. Women with moderate or severe ICP have a higher chance of preterm birth, meconium stained amniotic fluid, and their baby requiring neonatal care.\n\nActive management with planned early birth is recommended for women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Women with ICP should be monitored closely, with regular liver function tests and bile acid measurements. Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised. Drug treatments for ICP, such as topical emollients and antihistamines, can help alleviate symptoms but do not improve pregnancy outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes. Other treatments for ICP should only be considered in research studies or under specialist care. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies.\n\nDietary fat absorption is impaired in women with ICP, but routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms such as steatorrhoea are present. Women with ICP should consider planned birth based on peak bile acid concentration and other risk factors. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered to women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more. Standard analgesia and anaesthesia options should be offered for women with uncomplicated ICP during birth. Follow-up should be arranged at least 4 weeks postpartum for women with uncomplicated ICP to confirm resolution. ICP does not impact the choice of contraception or hormone replacement therapy. Women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and should have baseline liver function tests and bile acid concentrations checked at booking blood investigations.\n\nIn subsequent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests and bile acid concentrations should be performed to establish normal levels. Repeat testing should only be done if clinically indicated. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:\n- Identify prognostic tools for adverse perinatal outcomes in women with ICP\n- Determine if women with ICP should be tested for gestational diabetes\n- Investigate effective treatments for itching and prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes\n\nAUDITABLE TOPICS:\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered appropriate timing of birth\n- Proportion of women with uncomplicated raised bile acid concentrations receiving additional investigations\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered ursodeoxycholic acid\n- Proportion of women with severe ICP offered continuous fetal monitoring during labor\n\nUSEFUL LINKS AND SUPPORT GROUPS:\n- Information for healthcare professionals on maternal medication use in pregnancy\n- Information for women and families from ICP Support and RCOG\n- Information for women and families on medication use in pregnancy\n\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS:\nJG, CLK, and LC have declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nFUNDING INFORMATION:\nAll individuals involved in developing the Green-top Guidelines are unpaid volunteers except for RCOG staff.

      "Cervical Cerclage\nGreen-top Guideline No. 75\nJune 2022\n1. Key recommendations\n- Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage.\n- Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may be offered cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less at gestations less than 24 weeks.\n- For women with a singleton pregnancy and no other risk factors for preterm birth, insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women who have a short cervix incidentally identified on a late second trimester ultrasound scan.\n- In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be considered.\n- In women with a singleton pregnancy, insertion of an emergency cerclage may delay birth and reduce the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation.\n- The choice of transvaginal cerclage technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon, but the cerclage should be placed as high as possible.\n2. Background and scope\nCerclage remains a standard option for prophylactic intervention in women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss.\n3. Identification and assessment of evidence\nThis guideline was developed using standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.\n4. Definitions\n- History-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth.\n- Ultrasound-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in cases of cervical length shortening seen on transvaginal ultrasound.\n- Emergency cerclage: Insertion of cerclage in the case of premature cervical dilatation with exposed fetal membranes.\n- Transvaginal cerclage: A purse-string suture at the cervical isthmus junction.\n- Transabdominal cerclage: A suture placed via laparotomy or laparoscopy at the cervicoisthmic junction.\n- Occlusion cerclage: Occlusion of the external os by placement of a continuous non-absorbable suture.\n5. History-indicated cerclage\n- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered history-indicated cerclage.\n- History-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with less than three previous preterm births without additional risk factors.\n6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage\n- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.\n\nAn ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical shortening in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks gestation. Cerclage is not recommended for funnelling of the cervix without cervical shortening. Serial sonographic surveillance may help identify women who may benefit from cerclage. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies or in women with Mullerian anomalies or previous cervical surgery. Further research is needed in these areas.\n\nCerclage is effective in women with a raised BMI. In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be discussed and considered. Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy. Decisions on care and treatment in cases of delayed miscarriage or fetal death in women with an abdominal cerclage can be difficult and should be aided by a senior obstetrician. The decision to place an emergency suture should be individualized, taking the parents' views carefully into account. The contraindications to cerclage insertion are active preterm labor, clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, continuing vaginal bleeding, PPROM, evidence of fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Before cerclage insertion, women should be informed of potential complications.\n\nWomen should be informed of potential complications associated with cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labour, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage. Complications such as bladder damage, cervical trauma, membrane rupture, and bleeding are rare. Cerclage insertion is associated with an increased risk of maternal pyrexia but not chorioamnionitis, PPROM, or induction of labour. Women should receive appropriate information before cerclage insertion. Investigations before insertion should include a first-trimester ultrasound and screening for aneuploidy. Amniocentesis before rescue or ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not routinely recommended. Perioperative tocolysis is not recommended, and the choice of anaesthesia should be made on a case-by-case basis. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of cerclage placement should be at the discretion of the operating team. Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure. The choice of suture material and technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon. Additional cervical occlusion suture is not routinely recommended.\n\nPregnancy and cervical length less than 25mm between 16 and 23 weeks were randomized to McDonald cerclage or no cerclage. Outcomes of women who underwent cerclage were analyzed by the type of suture material comparing polyester braided thread to mersilene tape. Rates of preterm birth less than 35 weeks were similar between polyester braided thread and mersilene tape. An RCT is currently ongoing assessing the type of suture material. Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efficacy of single versus double cerclage. Limited data exist on the role of cervical occlusion at the time of cerclage. Adjuvant management such as bed rest, sexual intercourse, serial sonographic surveillance of cervical length, fetal fibronectin testing, and progesterone supplementation following cerclage should be individualized based on clinical circumstances. There is no evidence to recommend abstinence from sexual intercourse following cerclage insertion. Routine fetal fibronectin testing post-cerclage is not recommended. Routine use of progesterone supplementation following cerclage is not recommended. There is no evidence that progesterone or Arabin pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical cerclage. A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before labor, usually between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. In women with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks, the cerclage should be removed.\n\nDelayed removal of cerclage until labor or birth is indicated is not recommended due to increased risk of maternal/fetal sepsis. Data from a study suggest that leaving the cerclage in place may lead to higher rates of chorioamnionitis. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes before 23 or after 34 weeks of gestation, delayed removal of cerclage is unlikely to be beneficial.\n\nCerclage for prevention of preterm birth in women with a short cervix found on transvaginal ultrasound examination: a randomized trial.

      "Antenatal corticosteroids given within seven days prior to preterm birth reduce perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids. Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth, and benefits are still seen if given within 24 hours of birth.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation. Steroids have short-term respiratory benefits for the neonate but may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons. Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended. Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage, corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth is likely. Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. There is limited evidence to recommend repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after administration. The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS in pregnancies that birth between 24 hours and 7 days of administration of the second dose.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids have shown significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage among infants born within specific time frames after administration. There is a reduction in fetal and neonatal death for births within 24 hours to seven days after administration. However, caution is advised in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Population-based cohort studies support the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with the largest effect seen 24 hours to seven days after the first injection. Concerns about potential risks to both women and babies include effects on maternal blood glucose levels, fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, long-term metabolic and neurological consequences, and potential impacts on brain development. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of maternal and neonatal hospital services are available.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should not be delayed in serious maternal or fetal conditions. In the presence of systemic infection, the use of corticosteroids should be carefully balanced due to the risk of exacerbating the infection. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies. The maximum number of corticosteroid courses in pregnancy should not exceed three. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions and to investigate potential off-target effects. Recommendations for future research include determining the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing neonatal morbidity in elective caesarean births at term and investigating the safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancies and women with diabetes. Auditable topics include discussions about corticosteroids in planned caesarean births and the proportion of women offered corticosteroids for preterm birth.

      "Key recommendations:\n- All gynaecology departments should provide a dedicated outpatient hysteroscopy service for women and people with abnormal uterine bleeding, reproductive problems, and insertion/retrieval of intrauterine devices.\n- Written information should be provided to the woman prior to their appointment, including details about the procedure, benefits and risks, advice regarding pre-operative analgesia, and contact details for the hysteroscopy unit.\n- Women should be made aware of other settings and modes of anaesthesia for hysteroscopy.\n- Women should be advised to alert the clinical team if the procedure becomes too painful or distressing.\n- Vaginoscopy should be the standard technique for outpatient hysteroscopy unless a vaginal speculum is required.\n- Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes.\n- Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view.\n- Conscious sedation should not be routinely used in outpatient hysteroscopic procedures.\n\nWomen should be given verbal and/or written informed consent prior to hysteroscopy, and should be informed of the potential pain and distress during the procedure. A safety checklist should be considered before hysteroscopy, including exclusion of pregnancy. Care after hysteroscopy should include discussing clinical findings, providing contact information, and offering a dedicated recovery area. Training in hysteroscopy should cover basic and advanced skills, and analgesia with NSAIDs or alternatives should be recommended.\n\nA statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, and antispasmodics given prior to hysteroscopy. NSAIDs and TENS showed no significant difference in side effects, while opioids and antispasmodics had a higher likelihood of side effects. Cervical preparation with vaginal prostaglandins can be considered in selected cases, but is associated with side effects and complications. Miniature hysteroscopes of 3.5mm or less in outer diameter should be used for diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy to reduce pain. When performing operative hysteroscopy, smaller diameter hysteroscopes and mechanical tissue removal systems should be used for less pain. The choice of hysteroscope lens angle is at the discretion of the clinician.\n\nAdverse events were not meta-analysed. Image quality showed no significant difference between scope sizes, or found significantly better visualisation with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Studies reported a significant increase in success when using a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Procedural duration was significantly shorter with a miniaturised hysteroscope in some studies. The incidence of vasovagal reactions was significantly lower with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope in one study. Flexible hysteroscopes are associated with less pain during diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy. Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems are preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for endometrial polyp removal. Inactivated mechanical mini-scissors should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for uterine septa removal. Saline is recommended as the distension medium for outpatient hysteroscopy due to less pain, better image quality, and greater patient satisfaction. Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view. Warming saline to body temperature can be considered for outpatient hysteroscopy.\n\nRoutine cervical dilatation should be avoided prior to outpatient hysteroscopy. Blind dilatation of the cervix causes pain, discomfort, and uterine trauma in the outpatient setting. Local anaesthesia should not be routinely administered prior to outpatient hysteroscopy if a vaginoscopic approach is used, but should be considered if a vaginal speculum is planned. The choice of local anaesthetic agent and route of administration should be left to the discretion of the hysteroscopist. Conscious sedation should not be routinely used in outpatient hysteroscopic procedures. If conscious sedation is used, appropriate patient selection and monitoring are essential.\n\nConscious sedation is defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which women respond purposefully to verbal commands. It is imperative to follow guidance on safe use to prevent life-threatening complications. Different sedation levels affect airway, ventilation, and cardiovascular function. Intravenous conscious sedation reduces pain during outpatient hysteroscopy compared to local anesthesia. Inhaled conscious sedation shows the greatest pain reduction but lacks recorded side effects. Close monitoring is necessary to identify and respond to over-sedation. Vaginoscopy is recommended for outpatient hysteroscopy due to reduced pain and quicker procedures. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, but antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected. Standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings is essential.\n\nEffect of cervical preparation with prostaglandins on pain relief and feasibility in outpatient hysteroscopy. Safety, acceptability and feasibility of hysteroscopy according to angle of distal optical lens. Effectiveness of the vaginoscopic approach to outpatient hysteroscopy in relieving pain compared with traditional approaches with local anaesthesia. Relative effectiveness of different types, routes, doses and timings of local anaesthesia on pain and incidence of vasovagal reactions. Effectiveness of warming fluid distension media on pain relief and satisfaction. Effectiveness of methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) on pain relief and satisfaction. Assessment of specific operative hysteroscopic technologies including endometrial ablative devices, regarding pain, acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness. Evaluation of technical, analgesic, anaesthetic and sedative interventions for specific operative outpatient hysteroscopic procedures. Qualitative research exploring patient experience and preferences. Qualitative research exploring patient recovery and return to daily activity following outpatient hysteroscopy. Units should consider collecting data for quality assurance purposes. Provision of pre-appointment written information on OPH ≥ 95%. Mean peak intra-procedural pain score (on an 11-point Visual Analogue Scale) for various procedures. Procedure acceptability for diagnostic hysteroscopy, hysteroscopic polypectomy, and endometrial ablation. Mean overall level of care for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Compliance with safety checklists for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Documentation completion rates for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. Vasovagal reaction rates for diagnostic hysteroscopy, hysteroscopic polypectomy & endometrial ablation. Rates of uterine/cervical trauma, infection, hospital admission, and hospital readmission for all hysteroscopies & endometrial ablation. No reliable data for operative outpatient myomectomy or removal of retained products of conception. No data available for outpatient endometrial ablation. No data available for outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy or outpatient endometrial ablation. No data available for outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy or outpatient endometrial ablation. Recommended quality assurance tools for outpatient hysteroscopy include patient satisfaction surveys and the BSGE Surgical Information Collection System.\n\nHysteroscopy: Prospective randomized trials on pain management during outpatient hysteroscopy have been conducted, evaluating the use of various analgesic methods such as music, virtual reality, nitrous oxide, lidocaine, tramadol, misoprostol, diclofenac, and other medications. These studies have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in reducing pain associated with hysteroscopy. Additionally, studies have evaluated the optimal timing and methods of cervical preparation prior to hysteroscopy in different patient populations. Complications such as uterine perforation have also been reported in some cases.\n\nOUTPATIENT HYSTEROSCOPY\nSeveral clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of different medications for cervical priming before hysteroscopy, including misoprostol, carboprost methylate suppository, and vaginal dinoprostone. These studies have shown varying levels of efficacy and pain relief in different patient populations. Additionally, studies comparing different types of hysteroscopes, such as flexible versus rigid endoscopes, have been conducted to determine the feasibility and patient discomfort associated with each type. Overall, the choice of medication and hysteroscope type can impact the success and patient experience of outpatient hysteroscopy.\n\nPain management in outpatient hysteroscopy is important for patient comfort and procedure completion rates. Various methods, such as warm saline distension media, topical anesthesia, and paracervical blocks, have been studied in randomized controlled trials to assess their efficacy in reducing pain during hysteroscopy. These studies have shown promising results in improving patient comfort and procedural outcomes.\n\nOutpatient hysteroscopy: traditional versus the “no-touch” technique.

Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nWhen women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).\n\nHistory should include details on the last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed, bleeding pattern before starting HRT, pelvic pain, discharge, vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, bleeding pattern on HRT, HRT use details, application, contraceptive usage, pregnancy risk, cervical screening history, sexual history, drug interactions, malabsorption syndromes, and endometrial cancer risk factors.\n\nExamination and initial investigations should include abdominal assessment, vulvo-vaginal assessment, cervical appearance assessment, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, pregnancy test, and BMI assessment.\n\nThe document outlines major and minor risk factors affecting endometrial cancer risk in women taking HRT, as well as risk factors independent of HRT use. It also discusses the effect of HRT preparation on endometrial cancer risk and provides recommendations for different HRT regimens.\n\nContinuous combined HRT with daily progestogen is recommended for endometrial protection. Sequential/cyclical HRT should be considered in women over 50 with no unscheduled bleeding. Tricycling progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\n\nUnopposed estrogen use in people with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Different progestogen types can provide endometrial protection, with specific recommendations for each type. The use of a levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device is also discussed for endometrial protection.\n\nIt is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about the limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium if unscheduled bleeding occurs. A change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered if new unscheduled bleeding develops at 4 years of use. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. Normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT should be understood. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is important. Clinical pathways for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed based on risk factors and time-frames.\n\nConservative management strategies can be offered for unscheduled bleeding in women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer. Adjustments to HRT can be made if bleeding persists after changes in dose or preparation. Referral for ultrasound is recommended for certain criteria, and HRT can be continued during assessment. Recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options are provided based on ultrasound findings. Endometrial assessment is also recommended for asymptomatic women with a thickened endometrium on TVS. Blind outpatient endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling are options for further assessment.\n\nMenopausal women with unscheduled bleeding may benefit from adjustments in progestogen and hysteroscopic assessment. Recommendations include reassurance and progestogen adjustments after a normal biopsy, urgent hysteroscopy for thickened endometrial tissue, and referral to gynaecology oncology for hyperplasia or cancer. Adjustments in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and non-hormonal alternatives should be considered based on endometrial histology. Progestogen type and route of HRT can impact bleeding profiles, with options such as the Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD) and transdermal preparations showing potential benefits. Recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, considering low dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial in reducing unscheduled bleeding episodes.\n\nCounsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding in perimenopausal women with sequential preparations. Consider timing and offering desogestrel or combined oral contraceptives. Adjust progestogen dose or type as needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists.\n\nStute P, Neulen J, Wildt L.

      "Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome\nSummary answer: International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.\nWhat is known already: The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from 6 continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available evidence, applied robust methodological processes, and addressed shared priorities. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, and evidence-practice gaps persist.\nMain results and the role of chance: The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past 5 years but remains of low to moderate quality. Key updates include further refinement of diagnostic criteria, recognition of broader features of PCOS, emphasis on diverse burden of disease, and evidence-based medical therapy and fertility management.\nWider implications of the findings: The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert input, and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated to address key gaps in knowledge and promote future research.\n\nThe true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very Low confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.\n\nGeneral principles:\n- All diagnostic assessments recommended for use in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm.\n- Irregular menstrual cycles defined based on age and cycle length.\n- Adolescents with irregular cycles should discuss assessment and diagnosis of PCOS considering diagnostic challenges.\n- For adolescents with PCOS features, but not meeting diagnostic criteria, increased risk should be considered.\n- Ovulatory dysfunction can occur with regular cycles, and serum progesterone levels can confirm anovulation.\n\nBiochemical hyperandrogenism:\n- Total and free testosterone should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS diagnosis.\n- Laboratories should use accurate assays for measuring androgens.\n- Assessing biochemical hyperandrogenism is valuable in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism.\n\nClinical hyperandrogenism:\n- Hirsutism alone predicts biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults.\n- Female pattern hair loss and acne are weak predictors of hyperandrogenism.\n- Comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for clinical hyperandrogenism symptoms.\n\nUltrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology:\n- Follicle number per ovary is an effective ultrasound marker for PCOM in adults.\n- Criteria for PCOM should be based on follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement.\n- Thresholds for PCOM should be regularly revised with advancing ultrasound technology.\n\nAnti-Müllerian hormone in the diagnosis of PCOS:\n- Serum AMH may be used for defining PCOM in adults.\n- Serum AMH should not be used as a single test for PCOS diagnosis.\n- Serum AMH should not be used in adolescents.\n\nEthnic variation:\n- PCOS prevalence is high across all ethnicities and regions.\n- Presentation of PCOS may vary across ethnic groups.\n\nMenopause life stage:\n- PCOS diagnosis may be considered enduring/lifelong.\n- Clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism may persist post-menopause in women with PCOS.\n\nCardiovascular disease risk:\n- Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n- Lipid profile and blood pressure should be measured regularly in women with PCOS.\n\nCardiovascular guidelines should consider PCOS as a risk factor. Healthcare professionals and women with PCOS should prioritize preventative strategies for cardiovascular risk. Consideration should be given to differences in risk factors across ethnicities and ages. PCOS increases the risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, requiring regular assessment. Healthcare professionals should prioritize preventative strategies for diabetes risk in women with PCOS. PCOS is associated with higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial hyperplasia, and cancer. Screening and management strategies should be implemented. Psychological features are common in PCOS and should be addressed. Lifestyle interventions, including healthy eating and physical activity, are recommended for all women with PCOS to improve metabolic health. Behavioral strategies can also optimize weight management and emotional well-being.\n\nBehavioural or cognitive behavioural interventions could be considered to increase support, engagement, retention, adherence, and maintenance of healthy lifestyle and improve health outcomes in women with PCOS. Healthcare professionals and women should consider that there is no evidence to support any one type of diet composition over another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, or psychological outcomes. Any diet composition consistent with population guidelines for healthy eating will have health benefits. Tailoring of dietary changes to food preferences, avoiding unduly restrictive diets, and discussing barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to dietary change are important. Healthcare professionals should encourage physical activity consistent with population guidelines and discuss barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to physical activity. Self-monitoring with fitness tracking devices could be considered to support and promote active lifestyles. Many women with PCOS experience weight stigma, and healthcare professionals should be aware of their weight biases. Weight stigma education and minimization strategies should be promoted. Weight-inclusive practices should be followed in PCOS care. Metformin may be considered for adults with PCOS for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes. Combined oral contraceptive pills could be recommended for management of hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. Inositol could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values.\n\n4.7.5 PP Shared decision-making should include discussion about the regulatory status and quality control of inositol in any form.\n4.7.6 PP Policy makers and healthcare professionals should ensure women have access to evidence-based information for shared decision-making.\n4.8 Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism in women with PCOS.\n4.9 Bariatric/metabolic surgery could be considered to improve various health outcomes in women with PCOS.\n4.10 Women with PCOS have higher risk pregnancies and should receive appropriate monitoring and support during antenatal care.\n4.11 Metformin in pregnancy has not been shown to prevent certain complications but could be considered in some circumstances.\n5 Assessment and treatment of infertility should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm and include lifestyle interventions.\n\nIn women with anovulatory PCOS, IVF is effective, with elective single-embryo transfer to minimize multiple pregnancies. Women should be counseled about the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome during IVF/ICSI treatment. The use of a GnRH antagonist protocol is recommended to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing embryos is recommended in certain IVF/ICSI cycles. Metformin therapy may be used to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and miscarriage. In vitro maturation and ICSI could be considered as alternatives to stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles. Inositol therapy is considered experimental in PCOS. Anti-obesity agents should only be used in research settings for reproductive outcomes. Letrozole is the preferred first-line therapy for infertility in women with PCOS. IVF may be considered as a third-line therapy for anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS. Single embryo transfer is preferred to minimize pregnancy complications.\n\nThe Australian Diabetes Society, along with other relevant organizations, developed guidelines for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome. The effort was funded by the Australian Government and supported by various partner organizations. Conflict of interest disclosures were made and the guideline was peer-reviewed. The data extracted is available in a repository. The authors' contributions and a list of key contributors are provided in the guideline.",
      "The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline to improve healthcare delivery for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age, with symptoms including pain and infertility. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, including hormone therapies and surgical options. While there are still gaps in knowledge, the guideline aims to address the clinical needs of patients with endometriosis.\n\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments like GnRH agonists or antagonists, and surgical options. The use of Danazol, anti-progestogens, LUNA, PSN, and anti-adhesion agents is no longer recommended. Surgical options include excision over ablation and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma. Referral to a center of expertise is recommended for deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who do not wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.\n\n33 Consider long-term consequences of early menopause before removing ovaries. \n34 Total hysterectomy preferred when performed. \n35 Preoperative hormone treatment not recommended for pain improvement. \n36 Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered for pain improvement. \n37 Shared decision-making for choosing between hormone and surgical treatments. \n38 Discuss non-medical strategies for quality of life in endometriosis. \n39 Do not prescribe ovarian suppression for infertility. \n40 Postoperative hormone suppression not recommended solely for enhancing pregnancy rates. \n41 Hormone therapy may be offered for pain improvement in infertile women. \n42 Do not prescribe certain drugs outside ovulation induction for natural pregnancy rates. \n43 Operative laparoscopy may improve ongoing pregnancy rates in endometriosis-associated infertility. \n44 Consider operative laparoscopy for endometrioma-associated infertility. \n45 Consider operative laparoscopy for symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. \n46 Decision for surgery guided by various factors. \n47 Intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation may increase pregnancy rates in stage I/II endometriosis. \n48 Consider IUI with ovarian stimulation in stage III/IV endometriosis with tubal patency. \n49 ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis. \n50 No specific protocol recommended for ART in women with endometriosis. \n51 ART safety reassurance for women with endometriosis. \n52 Consider antibiotic prophylaxis during oocyte retrieval in women with endometrioma. \n53 Extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART not recommended. \n54 Prolonged administration of COC/progestogens not recommended as pre-treatment to ART. \n55 Do not perform surgery prior to ART to improve live birth rates in stage I/II endometriosis. \n56 Do not perform surgery for ovarian endometrioma prior to ART to improve live birth rates. \n57 Surgery for endometrioma prior to ART may improve endometriosis-associated pain or follicle accessibility. \n58 Consider surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART based on pain symptoms and patient preference. \n59 Discuss fertility preservation options with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. \n60 Do not advise pregnancy solely for treating endometriosis. \n61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma during pregnancy to appropriate expertise. \n62 Increased risk of first-trimester miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. \n63 Be aware of endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy. \n64 Perform ovarian cystectomy for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain. \n65 Consider postoperative use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptive for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain. \n66 Offer long-term hormone treatment after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma. \n67 Consider long-term administration of postoperative hormone treatment for the prevention of recurrence of deep endometriosis. \n68 ART can be performed in women with deep endometriosis. \n69 Offer hormone treatment or surgery for recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. \n70 Take a careful history to identify possible risk factors for endometriosis in adolescents. \n71 Consider endometriosis in young women with specific symptoms. \n72 Consider specific symptoms as suggestive of endometriosis in adolescents. \n73 Discuss acceptability before performing vaginal or rectal examination in adolescents. \n74 Use transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents. \n75 Do not use serum biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. \n76 Consider diagnostic laparoscopy in adolescents with suspected endometriosis. \n77 Consider taking biopsies during laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis. \n78 Prescribe hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line therapy for adolescents with severe pain. \n79 Consider NSAIDs for endometriosis-associated pain in adolescents. \n80 Consider prescribing GnRH agonists for adolescents with confirmed endometriosis and pain. \n81 Use GnRH agonist treatment after careful consideration and discussion of potential side effects in adolescents. \n82 Consider surgical removal of endometriosis lesions in adolescents with symptoms. \n83 Consider postoperative hormone therapy for symptom suppression in adolescents with endometriosis. \n85 Inform adolescents with endometriosis about the potential detrimental effects on fertility. \n86 Inform adolescents about fertility preservation options. \n87 Consider surgical treatment for postmenopausal women with signs of endometriosis and pain. \n88 Acknowledge uncertainty regarding the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. \n89 Consider aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain. \n90 Consider combined MHT for postmenopausal symptoms\n\nClinicians should be aware that women with endometriosis who have undergone an early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have an increased risk of diminished bone density, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Women with endometriosis also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, regardless of surgical menopause. For extrapelvic endometriosis, surgical removal is preferred for abdominal cases, while hormone treatment may be an option when surgery is not possible. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis, with surgery recommended when indicated in a multidisciplinary manner. Women with asymptomatic endometriosis should be informed and counseled, but surgical excision or medical treatment is not recommended. Routine ultrasound monitoring for asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered. While there is no direct evidence, aiming for a healthy lifestyle with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity may help prevent endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have a slightly higher risk of certain cancers, but general cancer prevention measures are recommended.\n\nClinical symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, and infertility should prompt consideration of endometriosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and previous diagnoses of certain conditions increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may be predictive of endometriosis, but overall, clinical symptoms alone are not reliable for diagnosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be considered if the examination is normal.\n\nThe guideline recommends using clinical examination for diagnosing endometriosis and further diagnostic steps if needed. Medical technologies like imaging and biomarkers can also be used, but there are limitations in their reliability. Imaging techniques like ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but they may not always be conclusive, especially for superficial disease. Laparoscopy may still be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, especially if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful.\n\nThe guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis. Laparoscopy is considered the standard for diagnosis, but it is invasive and costly. Empirical treatment following imaging results can be considered for symptomatic patients. Long-term monitoring for endometriosis is not recommended for preventing adverse outcomes. Individualized follow-up based on previous treatments and disease severity is suggested. Further research is needed to develop consensus criteria for diagnosis and to investigate long-term management approaches.\n\nImpact of the time of diagnosis on quality of life: Early diagnosis of endometriosis may reduce pain, infertility risk, and provide relief, empowerment, and understanding for affected women. While no studies directly compare early versus late diagnosis on quality of life, diagnosis can lead to positive adjustments and support services. The guideline recommends symptom relief or treatment after diagnosis. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on quality of life.\n\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain: Analgesics, such as NSAIDs, may be offered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence supporting their use is limited. Hormone treatments, including combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, or antagonists, are recommended to reduce pain. Individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability should be considered when choosing hormone treatments. Hormone treatments have shown to be effective in reducing pain symptoms associated with endometriosis.\n\nBased on clinical trials, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have been shown to improve pain associated with endometriosis. Continuous use of OCP may be more effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain compared to cyclic use. The vaginal ring and transdermal patch have also been studied for their efficacy in treating endometriosis. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have shown to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with some adverse effects. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems and subdermal implants is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol is not recommended due to severe side effects. GnRH agonists have been found to be effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain, but may be less effective than other treatments. Further details are available in the full guideline.\n\nIn studies comparing different routes of administration, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches, and decreased libido were reported, but there was no difference between intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intranasal administration. The bone mineral density was decreased in both groups at 20 weeks after treatment, but the degree of loss of BMD was significantly higher in the full dose group. Reduction of bone mineral density is one of the undesirable effects of long-term GnRH-agonist treatment. It is recommended to prescribe women GnRH agonists to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Clinicians should consider prescribing combined hormonal add-back therapy alongside GnRH agonist therapy to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms. A meta-analysis found that Lumbar spine BMD after treatment and at 6 months of follow-up were superior with GnRH agonist + add-back therapy than with GnRH agonist alone. GnRH antagonists have been added to the medical treatment options for endometriosis. GnRH antagonists can be considered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination with other medications to reduce endometriosis-associated pain.\n\nSurgical treatment to eliminate endometriotic lesions and divide adhesions has long been an important part of the management of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is recommended over ablation for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Superficial peritoneal endometriosis may be a separate entity, but more research is needed on its surgical treatment outcomes. Research should investigate the effect of surgery on pain and quality of life parameters in different subtypes of endometriosis.\n\nSurgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea was analyzed in a Cochrane review. Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) did not offer additional benefit, but presacral neurectomy (PSN) showed significant benefits in reducing pain and improving quality of life. PSN is associated with increased risk of adverse effects. \n\nFor ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy is recommended over drainage and coagulation to reduce recurrence of pain and endometrioma. CO2 laser vaporization can also be considered, with similar recurrence rates beyond the first year. It is important to minimize ovarian damage during surgery. \n\nFor deep endometriosis, excision of nodules is recommended, especially for colorectal involvement. Various surgical techniques have shown improvement in pain and quality of life, with segmental bowel resection being a widely acceptable option. Standardized reporting of surgical trials is recommended for deep endometriosis.\n\nA multicentre study showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life after laparoscopic excision of deep rectovaginal endometriosis. Analgesia use decreased, and complications occurred in 6.8% of cases. Surgical removal of deep endometriosis can reduce pain and improve quality of life. Referral to a centre of expertise is recommended, and patients should be informed of potential risks and benefits. Surgery improves pain and quality of life, but caution is advised due to varying study methods and outcomes. Different surgical approaches for bowel endometriosis have shown improvements in pain and quality of life. A minimally invasive approach is preferred for radical removal of endometriosis lesions. Complications of surgery for bowel endometriosis are significant, especially with rectal surgery.\n\nThe reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed improvement in pain symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder and ureteral endometriosis resulted in significant improvement in pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy can reduce the risk of urinary retention. Hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain can relieve symptoms and reduce the need for re-operation. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic factors to predict improvement in pain symptoms. Further research is needed in this area.\n\nSurgical treatment for endometriosis includes excision or ablation techniques, with excision showing better outcomes in terms of pain improvement. Laparoscopic surgery is effective for deep infiltrating endometriosis, with various techniques used for different locations of endometriotic lesions. Quality of life and fertility outcomes are important considerations in the surgical management of endometriosis. Recurrence rates after surgery vary depending on the type of procedure performed. It is essential to consider the impact of surgery on symptoms and quality of life when choosing a surgical approach for endometriosis.\n\nClinical outcomes after surgical treatment of endometriosis with colorectal involvement: a review of studies on laparoscopic excision and bowel resection.\n\nII.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  \nThe question on whether medical therapies are effective as an adjunct to surgical therapy considers both therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes, and therapies aimed at secondary prevention. A good practice point in this respect was formulated in the previous ESHRE guideline for endometriosis: “The GDG recommends that clinicians clearly distinguish adjunctive short-term (<6 months) hormone treatment after surgery from long-term (>6 months) hormone treatment; the latter is aimed at secondary prevention.” The evidence and recommendations are separated into ‘therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes’ and ‘therapies for secondary prevention’. \n\nPICO QUESTION: ARE MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT TO SURGICAL THERAPY?\n\nIt is not recommended to prescribe preoperative hormone treatment to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis. Surgeons may prescribe preoperative medical treatment with GnRH agonists to facilitate surgery, but there are no controlled studies supporting this. Postoperative hormone therapy may be prescribed for pain in women with endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. \n\nII.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence to make any definite recommendation on whether medical therapies or surgery are more effective for relieving pain in women with endometriosis. The decision between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain should be based on shared decision-making, individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. \n\nII.6. Non-medical management strategies\n\nNon-medical management strategies for endometriosis include complementary and alternative medicine, self-management strategies, and psychological and physical therapies. Research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these strategies in women with endometriosis. Acupuncture, psychological therapy, exercise, and other non-medical approaches are discussed in recent studies for relieving endometriosis-associated pain and improving quality of life.\n\nOne RCT compared ‘sham’ acupuncture with verum acupuncture in women with endometriosis and found that verum acupuncture resulted in significantly less pain and improved psychological well-being. Another study concluded that Japanese acupuncture is a safe and effective adjunct therapy for endometriosis-related pain. Overall, acupuncture was found to alleviate dysmenorrhea and pain in women with endometriosis, with little to no reported adverse effects.\n\nPhysiotherapy interventions for endometriosis are not well documented, but pelvic floor exercises have shown moderate evidence for addressing pelvic floor dysfunction. However, no specific research was identified for pelvic floor training for women with endometriosis. Massage and trigger point release therapy have not shown significant reduction in pain compared to general massage in chronic noncancer pain.\n\nExercise has benefits for mental health and overall health, but there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion on its effects on endometriosis-related pain. Psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and mindfulness-based programmes, have shown some improvements in pain and quality of life for women with endometriosis, but more research is needed. Overall, no recommendation can be made about physical therapies, exercise, or psychological interventions for improving quality of life and reducing pain in women with endometriosis.\n\nParticipants were included up to 5 years after their laparoscopic diagnosis, with most indicating their post-endometriosis-treatment condition as \"recovered\" and no current symptoms collected. No recommendations can be made regarding the effectiveness of psychological approaches for pain and quality of life in women with endometriosis. Studies on the impact of psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Nutrition may affect endometriosis symptoms, with limited studies evaluating the benefit of dietary interventions. Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may have positive effects on pain scores. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy were not well studied. Women with endometriosis may change their diets to alleviate symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine studies were generally poorly constructed. No recommendations can be made for nutrition or Chinese Medicine to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with endometriosis. Adequately designed trials are needed to define the potential benefits of non-medical interventions in endometriosis.\n\nWomen with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis associated pain, infertility, or both. For clarity, the GDG decided to separately discuss the evidence on pain as the outcome in chapter II; infertility as an outcome is addressed in this chapter. The first part of this chapter deals with treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility, including medical, surgical, and non-pharmacological treatments. Medically assisted reproduction and adjunctive treatments are discussed in the second part of the chapter. In the last part of the chapter, the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcome is discussed, as well as indications for ART after surgery, and indications for fertility preservation.\n\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility. Women seeking pregnancy should not be prescribed postoperative hormone suppression with the sole purpose to enhance future pregnancy rates. Those women who cannot attempt to or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery may be offered hormone therapy as it does not negatively impact their fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors have shown uncertain effects on pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis.\n\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase the chance of natural pregnancy, although no data from comparative studies exist. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis improves fertility, it may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated Endometriosis Fertility Index.\n\nThe Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their reproductive options after surgery. It can help reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or other fertility management options for women with endometriosis-related infertility. It is recommended to use the EFI for better patient phenotyping in studies on surgical treatment and/or the place of medically assisted reproduction in endometriosis-related infertility. Studies should clarify whether intrauterine insemination (IUI) with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women with different subtypes of endometriosis, and the value of the EFI to predict the relevance of IUI could be further investigated. \n\nIn infertile women with stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may consider performing IUI with ovarian stimulation instead of expectant management or IUI alone, as it increases pregnancy rates. The benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI in women with stage III/IV endometriosis is uncertain, but it could be considered. \n\nThere are currently no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of assisted reproductive technology (ART) versus no intervention in women with endometriosis. Studies comparing the outcomes of ART in women with endometriosis to women without endometriosis have reported lower fertilization rates and pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. The impact of endometrioma on ART reproductive outcomes has been summarized, with lower numbers of oocytes retrieved in women with endometrioma. Studies evaluating different ovarian stimulation protocols in women with endometriosis have not shown significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates.\n\nIn women with endometriosis, both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols can be offered for ART based on patient and physician preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been demonstrated. Women with endometriosis can be reassured regarding the safety of ART, as recurrence rates are not increased compared to those not undergoing ART. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometriomas is recommended. Overall, evidence does not show a negative impact of endometriosis on live birth rate after ART, although ovarian response and clinical pregnancy rates may be lower. ART may be effective for endometriosis-associated infertility, especially in cases where other treatments have failed. The severity of the disease may affect live birth rates, with stage III-IV endometriosis potentially decreasing the rate. Studies evaluating IUI and ART outcomes in women with endometriosis are recommended to report clinically relevant outcomes and perform subgroup analysis by stage of endometriosis and type of disease. Further research on medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility is needed to clarify treatment effectiveness.\n\nSurgical therapies as an adjunct to MAR for endometriosis-associated infertility may be effective. Surgery for peritoneal endometriosis prior to ART has shown higher implantation, pregnancy, and live birth rates. However, surgery for ovarian endometrioma before ART does not improve live birth rates and may negatively impact ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be guided by pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain. More data are needed to confirm the benefits of surgery for improving ART outcomes.\n\nIn symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis, surgical removal of the lesions may be (re)considered. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery, and complication rates are discussed in further detail in section II.3.f. Non-medical management strategies for infertility associated with endometriosis have not shown clear evidence of benefit. Fertility preservation should be discussed with women with severe endometriosis, as surgical treatment can impact ovarian reserve and AMH levels. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcomes is still unclear.\n\nEndometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show a variety of changes, including decidual reaction, atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis. Management may involve serial monitoring or surgery if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy does not consistently improve symptoms of endometriosis, and women should continue medical treatment after giving birth. Endometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, requiring referral to a specialized center. Complications from endometriosis during pregnancy are rare but may be life-threatening, necessitating surgical management. Women with endometriosis have an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms in the first trimester. Larger studies are needed to understand the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes. Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association between endometriosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the second and third trimesters. Complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth, placenta previa, and hypertensive disorders may be more common in women with endometriosis.\n\nWomen with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth and Caesarean section. They may also be more likely to have babies that are small for gestational age and experience neonatal death. Endometriosis does not seem to increase the risk of obstetric hemorrhages. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, but currently, there is no need for increased monitoring or discouraging pregnancy in women with endometriosis. Studies on interventions for risk reduction are lacking. Risk factors for endometriosis recurrence include surgery-related variables and patient-related factors. Surgical techniques for prevention of recurrence include ovarian cystectomy for endometrioma.\n\nCystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma ≥3 cm. Ovarian surgery should consider impact on ovarian reserve. Hormone therapy post-surgery can prevent disease recurrence. OCP and LNG-IUS have shown effectiveness in reducing pain and recurrence. Progestogens and GnRH agonists are also options. Long-term hormone treatment can prevent endometriosis recurrence. ART does not increase endometriosis recurrence. LNG-IUS or combined hormonal contraceptives can be used post-surgery for prevention. Consider patient preferences, costs, risks, and side effects when choosing treatment. Data on subtype-specific treatments are limited. Recommendations are strong for ovarian endometrioma and weak for deep endometriosis.\n\nIV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis  \nMedical treatment for recurrent endometriosis after surgery has been described in few RCTs and uncontrolled observational studies. In an RCT, 242 women with recurrent pelvic pain within 1 year following laparoscopic surgery were randomised to dienogest or depot leuprolide acetate. VAS scores for pelvic pain, back pain, dyspareunia or endometrioma size were significantly lower at 12 weeks follow-up. Another RCT compared 6-month treatment with desogestrel or OCP in 40 women with recurrent dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain after conservative surgery. Both treatments resulted in a significant decrease of VAS scores at 6 months compared to baseline. In the RCT by Vercellini and colleagues, 90 women with recurrent moderate or severe pelvic pain after conservative surgery for symptomatic endometriosis were randomised to 6-month treatment with cyproterone acetate or a continuous monophasic OCP. The study showed no difference in efficacy for cyproterone acetate versus a continuous monophasic OCP. Dienogest treatment immediately after recurrence was effective in controlling disease progression in a small cohort study. Dienogest was also effective in reducing the size of endometriomas and providing symptomatic relief in another study. Retreatment with nafarelin for recurrent endometriosis symptoms showed improvements in symptoms. \n\nSurgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis has limited evidence, with one small, uncontrolled study showing recurrence of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain in some women. A small prospective study showed that surgery for recurrent endometriomas may harm healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserve. \n\nAny hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. Recurrence of endometriosis is a prevalent clinical observation, and the lack of evidence should not prioritize certain treatments over others that have been shown effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain. Other causes for pain symptoms, such as adenomyosis or pelvic floor dysfunction, should be investigated if symptoms recur soon after surgery.\n\nIn adolescents, diagnosis of endometriosis is often based on pain symptoms only, which may have a more varied presentation compared to adults. Symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and nausea with pelvic pain should raise suspicion for endometriosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, should be considered, and transvaginal ultrasound is recommended for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents. Serum biomarkers are not recommended for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. If imaging is negative and medical treatments have not been successful, diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered. Histological confirmation of endometriosis through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended, as negative histology does not entirely rule out the disease.\n\n28: 2026- 2031.  \nQuestioning patients about their adolescent history can identify markers associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis.

Early menstrual characteristics associated with subsequent diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriosis in young women: the experience of GISE. Adolescent endometriosis in China: a retrospective analysis of cases. \n\nIn adolescents with severe dysmenorrhea and/or endometriosis-associated pain, clinicians should prescribe hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line hormone therapy. Clinicians may consider NSAIDs as treatment for endometriosis-associated pain in adolescents with (suspected) endometriosis. In adolescents with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and associated pain, clinicians may consider prescribing GnRH agonists for up to 1 year, as they are effective and safe when combined with add-back therapy. In young women and adolescents, if GnRH agonist treatment is considered, it should be used only after careful consideration and discussion of potential side effects and potential long-term health risks with a practitioner in a secondary or tertiary care setting. \n\nIn adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians may consider surgical removal of endometriosis lesions to manage endometriosis-related symptoms. If surgical treatment is indicated in adolescents with endometriosis, it should be performed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon, and, if possible, complete laparoscopic removal of all present endometriosis should be performed. \n\nThe effect of long-term treatment with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery for endometriosis in adolescents showed low recurrence rates.\n\nEndometriosis symptoms may persist after menopause, with a prevalence of 2-5% in postmenopausal women. Hormone therapy may stimulate endometriosis growth. Surgical treatment is recommended as first-line for postmenopausal women with endometriosis.\n\n2007 , Pavone and Bulun, \n2012 , Polyzos , et al. , 2011 ). Also, there are very little options available for medical treatment - besides \nusing analgesics or aromatase inhibitors (see  below) - due to the naturally low levels of estrogen in \npostmenopausal women.\n  \nVI.2.a. Surgical treatment  \nWe identified five cohort studies on surgery in postmenopausal endometriosis patients: three studies \ndescribed a cohort of postmenopausal women who presented with pain and subsequently underwent \nsurgery whilst two retrospective cohort studies reported on women in whom endometriosis was \nidentified based on histology.   \nVI.2.a.1. Efficacy of surgery in postmenopausal women  \nA prospective cohort by Redwine et al.  included 75 women with previous bilateral salpingo -\noophorectomy ( BSO) who received excision of histologically confirmed  endometriosis as treatment for \npain. Most women had a marked alleviation of pain after excision of endometriosis, although only 13 patients underwent a re -operation due to pelvic pain. No malignancy was found in this study.  \nBehera et al.  described a retrospective cohort of 124 women with chronic pelvic pain after hysterectomy and BSO. Laparoscopic treatment of any pelvic pathologic condition improved pain symptoms in the majority of women. In 2 women a malignancy of the bowel was found.  \nClayton et al.  described a case series of five women with recurrent pain after BSO and hysterectomy who had residual endometriosis managed by laparoscopic excision. The women had improved pain symptoms at 4 months after surgery.\nVI.2.a.2. Risk of malignant transformation in postmenopausal women  \nConsideration of the possibility of malignancy should be taken in postmenopausal women with endometriosis irrespective of symptoms. This may require further imaging studies and/or the surgical exploration of the area.  \nA retrospective cohort study identified 72 postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis, of which 57 had endometriomas. In 35% of these endometriomas a (pre)malignancy was found. \nSun et al.  described a retrospective cohort study of postmenopausal patients in whom endometriosis was histologically confirmed. In 62 women an endometrioma was found and 10 women had a coexisting ovarian, endometrial,  or cervical malignancy.  \n\nRecommendations: \nClinicians may consider surgical treatment for postmenopausal women presenting with signs of endometriosis and/or pain. \nThe GDG recommends that clinicians acknowledge the uncertainty towards the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women.\nFor postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain, clinicians may consider aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option especially if surgery is not feasible. \n\nJustification: \nSurgical treatment can improve pain in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors have shown effectiveness in reducing endometriosis-associated pain in premenopausal women and may be a medical alternative to surgery for postmenopausal endometriosis.\n\nResearch recommendation: \nMore evidence is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors or other medical treatments in postmenopausal women with endometriosis-related pain symptoms.\n\nAbdominal wall endometriosis is frequently associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI. The appearance of scar endometriosis on imaging depends on various factors. CT imaging has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing abdominal wall endometriosis. MRI is preferred in younger patients due to improved tissue characterization and lack of ionizing radiation. Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms with a catamenial pattern.\n\nCatamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. In a review of data on 490 cases of catamenial pneumothorax, pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in a high percentage of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain, with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, while hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis. In cases of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.\n\nWomen with incidental findings of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment unless there is evidence of disease progression. Surgical excision or ablation is not recommended due to associated risks. Medical treatment is also not recommended. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about any incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical procedures or prescribe medical treatment. Monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered, but there is limited evidence supporting its benefit. Women can be advised to aim for a healthy lifestyle and diet to potentially reduce the risk of developing endometriosis in the future. The use of hormonal contraceptives for primary prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk assessment should only be done in a research setting.\n\nEndometriosis shares features with cancer, such as resistance to apoptosis and chronic inflammation. While there is a small increased risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer with endometriosis, the absolute risk remains low. Clinicians should reassure patients and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with OCPs potentially reducing ovarian and endometrial cancer risk but increasing breast and cervical cancer risk. More research is needed on the impact of hormone treatments on cancer risk.\n\nAmong women with endometriosis, hormonal treatments do not impact ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy through CA-125 measurement or imaging is not recommended for women with endometriosis without additional risk factors. Monitoring for other types of malignancy is not justified given the low absolute risk in women with endometriosis. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis to guide monitoring needs.\n\nSome authors advocate for earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete disease removal to reduce future ovarian cancer risk. However, preventative surgery may not significantly reduce the future risk of cancer due to the relapsing nature of endometriosis. Studies have shown that unilateral oophorectomy or removal of all visible endometriosis during surgery can dramatically reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Other types of surgical treatment were not significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should consider the epidemiological data showing that complete excision of visible endometriosis may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, weighing the potential benefits against the risks of surgery.\n\nPrevention of endometriosis is essential. Endometriosis and cancer are linked. Conflicts of interest among members of the guideline development group should be declared. Key questions related to the diagnosis, treatment, recurrence, adolescence, menopause, extrapelvic endometriosis, asymptomatic endometriosis, primary prevention, and endometriosis and cancer should be addressed in the guideline. The methodology for guideline development involves literature searches, evidence collection, and consensus meetings.\n\nThe justification section provides data on the interpretation of supporting evidence and other factors considered. Costs and resource impact are discussed where relevant. Recommendations are labeled as 'strong' or 'weak' based on the GRADE approach. Good practice points are based on expert opinion. The guideline draft underwent a review process before publication. Implementation strategies include dissemination and development of patient versions. The guideline will be considered for revision in 2025. Errors or omissions will be corrected in the web version of the document. Diagnosis of endometriosis includes considering symptoms and clinical examination. Treatment options for pain and infertility are discussed. Pregnancy and endometriosis have variable effects. Stakeholder review was conducted before publication. Copyright restrictions apply to the use of the guidelines.",
      "The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline for endometriosis to improve healthcare delivery. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age. Symptoms include pain and infertility, impacting quality of life. Diagnosis can take years, and treatment options include hormone therapy and surgery. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments, combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and aromatase inhibitors. Surgical options such as excision of endometriosis lesions or cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma are also recommended. Referral to a center of expertise is advised for women with deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who no longer wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.\n\n33 When deciding whether to remove the ovaries, consider the long-term consequences of early menopause and the possible need for hormone replacement therapy. \n34 Total hysterectomy is preferred when performing hysterectomy. \n35 Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis. \n36 Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. \n37 Consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. \n39 Do not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility in infertile women with endometriosis. \n40 Postoperative hormone suppression should not be prescribed solely to enhance future pregnancy rates in women seeking pregnancy. \n41 Hormone therapy may be offered to women who cannot or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery as it does not negatively impact fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. \n42 Avoid prescribing pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation induction to improve natural pregnancy rates in infertile women with endometriosis. \n43 Consider operative laparoscopy as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. \n44 Consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility to increase the chance of natural pregnancy. \n45 Operative laparoscopy may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive, although evidence is limited. \n46 The decision to perform surgery should be guided by pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI). \n47 In infertile women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis, intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation may increase pregnancy rates. \n48 Consider the use of IUI with ovarian stimulation in infertile women with rASRM stage III/IV endometriosis with tubal patency. \n49 ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis, especially if tubal function is compromised, there is male factor infertility, low EFI, or if other treatments have failed. \n50 Offer both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols for ART based on patients' and physicians' preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been demonstrated. \n51 Reassure women with endometriosis regarding the safety of ART as recurrence rates are not increased compared to those not undergoing ART. \n52 Consider antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometrioma. \n53 Extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART treatment is not recommended to improve live birth rate in infertile women with endometriosis. \n54 Prolonged administration of COC/progestogens as a pre-treatment to ART to increase live birth rates is not recommended. \n55 Avoid routinely performing surgery prior to ART to improve live birth rates in women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis. \n56 Avoid routinely performing surgery for ovarian endometrioma prior to ART to improve live birth rates as evidence shows no benefit and surgery may impact ovarian reserve. \n57 Surgery for endometrioma prior to ART can be considered to improve endometriosis-associated pain or accessibility of follicles. \n58 Surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART should be guided mainly by pain symptoms and patient preference as its effectiveness on reproductive outcome is uncertain. \n59 Discuss the pros and cons of fertility preservation with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. \n60 Do not advise patients to become pregnant solely to treat endometriosis as pregnancy does not always lead to symptom improvement or disease progression reduction. \n61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma during pregnancy to a centre with appropriate expertise. \n62 Be aware of the increased risk of first-trimester miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. \n63 Be aware of endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy, although rare, and interpret findings with caution. \n64 Perform ovarian cystectomy instead of drainage and electrocoagulation for the secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated symptoms. \n65 Consider postoperative use of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptive for the secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated symptoms. \n66 Offer long-term hormone treatment for the secondary prevention of endometrioma and endometriosis-associated symptom recurrence after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma. \n67 Consider long-term administration of postoperative hormone treatment for the prevention of recurrence of deep endometri\n\nClinicians should continue to treat women with a history of endometriosis after surgical menopause with combined estrogen-progestogen until natural menopause. Women with endometriosis who have undergone early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have an increased risk of bone density loss, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Extrapelvic endometriosis may present with symptoms such as cyclical shoulder pain or cough, and surgical removal is preferred for abdominal cases. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical excision or prescribe medical treatment for asymptomatic cases. Routine ultrasound monitoring can be considered for asymptomatic endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have a slightly higher risk of certain cancers, but the absolute risk increase is low. Clinicians should reassure women about their cancer risk and recommend general cancer prevention measures.\n\nWomen with symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, haematuria, shoulder tip pain, catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, cyclical scar swelling and pain, fatigue, and infertility should be considered for endometriosis diagnosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and a history of certain conditions increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may also indicate the presence of endometriosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps should be considered even if the examination is normal.\n\nThe guideline recommends clinical examination for the diagnosis of endometriosis and further diagnostic steps using medical technologies. Vaginal and rectovaginal examinations may be inappropriate in certain situations and painful for some women. Biomarkers are not reliable for diagnosing endometriosis. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but a negative finding does not exclude endometriosis. Laparoscopy may be considered if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful. Laparoscopic identification of lesions should be confirmed by histology.\n\nThe guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis, with laparoscopy or empirical treatment as options. Long-term monitoring may not be beneficial for preventing adverse outcomes, but follow-up and psychological support are recommended. Research is needed to develop consensus criteria for diagnosis and investigate long-term management approaches for endometriosis.\n\nEndometriosis can have a detrimental effect on the lives of affected women, partners, and families. An early diagnosis, ideally followed by early, adequate treatment, may reduce pain, reduce the risk of infertility, and provide an explanation for symptoms. Although no studies exist to support the benefits of early versus late diagnosis, women may experience relief, legitimation, and empowerment from the diagnosis. The impact of endometriosis on quality of life should be assessed using validated tools. In symptomatic women, attempts should be made to relieve symptoms, either by empirical treatment or after a diagnosis of endometriosis. Large longitudinal studies are recommended to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on the quality of life of women with endometriosis.\n\nBased on clinical trials, continuous use of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) is recommended for treating endometriosis-associated pain. Continuous OCP use has shown to be more effective in reducing dysmenorrhea recurrence compared to cyclic use. Safety profiles of continuous and cyclic OCP use are similar. Different modes of administration, such as vaginal ring and transdermal patch, have been studied, with varying results in terms of effectiveness. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have also been found to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with different side effect profiles to consider. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol is not recommended due to severe side effects. GnRH agonists have shown effectiveness in relieving endometriosis-associated pain, but may not be as effective as other treatments such as levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or oral danazol.\n\nThere was no significant difference between treatments after resumption of menstruation. Safety concerns for GnRH agonists include vaginal dryness, hot flushes, headaches, weight gain, and acne. Add-back therapy can prevent bone loss when used with GnRH agonists. Aromatase inhibitors can reduce endometriosis-associated pain but have side effects like vaginal dryness, hot flushes, and diminished bone mineral density. It is recommended to prescribe GnRH agonists as a second-line treatment and consider add-back therapy to prevent bone loss. GnRH antagonists can also be considered as a second-line treatment for endometriosis-associated pain. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination with other medications for treatment.\n\nSurgical treatment is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is superior to ablation in reducing symptoms. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of surgery for superficial peritoneal endometriosis.\n\nSurgical intervention for endometriosis, such as pelvic nerve pathway interruption and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma, has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and recurrence. However, these procedures come with risks and require careful consideration. For deep endometriosis involving the bowel, various surgical techniques have been used with promising results in improving quality of life and reducing symptoms. Standardization of reporting and further research is needed to guide treatment decisions.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that surgical removal of deep endometriosis can significantly improve pain and quality of life in women. The largest prospective case series reported reductions in pelvic pain, improved quality of life, and decreased analgesia use post-surgery. It is recommended that women with deep endometriosis are referred to a center of expertise and informed about potential risks and benefits of surgery. Different surgical approaches, such as discoid excision and segmental resection, have shown positive outcomes in improving pain and quality of life. It is important to consider the type of study, surgical technique, and outcome measurement when interpreting the literature on deep endometriosis surgery. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be performed in a center of expertise to minimize complications and maximize outcomes.\n\nThe reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed improvements in pain scores and symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder endometriosis and ureteral lesions was associated with significant improvement of pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy showed a reduction in urinary retention. Hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain may reduce the need for re-operation. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic markers for pain symptom improvement. Further research is needed in this area.\n\nEndometriosis surgical outcomes and quality of life improvements are studied in various research articles. Studies have looked at different surgical techniques and their impact on symptoms and quality of life for patients with endometriosis. Some research has focused on specific procedures, such as laparoscopic excision or ablation, while others have examined the long-term effects of surgery on pain, fertility, and recurrence rates. Overall, surgical management of endometriosis has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life for many patients.\n\nSurgical treatment of endometriosis: correlation between histological pattern and clinical outcomes. Various studies on surgical management of endometriosis and its impact on pain relief and quality of life. Recommendations for surgical treatment of endometriosis.\n\nII.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  \nThe effectiveness of medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy for endometriosis is discussed. The recommendation is to clearly distinguish between short-term and long-term hormone treatment after surgery. Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain if pregnancy is not desired. Further research is recommended to compare the risks and outcomes of laparoscopy and empirical treatment.\n\nII.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis  \nThe effectiveness of surgical versus medical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain is discussed. There is no conclusive evidence to recommend one over the other, and a shared decision-making approach is recommended considering individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. Research is recommended for randomized clinical trials to directly compare laparoscopy and empirical treatment.\n\nII.6. Non-medical management strategies  \nNon-medical management strategies, such as complementary and alternative medicine, self-management strategies, and self-help groups, are explored for women with endometriosis. The limited research supports the use of these strategies, and more studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Acupuncture is discussed as a complementary treatment, but there is insufficient high-quality evidence to recommend it for endometriosis patients. Additional research is recommended for non-medical management strategies for endometriosis-associated pain and quality of life.\n\nOne RCT showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life with verum acupuncture compared to 'sham' acupuncture in women with endometriosis. Japanese acupuncture was also found to be effective. Overall, acupuncture was safe and could be used as an adjunct therapy for pain relief in women with endometriosis.\n\nPhysiotherapy interventions for endometriosis lack significant literature, but pelvic floor exercises have shown effectiveness for urinary incontinence. Massage and trigger point release therapy have mixed results and may not be recommended for chronic pain.\n\nExercise, while beneficial for overall health, has not been well studied for endometriosis-related pain relief. While some studies show potential benefits, more research is needed to make firm recommendations.\n\nElectrotherapy studies have shown improvements in pain and quality of life, but caution is advised due to study design limitations and small sample sizes.\n\nPsychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and mindfulness-based programmes, have shown promise in reducing pain and improving quality of life in women with endometriosis. However, more research is needed to make conclusive recommendations.\n\nParticipants included up to 5 years after laparoscopic diagnosis, limiting the significance of found efficacy. No recommendations on psychological approaches for endometriosis pain and quality of life. Limited evidence on the impact of psychological interventions for endometriosis symptoms. Nutrition may affect symptoms, with limited studies on dietary interventions. Some studies suggest omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may help with pain. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy not well studied. Dietary changes may improve symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine studies are generally poorly constructed. No specific recommendations for nutrition or Chinese Medicine for endometriosis. Clinicians should discuss non-medical strategies for quality of life and psychological well-being in women with endometriosis. Further research is needed on non-medical interventions for endometriosis.\n\nWomen with endometriosis are confronted with endometriosis-associated pain, infertility, or both. The use of ovarian suppression therapy to improve fertility in women with endometriosis is ineffective and should not be prescribed. However, postsurgical medical therapy may increase pregnancy rates compared to surgery alone, but the evidence should be interpreted with caution. Other medical treatments such as anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors have uncertain effects on pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis.\n\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase their chance of natural pregnancy. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis improves fertility, it may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age, history of previous surgery, and ovarian reserve. Research is needed to evaluate the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis in improving natural pregnancy rates. Before and after surgery for endometriosis, individuals who wish to become pregnant should be counseled objectively on their chances of achieving a pregnancy. The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) can be used to predict non-ART pregnancy rates after surgery.\n\nThe Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their reproductive options post-surgery. It has been shown to reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or other fertility management options. It is recommended to use IUI with ovarian stimulation in women with stage I/II endometriosis to increase pregnancy rates. The efficacy of ART in women with endometriosis is uncertain, with some studies showing lower outcomes compared to women without endometriosis. Studies are needed to clarify the relevance of IUI with or without ovarian stimulation in women with endometriosis and to investigate the value of EFI in predicting the success of IUI.\n\nbe recommended. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous combined oral contraceptive/progestogens as a pre-treatment to ART to increase live birth rates. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medical therapies in improving outcomes for women with endometriosis undergoing ART.\n\nSurgery prior to ART for endometriosis-associated infertility may improve reproductive outcomes, but the evidence is limited and more data is needed. Clinicians are not recommended to routinely perform surgery for endometriosis prior to ART to improve live birth rates, as the potential benefits are unclear. Surgery for endometrioma prior to ART is not recommended to improve live birth rates, as it may have a negative impact on ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis prior to ART should be guided mainly by pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain.\n\nSymptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis may consider surgical removal of lesions. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis is discussed in detail. Non-medical interventions for infertility in endometriosis have unclear benefits. Fertility preservation in women with endometriosis should be discussed, but the true benefit remains unknown. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcomes is not well understood.\n\nEndometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show a range of changes, including decidual reaction and atrophy. Management may involve monitoring and expectant management or surgery if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy may not always benefit women with endometriosis, so continued evaluation and treatment postpartum is recommended. \n\nEndometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, and if atypical findings are seen on ultrasound, referral to a specialized center is advised. Complications from pre-existing endometriosis lesions during pregnancy are rare but may require surgical intervention. \n\nWomen with endometriosis may have an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in the first trimester. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms and consider closer monitoring. \n\nStudies have shown conflicting results regarding the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes in the second and third trimesters. Associations have been reported with gestational diabetes, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and placenta previa. \n\nOverall, complications related to pre-existing endometriosis lesions during pregnancy are rare but may require surgical management. Further research is needed to assess the impact of surgery on pregnancy outcomes in women with endometriosis.\n\nWomen with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth, caesarean section, and small for gestational age babies. Endometriosis does not seem to increase the risk of obstetric hemorrhages or postpartum hemorrhage. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks in pregnancy, but current evidence does not warrant increased monitoring or discourage pregnancy. Research is needed to better understand obstetric risks in women with endometriosis. Surgical techniques, such as ovarian cystectomy, may be beneficial in preventing recurrence of symptoms associated with endometriosis.\n\nCystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma in women, with a strong recommendation in favor of cystectomy. Hormone treatment post-surgery can prevent recurrence of endometriosis-associated symptoms. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptives are recommended for at least 18-24 months post-surgery. ART in women with deep endometriosis does not increase recurrence. Consider long-term hormone treatment for prevention of deep endometriosis recurrence and associated symptoms. The choice of treatment should consider patient preferences, costs, availability, risks, and side effects. Further information is available in Annex 7 and Annex 8.\n\nIV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis: \nMedical treatment options for recurrent endometriosis after surgery include dienogest, depot leuprolide acetate, desogestrel, OCP, cyproterone acetate, and nafarelin. These treatments have shown efficacy in reducing symptoms such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and endometrioma size. Surgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis is less studied, but one small study reported recurrence of symptoms in a percentage of women after surgery. It is important to consider all available hormone and surgical treatment options for managing recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. \n\nV. Endometriosis and adolescence: \nDiagnosing endometriosis in adolescents can be challenging due to a lack of awareness among medical professionals and caregivers. Risk factors for adolescent endometriosis include a positive family history, genital malformations, early menarche, and short menstrual cycles. Clinicians should take a careful history to identify possible risk factors and consider endometriosis in young women presenting with symptoms such as cyclical absent.\n\nIn adolescents, a careful history should be taken to consider symptoms suggestive of endometriosis, such as chronic pelvic pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, and other associated symptoms. Diagnosis in adolescents may differ from adults, with a more varied clinical presentation. Imaging with transvaginal ultrasound can be effective, and diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered if other treatments are unsuccessful. Histological confirmation through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis, although negative histology does not rule out the disease entirely.\n\nIn adolescents with endometriosis, hormonal contraceptives or progestogens are recommended as first-line treatment for pain relief. NSAIDs can be considered as an additional option. GnRH agonists may be used as a second-line treatment if initial hormone therapy fails, but careful consideration of potential side effects is necessary. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be considered for symptom management, but recurrence rates should be taken into account. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended by experienced surgeons. Combination therapy with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery may also be effective in reducing recurrence.\n\nEndometriosis symptoms may persist after menopause, with a prevalence estimated at 2-5%. Hormone therapy may stimulate endometriosis growth, but it can also occur in women not using hormone therapy. Clinicians should be aware that endometriosis can still be active after menopause. Surgical treatment is recommended as first-line for postmenopausal women with endometriosis.\n\nIn postmenopausal women with endometriosis, surgical treatment has been shown to alleviate pain and improve symptoms. Consideration of malignancy is important, with some studies showing a risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors may be a medical alternative to surgery for treating endometriosis in postmenopausal women. More research is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors in this population. Hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis is not well studied, but may be effective in reducing symptoms. The risk of recurrence of endometriosis with hormone therapy is small but present, and continuous combined estrogen-progestogen therapy may be preferred to limit proliferation of endometriosis tissue. Tibolone could be a safe alternative for combined hormone therapy.\n\nAbdominal wall endometriosis is associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI. Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms with a cyclical pattern.\n\nCatamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. In a review of 490 cases, pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in 89% of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis when possible. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis. In cases of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.\n\nWomen with incidental finding of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment, as there is low risk of progression to symptomatic disease. Surgical treatment is not recommended due to associated risks, and medical treatment is not advised without evidence of disease progression. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about the incidental finding, but surgical excision or ablation is not recommended. Monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered, but the benefits are uncertain. Primary prevention of endometriosis can involve aiming for a healthy lifestyle and diet, with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity, but the usefulness of hormonal contraceptives for prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk should only be done in a research setting.\n\nEndometriosis shares features with cancer but is not significantly associated with increased overall cancer risk. Specific risks include higher risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer, but the absolute increase in risk is low. Clinicians should reassure patients about their cancer risk and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with OCP potentially reducing ovarian and endometrial cancer risk but increasing breast and cervical cancer risk. More research is needed on the impact of hormone treatments on cancer risk.\n\nAmong women with endometriosis, hormonal treatments have no appreciable impact on ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy could be performed but has shown no benefit in early detection or mortality reduction. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is not recommended for women with endometriosis without further risk factors for ovarian cancer. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis to guide monitoring needs.\n\nSome authors suggest earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete removal of endometriosis to reduce the future risk of ovarian cancer. A study in Sweden found that women who had undergone surgery for endometriosis had a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, especially those who had unilateral oophorectomy. Surgical treatment like tubal ligation or hysterectomy was not significantly associated with the risk of ovarian cancer. Clinicians should consider the potential benefits of complete excision of visible endometriosis to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, weighing them against the risks of surgery.\n\nPrevention of endometriosis  \nEndometriosis and cancer  \nDeclarations of interest  \nConflicts of Interest  \nAbbreviations  \nKey Questions  \nMethodology\n\nIn the justification section, more data are provided on the interpretation of the supporting evidence and how other factors were considered.

      "FIGO GUIDELINES\nFIGO consensus guidelines on intrapartum fetal monitoring: Cardiotocography\n1. Introduction\nCTG monitoring should never be regarded as a substitute for good clinical observation and judgement, or as an excuse for leaving the mother unattended during labor.\n2. Indications\nContinuous CTG monitoring should be considered in all situations where there is a high risk of fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG is also recommended when abnormalities are detected during intermittent fetal auscultation. The routine use of admission CTG for low-risk women on entrance to the labor ward has been associated with an increase in cesarean delivery rates and no improvement in perinatal outcomes.\n3. Tracing acquisition\nMaternal supine recumbent position should be avoided for prolonged monitoring. CTG acquisition can be performed by portable sensors that transmit signals wirelessly to a remote fetal monitor. External FHR monitoring is the recommended initial method for routine intrapartum monitoring. Simultaneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate can be useful in specific maternal health conditions.\n4. Analysis of tracings\nCTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions) followed by overall CTG classification.\n\nAcute fetal hypoxemia can result in tachycardia. Bradycardia is defined as a baseline value below 110 bpm lasting more than 10 minutes. Variability in fetal heart rate signal is important, with reduced variability indicating potential issues. Accelerations in fetal heart rate above the baseline are a sign of a neurologically responsive fetus. Decelerations below the baseline can indicate fetal hypoxia. Sinusoidal patterns may indicate severe fetal anemia. Clinical decisions should integrate CTG analysis with other clinical information. Action in cases of suspected fetal hypoxia may involve identifying and reversing underlying causes.\n\nManagement of fetal hypoxia/acidosis during labor requires careful assessment and intervention. Oxygen administration and intravenous fluids may not be effective in improving fetal oxygenation. Clinical judgment is needed to diagnose and address underlying causes of abnormal CTG patterns. Prompt action should be taken to avoid prolonged fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Limitations of cardiotocography include observer disagreement and the inability to accurately predict hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG monitoring may not significantly improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary interventions. Clinical guidelines should be simple and objective for proper use of technology. Regular training of labor ward staff is essential for safe monitoring.\n\net Gynaecol Res 2007;33(3):266 –73.\nAbnormal uterine action during labour.

      "RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49\nPREVENTING ENTRY-RELATED GYNAECOLOGICAL LAPAROSCOPIC INJURIES\nApproximately 250,000 women undergo laparoscopic surgery in the UK each year, with serious complications occurring in about one in 1000 cases. This guideline aims to reduce complications related to laparoscopic entry techniques. Bowel damage associated with laparoscopic surgery may not be immediately recognized, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques, and the primary trocar should be inserted in a controlled manner at 90 degrees to the skin. The Veress needle or open (Hasson) approach can be used for entry, with no significant safety advantage to either technique. Direct trocar insertion is an acceptable alternative method, and there are devices available to minimize risks during trocar insertion. Surgeons should be aware of the risks and complications associated with laparoscopy and counsel patients accordingly. Women should be informed of the risks and potential complications, including injury to the bowel, urinary tract, major blood vessels, and later complications associated with entry ports. Surgeons should ensure appropriate training, supervision, and experience in laparoscopic surgery. Intra-abdominal pressure should be maintained at 20-25 mmHg before inserting the trocar. Alternative entry techniques, such as direct trocar insertion or alternative devices, can also be considered.\n\nAlternative sites for primary trocar or Veress needle insertion include Palmer's point, especially in cases of previous surgery or splenomegaly. Adhesion formation at the umbilicus may make it an inappropriate site for insertion after abdominal surgery. Secondary ports should be inserted under direct vision perpendicular to the skin, ensuring pneumoperitoneum at 20-25 mmHg. In obese women, the open (Hasson) technique or entry at Palmer's point is recommended. For very thin women, the Hasson technique or insertion at Palmer's point is preferred. Special care is needed for entry in young, thin, nulliparous women with well-developed abdominal musculature. Documentation of appropriate counseling and reporting of adverse events or complications are essential auditable standards.\n\nGuidelines and Audit lead reviewers were: Dr DE Parkin FRCOG, Aberdeen, Scotland; Mr MC Slack FRCOG, Cambridge; and Mr P Hilton FRCOG, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.\nThe final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines and Audit Committee of the RCOGRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 10 of 10Grades of recommendations\nRequires at least one randomised controlled trial as part of a body of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation.

      "The prevention of malaria in pregnancy\n1. Purpose and scope\nThe aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based information about the prevention of malaria in pregnancy for UK-based residents visiting malaria endemic areas. This guideline covers malaria prevention recommendations for women planning a pregnancy and those already pregnant or breastfeeding.\n2. Background\nMalaria can be life-threatening and is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. The species of malaria can determine the pattern of the disease. The majority of imported malaria cases in the UK are caused by P. falciparum. Pregnant women are at increased risk of malaria complications.\n4. Medical complications of malaria in pregnancy\nMalaria infection in pregnancy can result in maternal mortality, pregnancy loss, reduced birth weight, and other complications. Pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting and dying from malaria compared to non-pregnant individuals.\n5. Prevention of malaria infection in pregnancy\nPregnant women should consider postponing travel to malaria endemic areas if possible. If travel is unavoidable, they should seek guidance on malaria risks and prevention strategies. Awareness of risk, bite prevention, chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are important in preventing malaria. Pregnant women should be educated on malaria prevention measures and provided with written information. The risk of contracting malaria varies depending on the destination.\n5.4. Chemoprophylaxis for pregnant or breastfeeding women\nMefloquine is recommended for prophylaxis in the second and third trimesters in chloroquine-resistant areas. Pregnant women should be cautious about drug choices and seek advice from specialists if needed. Atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are also options for prophylaxis in certain areas. Waiting times before becoming pregnant after taking prophylactic drugs should be considered to avoid potential adverse effects.\n\nIn pregnancy, chloroquine and proguanil are safe but not effective in areas of chloroquine resistance. Mefloquine can be considered if necessary, and atovaquone and proguanil can be used in consultation with a specialist. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Emergency standby treatment instructions should be given to pregnant travelers for suspected malaria without access to medical care. Quinine and clindamycin are recommended treatments for pregnant women. Standby treatment should be started if malaria is suspected with a fever, and medical treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Quinine, Co-artem, or atovaquone-proguanil can be used as standby emergency treatment.\n\nGambian multigravidae.

      "The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based information on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy is detrimental to the woman and her fetus, with risks of adverse effects outweighing those of treatment. Prompt treatment with appropriate antimalarials is crucial, with intravenous artesunate recommended for severe falciparum malaria. Pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria should be admitted to the hospital, while those with severe and complicated malaria should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Seek advice from infectious diseases specialists for severe and recurrent cases. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with death from severe malaria. Physicians should prescribe treatment, and hospitalization is advisable for pregnant women with P. falciparum.\n\nBlood films are monitored every 24 hours, with clinical deterioration indicating a repeat. Severe or complicated malaria requires IV artesunate or quinine. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated with oral quinine or Riamet®. For preventing relapse during or after pregnancy, chloroquine or primaquine is recommended. Recurrent malaria in pregnancy may require alternative treatments. Severe malaria in pregnancy is a medical emergency, requiring monitoring for hypoglycaemia and pulmonary oedema. Obstetric management includes monitoring for preterm labor and fetal growth restriction, with prompt antimalarial treatment to prevent adverse effects on the fetus. Vertical transmission risk should be discussed with women. Monitoring for fetal distress and appropriate treatment are essential in severe malaria cases.\n\nIn women with severe malaria, obstetric advice should be sought at an early stage. Fetal distress is common and has been related to malaria fever. Standard obstetric principles apply, and instrumental birth may be necessary in the presence of maternal or fetal distress. Acute malaria can cause thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Maternal malaria close to delivery can result in congenital malaria, which may present in the first weeks to months of life. Reporting of malaria in pregnancy in the UK is mandatory.\n\nRamshesh P , et al.

Am J Med\n1982;73:564–72.\n\nSummary:\n- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy is crucial to prevent mortality\n- Symptoms of malaria include flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise\n- Urgent investigations include thick and thin blood films, malaria rapid antigen tests, and other tests\n- Treatment for non-falciparum malaria is chloroquine, for falciparum malaria admit to hospital and use IV artesunate or quinine\n- Regular monitoring and management of malaria in pregnancy is essential\n- Severe malaria in pregnancy should be treated with IV artesunate if available, otherwise use IV quinine\n- Quinine monotherapy is not recommended for uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy, use quinine with clindamycin\n- Clindamycin is slow-acting and may not add value to IV artesunate\n- Treatment should not be delayed, seek expert consultation for IV artesunate if needed\n- IV artesunate is not currently licensed in the UK but can be obtained from specialist centers or Idis Pharma if needed.\n\nClindamycin should not be used in pregnancy. Patients may deteriorate under treatment, at which point, management should be upgraded to account for severity. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters, ahead of quinine and clindamycin. Atovaquone-proguanil alone and atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate were safe and efficacious for uncomplicated P. falciprum in the second and third trimesters. Artemether-lumefantrine treatment in pregnancy showed disappointing efficacy. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is not recommended in pregnancy. Weekly chloroquine can be given to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale before delivery. Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax should be treated similarly to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs are often reduced in late pregnancy, leading to under-dosing.\n\nThe persistence of Plasmodium falciparum in the placenta after apparently adequate therapy with quinine has been described. This phenomenon is described in the placenta of a 19-year-old woman with falciparum malaria, who was treated with a combination of quinidine and clindamycin. Although this therapy was effective and diminished her peripheral blood parasitemia, vast numbers of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were present in the maternal sinusoids of the placenta. This sequestration of infected erythrocytes produced a local parasitemia in the placenta. Additionally, rare Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes were also seen in the fetal blood of the placenta. Malaria in pregnancy and parasitic involvement of the placenta are reviewed, emphasizing that Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes may persist in the placenta even after clearance of parasites from the peripheral blood.",
      "Antepartum Haemorrhage\nAntepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. The most important causes of APH are placenta praevia and placental abruption. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Up to one-fifth of very preterm babies are born in association with APH, and the known association of APH with cerebral palsy can be explained by preterm delivery. Recurrent APH is the term used when there are episodes of APH on more than one occasion. It is important to assess for signs of clinical shock when estimating blood loss, as the amount of blood lost is often underestimated. Spotting, minor haemorrhage, major haemorrhage, and massive haemorrhage are defined based on the amount of blood loss. Antepartum haemorrhage is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pregnancies complicated by unexplained APH are also at increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Women with repeated presentations that may include APH should be asked about domestic violence. Women with APH should report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider and be managed in a hospital maternity unit with facilities for resuscitation and emergency operative delivery.\n\nClinical assessment in women presenting with APH is crucial to establish the need for urgent intervention to manage maternal or fetal compromise. Triage includes history-taking, assessment of vaginal bleeding, maternal cardiovascular condition, and fetal wellbeing. If major haemorrhage persists or the woman is unable to provide a history, immediate maternal stabilization is priority. A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of APH, such as placental abruption or placenta praevia. Abdominal palpation and speculum examination can aid in identifying the cause of bleeding. Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH. Fetal investigations, including fetal heart rate assessment and ultrasound scans, are important to monitor fetal wellbeing. Hospitalization is recommended for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding. Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth. Tocolytic therapy should not be used in cases of major APH or placental abruption. Antenatal care should be altered following APH, with increased fetal surveillance for high-risk pregnancies. Delivery should be determined based on maternal and fetal condition, with immediate delivery required for compromised cases.\n\nIn women with antepartum hemorrhage (APH) due to placenta praevia, management includes maternal resuscitation and delivery of the fetus to control bleeding. Delivery is usually by caesarean section in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. For women with APH before 37 weeks of gestation without compromise, elective premature delivery is not recommended. In cases after 37 weeks, induction of labor may be considered. Fetal monitoring during labor should be continuous for active bleeding or if there are concerns of placental insufficiency. Regional anesthesia is recommended for operative delivery in cases of APH, unless contraindicated. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated and active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH. Massive APH should be managed following multidisciplinary protocols, and blood products should be ordered as needed. Women with coagulopathy should receive appropriate transfusions. Neonates should be assessed by a senior pediatrician/neonatologist in cases of major APH. In cases of extremely preterm pregnancy with APH, maternal stabilization is the priority before considering delivery of the baby. Postnatal issues include thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, and clinical incident reporting. Obstetric skill drills should include management of major APH to improve patient safety.\n\nteamworking and ensure prompt and efficient management in such an emergency.\nSuggested audit topics:\n1. The administration of corticosteroids to women presenting with APH less than 34+6weeks of gestation.\n2. Administration of anti-D Ig to non-sensitised RhD-negative women presenting with APH.\n3. Percentage of women with APH referred for serial growth scans.\n4. Management of the third stage of labour in women who had a major APH.\n5. Appropriate training of the multidisciplinary team.\n\nAreas for future research:\n1. Randomised controlled trials of interventions to prevent placental abruption.\n2. Studies to determine the optimum timing of delivery in women presenting with unexplained APH.\n3.

      "Pregnancy and Breast Cancer Green–top Guideline No. 12 March 2011\n\n1. Purpose and scope: This document provides clinical guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer.\n\n2. Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females, with a lifetime risk of one in nine in the UK. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer occurs in younger women and may have an inferior prognosis. Treatment should be in a multidisciplinary team.\n\n4. What is the optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: Prognosis for women diagnosed during pregnancy is not worsened compared to non-pregnant controls. Diagnosis may be difficult, and treatment should be based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage.\n\n5. Contraceptive choices for women wishing to avoid pregnancy after treatment of breast cancer: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods are recommended. Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer.\n\n6. What advice should be given to women planning pregnancy following breast cancer: Women planning pregnancy after treatment should consult their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon, and obstetrician. Long-term survival after breast cancer is not adversely affected by pregnancy.\n\nSeveral studies show better survival outcome in women who conceive after treatment for breast cancer. In the largest series, women who had a full-term pregnancy had a relative risk of death. The impact of pregnancy does not seem to be modified by tumor characteristics, but there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy. Advice on postponement of pregnancy should be individualized based on treatment needs and prognosis over time. Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception. Women with estrogen receptor-positive diseases should be advised on the recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment. The majority of pregnancies after breast cancer proceed to live birth. Women can be reassured concerning the risk of malformation in children conceived after treatment. Pregnancy following breast cancer should be jointly supervised by the obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon. Echocardiography should be performed during pregnancy in women at risk to detect cardiomyopathy. A slightly increased risk of delivery complications and caesarean section has been reported in breast cancer survivors. Women can breastfeed from the unaffected breast and there is no evidence that breastfeeding increases the risk of recurrence. The effect of breast cancer treatment on fertility should be discussed with all women of reproductive age diagnosed with breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea with complete loss of germ cells. The effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy on fertility should also be considered. Women are generally advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years after treatment, but age is a major determinant of fertility. Fertility preservation options should be discussed with women before treatment, including the use of GnRH analogues and cryopreservation. Every breast oncology service should have a designated pathway for prompt referral to a fertility specialist able to offer assisted conception.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends universal access to sperm, egg, and embryo storage for individuals undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. However, NHS funding is not available in all areas, and the oncology referral pathway may not align with local IVF arrangements. Assisted reproduction after breast cancer treatment is limited due to loss of ovarian reserve, but options such as donated eggs and surrogacy can be considered. Women may need hormone replacement therapy for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause.\n\nReproductive concerns for young women with breast cancer are important to address. Fertility preservation options, such as GnRH agonist cotreatment and cryopreservation, can help protect ovarian function. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea and its impact on fertility should be considered in treatment planning. It is recommended to discuss fertility preservation options with patients before starting treatment.",
      "The Initial Management of Chronic Pelvic Pain \nThis guideline provides an evidence-based summary for appropriate investigation and management of women with chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain can significantly impact a woman's ability to function and may have multiple contributing factors. Pain is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and may be influenced by physical, psychological, and social factors. The initial assessment aims to identify factors contributing to the pain and develop a management plan. Adequate time should be allowed for the initial assessment, and a partnership between the clinician and the woman should be established to plan a management program. Referral to a specialist may be considered if the pain is not adequately controlled. The history should include questions about the pattern of pain, association with other symptoms, and the effect of movement and posture on the pain. Red flag symptoms should be noted for further investigation. Additionally, asking about past or present sexual assault may be helpful. Completing a daily pain diary may help identify provoking factors or associations.\n\nEstablishing the woman's level of function at the start of treatment is important for monitoring progress and setting functional goals. Symptom-based diagnostic criteria can confidently diagnose IBS. Referral to relevant healthcare professionals should be considered if a non-gynaecological component to the pain is suspected. Examination should include abdominal and pelvic examination. Screening for infection, particularly STIs, should be offered to sexually active women with chronic pelvic pain. TVS and MRI are useful for identifying structural abnormalities. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered as a second-line investigation. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatment for cyclical pain and antispasmodics for IBS. Other treatments such as analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications may also be beneficial. Self-management techniques and support from organizations can be valuable for patients. Chronic pelvic pain should be seen as a symptom with multiple contributing factors, and a comprehensive management plan should be developed in partnership with the woman.\n\nGastroenterol 2009;23:593–610.

      "Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia\nRisk factors for endometrial hyperplasia should be identified and monitored. The WHO classification should be used for classification. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens are effective in managing hyperplasia without atypia, with LNG-IUS being the first-line treatment. Treatment should last at least 6 months with follow-up biopsies. Surgical management may be considered in certain cases. Atypical hyperplasia should be managed with total hysterectomy. Women wishing to preserve fertility should be counseled about risks. HRT should be used cautiously. Women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer should be monitored for hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to a polyp should be managed with complete removal. Regular surveillance is recommended. Management in women wishing to conceive should focus on achieving disease regression before attempting conception.\n\nThe 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia. Diagnosis requires histological examination. Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy may be necessary for further assessment. CT or MRI are not routinely recommended. Biomarkers have not been found to be clinically useful. Management of hyperplasia without atypia includes addressing reversible risk factors and considering progestogen treatment if regression does not occur. Weight loss and hormone therapy should be reviewed. Anovulatory cycles may regress with ovulation. Progestogen treatment may reduce the risk of progression to cancer. More evidence is needed to determine the appropriate management approach.\n\nMany women with endometrial hyperplasia may require treatment due to the risk of progression to cancer. The first-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens. Treatment should last for a minimum of 6 months to induce regression. Endometrial surveillance should be done every 6 months, with at least two consecutive negative biopsies before discharge. Surgical management, such as hysterectomy, should be considered if there is no regression after 12 months of treatment or if there is relapse. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred. Endometrial ablation is not recommended. Annual endometrial biopsies can be considered for high-risk women. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be based on individual factors and patient preferences.\n\nEndometrial ablation is not recommended for atypical hyperplasia, as complete endometrial destruction cannot be guaranteed, and there is a risk of tissue regeneration. Total hysterectomy is advised for women with atypical hyperplasia to reduce the risk of underlying malignancy or cancer progression. In cases where fertility preservation is desired or surgery is not suitable, first-line treatment with LNG-IUS is recommended, with oral progestogens as an alternative. Women should be counselled about the risks of fertility-sparing therapy, including the potential for cancer progression. Follow-up for women not undergoing hysterectomy should include routine endometrial surveillance with biopsies every 3 months until negative results are obtained. Women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to conceive should achieve disease regression before attempting to conceive and may consider assisted reproduction for higher live birth rates and to prevent relapse. It is important to monitor disease regression and consider referral to a fertility specialist for further assessment and treatment options.\n\n- A small trial showed that LNG-IUS treatment was more effective than observation alone in regressing simple hyperplasia and improving pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.\n- Hysterectomy is recommended for women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia once fertility is no longer required.\n- Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in women with a uterus.\n- Women with endometrial hyperplasia on HRT should consider switching to continuous progestogen intake using LNG-IUS or continuous combined HRT.\n- Tamoxifen users should be aware of the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\n- Aromatase inhibitors do not increase the risk of endometrial pathology or vaginal bleeding.\n- LNG-IUS may reduce the incidence of endometrial polyps and hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen.\n- Women with endometrial hyperplasia while on tamoxifen should reassess the need for tamoxifen with their oncologist.\n- Complete removal of endometrial polyps is recommended for management.\n- Recommendations for future research include evaluating the role of biomarkers in diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia and studying the effect of weight loss on regression of the condition.\n- Auditable topics include advising weight loss for obese women with endometrial hyperplasia and ensuring appropriate follow-up biopsies.\n- Useful links and support groups for endometrial hyperplasia.\n\nAccuracy of outpatient endometrial biopsy in the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia.

      "Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth\nRecommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS to facilitate counselling and decision-making. Planned VBAC is suitable for most women with a singleton pregnancy and previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with complicated uterine scars should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Labour for women with two or more prior caesareans should be in a center with expertise and immediate surgical delivery. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery increasing the likelihood of success. VBAC should be conducted in a well-equipped delivery suite with continuous monitoring. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be performed after 39+0 weeks of gestation, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis administered. VBAC may not be suitable in certain circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, or antepartum stillbirth. Overall, planned VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery.\n\nWomen with two or more prior caesarean deliveries may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Labour should be conducted in a centre with suitable expertise and recourse to immediate surgical delivery. A multivariate analysis showed no significant difference in uterine rupture rates between VBAC with two or more previous caesarean births compared to a single prior caesarean birth. Women considering VBAC should be counselled about success rates, uterine rupture rates, and maternal morbidity. Antenatal counselling should consider factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture, such as short inter-delivery interval, maternal age, obesity, and myometrial thickness. VBAC success rates with two previous caesarean births are similar to those with a single prior caesarean birth. Women seeking multiple future pregnancies should be counselled about the risks associated with repeated caesarean deliveries and the benefits of attempting VBAC. Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of planned VBAC versus ERCS from 39+0 weeks of gestation, including the risks of uterine rupture, perinatal death, and maternal and fetal outcomes. VBAC has a lower risk of adverse outcomes compared to ERCS, but both options have associated risks. Women should be provided with a patient information leaflet and the decision for mode of birth should be agreed upon before the expected delivery date.\n\nThe NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase for serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared with ERCS. A review of outcomes suggests a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Factors such as maternal height, age, BMI, gestation, and birthweight also influence VBAC success. Induction and augmentation of labour in VBAC are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be administered, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Practice guidelines for ERCS are provided in the NICE caesarean section guideline.\n\nWomen considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables around a 5% reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, but may be associated with a 5 per 10,000 increase in the risk of antepartum stillbirth. Consideration should be given to administering maternal corticosteroids if ERCS is performed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics achieve a greater reduction in the risk of maternal infection than prophylactic antibiotics administered after making the skin incision. The choice of method of thromboprophylaxis should be as per RCOG guidance. Women in special circumstances, such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more, should be approached cautiously when considering VBAC. The NICE induction of labor guideline recommends induction of labor from 41+0 weeks to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates for preterm and term pregnancies are similar, but the rates of uterine rupture and dehiscence are significantly lower in preterm compared with term VBAC. Future research should focus on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC or uterine rupture using ultrasound, investigating the etiology and prevention of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery, and factors impacting the uptake of VBAC.\n\nThis clinical guideline provides information on various factors affecting pregnancy outcomes, including uterine rupture, mode of delivery after previous cesarean section, and risks associated with different delivery methods. It also discusses the use of decision aids for pregnant women and the impact of previous cesarean deliveries on subsequent pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of patient preferences and personalized decision-making in childbirth.\n\nIncidence of neonatal respiratory distress after elective caesarean section: pragmatic randomised trial.

      "Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics\nGreen-top Guideline No. 47 \nMay 2015\nRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\nExecutive summary of recommendations \nHow can the risk of transfusion be reduced?\nOptimisation of haemoglobin in the antenatal period\nDiagnosis\nAnaemia in pregnancy is defined as first trimester haemoglobin (Hb) less than 110 g/l, second/third \ntrimester Hb less than 105 g/l, and postpartum Hb less than 100 g/l, in line with British Committee \nfor Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidance.\nFor normocytic or microcytic anaemia, a trial of oral iron should be considered as the first step and \nfurther tests should be undertaken if there is no demonstrable rise in Hb at 2 weeks and compliance \nhas been checked.\nPregnant women should be offered screening for anaemia at booking and at 28 weeks. Women \nwith multiple pregnancies should have an additional full blood count done at 20–24 weeks.\nOral iron should be the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency.\nParenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed or patient compliance is in \ndoubt or if the woman is approaching term and there is insufficient time for oral supplementation \nto be effective.\nWomen should receive information on improvement of dietary iron intake and factors affecting \nabsorption of dietary iron.\nThe role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for non-end-stage renal anaemia is still \nto be established and it should only be used in the context of a controlled clinical trial or on the \nexpert advice of the haematologist.\nActive management of the third stage of labour is recommended to minimise blood loss.\nWomen at high risk of haemorrhage should be advised to deliver in hospital.\nGeneral principles of blood transfusion\nConsent for blood transfusion\nValid consent should be obtained where possible prior to administering a blood transfusion.\nIn an emergency, where it is not feasible to get consent, information on blood transfusion should \nbe provided retrospectively.\nThe reason for transfusion and a note of the consent discussion should be documented in the \npatient’s case notes.\nRequirements for group and screen samples and cross-matching \nAll women should have their blood group and antibody status checked at booking and at 28 weeks \nof gestation.\nGroup and screen samples used for provision of blood in pregnancy should be less than 3 days old.\nIn a woman at high risk of emergency transfusion, e.g. placenta praevia, and with no clinically \nsignificant alloantibodies, group and screen samples should be sent once a week to exclude or \nidentify any new antibody formation and to keep blood available if necessary. Close liaison with \nthe hospital transfusion laboratory is essential.\nWomen should have a group and screen sample taken in line with clear locally agreed protocols \nfor provision of blood.\nBlood product specification in pregnancy and the puerperium  \nABO-, rhesus D- (RhD-) and K- (Kell-) compatible red cell units should be transfused.\nIf clinically significant red cell antibodies are present, then blood negative for the relevant antigen \nshould be cross-matched before transfusion; close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is \nessential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.\nCytomegalovirus- (CMV-) seronegative red cell and platelet components should be provided for \nelective transfusions during pregnancy.\nWhat are the strategies to minimise the use of banked blood?\nIs there a role for preoperative/predelivery autologous blood deposit?\nPredelivery autologous blood deposit is not recommended.\nIs there a role for intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS)?\nCell salvage is recommended for patients where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to \ninduce anaemia or expected to exceed 20% of estimated blood volume.\nConsent should be obtained for IOCS where possible and its use in obstetric patients should be \nsubject to audit and monitoring.\nCell salvage should only be performed by multidisciplinary teams who develop regular experience \nof IOCS.\nWhere IOCS is used during caesarean section in RhD-negative, previously nonsensitised women \nand where cord blood group is confirmed as RhD positive (or unknown), a minimum dose of 1500 iu \nanti-D immunoglobulin should be administered following the reinfusion of salvaged red cells.\nA maternal blood sample should be taken for estimation of fetomaternal haemorrhage 30–40 \nminutes after reinfusion in case more anti-D is indicated.\nManagement of obstetric haemorrhage with blood components\nThere should be a clear local\n\nIron absorption from food is influenced by vitamin C, tea, and coffee. rHuEPO is mainly used for end-stage renal disease, but can also be used in pregnancy. Active management of the third stage of labor reduces postpartum blood loss. Women at high risk of hemorrhage should deliver in units with immediate access to care. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained whenever possible. Group and screen samples should be taken regularly for pregnant women. Cell salvage is recommended for patients with significant blood loss. Mechanical strategies can be used to reduce postpartum blood loss. Red cell transfusion should be based on clinical and hematological grounds. FFP should be given during major obstetric hemorrhage. Close monitoring of clotting tests is necessary for subsequent FFP transfusion.\n\n- Regular full blood counts and coagulation screens should be performed during a bleeding episode.\n- Cryoprecipitate should be administered early in major obstetric hemorrhage and subsequent transfusion guided by fibrinogen levels.\n- FFP and cryoprecipitate should ideally be of the same blood group as the recipient.\n- No anti-D prophylaxis is required if a RhD-negative woman receives RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate.\n- Platelet count should be maintained above 50 x 10^9/l in acutely bleeding patients.\n- Platelets should ideally be group compatible.\n- Tranexamic acid may be considered during major obstetric hemorrhage.\n- Blood transfusions should be based on careful clinical assessment in conjunction with Hb levels.\n- Iron deficiency should be recognized and treated promptly to reduce the need for blood transfusions.\n- Women declining blood products should have their Hb optimized before delivery and a multidisciplinary plan in place.\n\nPBM involves an approach to avoid unnecessary transfusion by optimizing preoperative/predelivery Hb, avoiding overtransfusion, using cell salvage where appropriate, accepting evidence-based lower transfusion triggers, and using iron supplements. Evidence supports the use of autologous blood from IOCS to decrease the requirement for allogeneic transfusion. Current evidence supports the use of IOCS in obstetrics. Recommendations for future research include defining coagulation abnormalities during major obstetric hemorrhage and investigating the role of point of care testing in the diagnosis and management of obstetric hemorrhage. Auditable topics include standards for audit of documentation and practice related to obstetric hemorrhage.\n\nRecommendations for the management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma, pre-anaesthetic assessment of coagulation abnormalities in obstetric patients, and the decrease of fibrinogen as an early predictor of postpartum hemorrhage are clinically significant. The use of recombinant activated factor VII in obstetric hemorrhage, the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss after cesarean section, and the use of intravenous iron sucrose versus oral iron ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy are also important considerations. Good practice points and recommended best practices are included in the guidelines for the surgical management of Jehovah's Witnesses and the management of anesthesia for Jehovah's Witnesses.",
      "Chickenpox in Pregnancy\nThis guideline addresses varicella prevention and management in pregnant women. It recommends considering varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy. Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles. If exposed, a blood test for VZV immunity should be done. Treatment with VZIG is recommended if non-immune and exposed. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their doctor immediately and may be prescribed aciclovir. Hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Risks to the fetus and newborn are also discussed, with recommendations for care and follow-up. Delivery should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. Varicella vaccination is considered cost-effective for susceptible women. Routine screening for VZV immunity is not recommended in the UK. Contact with chickenpox or shingles should be carefully assessed, and VZIG may be offered if non-immune and exposed. Awareness of VZV infection risks and prevention strategies is crucial in managing chickenpox in pregnancy.\n\nPregnant women with shingles or chickenpox should notify their doctor early if a rash develops. Isolation is recommended for pregnant women with chickenpox. VZIG may be needed for further exposure to chickenpox. Chickenpox is infectious before and during the rash, ceasing when lesions crust over. Susceptibility to varicella infection should be determined through history or serology. VZIG should be offered to non-immune pregnant women with significant exposure to chickenpox. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their GP and avoid contact with others until lesions crust over. Aciclovir may be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox. Hospital assessment is recommended for severe chickenpox cases. Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. The risks of varicella infection to the fetus include FVS, which can be diagnosed prenatally through ultrasound. Amniocentesis may be considered for detecting varicella DNA in the fetus.\n\nAmniotic fluid PCR for VZV DNA has high sensitivity but low specificity for FVS. Ultrasound abnormalities may not always detect FVS. Neonatal risks of varicella infection in pregnancy can be prevented by delaying delivery after maternal rash onset. Varicella infection in newborns can result from maternal infection near delivery. Prophylaxis with VZIG is vital for newborns exposed to chickenpox around delivery. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox. Future research recommendations include randomized trials for screening and treatment. Auditable topics include referrals to specialists for pregnant women with chickenpox and informing neonatologists of affected births.

Reported complications include haemorrhage, urinary retention, genital swelling, infection, fever, scarring, urinary tract symptoms, dyspareunia, bacterial vaginosis, genital scarring, urinary tract complications, damage to the urethra, dyspareunia, sexual consequences, psychological effects, menstrual difficulties, genital infection, infertility, HIV and hepatitis B infection, and obstetric complications. Health professionals must understand the legal responsibilities regarding FGM in the UK, including mandatory reporting of FGM in girls under 18 years. FGM is illegal in the UK and health professionals must be familiar with the requirements of the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset. Reporting and recording guidelines are provided for health professionals.\n\nWomen with FGM should be assessed during pregnancy and appropriate care provided, including referral to designated consultants and midwives. Healthcare professionals should be trained in FGM management and ensure safe and sensitive care. De-infibulation may be necessary for women with FGM, and should be offered before pregnancy if possible. Postnatal care should include follow-up for women who did not undergo de-infibulation during delivery.\n\nWomen with FGM should be offered de-infibulation before pregnancy. Discharging midwives should ensure legal processes are followed before discharge. A postnatal debrief may be considered for education on FGM. Future research should focus on stillbirth rates and the role of de-infibulation. Auditable topics include healthcare worker training and referrals for FGM patients. Useful links and support groups are available for further information.\n\nAdditional management in pregnant women:\n- Refer to designated consultant obstetrician or specialist midwife with responsibility for women with FGM.\n- Local protocols will determine which elements of care should be undertaken by the designated midwife or obstetrician.\n- Make an individual risk assessment using an FGM safeguarding risk assessment tool.\n- Offer screening for hepatitis C in addition to routine screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis.\n- Manage as high obstetric risk.\n- Document maternal history of FGM in the personal child health record.\n- Notify designated child protection midwife if delivery of a baby girl.\n- Offer postnatal follow-up if de-infibulation performed intrapartum or if planned de-infibulation did not occur because of delivery by caesarean section.",
      "Epilepsy in Pregnancy \nDiagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform seizures should be made by a neurologist. Different types of epilepsy should be assessed for specific risks to the mother and baby. Other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnant women. \nWomen with epilepsy planning pregnancy should have a clinician manage their AEDs based on fetal risk and seizure control. Folic acid intake and minimizing AED exposure can reduce congenital malformations. \nMost women with epilepsy will not have seizure deterioration in pregnancy. Risks and safety precautions should be communicated to women with epilepsy. \nRegular antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team is recommended. Screening for fetal abnormalities and monitoring AED levels in pregnancy should be individualized. \nSeizures in labour should be managed promptly to avoid complications. Pain relief options for women with epilepsy in labour should be prioritized. \nPostnatal care should include continued AED use and monitoring for seizure triggers. Neonates exposed to AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects. \nEffective contraception is important for women with epilepsy to stabilize their condition and optimize outcomes. \nHealthcare providers should be aware of disability legislation protecting individuals with epilepsy from discrimination.\n\nEpilepsy review services and engagement with WWE during the preconception period and in pregnancy have been a focus of maternal and child health in the UK. Any service caring for WWE needs to provide evidence-based information on risks and benefits to empower parents to make informed choices. Diagnosis of epilepsy should be made by a neurologist, considering seizure history, impact on the mother, and drug history. Classification of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome is important to choose appropriate treatment and prevent seizure deterioration. Differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnancy should consider eclampsia, cardiac, metabolic, and intracranial conditions. Prepregnancy counselling for WWE should discuss the risk of congenital malformations based on AED exposure and emphasize the importance of folic acid supplementation. Exposure to AEDs, especially sodium valproate, may impact long-term neurodevelopment in infants. Minimizing exposure to AEDs and maximizing folic acid intake can help reduce the risk of congenital abnormalities in WWE.\n\nAED polytherapy should have a detailed discussion with the epilepsy specialist on the risks and benefits of continuing or changing the AED prior to planning pregnancy. Where possible, the aim will be to avoid sodium valproate and AED polytherapy. However, if the risk of maternal seizure deterioration from changing the AED is deemed to be high, women will need to be advised to continue the sodium valproate or AED polytherapy. Pregnant women should be informed that two-thirds will not have seizure deterioration in pregnancy. The majority of women do not experience a seizure in pregnancy. Women who were seizure-free for at least 9 months to 1 year prior to pregnancy continued to be seizure-free in pregnancy. Pregnant women with idiopathic generalised epilepsies were more likely to remain seizure-free than those with focal epilepsies. Healthcare professionals should provide verbal and written information on prenatal screening, risks of self-discontinuation of AEDs, effects of seizures and AEDs on the fetus, and breastfeeding. Women should be fully aware of the implications of future pregnancy on their epilepsy and the health of their offspring in the short and long term. WWE tend to overestimate the risks of teratogenicity associated with intake of AEDs in pregnancy. Healthcare professionals should acknowledge the concerns of WWE and be aware of the effect of such concerns on their adherence to AEDs. Pregnant WWE taking levetiracetam or carbamazepine showed that some mothers self-discontinued their AED in pregnancy. Women have concerns regarding the effect of epilepsy and its treatment on motherhood. WWE feel that there is a lack of understanding among healthcare professionals about epilepsy and the specific issues related to pregnancy. Pregnant WWE should have access to regular planned antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team. WWE taking AEDs who become unexpectedly pregnant should be able to discuss therapy with an epilepsy specialist on an urgent basis. All pregnant WWE should be provided with information about the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register and invited to register. Pregnant WWE should be regularly assessed for risk factors for seizures, adherence to AEDs, and seizure type and frequency. Serial growth scans are required for detection of small-for-gestational-age babies in WWE exposed to AEDs. All babies born to WWE taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should be offered 1 mg of intramuscular vitamin K to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.\n\nGiving vitamin K to WWE to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Enzyme-inducing AEDs can increase the risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Parenteral vitamin K supplementation should be offered routinely to babies born to mothers on enzyme-inducing AEDs. WWE with well-controlled seizures do not require early delivery, but elective caesarean section may be considered in cases of significant deterioration of seizures. Non-epileptic attack disorder should be managed with specialist psychiatric or psychological services. Antenatal administration of oral vitamin K for postpartum hemorrhage prevention has not been evaluated. Adequate analgesia and care in labor can minimize the risk of seizures in WWE. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for managing seizures in labor. Pain relief options in labor for WWE should be prioritized, with caution advised for pethidine use. Induction of labor does not have contraindications in WWE taking AEDs. WWE at risk of peripartum seizures should deliver in a consultant-led unit with facilities for resuscitation. WWE should continue their AEDs postnatally to minimize seizure triggers. AED dose adjustments may be needed post-delivery to avoid toxicity. Neonates born to WWE taking AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects, and breastfeeding is encouraged.\n\nIncreasing concentrations of AED in the neonate by 25% during the follow-up period to be clinically important. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate transfer to the child from breast milk to a larger extent compared with sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and phenytoin. Breastfeeding has not been shown to affect cognitive outcomes at 3 years of age in children exposed to certain AEDs. Other options such as alternating breast and bottle milk could be considered. Postpartum safety advice and strategies should be discussed with mothers with epilepsy. Generalised seizures can result in accidental injuries to the mother and baby. Depression should be screened for in the postpartum period. Effective contraception should be offered to women taking AEDs to avoid unplanned pregnancies. Women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should be informed that a copper IUD is the preferred choice for emergency contraception. Contraceptive efficacy may be improved by adjusting the oestrogen component and pill-free interval. Barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives for women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs. The risks of contraceptive failure and adverse effects of each method should be explained to women. Healthcare providers should be aware of equality legislation protecting individuals with disabilities. Future research should focus on optimal monitoring strategies for pregnant women with epilepsy and the effects of AED exposure on offspring. Audit topics should include multidisciplinary input into care and documentation of risks associated with epilepsy and AEDs. Useful links and support groups are provided for further information.\n\nThis guideline provides information on the management of epilepsy during pregnancy, including the risks associated with antiepileptic drugs and the importance of monitoring seizures. It also discusses the impact of epilepsy on pregnancy outcomes and the need for pre-conception counseling.

      "SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE\nNo. 451: Asymptomatic\nEndometrial Thickening in\nPostmenopausal Women\n\nAuthors: Wendy Wolfman, MD, Toronto, ON\nOlga Bougie, MD, Kingston, ON\nInnie Chen, MD, Ottawa, ON\nYale Tang, MD, Edmonton, AB\nSusan Goldstein, MD, Toronto, ON\nJeanne Bouteaud, MD, Montréal, QC\n\nRECOMMENDED CHANGES IN PRACTICE\n1. Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do not need investigations if they have endometrial thickness <11 mm on ultrasound.\n2. Further endometrial investigations should be decided on an individual basis, based on specific ultrasound findings and the patient’s personal risk for endometrial cancer.\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n1. Routine pelvic ultrasound is not recommended to screen for endometrial cancer.\n2. Most patients with endometrial cancer present with postmenopausal bleeding.\n3. Endometrial thickness <11 mm is associated with a low risk of malignancy.\n4. Patients with endometrial thickening and risk factors may need further assessments.\n5. Hormone therapies in a continuous combined formulation do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\n6. Patients on tamoxifen do not need routine ultrasound if asymptomatic.\n7. Endometrial biopsy in patients with global thickening on ultrasound is accurate.\n8. Invasive endometrial procedures have a low but significant complication risk.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Endometrial tissue sampling should not be extrapolated to asymptomatic women.\n2. Women with endometrial thickness >11 mm and other positive ultrasound findings should have endometrial sampling or be referred for further investigations.\n3. Further investigations should be based on individual risk factors in asymptomatic women with increased endometrial thickening.\n4. Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors and endometrial thickening <11 mm do not need invasive investigations.\n5. Transvaginal ultrasound is not recommended for screening for endometrial cancer.\n6. Further investigations for women with endometrial thickening >11 mm should include hysterosonogram, diagnostic hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, or monitoring.\n7. Women on continuous combined hormone therapy without bleeding do not need screening ultrasounds.\n8. Women on tamoxifen do not need routine ultrasound.\n9. Women with cervical stenosis and no bleeding should be managed based on individual factors.\n\nClinical characteristics such as menopausal status, polycystic ovary syndrome, a long menstrual history, and infertility may increase the risk of hyperplasia. Lynch syndrome is an inherited risk factor for hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Exposure to estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy post-menopause has been shown to increase the risk of hyperplasia in some studies. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, typically diagnosed in postmenopausal women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. Endometrial thickness >11 mm or increased vascularity on ultrasound may warrant additional investigation with endometrial biopsy. Endometrial biopsy is recommended for assessment of endometrial tissue, with blind outpatient endometrial biopsy being a cost-effective and minimally invasive option. Systemic menopausal hormone treatments can affect endometrial thickness, with unopposed systemic estrogen increasing thickness. Newer estrogen-progestin therapies have not shown significant increases in endometrial thickness or hyperplasia.\n\nLevonorgestrel intrauterine system combined with estrogen therapy has been shown to be effective in managing menopausal symptoms. Tibolone and tissue selective estrogen complex tablet are also options for hormone therapy. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the risk of endometrial cancer with these therapies. Transdermal testosterone as an adjunct to estradiol does not increase endometrial thickness. Limited studies on herbal or complementary menopausal products show no increase in endometrial thickness. Local hormone therapies containing estradiol, conjugated equine estrogen, or testosterone are also effective in managing genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Tamoxifen therapy is associated with thicker endometrium in postmenopausal patients. Aromatase inhibitors have been shown to reduce endometrial thickness. Cervical stenosis can complicate endometrial biopsy, and medical management options include prostaglandin E1 and osmotic dilators. Operative techniques may be necessary in cases of cervical stenosis. Routine screening for asymptomatic women on tamoxifen is not recommended. Endometrial biopsy should be considered in women with suspected pathology or at high risk for cancer.\n\nWatchful monitoring with repeat ultrasound over 4 months may be an option if the patient is counselled with respect to her individual endometrial cancer risk. Newer literature continues to support the extremely low risk of malignancy in women with asymptomatic global endometrial thickening <10-11 mm.\n\nHormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia: a Cochrane review summary. Various studies have investigated the effects of different hormone therapies on endometrial safety and bleeding profiles in postmenopausal women. Results have shown varying effects on endometrial thickness and safety, with some therapies showing no significant impact. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of hormone therapy on endometrial health in postmenopausal women.\n\nPreoperative ripening of the cervix before operative hysteroscopy is recommended. Misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy in premenopausal and post-menopausal women is also recommended. Self-administered vaginal misoprostol is compared to placebo for cervical ripening before operative hysteroscopy. Resectoscopic cervical trauma can be minimized by inserting Laminaria digitata preoperatively. Complications of hysteroscopy should be considered in a prospective, multicenter study. Experience of hysteroscopy indications and complications should be monitored. A multicenter survey of complications associated with operative hysteroscopies is recommended. Ultrasonography can be used in difficult postmenopausal dilation and curettage. Dilute vasopressin solution can affect the force needed for cervical dilatation. Hysteroscopic management of a stenotic cervix can be achieved. A hysteroscopic morcellator may help overcome cervical stenosis. Ultrasonography-guided transvaginal endometrial biopsy is useful in patients with cervical stenosis.",
      "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a common condition in late pregnancy, characterized by itching and elevated bile acids. Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth based on bile acid levels. Fetal monitoring has not shown to improve outcomes. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common. Clinicians should consider ICP in pregnant individuals with itching, perform bile acid testing, and offer ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment. Monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended during labor. Resolution of symptoms should be confirmed postpartum. Patients and family members are at higher risk for ICP in future pregnancies.\n\nThis clinical practice guideline aims to evaluate and summarize the available literature on ICP and provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical care. ICP is a common gestational disease that targets the liver, with varying incidence rates globally. Bile acids play a key role in the pathophysiology of ICP, and genetic susceptibility may contribute to its development. Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities. The most common symptom of ICP is pruritis, with elevated serum bile acids being a common laboratory finding. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated total serum bile acids, and monitoring levels is important for fetal outcomes. Maternal and fetal sequelae of ICP include an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Further testing for alternative diagnoses is recommended in certain cases.\n\nUrocholate impacted the rate and rhythm of cardiomyocyte contraction and abnormal calcium dynamics. Evaluation of pregnancies with ICP have supported the presence of alterations to fetal cardiac parameters. The goal of treating ICP is to ameliorate maternal symptomatology of pruritus and improve fetal outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most frequently used medication for ICP. Treatment with UDCA may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Refractory cases of ICP may benefit from a referral to a specialist. Follow-up laboratory testing and monitoring should be performed to gauge the magnitude of fetal risk. Fetal monitoring with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasound may be considered. Delivery timing should be based on the highest recorded non-fasting bile acid level. Postpartum outcomes, contraception considerations, and recurrence risk should be discussed. The recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies is around 70%. Individuals with ICP are at an increased risk of acquiring metabolic disease during adulthood. The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception for those with ICP. Overall, ICP is a multifactorial and common hepatic disease unique to pregnancy.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a condition that can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal complications. It is associated with elevated serum bile acid concentrations and may increase the risk of preeclampsia. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to be effective in managing the condition. Induction of labor may be necessary in some cases to reduce the risk of complications. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and optimal management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.\n\nIntrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy\nDifferential diagnoses for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy include AFLP, allergic or drug reaction, autoimmune hepatitis, biliary obstruction, drug-induced liver injury, HELLP syndrome, and more. Recommendations for iatrogenic birth are based on non-fasting bile acid levels. Contraceptive eligibility for women with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is outlined.",
      "Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy\nObjective and scope\nThis guideline provides recommendations for the management of genital herpes simplex virus infection in pregnant women. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. The target population includes pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. Healthcare professionals in maternity units and level 3 care services are the intended audience.\nStakeholder involvement\nClinicians from BASHH and RCOG, along with patient input from the Herpes Viruses Association, were involved in developing this guideline. External peer review was conducted by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\nSearch strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using various databases and guidelines to inform the recommendations in this guideline.\nBackground\nNeonatal herpes is a rare but serious viral infection with varying presentations and outcomes. It is primarily caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The incidence of neonatal herpes is low in the UK compared to other countries. Transmission risk factors include maternal infection type, duration of rupture of membranes, and mode of delivery.\nManagement of pregnant women with first episode genital herpes\nTreatment with aciclovir is recommended for pregnant women with first episode genital herpes, with no evidence of increased risk of birth defects. Symptomatic relief options like paracetamol and lidocaine gel can be considered. Vaginal delivery is generally safe, and suppressive aciclovir therapy from 36 weeks gestation can reduce HSV lesions and viral shedding. Caesarean section is advised for women with third trimester acquisition to prevent neonatal transmission.\nThird trimester acquisition\nFor women acquiring genital herpes in the third trimester, daily suppressive aciclovir until delivery is recommended. Caesarean section is the preferred delivery mode to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can help differentiate between primary and recurrent infections, influencing management decisions.\n\nIt is recommended that an initial plan of delivery should be based on the assumption that all first episode lesions are primary genital herpes. Women with recurrent genital herpes should be informed that the risk of neonatal herpes is low, even if lesions are present at the time of delivery. Vaginal delivery should be anticipated in the absence of other obstetric indications for caesarean section. Daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered from 36 weeks of gestation. Management of pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes should be based on clinical assessment. Caesarean section should be recommended to all women presenting with primary episode genital herpes lesions at the time of delivery. In cases of recurrent genital herpes lesions at the onset of labor, vaginal delivery should be offered. In cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, management should be guided by a multidisciplinary team discussion. For HIV-positive women with HSV infection, daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered. Management of the neonate born to mothers with HSV infection should involve informing the neonatal team and considering appropriate testing and treatment. Efforts to prevent postnatal transmission of HSV are important.\n\nManagement of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy\nTreat episodes with standard doses of aciclovir if necessary. Treat primary episode with standard doses of aciclovir. Consider aciclovir 400 mg tds from 36/40 gestation. Offer vaginal delivery. Perform lumbar puncture for HSV PCR if necessary. Recommend planned CS especially if within 6 weeks of delivery. Start aciclovir 20 mg/kg tds for 10 days while awaiting results.",
      "Management of Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women\nThis guideline provides information for clinicians on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and referral for improved outcomes. Conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign ovarian masses, with referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings are key factors in assessing the risk of malignancy. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules can aid in estimating the risk of malignancy without relying solely on CA-125 levels. Women with specific ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy should be referred to a gynaecological oncology service. Other guidelines from the USA and Canada also provide recommendations for managing premenopausal women with pelvic masses. Asymptomatic women with small simple ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly.\n\nWomen with simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter should have yearly ultrasound follow-up, and those with larger simple cysts should be considered for further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or increasing ovarian cysts may warrant surgical management, especially in cases of mature cystic teratomas. Combined oral contraceptives do not help in the treatment of functional ovarian cysts. The laparoscopic approach is preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses, with lower morbidity and quicker recovery time. Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is less effective and has a high rate of recurrence. Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent potential malignancy. The possibility of removing an ovary should be discussed preoperatively. Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy after laparoscopic surgery and complications following surgery for ovarian cysts.\n\nThree-dimensional quantification of tumor vascularity as a tertiary test after B-mode and power Doppler evaluation for detection of ovarian cancer.

      "The guideline focuses on laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. It emphasizes the importance of experienced laparoscopists performing these procedures to ensure maternal and fetal safety. Studies have shown that laparoscopy is safe for both mother and fetus, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. The incidence of non-obstetric abdominal surgical emergencies in pregnancy is low, and hormonal changes may affect the risk of certain conditions like gallbladder disease. Overall, laparoscopy is considered a viable surgical option in pregnancy when performed by skilled professionals.\n\nLaparoscopic appendectomy in pregnancy has been associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous miscarriage compared to open appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is more common in the first trimester, which may contribute to the increased risk of miscarriage. However, laparoscopic surgery offers benefits such as faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower rates of wound infection for pregnant women. When considering the type of surgery, factors such as expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference should be taken into account. Maternal risks of laparoscopy include potential vascular and organ trauma, while anaesthetic risks should be carefully managed with early involvement of an obstetric anaesthetist and consideration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is typically recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy to ensure optimal safety for both the mother and fetus.\n\nPregnant women requiring laparoscopy for non-obstetric conditions should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Surgery should be postponed if non-urgent, but if necessary, can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally good for laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Surgeons with experience in laparoscopy have better outcomes. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed by skilled surgeons to reduce complications. Urgent surgery should not be delayed in pregnancy. Both laparoscopic and open surgery are acceptable options. Intraoperative monitoring may be needed in selected cases. Antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium may be used if preterm delivery is a risk. Routine tocolysis is not recommended. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed in facilities with appropriate expertise and monitoring. Fetal monitoring may be done before and after surgery. Caution is needed in steroid administration for maternal sepsis. Routine intraoperative fetal monitoring is not always necessary. Ports should be placed based on uterine size and location of pathology. The Hasson technique may reduce the risk of uterine trauma. Secondary port placement should consider uterine size and pathology. Pneumoperitoneum pressures below 12 mmHg are safe for the fetus.\n\nInsufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended for gas insufflation in laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy. Operating pressures of 12 mmHg are supported by current evidence. Both 5 and 10 mm diameter laparoscopes can be used, depending on surgical requirements. The choice of laparoscope degree depends on surgeon preference. Ultrasound, bipolar, and monopolar energy sources are safe to use during laparoscopy in pregnancy. The choice of extraction method for surgical specimens should be based on surgeon preference. Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process. Timely surgical intervention is preferable in suspected appendicitis in pregnancy to avoid adverse outcomes. Delay in surgery for appendicitis can lead to increased complications.\n\nShould the laparoscopic approach to appendicectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? There is controversy regarding the association of laparoscopic appendicectomy and miscarriage, and further research is needed to distinguish between association and causality. In the case of cholecystectomy, laparoscopic approach is associated with better outcomes than open approach, with fewer complications and shorter hospital stay. When surgery is indicated for ovarian cysts, laparoscopic cystectomy is associated with better maternal outcomes than laparotomy. The choice of approach should be based on local circumstances and expertise.\n\nAdnexal masses in pregnancy can be safely managed laparoscopically, especially for appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and symptomatic adnexal cysts. Adequately trained laparoscopists should perform these procedures with proper peri-operative preparations. More high-grade evidence is needed, and national large databases may be beneficial due to the difficulty in conducting randomized controlled trials for these conditions.\n\nAdnexal torsion: cystectomy and ovarian fixation are equally important in preventing recurrence.

      "Antenatal care guideline by NICE outlines the organization and delivery of antenatal care, routine antenatal clinical care, information and support for pregnant women and their partners, and interventions for common problems during pregnancy. It emphasizes the importance of involving partners in care decisions and providing comprehensive care for pregnant women. The guideline also includes recommendations for starting antenatal care, antenatal appointments, and involving partners in the care process.\n\nConsider reviewing the woman's previous medical records if needed, including records held by other healthcare providers. Be aware that women and babies from some minority ethnic backgrounds and those who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of death and may need closer monitoring and additional support. Assess the woman's risk of and, if appropriate, discuss female genital mutilation (FGM) in a kind, sensitive manner. Refer the woman for a clinical assessment by a doctor to detect cardiac conditions if there is a concern based on the pregnant woman's personal or family history. Refer the woman to an obstetrician or other relevant doctor if there are any medical concerns or if review of current long-term medicines is needed. Ask the woman about domestic abuse in a kind, sensitive manner at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for venous thromboembolism at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for gestational diabetes at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for pre-eclampsia at the first antenatal appointment and again in the second trimester. Measure and record the woman's blood pressure at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a urine dipstick test for proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a risk assessment for fetal growth restriction at the first antenatal appointment, and again in the second trimester. Offer symphysis fundal height measurement at each antenatal appointment after 24+0 weeks. If there are concerns about the symphysis fundal height, consider an ultrasound scan for fetal growth and wellbeing.\n\n1.2.34 Discuss the topic of babies' movements with the woman after 24 weeks, ask about concerns and advise to contact maternity services if needed.\n1.2.35 Structured fetal movement awareness packages have not been shown to reduce stillbirth rates.\n1.2.36 Offer abdominal palpation after 36 weeks to identify possible breech presentation.\n1.2.37 Offer an ultrasound scan if breech presentation is suspected.\n1.2.38 For women with confirmed breech presentation after 36 weeks, discuss different birthing options.\n1.3.1 Listen to the pregnant woman's needs and preferences.\n1.3.2 Discuss risks, benefits, and implications of assessments with the woman.\n1.3.3 Respect women's decisions even if they differ from healthcare professionals.\n1.3.4 Provide information in a clear, tailored, and supportive manner.\n1.3.5 Individualize discussions based on the woman's knowledge.\n1.3.6 Ensure understanding of information provided and allow time for questions.\n1.3.7 Discuss antenatal care and schedule appointments at the first visit.\n1.3.8 Provide information on various aspects of antenatal care.\n1.3.9 Discuss nutrition, diet, physical activity, and substance use in a non-judgemental way.\n1.3.10 Discuss the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n1.3.11 Provide information on pregnancy changes, support, and resources.\n1.3.12 Refer to guidance on pelvic floor dysfunction.\n1.3.13 Discuss babies' movements after 24 weeks.\n1.3.14 Start discussing birth preferences before 28 weeks.\n1.3.15 Provide information on preparing for labor, postnatal care, and newborn care.\n1.3.16 Continue discussing birth preferences throughout pregnancy.\n1.3.17 Discuss prolonged pregnancy options after 38 weeks.\n1.3.18 Provide support for women with babies at increased risk of neonatal admission.\n1.3.19 Offer appropriate information and support based on risk factors.\n\n1.3.23 Discuss the potential benefits of peer support with pregnant women (and their partners), and explain how it may provide practical support, help to build confidence, and reduce feelings of isolation.\n1.3.24 Offer pregnant women (and their partners) information about how to access local and national peer support services.\n\n1.3.25 Advise women to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks of pregnancy and to consider using pillows to maintain their position while sleeping.\n1.3.26 Explain to the woman that there may be a link between going to sleep on her back and stillbirth in late pregnancy (after 28 weeks).\n\n1.4 Interventions for common problems during pregnancy\nNausea and vomiting\n1.4.1 Reassure women that mild to moderate nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy and are likely to resolve before 16 to 20 weeks.\n1.4.2 Recognize that by the time women seek advice from healthcare professionals about nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, they may have already tried a number of different interventions.\n1.4.3 For pregnant women with mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting who prefer a non-pharmacological option, suggest that they try ginger.\n1.4.4 When considering pharmacological treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different antiemetics with the woman. Take into account her preferences and her experience with treatments in previous pregnancies.\n1.4.5 For pregnant women with nausea and vomiting who choose a pharmacological treatment, offer an antiemetic.\n1.4.6 For pregnant women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting, consider intravenous fluids, ideally on an outpatient basis, and consider acupressure as an adjunct treatment.\n1.4.7 Consider inpatient care if vomiting is severe and not responding to primary care or outpatient management. This will include women with hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nModels of antenatal care and the identification of breech presentation were discussed, as well as the management of severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Recommendations were made based on the need for timely access to antenatal care, involvement of partners, and the importance of taking and recording the woman's history. The impact on practice was considered, with a focus on improving care for women without major changes in practice.\n\nAddressing inequalities is important in antenatal care. It is essential to discuss a woman's past and present conditions and experiences to identify potential risks and tailor care to her needs. This includes reviewing medication use and discussing home and family situations. Healthcare professionals should be aware of disparities in maternal mortality rates among different populations and address them. It is crucial to inquire about domestic abuse and female genital mutilation to provide appropriate support and safeguarding. Identifying underlying cardiac problems is also important to prevent maternal mortality. Antenatal appointments allow for monitoring and reassessment of care needs. Overall, the recommendations aim to improve current best practices in antenatal care.\n\nThe committee discussed the importance of fetal movements and the need for structured fetal movement awareness packages. Evidence did not show a significant benefit from these packages, but the committee agreed that fetal movements should be routinely discussed and women's concerns taken seriously. There is no agreed definition of normal fetal movements, so discussions on changes throughout pregnancy are important. The recommendations on fetal growth monitoring reflect current practice, with potential changes in offering ultrasound scans after 28 weeks. Managing reduced fetal movements should follow the NHS saving babies' lives care bundle. The recommendations on breech presentation and communication emphasize informed decision-making and listening to women's needs. Providing information about antenatal care and scheduling appointments can improve engagement and follow-up. Antenatal classes can benefit women, especially nulliparous women, and should be accessible to all groups. Peer support during the antenatal period can be valuable, especially for specific subpopulations. Lastly, recommendations on sleep position aim to reduce the risk of stillbirth and babies being born small for gestational age.\n\n28 weeks if women fall asleep on their backs. The committee agreed that there is some uncertainty about this risk because the evidence was from relatively small studies whose design made it difficult to assume that sleep position caused the adverse outcomes. Further research is unlikely because conducting sufficiently powered prospective cohort studies is not feasible given the relatively low incidence of stillbirth. On balance, the committee agreed that the evidence was strong enough to advise women to try to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks.\n\nThe committee recognized the potential anxiety and feelings of guilt that women may experience if they wake up on their backs. Healthcare professionals may need to spend more time talking to women about sleep position in pregnancy, but the recommendations are not expected to have a significant cost or resource impact.\n\nNausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect daily functioning and quality of life. The committee agreed that it is important to reassure pregnant women who experience mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting that these are common symptoms in early pregnancy and will usually settle later in the second trimester. Some women prefer non-pharmacological treatments while others may prefer pharmacological treatments, so both options are recommended.\n\nThere was evidence that ginger is effective in treating mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting in pregnancy compared with placebo. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and ondansetron were also found to be effective in improving symptoms. The committee recommended considering acupressure for women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting as an additional treatment. No recommendation was made on the use of corticosteroids for severe nausea and vomiting in pregnant women.\n\nThe treatment options for heartburn in pregnancy reflect current clinical practice. Lifestyle and diet information may help alleviate symptoms. Antacids and alginates are recommended as they are equally effective. No recommendations were made on acupuncture or proton pump inhibitors.\n\nLimited evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for symptomatic vaginal discharge in pregnant women led the committee to base their recommendations on their knowledge and clinical experience. Antifungal treatments for vaginal candidiasis and antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis were recommended, either orally or vaginally. No recommendations were made for metronidazole to treat symptomatic vaginal discharge due to vaginal trichomoniasis.\n\nExercise advice from a physiotherapist may reduce pelvic girdle pain intensity and functional disability. Referral to physiotherapy services is recommended, as non-rigid lumbopelvic belts together with general information and advice were found to reduce pain intensity.\n\nNo evidence was identified about adverse effects of using a lumbopelvic belt. Providing a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt was also found to be cost-effective, but due to limited clinical evidence, a strong recommendation was not made. Manual therapy alone was not found to have any benefits for women with pelvic girdle pain. The evidence for acupuncture to treat pelvic girdle pain was mixed and of poor quality, therefore not enough to justify a recommendation with substantial resource impact. Providing a lumbopelvic belt is not current practice in all units, so the recommendation may have cost implications. However, health economic modeling showed that it is cost-effective even if women are referred for physiotherapy. The recommendation may increase the number of pregnant women seeking referral to physiotherapy services.\n\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks should prompt a review in secondary care for monitoring, administering corticosteroids, and neonatal unit care if the baby is born preterm. Hospitalization should be considered for these cases. Recommendations reflect current practice. \n\nAround 660,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year. The antenatal period is crucial for providing support, information, and assessing the risk of complications. Good quality antenatal care is essential to identify and address potential problems and reduce the chance of poor outcomes for both the woman and the baby. This guideline covers routine antenatal care for all women. It does not cover specialized care for women with underlying medical conditions or obstetric complications.\n\nFor more information and committee details, refer to the NICE topic page on pregnancy. See evidence reviews for full details of the evidence and committee discussions. NICE has tools and resources to help implement this guideline. \n\nUpdate information: This guideline updates and replaces NICE guideline CG62 (published March 2008). Minor changes have been made since publication.",
      "Laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer is safe and effective, provided proper arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent, and audit. Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, with additional training recommended. The procedure aims to provide a less invasive option with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery. Conversion to laparotomy rates vary but postoperative complications are fewer with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Further data on long-term outcomes would be beneficial for future reviews.",
      "Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management guideline covers diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with complications in early pregnancy. It aims to improve early pregnancy loss diagnosis and support for women. Healthcare professionals, commissioners, and women with complications in early pregnancy are the target audience. Recommendations include providing support and information with dignity and respect, early pregnancy assessment services available 7 days a week, and recognizing the symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy for prompt referral.\n\nIn women of reproductive age, consider offering a pregnancy test even with non-specific symptoms. Healthcare professionals should have access to pregnancy tests. Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment. Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors. Refer women with early pregnancy complications for assessment based on clinical situation. Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies. Consider signs indicating tubal ectopic pregnancy during ultrasound scans. Use serum hCG measurements cautiously in women with pregnancies of unknown location. Provide written information to women with pregnancies of unknown location for monitoring symptoms and accessing emergency care.\n\n1.4.29 For a woman with an increase in serum hCG levels greater than 63% after Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management:\n- Inform her that she is likely to have a developing intrauterine pregnancy.\n- Offer her a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the location of the pregnancy between 7 and 14 days later. Consider an earlier scan for women with a serum hCG level greater than or equal to 1,500 IU/litre.\n- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed, offer her routine antenatal care. \n- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not confirmed, refer her for immediate clinical review by a senior gynaecologist.\n\n1.4.30 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels greater than 50% after 48 hours:\n- Inform her that the pregnancy is unlikely to continue but this is not confirmed.\n- Provide her with oral and written information about where she can access support and counselling services.\n- Ask her to take a urine pregnancy test 14 days after the second serum hCG test.\n\n1.4.31 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels less than 50%, or an increase less than 63%, refer her for clinical review in the early pregnancy assessment service within 24 hours.\n\n1.4.32 For women with a pregnancy of unknown location, when using serial serum hCG measurements, do not use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.\n\nOffer systemic methotrexate to women with an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy who have no significant pain, an adnexal mass smaller than 35mm, a serum hCG level less than 1,500 IU/litre, and no visible heartbeat. Surgery should be offered if methotrexate is not acceptable or if the woman has significant pain, a larger adnexal mass, a visible heartbeat, or a serum hCG level of 5,000 IU/litre or more. Women with an ectopic pregnancy and a serum hCG level between 1,500 and 5,000 IU/litre can choose between methotrexate and surgical management if they meet certain criteria. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed when surgical treatment is needed, and competent surgeons should be available. Salpingectomy should be offered unless there are other risk factors for infertility, and salpingotomy can be considered for women with infertility risk factors. Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis should be offered to all Rh-negative women undergoing surgery for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Do not offer it to women receiving solely medical management or with certain pregnancy conditions.\n\nOver the past 2 decades, there have been significant changes in the management of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, with a shift towards outpatient or day case care and the introduction of medical and expectant management as alternatives to surgery. However, there is a lack of research into the effects of these different approaches from the woman's perspective, particularly their psychological and emotional impact. Miscarriage is distressing for most women, and the type of management itself might affect women's need for counseling, resulting in a cost to the NHS. Therefore, further research in this area is important.\n\nA comparative study should be conducted to assess how the type of intervention impacts women's experience, including psychological and emotional outcomes. Currently, there is no evidence exploring the psychological impact of different treatments for ectopic pregnancy. A qualitative comparative study is needed to reduce the emotional impact of the condition and maximize women's emotional recovery in the short and long term.\n\nAdditionally, recommendations have been made regarding the use of ultrasound for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy and the use of progestogens for preventing miscarriage. Standardizing practices across the NHS based on evidence will improve the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and reduce risks to women. The use of progestogens to prevent miscarriage is cost-effective and will standardize the preparation of progesterone used in such cases.\n\nFurthermore, recommendations have been made for the medical management of miscarriage, including the use of a combination of medications to reduce the need for surgical intervention. These recommendations aim to improve the management of miscarriage and reduce costs for the NHS.\n\nLastly, recommendations have been made for the expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, offering clinically stable women an alternative to medical management. These recommendations aim to standardize the management of ectopic pregnancy and make expectant management available when clinically appropriate, potentially resulting in cost savings through a reduction in drug use.\n\nEctopic pregnancy and miscarriage have an adverse effect on the quality of life of many women. Approximately 20% of pregnancies miscarry, and miscarriages can cause considerable distress. Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is 11 per 1,000 pregnancies, with a maternal mortality of 0.2 per 1,000 estimated ectopic pregnancies. About two-thirds of these deaths are associated with substandard care. Women who do not access medical help readily are particularly vulnerable. Improvement in the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy loss is therefore of vital importance, in order to reduce the incidence of the associated psychological morbidity and avoid the unnecessary deaths of women with ectopic pregnancies.",
      "Endometriosis: diagnosis and management \nNICE guideline \nPublished: 6 September 2017 \nLast updated: 16 April 2024 \n\nThe recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences, and values of their patients. \n\n1.1 Organisation of care \n1.2 Endometriosis information and support \n1.3 Endometriosis symptoms and signs \n1.4 Referral for women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis \n1.5 Diagnosing endometriosis \n1.6 Staging systems \n1.7 Monitoring for women with confirmed endometriosis \n1.8 Pharmacological pain management \n1.9 Non-pharmacological management \n1.10 Surgical management \n1.11 Management if fertility is a priority \n\nTerms used in this guideline \n\nRecommendations for research \n\nOverview \nWho is it for? \nRationale and impact \nContext \nFinding more information and committee details \nUpdate information\n\nAssess the extent of deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter. Ensure that pelvic MRI scans are interpreted by a healthcare professional with specialist expertise in gynaecological imaging. Consider laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis in women with suspected endometriosis, even if the ultrasound was normal. For women with suspected deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter, consider a pelvic ultrasound or MRI before an operative laparoscopy. During a diagnostic laparoscopy, a gynaecologist with training and skills in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis should perform a systematic inspection of the pelvis. Consider taking a biopsy of suspected endometriosis during a diagnostic laparoscopy. Offer endometriosis treatment according to the woman's symptoms, preferences, and priorities rather than the stage of the endometriosis. Consider outpatient follow-up for women with confirmed endometriosis, particularly women with deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter or large endometrioma. For women with endometriosis-related pain, discuss the benefits and risks of analgesics. Consider hormonal treatment for women with suspected, confirmed, or recurrent endometriosis. Discuss surgical management options with women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. Perform surgery for endometriosis laparoscopically unless there are contraindications. Consider excision rather than ablation to treat endometriomas. Offer excision or ablation of endometriosis plus adhesiolysis for endometriosis not involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter to improve the chance of spontaneous pregnancy. Offer laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or drainage and ablation to improve the chance of spontaneous pregnancy in women with endometriomas. Discuss the benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery as a treatment option for women with deep endometriosis trying to conceive. Do not offer hormonal treatment alone or in combination with surgery to women trying to conceive as it does not improve spontaneous pregnancy rates. Terms used in this guideline: Chronic pelvic pain, Paediatric and adolescent gynaecology service, Ovarian cystectomy, Managed clinical networks. Recommendations for research: Pain management programs - Are pain management programs a clinically and cost-effective intervention for women with endometriosis?\n\nProvide an additional or alternative treatment option for women experiencing endometriosis-related pain. Groups of particular interest are women for whom hormonal and surgical options have been exhausted, women who would prefer an alternative to a pharmacological or surgical approach, and women who may be prioritizing trying to conceive.\n\nIs laparoscopic treatment (excision or ablation) of peritoneal disease in isolation effective for managing endometriosis-related pain? Isolated peritoneal endometriosis can be an incidental finding in women who may or may not experience pain or other symptoms. Research is needed to determine whether laparoscopic treatment of isolated peritoneal endometriosis in women with endometriosis-related pain results in a clinical and cost-effective improvement in symptoms.\n\nAre specialist lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) effective, compared with no specialist lifestyle interventions, for women with endometriosis? Endometriosis is a long-term condition that can cause acute and chronic pain, and fatigue. It has a significant and sometimes severe impact on the woman's quality of life and activities of daily living, including relationships and sexuality, ability to work, fertility, fitness, and mental health.\n\nWhat information and support interventions are effective to help women with endometriosis deal with their symptoms and improve their quality of lives? This guideline has identified that women with endometriosis and their partners feel that information and support is not always provided in the way that best meets their needs. However, the direct effectiveness of different types or formats of information and support interventions on measurable outcomes such as health-related quality of life and level of function has not been tested.\n\nWhat is the effect of different doses and durations of hormonal treatments given either before, after, or both before and after surgery on fertility outcomes in people with endometriosis where fertility is a priority?",
      "Inducing labour \nNICE guideline \nPublished: 4 November 2021 \n\nThe recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences, and values of their patients or the people using their service. \n\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. \n\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. \n\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible. \n\nOverview: This guideline covers the circumstances for inducing labour, methods of induction, assessment, monitoring, pain relief, and managing complications. It aims to improve advice and care for pregnant women who are thinking about or having induction of labour. \n\nWho is it for? Healthcare professionals, commissioners and providers, pregnant women, their families, and carers. \n\nRecommendations: People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care. \n\n1.1 Information and decision making: Discuss preferences about mode of birth with women early on in their pregnancy. Take into account their individual circumstances and discuss the options for birth. Record these discussions and the woman's preferences in her notes. Confirm a woman's preferences for birth at antenatal visits towards the end of pregnancy, as these may have changed since earlier discussions. Explain to women that induction of labour is a medical intervention that will affect their birth options and their experience of the birth process. \n\n1.2 Induction of labour in specific circumstances: Give women with uncomplicated pregnancies every opportunity to go into spontaneous labour. Explain to women that labour usually starts naturally before 42 weeks. Discuss with women the risks associated with a pregnancy continuing beyond 41 weeks and the potential benefits of induction of labour. Be aware of the increased risk of stillbirth for women from some minority ethnic backgrounds or living in deprived areas. Offer additional fetal monitoring for women who choose not to have their labour induced if they wish to have monitoring from 42 weeks. Offer women who choose to await the spontaneous onset of labour the opportunity.\n\nAdvise women to contact their midwife or maternity unit if they change their mind before their next appointment or have concerns about their baby. Do not carry out induction of labor before 34+0 weeks for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes unless there are additional obstetric indications. Offer expectant management until 37+0 weeks. Discuss the options of expectant management or induction of labor for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks but before 37+0 weeks. Consider risks to the woman and baby, availability of neonatal intensive care facilities, and the woman's individual circumstances and preferences. If a woman has preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or cesarean birth. Offer women with prelabor rupture of membranes at term a choice of expectant management for up to 24 hours or induction of labor as soon as possible. Respect the woman's decision if she chooses to wait for spontaneous onset of labor for over 24 hours after prelabor rupture of membranes at term. If a woman has prelabor rupture of membranes at term and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or cesarean birth. Discuss methods of induction with a woman who has had a previous cesarean birth to make an informed decision about the most appropriate choice. Consider requests for induction of labor after discussing the benefits and risks with the woman. Induction of labor is not generally recommended if a woman's baby is in the breech position. Consider induction of labor for babies in the breech position if birth needs to be expedited and external cephalic version is unsuccessful, declined, or contraindicated, and the woman chooses not to have a planned cesarean birth. Do not induce labor if there is fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise. Do not routinely offer induction of labor to women with a history of precipitate labor to avoid a birth unattended by healthcare professionals. In the event of an intrauterine fetal death, offer support to help women and their partners and family cope with the emotional and physical consequences of the death. If a woman with an intrauterine fetal death chooses induced labor, follow the recommendations on monitoring of uterine contractions and provide one-to-one midwifery care of the woman during labor and birth. Explain to women what a membrane sweep is and that it might make it more likely that labor will start without the need for additional methods of induction. Discuss with women if they would like a vaginal examination for membrane sweeping after 39+0 weeks. Discuss with women if they would like to have additional membrane sweeping if labor does not start spontaneously following the first sweep. Explain to women that a vaginal examination to assess the readiness of the cervix will help decide which method of induction they will be offered first and discuss the risks and benefits of different methods to induce labor. Include that both dinoprostone and misoprostol can cause hyperstimulation.\n\nUterine activity and fetal condition must be monitored regularly. If hyperstimulation occurs, the induction treatment will be stopped. Different vaginal products have varying ease of removal. Hyperstimulation can be treated with tocolysis. Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation than pharmacological methods. Follow manufacturers' guidance on the use of dinoprostone and misoprostol preparations for induction of labor. Consider induction options based on Bishop score. Offer induction with amniotomy and oxytocin infusion for Bishop score of more than 6. Assess fetal wellbeing and uterine contractions during induction. Offer pain relief options and discuss with women. Consider outpatient induction with appropriate monitoring. Monitor fetal wellbeing and progress during induction. Manage complications like uterine hyperstimulation, unsuccessful induction, cord prolapse, and other issues. Definitions provided for Bishop score, Dinoprostone, and Expectant management.\n\nHyperstimulation is the overactivity of the uterus as a result of labor induction. It is defined by increased contractions and may be associated with changes in fetal heart rate. Membrane sweeping involves separating membranes to induce labor. Mothers and babies are audited to reduce risks. Precipitate labor is a very quick labor. Suspected fetal macrosomia is when a baby is large for its gestational age. Unsuccessful induction is when labor does not start after treatment. Research recommendations include optimal timing of induction and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Inducing labor for suspected fetal macrosomia requires informed decision-making. Inducing labor after intrauterine fetal death after a previous cesarean birth needs further research.\n\nThe committee recommends discussing different birth options with women after intrauterine fetal death if they have had a previous cesarean birth. Women with IUFD should be cared for on a one-to-one basis and monitored. Women with a scarred uterus are at increased risk of uterine rupture after IUFD. Mechanical methods of induction may be safe to use in women with a previous cesarean birth. Inducing labor methods depend on the readiness of the cervix, with options including vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol, and mechanical methods. The aim is to provide advice to healthcare professionals and pregnant women on the information and support needed to make decisions about induction of labor.",
      "BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology\nRCOG GUIDELINE\nManagement of Thyroid Disorders in Pregnancy\nGreen- top Guideline No. 76\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n• Trimester-  and manufacturer-  specific pregnancy reference ranges for serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) are recommended for correct interpretation of thyroid function tests.\n• Consideration should be given to increasing dietary intake of iodine-  rich foods or consuming daily oral supplementation of 150μg iodine in the form of potassium iodide during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n• Subpopulations with specific risk factors for thyroid disorders should be tested in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n• Titration of levothyroxine to achieve a preconception TSH ≤ 2.5 mU/L is recommended for women with overt hypothyroidism.\n• Women treated with levothyroxine should increase their dose upon a positive pregnancy test.\n• TSH and fT4 concentrations should be checked regularly during pregnancy for women treated with levothyroxine.\n• Treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for women with subclinical hypothyroidism.\n• Routine testing for TPOAb in euthyroid women is not recommended during pregnancy.\n• Levothyroxine treatment is not recommended for women with TPOAb in the absence of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.\n\nFertility and recurrent miscarriage should be addressed by clinicians with appropriate experience. Care should be optimized prior to conception, during pregnancy, and after birth. There should be a clear designated primary clinician to ensure continuity of care. Women with thyroid disorders should be seen in joint multidisciplinary clinics. \n\nThyroid function tests in pregnancy should use trimester- and manufacturer-specific pregnancy reference ranges for serum TSH and fT4. Treatment targets for TSH and fT4 are recommended for pregnant women on thyroid-related medication. Iodine supplementation of approximately 200-250μg daily is recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Universal testing for thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy is not recommended.\n\nThe benefit of treatment is not yet proven. Targeted testing for thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women at risk is recommended for improving pregnancy outcomes. Testing should be carried out in women with specific risk factors, such as a personal history of thyroid disorder, autoimmune conditions, or a history of late miscarriage or stillbirth. Levothyroxine treatment is recommended for pregnant women with severe subclinical hypothyroidism to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism. Testing and treatment should be initiated as early as possible in pregnancy for optimal outcomes.\n\nTo reduce the risk of hypothyroidism in pregnancy, women with low fT4 should be referred for further investigation. Women on levothyroxine therapy should increase their dose by 25%-30% upon a positive pregnancy test. Dose adjustments may be needed during pregnancy. Regular monitoring of TSH and fT4 levels is recommended to maintain thyroid function within normal ranges. Routine testing for TPO antibodies in pregnancy is not recommended unless there is thyroid dysfunction. Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to adverse outcomes in pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy counseling is advised for women with hyperthyroidism to minimize risks to the mother and fetus. Definitive treatment options should be discussed before conception.\n\nMaintenance of euthyroidism during pregnancy is easier in women who have been rendered hypothyroid by definitive treatment. They would require levothyroxine replacement, with dose titrations in pregnancy. Further, the risk of teratogenicity with antithyroid drugs can be avoided. A persistently increased TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level assessed around 6 months post-treatment is associated with increased risk of fetal Graves' disease. Retrospective studies show increased risks of fetal/neonatal Graves' disease with TRAb more than 3 times the assay threshold for positivity. Hyperthyroidism requiring treatment with antithyroid drugs while trying to conceive should use propylthiouracil (PTU) in preference to carbimazole (CMZ), at the lowest effective dose to maintain fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the reference range. All women of childbearing age who develop hyperthyroidism should have a discussion regarding potential future pregnancy. The risks and benefits of all treatment options should be discussed. If the woman is on levothyroxine replacement following definitive thyroid ablation or thyroidectomy, then optimal TSH and fT4 concentrations should be achieved prior to trying conception. Following radioiodine treatment, TRAb concentrations may rise, increasing the risk of fetal Graves' disease. Surgery may be the better option in women with high TRAb concentrations. Women who are in remission from Graves' disease are unlikely to relapse during pregnancy. Antithyroid drugs should be monitored regularly during pregnancy. Titration of antithyroid drugs should target fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the pregnancy reference range. Neonates of women with known Graves' disease should have their thyroid function monitored soon after birth. Treatment with antithyroid drugs is the mainstay of treatment of active hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Potential teratogenic effects have been linked to antithyroid drugs. The lowest effective dose of antithyroid drugs should be used targeting serum fT4 at the upper half of the pregnancy reference range. In rare cases of isolated fetal hyperthyroidism, a block replace regimen may be indicated. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be used temporarily for control of hyperthyroid symptoms.\n\nIt is unlikely that antithyroid drugs will affect the fetus. Women with a history of hyperthyroidism in remission do not require additional fetal surveillance. However, in those with active Graves' hyperthyroidism, fetal surveillance is recommended. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is self-limiting and does not require treatment. Women with a history of hyperthyroidism should have thyroid function tested postpartum. Antithyroid drugs are safe during breastfeeding. Thyroid nodules in pregnancy should be monitored, and if there is suspicion of malignancy, a fine needle aspiration can be safely performed. Surgical intervention for thyroid enlargement should be considered between 14-22 weeks of gestation.\n\nWomen should be counseled that there is no difference in the rate of recurrence or long-term survival with well-differentiated thyroid cancer identified during pregnancy compared with those diagnosed outside of pregnancy. Generally, surgery for most common thyroid cancers diagnosed in pregnancy can be deferred until after birth unless there is substantial growth, significant airway compression, or rapidly progressive disease. Postpartum Thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies to TPO and thyroglobulin, occurring in 5%-10% of unselected pregnancies. The classical form of PPT is triphasic with an initial thyrotoxic phase followed by a transient hypothyroid phase and then a return to euthyroidism. Routine testing for PPT is not recommended. In women with risk factors for PPT who experience symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, thyroid function tests should be performed. Levothyroxine replacement is appropriate for women who are very symptomatic during the hypothyroid phase of PPT or actively trying to become pregnant. Antithyroid drugs are not indicated in the management of the thyrotoxic phase of PPT. Consider treatment of symptomatic women in the thyrotoxic phase with beta-blockers. Following restoration of euthyroidism, monitor serum TSH annually in women with a history of PPT as they continue to be at risk of developing permanent hypothyroidism. There is insufficient evidence to recommend levothyroxine prophylaxis, or either iodine or selenium supplementation to prevent or treat PPT.\n\nImportance of Iodine Nutrition During Pregnancy, Placenta as a Compensatory Iodine Storage Organ, Effects of Iodine Deficiency in Pregnancy and Infancy, Thyroid Hormone Action in the Placenta, Neurodevelopmental Actions of Thyroid Hormone, Maternal Thyroid Hormones and Fetal Brain Development, Role of the Placenta in Thyroid Hormone Delivery to the Fetus.\n\nClinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and postpartum. It includes information on the importance of iodine supplementation for pregnant women to prevent neurological damage to the fetus. The guideline also discusses the impact of iodine deficiency on child growth and development, emphasizing the need for adequate iodine intake during pregnancy. The guideline recommends routine testing for hypothyroidism during pregnancy and postpartum to ensure optimal thyroid function.\n\nUniversal screening detects two times more thyroid disorders in early pregnancy than targeted high-risk case finding.

It is important to monitor thyroid function in pregnant women with thyroid antibodies to prevent postpartum depression. Selenium supplementation may influence postpartum thyroid status in women with thyroid antibodies. Further research is needed to assess the safety of iodine supplementation in these women.\n\nEmployers should not use these guidelines as prescriptive directions, but rather as general recommendations. Any deviation from local protocols should be documented in the patient's case notes.",
      "Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth\nRecommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS, offering planned VBAC to most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. VBAC success rate is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being a predictor of success. Planned VBAC should be conducted in a suitably staffed delivery suite. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis given. VBAC may not be suitable for pregnancies with certain complications. A structured antenatal care schedule should be followed, with counselling by a member of the maternity team. VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with certain risk factors may have increased adverse outcomes with VBAC.\n\nPrevious caesarean deliveries increase the risk of placenta praevia and placenta accreta in subsequent pregnancies. Women with two or more prior caesareans may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, post-date pregnancy, maternal age over 40, obesity, and decreased myometrial thickness. Antenatal counselling should be individualized and documented, with consideration of VBAC success rates and future reproductive preferences. Planned VBAC has fewer complications than ERCS, with a small risk of uterine rupture. VBAC is associated with a slightly increased risk of stillbirth, while ERCS has a higher risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Long-term outcomes of repeated ERCS include increased risks of placenta praevia and accreta. Consideration should be given to attempting VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies.\n\nThe NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase in serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared to ERCS. A summary of outcomes indicates a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC compared to ERCS. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Induction and augmentation of VBAC labour are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be given, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Recommended practices for ERCS are outlined in the NICE caesarean section guideline.\n\nWomen considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables a reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, particularly reducing the risk of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. Administering maternal corticosteroids may be considered if ERCS is needed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics are more effective in reducing the risk of maternal infection. The choice of thromboprophylaxis should follow RCOG guidance. Special circumstances such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more require a cautious approach when considering VBAC. Induction of labor from 41+0 weeks is recommended to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates in twin pregnancies are similar to singleton pregnancies. Antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is important. Further research is needed on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC with ultrasound, and understanding the increased risk of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery. Auditable topics include documented discussions of risks and benefits of VBAC, successful versus unsuccessful VBAC rates, and maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality.\n\nCondensed version:\n- Various studies have been conducted on the risks and outcomes associated with different modes of delivery after a previous cesarean section.\n- Factors such as uterine rupture, placenta previa, and maternal morbidity have been examined in relation to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and repeat cesarean sections.\n- Patient decision aids and personalized decision-making tools have been developed to assist women in choosing the mode of delivery.\n- It is important to consider the risks and benefits of different delivery options, including the impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes.\n\nIncidence of neonatal respiratory distress after elective caesarean section: pragmatic randomized trial.

Successful VBAC is a vaginal delivery, while unsuccessful VBAC is a cesarean during labor. Uterine rupture is a disruption of the uterine muscle, while uterine dehiscence is a disruption with intact uterine serosa. Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Term delivery-related perinatal death is specific to births at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Neonatal respiratory morbidity includes transient tachypnea and respiratory distress syndrome. Antenatal care includes counseling on delivery options and routine tests. VBAC success rates are influenced by various factors, and guidelines outline intrapartum care for VBAC and ERCS. The pathway for birth choices after cesarean delivery considers risks and benefits, with a focus on VBAC success and uterine rupture risks. The guidelines are based on evidence levels and grades of recommendations.\n\nThe final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2018.",
      "Anaemia during Pregnancy  \nSummary statement: By providing evidence based guidance for Obstetric, Midwifery and Haematology staff on the parameters and treatment for anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. \n\nPurpose: To provide evidence based guidance for staff when caring for women and people with anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. \n\nKey related documents: UH Sussex Maternity SRH& WH guidelines: Antenatal Care and Patient Information, Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage, Postpartum Haemorrhage \n\nApproved by: Joint Obstetric Guideline Group (JOGG): 18th October 2023 \n\nManagement of iron deficiency in pregnancy includes dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy. Anaemia in pregnancy is diagnosed based on hemoglobin levels. \n\nCauses of anaemia in pregnancy include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and other inflammatory disorders. Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. \n\nConsequences of anaemia in pregnancy include higher risk of perinatal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and preterm birth. \n\nScreening for anaemia should be done at booking and 28 weeks, with treatment initiated if hemoglobin levels are below certain thresholds. \n\nWomen and people at high risk for iron deficiency should receive prophylactic iron or have serum ferritin checked. Red cell indices and ferritin levels are used to diagnose iron deficiency. \n\nDietary advice should be given to all pregnant women and people to meet increased iron requirements during pregnancy.\n\nDaily intake of iron during pregnancy is 27 mg, twice that of a non-pregnant person. Iron-rich foods include meat, nuts, beans, dried fruit, whole grains, fortified cereals, soybean flour, and dark green leafy vegetables. Oral iron supplementation is needed once iron deficiency occurs. Oral iron replacement therapy should be recommended if anemia is diagnosed, with a recommended elemental iron dose of 40-80 mg each morning or alternate day. Side effects of oral iron include gastric irritation, nausea, and disturbed bowel function. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, with further checks depending on the degree of anemia and gestational period. Intravenous iron therapy can be considered in cases of non-compliance, intolerance to oral preparations, malabsorption, GI diseases, or poor response to oral iron. IV iron therapy should not be administered out of hours to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Contraindications include a history of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, first trimester of pregnancy, acute or chronic bacteremia, and decompensated liver disease. Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos is the preparation used for IV iron therapy. Techniques to minimize the risk of iron staining during infusion should be followed. Management of hypersensitivity reactions and iron extravasation is important. Efforts should be made to maximize management at birth.\n\nPrioritize iron infusion for pregnant individuals with Hb <100 approaching term to reduce the risk of postpartum complications. Consider IV iron therapy or blood transfusion for those with moderate symptoms of anaemia. Monitor Hb levels postpartum and offer oral iron replacement if needed. Consider blood transfusion only after careful evaluation and explore alternative treatments. Ensure patients are informed of the risks and benefits of transfusion and document discussions and consent.",
      "Clinical Protocol: Cord Prolapse Management\n\nCord prolapse is defined as the descent of the umbilical cord through the cervix alongside or past the presenting part in the presence of ruptured membranes. The overall incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%, with higher rates in breech presentations. Risk factors include long cord, breech presentation, and iatrogenic factors like artificial rupture of membranes.\n\nImmediate action is crucial upon diagnosis, with methods like bladder filling to relieve cord compression. In the hospital setting, a category 1 caesarean birth is recommended within 30 minutes for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. In community settings, immediate transfer to a labor ward is advised.\n\nTraining for maternity care staff is essential, and monitoring through clinical incident forms and audits is recommended. Postnatal debriefing is also encouraged to reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nClinical Protocol: Cord Prolapse Management v1.0\n\nApproval:\n- Departmental Joint Obstetric Guideline Group\n- Women’s and Children Divisional Governance Group\n- Medicines Governance Committee\n- Clinical Document Approval Group\n\nProtocol version control log:\n- Version 1.0, June 2024, S.

      "Fetal Heart Monitoring MP037\n\nScope: This protocol applies to all childbearing women and people.\n\nResponsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance.\n\nFetal Heart Monitoring in the Antenatal Period\n\nAim of Antenatal Fetal Monitoring: To identify a fetus at risk of intrauterine hypoxia and acidaemia.\n\nIntermittent Auscultation: Routine listening is not recommended, but may provide reassurance when requested.\n\nElectronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM): Continuous monitoring is not indicated for low-risk pregnancies.\n\nComputerised CTG (cCTG) – DR Analysis: Provides objective interpretation based on evidence.\n\nGestational Age for cCTG: Agreed at 26/40 for severe pre-term pregnancies.\n\nIndications for DR Criteria: Various clinical indications for antenatal fetal monitoring.\n\nEquipment: Huntleigh Sonicaid Team3 monitor must be used for all antenatal cCTGs.\n\nDuration of DR Monitoring: Initial analysis at 10 minutes, with a maximum of 60 minutes.\n\nInterpreting DR Analysis: Criteria met results in a normal trace, criteria not met requires further monitoring and assessment.\n\nSTV Values: Guidelines for interpreting short-term variation values.\n\nShort Term Variation (STV): Must not be used in isolation for fetal condition assessment.\n\nAn episode of high variation. STV of less than 3ms should be discussed and reviewed immediately by the Consultant.\n\nDO NOT RELY ON THE DR ANALYSIS IN ISOLATION: It may not identify abnormal patterns that may be more obvious on visual interpretation. Ensure holistic assessment of the clinical scenario.\n\nAim of Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring\nTo identify hypoxia before it is sufficient to lead to long-term poor neurological outcome for babies.\n\nInitial Assessment for Monitoring\nPerform an initial assessment of antenatal risk factors for fetal compromise at the onset of labour to determine whether intermittent auscultation (IA) or cardiotocography (CTG) is offered as the initial method of fetal heart rate monitoring.\n\nLow Risk Pregnancies\nOffer intermittent auscultation (IA) of the fetal heart rate in low-risk pregnancies in all birth settings.\n\nIncreased Risk Pregnancies\nOffer continuous fetal monitoring (CTG) in pregnancies with increased risk.\n\nIntermittent Auscultation in Labour\nEnsure one-to-one support is maintained by having a midwife remain with the woman throughout labour. Use a pinard stethoscope or handheld doppler ultrasound device for IA in all practice areas.\n\nActions:\n- Carry out IA immediately after a palpated contraction for at least 1 minute, at least once every 15 minutes, and record the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) on the partogram and in the woman's notes\n- Record accelerations and decelerations, if heard\n- Palpate and record the maternal pulse hourly, or more often if there are any concerns\n- If no fetal heartbeat is detected, offer urgent real-time ultrasound assessment to check fetal viability\n\nSuspected Rising Baseline Rate (BLR) or decelerations:\nIf there is a rising baseline fetal heart rate of ≥20 beats a minute from the start of labour or within the last hour, or decelerations are suspected on IA, actions should include:\n- Carry out IA more frequently\n- Carry out a full review of the whole clinical picture\n\nConfirmation of rising BLR or decelerations:\n- Summon help\n- Advise continuous CTG and explain to the woman or birthing person why it is needed\n- Transfer the woman or birthing person to obstetric-led care if it is safe and appropriate\n\nReturn to intermittent auscultation if continuous CTG monitoring has been started due to concerns arising from intermittent auscultation, and the CTG trace is normal after 20 minutes. If the woman decides to remain on continuous CTG monitoring, so be it.\n\nHourly review\nPerform and document a systematic assessment of the condition of the woman and unborn baby every hour, more frequently if there are concerns. Update the labour ward coordinator (LWC) of progress and escalate concerns sooner if necessary. Discuss the results of each hourly assessment with the woman and base recommendations about care on her preferences. Include birthing companions in these discussions if appropriate.\n\nHomebirth\nIt is recommended that Homebirth Midwives update the LWC every 4 hours on the red phone when confirmed in established labour or staying at a homebirth. This is to ensure the safety and support of the MW at the homebirth.\n\nDocumentation for IA\nDocument the fetal heart rate, woman's pulse, any abnormalities heard, any transfer from IA to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and hourly assessments on women and unborn baby.\n\nContinuous Cardiotocography (CTG) in Labour\nIt is recommended that women with any high-risk features have their baby monitored continuously throughout their labour once it is established.\n\nGestational Age for CTG\nDecisions around fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and the multidisciplinary team.\n\nTelemetry\nEnsure wireless transducers are ready to use and switch from wireless to wired transducers if there is signal loss.\n\nManagement of Continuous Fetal Monitoring\nOffer one-to-one care when being continuously monitored.\n\nCTG Reviews\nSystematically assess the CTG trace every 30 minutes and document the review in the woman's record.\n\nFresh Eyes\nOn an hourly basis, another Midwife or Obstetrician should review all continuous CTGs alongside the midwife providing care.\n\nInterpretation of the INTRAPARTUM CTG\nAssess and document contractions, baseline fetal heart rate, variability, decelerations, and accelerations. Categorize the overall CTG trace as normal, suspicious, or pathological based on these features.\n\nContractions\nRecord contraction frequency and length on the CTG trace and take action if there are more than 5 contractions per 10 minutes.\n\nBaseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)\nDifferentiate between fetal and maternal heartbeats when assessing baseline FHR.\n\nVariability\nAssess variability and take into account certain factors when evaluating fetal heart rate variability.\n\nDecelerations\nDefine decelerations and consider concerning characteristics when evaluating them. Take action if there is a significant reduction in variability or other CTG changes\n\nFailure or slow return to baseline fetal heart rate\n• Loss of previously present shouldering.\n\nWHITE AMBER RED\nNo decelerations\nOR\nEarly decelerations\nOR\nVariable decelerations that are not evolving to have concerning characteristics\nRepetitive variable decelerations with any concerning characteristics for less than 30 minutes\nOR\nVariable decelerations with any concerning characteristics for more than 30 minutes\nOR\nrepetitive late decelerations for less than 30 minutes\nRepetitive variable decelerations with any concerning characteristics for more than 30 minutes\nOR\nRepetive late decelerations for more than 30 minutes\nOR\nAcute bradycardia or a single prolonged deceleration lasting 3 minutes or more\n\n*If there are decelerations lasting longer than 30 minutes in the presence of either rise in baseline heart rate or reduced variability, start conservative measure and carry out urgent obstetric review. Take into account the following to determine the need to expedite birth:\n• Sepsis\n• Presence of meconium\n• Slow progress of labour\n• Use of oxytocin\nIf variable decelerations with no concerning characteristics and no other CTG changes, including no rise in the baseline fetal heart rate, are observed:\n• Be aware that these are very common, can be a normal feature in an otherwise uncomplicated labour and birth, and are usually a result of cord compression\n• Support the woman to change position or mobilise\n\nTake into account that early decelerations are uncommon and usually associated with head compression and that they are not accompanied by any other CTG changes such as reduced variability or a rise in FHR.\nAccelerations\nDefine accelerations as transient increases in fetal heart rate of 15 beats a minute or more, lasting 15 seconds or more.\n\nClassifying the Intrapartum CTG\n\nNORMAL SUSPICIOUS PATHOLOGICAL\nNo amber or red features. All 4 features are white\nAny 1 feature is amber\nAny 1 feature is red\nOR\n2 or more features are amber\n\nAfter the CTG trace has been classified, discuss with the birth person and their partner what is happening.

Take into account antenatal and intrapartum risk factors, and discuss this with the women or birthing person\n\nConservative Measures\nIf there are concerns about the baby's wellbeing, be aware of the possible underlying causes and start 1 or more of the following conservative measures based on an assessment of the most likely cause(s):\n• Maternal position (this can affect uterine blood flow and cord compression): Encourage the woman to mobilise, adopt an alternative position, and avoid being supine\n• Hypotension. Do not offer intravenous fluids to treat fetal heart rate abnormalities unless the woman is hypotensive or has signs of sepsis. If the woman is hypotensive secondary to an epidural top-up, start intravenous fluids, move her to a left lateral position and call an anaesthetist to review\n• If there is excessive contraction frequency, consider reducing or turning oxytocin off\n\nDo not review numeric data for cCTG classified as normal. Continue recording until criteria are met. Urgent review required for visually abnormal assessment. STV cannot be interpreted before 60 minutes. Auscultate if CTG not indicated. Criteria not met after 60 minutes requires urgent review. STV should be considered for fetus at risk. Continuous CTG advised for various risk factors.",
      "Disengaging a Deeply Impacted Fetal Head at LSCS and Use of Fetal Pillow\n\nThis guideline applies to pregnant individuals requiring a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) at or beyond 37 weeks gestation with a cephalic presentation. It outlines the use of a Fetal Pillow as a first-line action to disengage a deeply impacted fetal head during LSCS. If the fetal head remains impacted, a reverse breech extraction technique can be used as a second-line action. The guideline also provides detailed instructions on how to insert the Fetal Pillow and emphasizes the importance of professional judgment in its application. The management of pre-term cases will depend on individual circumstances and obstetrician's decision-making. The guideline is based on current research and best practice standards.\n\nClinical Guideline: Fetal Pillow Insertion for Impacted Head at LSCS\n\n- Fetal pillow is a disposable soft silicone balloon inserted into the vagina before LSCS to elevate the fetal head in cephalic presentation.\n- Studies suggest it elevates the head by 2-4cm.\n- Indications for fetal pillow use include failed instrumental delivery, full dilatation cesarean with the fetal head at or below the ischial spines, and severe caput or molding.\n- Operator training is required before using the pillow.\n- Various assessments are needed before and during the procedure.\n- Perceived difficulty of delivering the head, mode of delivery, Apgar score, injuries to the baby, cord gases, SCBU admission, uterine incision extensions, estimated blood loss, bladder injury, and ICU/HDU admission should all be documented during the procedure.",
      "Hypertension and preeclampsia in pregnancy Maternity Protocol: MP019 Date agreed: April 2022\n\nKey Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.\n\nScope: This protocol applies to all pregnant women/people with Hypertensive Disease\n\nResponsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians: To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. Management Team: To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations.\n\nDefinitions: Hypertension is systolic over 140mmHg on two separate occasions in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is raised BP on two occasions at >20/40 gestation with significant proteinuria.\n\nAntenatal Management: Assessing proteinuria in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is important. Referrals and management should be immediate for high-risk individuals. Antihypertensive drugs like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa can be considered.\n\nManagement of Chronic Hypertension: Pre-pregnancy advice includes weight management, exercise, and healthy eating. Antihypertensive drugs like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa can be considered based on individual factors. Regular antenatal appointments and timing of birth are crucial.\n\nDo not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women/people with chronic hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, with or without antihypertensive treatment, unless there are other medical indications or fetal growth restriction. For women/people with chronic hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment timing of birth should be agreed after 37 weeks between the woman and the senior obstetrician. If planned early birth is necessary offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate if indicated. Measure blood pressure daily for the first 2 days after birth and at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth. Aim to keep blood pressure lower than 140/90 mmHg and continue antihypertensive treatment if required. Consider labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa for treatment of gestational hypertension. Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women/people with gestational hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, unless there are other medical indications or fetal growth restriction. If planned early birth is necessary offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate if indicated. Measure blood pressure daily for the first 2 days after birth and at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth. Continue antihypertensive treatment if required. Offer labe talol to treat hypertension, nifedipine for women/people in whom labetalol is not suitable, or methyldopa if labetalol or nifedipine are not suitable. Women/people with severe hypertension should be managed in a high dependency unit environment. If a woman in a critical care setting has severe hypertension or severe pre-eclampsia, give intravenous magnesium sulphate. Consider prophylactic magnesium sulphate treatment if certain features of severe pre-eclampsia are present. Recurrent fits should be treated with a further dose of magnesium sulphate. Do not use diazepam, phenytoin, or other anticonvulsants as an alternative to magnesium sulphate in women/people with eclampsia. Treat women/people with blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg or MAP 125 or more during pregnancy or after birth.\n\nLabetalol infusion is the first-line treatment for hypertension in pregnant women due to its effectiveness and rapid onset of action. Initial dose is 200mg orally or 20mg intravenously, with a maximum cumulative dose of 300mg. Continuous IV infusion can also be used. If target blood pressure is not achieved, switch to another class of agent. Labetalol is contraindicated in patients with a history of oral steroid-dependent asthma. Oral nifedipine is the second-line treatment but may cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure. Intravenous hydralazine is the third-line treatment. Monitoring of blood pressure and fetal well-being is essential, and delivery should be considered as the only cure for pre-eclampsia. Postnatal care includes monitoring blood pressure and offering antihypertensive treatment if necessary. Haematological and biochemical monitoring should be conducted postpartum to assess kidney function. Fetal monitoring should also be performed in cases of chronic hypertension.\n\n15.6.2 In women/people with chronic hypertension, only carry out cardiotocography if clinically indicated. \n\n15.7 Fetal monitoring in gestational hypertension\n15.7.1 In women/people with gestational hypertension, carry out an ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry at diagnosis and if normal repeat every 2 to 4 weeks, if clinically indicated. \n15.7.2 In women/people with gestational hypertension, only carry out cardiotocography if clinically indicated. \n\n15.8 Fetal monitoring in pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension\n15.8.1 Carry out cardiotocography at diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension.\n15.8.2 If conservative management of pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension is planned, carry out all the following tests at diagnosis:\n15.8.2.1 Ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment\n15.8.2.2 Umbilical artery doppler velocimetry\n15.8.3 If the results of all fetal monitoring are normal in women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, do not routinely repeat cardiotocography unless clinically indicated.\n15.8.4 In women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, repeat cardiotocography if any of the following occur:\n15.8.4.1 The woman reports a change in fetal movement\n15.8.4.2 Vaginal bleeding\n15.8.4.3 Abdominal pain\n15.8.4.4 Deterioration in maternal condition\n15.8.5 In women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, repeat ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment or umbilical artery doppler velocimetry every 2 weeks, with subsequent surveillance and monitoring determined by the findings of these scans.\n15.8.6 For women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, write a care plan that includes all of the following:\n15.8.6.1 The timing and nature of future fetal monitoring\n15.8.6.2 Fetal indications for birth and if and when antenatal corticosteroids should be given\n15.8.6.3 Plans for discussion with neonatal paediatricians and obstetric anaesthetists\n\n16 Women/people who need additional fetal monitoring\n16.1 Carry out an ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry starting at between 28 and 30 weeks (or at least 2 weeks before previous gestational age of onset if earlier than 28 weeks) and repeating 4 weeks later in women/people with previous:\n16.1.1 Severe pre-eclampsia\n16.1.2 Pre-eclampsia that resulted in birth before 34 weeks\n16.1.3 Pre-eclampsia with a baby whose birth weight was less than the 10th centile\n16.1.4 Intrauterine death\n16.1.5 Placental abruption\n16.2 In women/people who need additional fetal monitoring as above, carry out cardiotocography only if clinically indicated.\n\n17 Intrapartum care\n17.1 Give advice and treatment to women/people in line with the NICE guideline on intrapartum care, unless there are recommendations in this guideline on the same topic.

The OAA/DAS have created algorithms for managing the unanticipated difficult airway for pregnant patients.\n\n1.0 OAA/DAS Guideline (2015)",
      "Management of Breech Presentation and ECV (RSCH PRH only) MP046\n\nBreech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with the buttocks, legs, or feet in the lower uterine segment closest to the cervix. The incidence of breech presentation decreases with advancing gestational age. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are increased with breech presentation compared with cephalic presentation.\n\nTypes of breech presentation include frank or extended breech, complete or flexed breech, footling breech, and kneeling breech.\n\nPregnant individuals with suspected breech presentation should be monitored, and those with confirmed breech presentation should be offered external cephalic version (ECV). ECV should be booked at 36-37 weeks of gestation. The success rate of ECV is approximately 50%. Complementary therapies like moxibustion may be considered for breech presentation.\n\nAbsolute contraindications for ECV include conditions like placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers. ECV should be performed by trained obstetricians and monitored for complications.\n\nThose declining ECV or with persistent breech presentation should be informed of their birth options, including planned caesarean section or vaginal breech birth. Risks to both the baby and the mother should be discussed, and individualized care plans should be developed.\n\nPregnant individuals choosing elective LSCS for breech presentation should be informed about the timing and potential risks. Those opting for vaginal breech birth should undergo antenatal assessment and be referred to appropriate clinics for care.\n\n7.1.2 Thorough assessment for risk factors in planned vaginal breech birth is essential. Higher risk factors include hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise. \n7.1.3 If any risk factor is identified, pregnant individuals should be counseled that planned vaginal birth is associated with increased perinatal risk and caesarean section is recommended. \n7.1.4 All information, discussions, decisions, and referrals should be documented clearly in the notes by the clinician providing care.\n7.2 A detailed birth plan should be made with the pregnant individual following discussion with a consultant midwife and consultant obstetrician. \n7.3 Pregnant individuals should be recommended to have their labor and birth in an obstetric unit with access to theaters for immediate caesarean section and neonatal support. \n7.4 Pregnant individuals should be advised to phone the maternity unit immediately if they have spontaneous rupture of membranes or are concerned about fetal movements. \n7.5 Induction of labor is not recommended for babies in the breech position unless certain criteria are met. \n8.1 It is recommended to have a multidisciplinary team approach to labor and birth care for planned vaginal breech birth. \n8.2 Once labor is established, it is recommended to inform the necessary medical professionals and ensure plans of care are made with the mother, midwife, and obstetric team. \n8.3 All birthing individuals should be offered continuous CTG monitoring in established labor. \n8.4 Passage of fresh meconium during labor with a breech presentation may not require intervention if the CTG is normal. \n8.5 Maternal observations should be performed regularly throughout labor. \n8.6 An intravenous cannula is recommended on admission in labor for individuals with anticipated difficulty with IV access. \n8.7 Birthing individuals should be encouraged to adopt an upright position and be mobile in labor. \n8.8 All birthing individuals have the full range of pain relief options available to them. \n8.9 Birthing individuals should feel calm, in control, and supported during labor and birth. \n9 Management of undiagnosed breech presentation in labor should depend on various factors and informed consent. \n10 Progress in labor should be monitored closely, and slow progress in breech labors may require a low threshold for advising LSCS. \n11 General principles for care during the second stage of labor should include informing the full MDT, preparing for birth, and monitoring descent of the breech. \n12 Progressive descent of the breech in the second stage of labor is crucial, and interventions may be required if there is poor progress. \n13 Active second stage and assisted vaginal breech maneuvers may be necessary to expedite breech birth if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or delay in delivery.\n\nThe choice of manoeuvres used for delivery of the breech should depend on the experience and preference of the attending doctor or midwife. A semirecumbent or all-fours position may be adopted for delivery based on maternal preference and experience of the attendant. Involuntary pushing should not start until the breech is visible. Cord compression is common once the buttocks have passed the perineum. Traction should never be applied to the breech. Selective episiotomy is recommended. Signs of assistance during delivery include lack of tone or color. Delay with the body of the baby should be managed with gentle pressure on the legs. Delay with the arms may require Lovset's manoeuvre. Delay in delivery of the after-coming head may require the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre. Physiological breech birth is usually performed in the all-fours position. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation. Caesarean section is recommended for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech. Organizational support for vaginal breech delivery should include skills and drills training. All doctors and midwives should attend skills and drills training in vaginal breech birth at least once per year.\n\n- If opting for vaginal breech, please be aware that in some circumstances it will not be appropriate and you will be advised to have an emergency caesarean.\n- Individual risk assessment must be quickly undertaken.\n- We have discussed the risks of vaginal breech birth and caesarean section.\n- Caesarean should be recommended for an unplanned vaginal breech presenting in the first stage of labor.\n- Factors such as fetal hyperextended neck, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of fetal compromise may require a caesarean section.\n- Maternal factors such as previous LSCS, raised BMI, maternal age >40 years, and other obstetric complications may also require a caesarean section.",
      "Shoulder Dystocia  \n \nDefinition: Delivery requiring additional obstetric manoeuvres after gentle downward traction fails.  \n \nIdentification of risk factors: Previous shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal BMI > 30, induction of labor, prolonged labor, prolonged second stage, oxytocin augmentation, assisted vaginal delivery.  \n \nPrevention: No evidence for early induction or elective caesarean for suspected macrosomia in non-diabetic women. Induction at 38 weeks may reduce incidence in gestational diabetes. Caesarean considered for suspected macrosomia in pregnancies with maternal diabetes.  \n \nDiagnosis: Gentle traction used to diagnose shoulder dystocia.  \n \nManagement: McRoberts' manoeuvre first, followed by suprapubic pressure. Avoid lateral and downward traction.  \n \nDocumentation: Complete shoulder dystocia proforma in maternal notes.  \n \nPost-Delivery Care: Increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal tears.  \n \nTraining: Maintain skills in dealing with shoulder dystocia for quicker and fewer complications.\n\nAppendix C - Shoulder Dystocia Proforma from the new labour notes 2013.",

Effective communication and responsibilities are crucial for management.\n\nClear communication between medical staff is vital in managing obstetric hemorrhage. The labor ward coordinator should ensure important information is communicated clearly. In cases of major hemorrhage, the Obstetric Registrar and Anaesthetic Registrar should be contacted for immediate management. For home births, midwives should initiate emergency management and call for urgent transfer if needed. In cases of primary hemorrhage, basic measures should be taken to facilitate resuscitation. For major and massive hemorrhage, specific protocols should be followed, including summoning the correct team and initiating emergency management. Communication with the hematology department and regular monitoring of blood components are essential. In cases of secondary hemorrhage, antibiotics may be indicated, and surgical measures may be necessary if bleeding persists. Postnatal care for women who have had a hemorrhage should include close monitoring and follow-up. Women who decline blood products should be informed of the risks and have a plan in place. Antenatal care should involve developing a care plan with medical staff and religious advisors if needed. Each woman's individual choices regarding interventions should be respected. Regular monitoring of blood levels and iron stores is important throughout pregnancy.\n\nAn ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site. There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s Witness, and if any complication is noted during the antenatal period, the Consultant Obstetrician must be informed. A clear individual management plan should be documented in the maternal notes where blood products will be declined. All women who wish not to receive blood products should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist. It is important for experienced staff to provide care during labor and birth. Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered, and an FBC should be performed before discharge home. Accurate documentation is essential, and thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is arrested and coagulopathy is corrected. Debriefing is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team, and a 6-week follow-up appointment should be offered to discuss the events in more detail. A datix needs to be completed for all MOHs >1500ml.",
      "Perinatal Collapse in Pregnancy & Puerperium Maternity Protocol: MP055 Date agreed: March 2022 University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East \n\nKey Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.\n\nScope: This protocol applies to all seriously ill women and all women found collapsed in the peri-partum period.\n\nResponsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.\n\nMaternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium: Maternal collapse is a rare but life-threatening event, with a wide-ranging etiology. Prompt and effective resuscitation is crucial for the mother and fetus.\n\nImmediate Emergency Resuscitative Management: Call for help, check for signs of life, initiate basic life support, give oxygen, obtain venous access, start fluid resuscitation, and institute advanced life support as needed.\n\nProcess for the Use of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS): MEOWS chart should be used for antenatal patients, postnatal women with risk factors or complications, and those who have undergone surgical intervention. Regular observations and documentation are essential.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of Staff Groups: Midwives should escalate to management, provide one-to-one care, and document observations. Obstetricians should be involved in care plans and attend all cases of maternal collapse. Anaesthetists should be notified for severely ill pregnant women and liaise with ITU if necessary. All team members should consider Critical Care Outreach team for support. Fast bleep the Obstetric Registrar for clinical deterioration or loss of consciousness.\n\nGuidance for staff on when to involve clinicians from outside the maternity service: Specialist clinicians should be involved for specific medical issues beyond common obstetric complications. Contact them via the hospital switchboard as needed.\n\nHaematologist and Microbiologists are key in managing blood disorders and sepsis/infection/antibiotic issues. \n\nITU admissions require collaboration between Obstetrician, Anaesthetic Consultant, and ITU Consultant. \n\nMajor obstetric haemorrhage is a common cause of maternal collapse, with causes including postpartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and ectopic pregnancy. \n\nCardiac disease is a leading cause of maternal death, with various causes including ischaemia and sudden arrhythmic cardiac death. \n\nThromboembolism is a common cause of direct maternal death, and appropriate thromboprophylaxis is crucial. \n\nAmniotic fluid embolism presents as collapse during labor or birth and requires supportive management. \n\nSepsis is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt and appropriate therapy. \n\nDrug toxicity should be considered in cases of collapse, with magnesium sulphate and local anaesthetic agents being common culprits. \n\nEclampsia and intracranial hemorrhage are important considerations in cases of maternal collapse. \n\nAnaphylaxis is a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction that can lead to collapse and requires immediate intervention.\n\nThe incidence of severe perioperative obstetric anaphylaxis is between 1 and 3.5 per 100,000, with a mortality rate of approximately 1%. Anaphylaxis is likely when sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms, life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems, and skin and/or mucosal changes are present. Exposure to a known allergen for the woman supports the diagnosis, but many cases occur with no previous history. Mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In cases of anaphylaxis, all potential causative agents should be removed, and the ABCDE approach to assessment and resuscitation followed. The treatment for anaphylaxis is 1:1000 adrenaline 500 micrograms intramuscularly, with adjuvant therapy consisting of chlorphenamine 10mg and hydrocortisone 200 mg. Other causes of collapse in pregnant women include hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. Aortocaval compression can occur from around 20 weeks of gestation onwards, reducing venous return in the supine position. Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the standard ABCDE approach, with some modifications for maternal physiology, in particular relief of aortocaval compression. If there is no response to correctly performed CPR within 4 minutes of maternal collapse, perimortem caesarean section should be considered to assist maternal resuscitation. Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age, and access to emergency care, with survival rates being poorer if the collapse occurs out of hospital. All cases of maternal collapse should generate a clinical incident form and be reviewed through the clinical governance process. All maternity staff should have annual formal multidisciplinary training in ABLS and the management of maternal collapse. Life support training improves resuscitation skills.\n\nDebriefing is recommended for the woman, the family, and the staff involved in the event. Maternal collapse can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, postnatal depression, and tocophobia. Debriefing is an important part of holistic maternity care and should be offered by a competent professional to support the ongoing mental health of all concerned. It is recommended to audit the management of maternal collapse and ensure compliance with incident reporting. Additionally, useful links and support groups are provided for further information and resources.",

      "In pregnancies complicated by diabetes, a key therapeutic goal is avoidance of maternal hyperglycemia to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. During labor, glycemic targets should be 70 to 125 mg/dL. Factors affecting glycemic management include metabolic demands of labor, food restriction, and dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. Maternal hyperglycemia during labor is linked to fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Glucose monitoring and insulin management should be individualized based on the type of diabetes and glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitoring devices may be used, and protocols for intrapartum intravenous insulin are available. Neonatal hypoglycemia may result from maternal hyperglycemia and requires monitoring and management.\n\nPatients on insulin pumps can continue using them during labor and delivery hospitalization. Patients who prefer not to use their pumps should follow the same insulin infusion management as those on multiple daily injections. Hospitals should have policies for patients using their insulin pumps during labor, including moving the infusion site away from the lower abdomen. Before food is restricted, insulin pump users will need prandial insulin coverage. After food is restricted, a constant infusion of dextrose-containing fluids is started for patients with blood glucose ≤ 125 mg/dL. Intrapartum insulin requirements vary for patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients on metformin should hold the medication on admission for delivery.\n\nFor scheduled cesarean birth in patients receiving insulin, insulin pump users can continue using their pumps according to hospital policy. Subcutaneous correctional insulin can be used for patients with gestational diabetes during labor. Monitoring glucose levels every hour is recommended for patients on insulin due to the risk of hypoglycemia. Pre- and intraoperative hyperglycemia is treated with insulin. Patients using metformin should hold the medication on the morning of the cesarean. Patients with gestational diabetes managed with nutritional therapy alone are managed similarly to those without diabetes undergoing a scheduled cesarean birth. Induction of labor can be managed similarly to spontaneous labor. Insulin requirements drop immediately after birth for patients with type 1 diabetes, reaching a nadir at approximately 48 hours postpartum. Glycemic monitoring and targets are recommended postpartum. Insulin management is adjusted postpartum based on capillary blood glucose levels.\n\nInitial postpartum insulin dosing is typically 30 to 35 percent of antenatal doses. Insulin degludec may be held after delivery to prevent postpartum hypoglycemia. Basal, prandial, and correctional insulin is given via injections or pump. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin regimen is necessary postpartum. Breastfeeding mothers may have lower insulin requirements. Metformin is recommended for type 2 diabetes postpartum. Insulin and metformin are compatible with breastfeeding. Additional therapies for type 2 diabetes postpartum may be limited in breastfeeding patients. Gestational diabetes may not require diabetes medications postpartum. Breastfeeding may prevent type 2 diabetes in mothers with a history of gestational diabetes. Close monitoring of glucose levels postpartum is important. Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is recommended. Target blood glucose levels may vary during labor and postpartum. Insulin may be adjusted based on individual needs postpartum.\n\nDuring labor, patients with gestational diabetes can often be managed with subcutaneous correctional insulin. If blood glucose levels are persistently above the goal of 125 mg/dL despite subcutaneous insulin, an insulin infusion can be initiated. Close follow-up for the development of overt diabetes is required.\n\n19.4 mmol/L] 8 units\n351 to 400 mg/dL [19.5 to 22.2 mmol/L] 10 units\nPreexisting (pregestational) and gestational diabetes: Intrapartum and postpartum glucose management - UpToDate",
      "Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term refers to the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of regular contractions. The key decision in managing term PROM is whether to induce labor or wait for spontaneous labor to begin. Inducing labor reduces the risk of maternal and newborn infection. Oxytocin induction is the preferred approach for patients with no contraindications to labor and vaginal birth. Expectant management may be considered for patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who prefer to wait for labor to begin. Hospitalization is recommended for patients with PROM to reduce the risk of complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used when indicated, but prophylactic antibiotics for PROM at term should be avoided unless certain criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not necessarily preclude expectant management.\n\nMajor organizations recommend induction for patients with term PROM. Induction with oxytocin reduces neonatal infection rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term PROM shows no significant reductions in complications. In patients with ruptured membranes and positive GBS culture, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Expectant management should include monitoring for signs of infection and fetal well-being. Indications for delivery in expectant management include specific clinical scenarios. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for patients with negative GBS culture. Patients with unknown GBS status should be managed based on standard risk assessment. Maternal and fetal monitoring should be performed in expectantly managed term PROM.

      "Uterine fibroids are common in reproductive-age females and can cause symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure or bulk symptoms, fertility issues, and pain. Treatment options include expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection for heavy menstrual bleeding, and medical therapy with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestin-releasing intrauterine devices. Second-tier treatments include GnRH agonists and antagonists, uterine artery embolization, and tranexamic acid. Patients not desiring fertility can choose from various treatment options based on symptom severity and patient preference.\n\nSustained reduction of menstrual bleeding was shown with the treatment for an additional 6 months, with modest side effects. Elagolix alone improved fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding. Relugolix combination therapy was approved for fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding. Linzagolix therapy also showed efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss. GnRH agonists are used for preoperative therapy or transitional therapy for patients in late perimenopause. Uterine artery embolization is a minimally invasive option for managing fibroid symptoms. Less invasive interventional therapies are available for patients who desire uterine preservation. Focused ultrasound surgery is a noninvasive technique for treating fibroids. Endometrial ablation has a limited role in patients with bleeding disorders. Traditional surgery options include hysterectomy and myomectomy.\n\nHysterectomy is a common surgical treatment for uterine fibroids, but it is associated with long-term risks. Myomectomy is advised as an alternative for patients who desire to preserve their uterus. Patients with bulk or pain symptoms can consider UAE or GnRH analogs. For patients desiring fertility, hysteroscopic myomectomy is recommended for submucosal fibroids, while myomectomy via laparoscopy or open abdominal incision is suggested for other types of fibroids. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred for patients with specific criteria such as smaller uterine size and fewer fibroids.\n\nIn a systematic review of six randomized trials, laparoscopic myomectomy had a longer operative duration but less blood loss compared to open abdominal myomectomy. The overall risk of complications was lower for laparoscopic myomectomy, with similar rates of major complications and recurrent myomas. Laparoscopic approach may result in less severe adhesive disease and higher surgical complication rates in certain populations. Surgical approach does not affect ovarian reserve. Further randomized trials are needed to compare these procedures. Open abdominal myomectomy is recommended for patients with numerous or larger fibroids. Expectant management can be employed for patients with uterine fibroids. Patients with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not desire future fertility can consider hysteroscopic myomectomy or medical therapy as initial treatment options. Second-tier medical treatments for fibroid-associated HMB include GnRH agonists and antagonists. Aromatase inhibitors and androgenic compounds are not recommended for fibroid treatment.\n\nInvasive treatment options for uterine fibroids include UAE and myomectomy. Patients who do not desire future fertility may consider hysterectomy. For patients with bulk or pain symptoms, GnRH analogs and UAE are options. Patients desiring pregnancy may opt for myomectomy or hysteroscopic myomectomy. Laparoscopic myomectomy is suggested for technically feasible cases. Myomectomy is preferred over UAE and focused ultrasound surgery for patients desiring pregnancy.\n\nAl-Hendy A, Venturella R, Arjona Ferreira JC, et al.

      "Approach to the patient with pregnancy of unknown location\n\nPregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used when a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound that shows neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. This term requires continued evaluation until a final diagnosis is obtained. Distinguishing between these entities is crucial to prevent severe maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe natural history of PUL includes eventual IUP, ectopic pregnancy, or unresolved cases. Patients may present with symptoms of early pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy, or be asymptomatic. The differential diagnosis includes various conditions such as early IUP, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and rare entities.\n\nInitial evaluation involves history, physical examination, and transvaginal ultrasound. Further diagnostic workup is needed based on ultrasound findings. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements and TVUS assessment are done for selected patients. hCG rise and ratio are used to predict outcomes, but clinical judgment should always guide decision-making.\n\nPatients with Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) may require further evaluation to determine the final diagnosis, such as ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or spontaneous resolution. Management depends on the patient's hemodynamic stability and pregnancy desires. Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate surgical intervention, while stable patients may undergo expectant management with regular hCG and ultrasound assessments. For undesired pregnancies, proactive intervention may be preferred. Special considerations are needed for patients with persistent hCG elevations or nonpregnancy-related causes.\n\nCondensed text:\n\nGynecol 2025; 232:1.\n\n2.

      "Pregnancy loss, also known as miscarriage, is defined as a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 20 weeks of gestation. Early pregnancy loss, which occurs in the first trimester, is the most common type. The diagnosis is confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound evaluation. Ultrasound is performed in pregnant individuals with signs of pregnancy loss to confirm intrauterine gestation and exclude ectopic pregnancy. The timing of ultrasound varies, with a pelvic ultrasound recommended at seven weeks of gestation to identify embryonic cardiac activity. Pregnancy loss can be diagnosed with single or serial ultrasound studies, with criteria based on gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity. Different criteria exist for different levels of diagnostic certainty, with considerations for patient preferences and clinical context. The choice of ultrasound criteria depends on the expertise of the sonographer and quality of equipment.\n\n- A gestational sac 225 mm in mean diameter without a yolk sac or embryo.\n- An embryo with a CRL 27 mm without cardiac activity.\n- Absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 22 weeks from a prior ultrasound showing a gestational sac without a yolk sac.\n- After a pelvic ultrasound showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac, absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 211 days.\n- Initial criteria for nonviable early pregnancy include CRL of 5mm without cardiac activity and an empty gestational sac measuring 16 mm in mean diameter.\n- Scenarios that can make the assessment of early pregnancy more challenging include discrepancy in gestational duration, multiple gestations, and pregnancy of unknown location.\n- Additional ultrasound findings suggestive of non-viable pregnancy include expanded or empty amnion.\n- Findings suggestive of poor outcome include irregularly shaped gestational sac, moderate or large subchorionic hematoma, and chorionic bump.\n- Findings consistent with live pregnancy include a gestational sac with a yolk sac only and a normal pregnancy with amnion.\n\n- Guidelines for transvaginal ultrasonographic diagnosis of pregnancy failure in a woman with an intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability\n- Diagnosis of early pregnancy loss with transvaginal ultrasound\n- Comparison of ultrasound criteria used to diagnose pregnancy loss\n\nProspective study comparing ultrasound techniques for early pregnancy diagnosis.

Recommendations include the use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent vertical transmission of HIV, mode of delivery, and management of specific patient populations. Changes in recommendations include updated prevalence data on HIV in pregnancy, updated advice on infant feeding, expanded section on psychosocial care, and new data on antiretroviral safety. All women are recommended to start treatment and remain on lifelong treatment.\\n\\n- Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team\\n- Pregnant women living with HIV should be offered peer support\\n- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken\\n- Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV\\n- Pregnant women who are newly diagnosed with HIV do not require any additional baseline investigations\\n- HIV resistance testing should be completed before initiation of treatment\\n- In women conceiving on cART, there should be a minimum of one CD4 cell count at baseline and one at delivery\\n- Women who commence cART in pregnancy should have regular CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load tests\\n- Women conceiving on effective cART should continue treatment\\n- All pregnant women should start ART during pregnancy\\n- Tenofovir DF or abacavir with emtricitabine or lamivudine is recommended as a nucleoside backbone\\n- An integrase inhibitor-based regimen should be considered in certain patients\\n- Women presenting after 28 weeks should commence cART without delay\\n- Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the woman is known\\n\\nWomen with HIV should defer invasive diagnostic tests until viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. If immediate testing is necessary, cART and nevirapine should be given. For mode of delivery, vaginal delivery is supported for viral load <50 copies/mL, while CS is recommended for viral load ≥400 copies/mL. PLCS is recommended for viral load between 50-399 copies/mL. For preterm SROM, intramuscular steroids should be given and delivery timing discussed. Zidovudine infusion is recommended for viral load >1000 copies/mL. All women with HIV should give birth in a facility with pediatric care. Water births are supported for viral load <50 copies/mL. Infant PEP duration is based on risk level and maternal viral load. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended for infants with HIV. Immunizations should follow national guidelines. Formula feeding is recommended for infants born to women with HIV. Lactation suppression is advised if viral load is >50 copies/mL. Breastfeeding is supported for virologically suppressed women. Infant HIV status should be monitored with molecular diagnostics and antibody testing. Postpartum care should include cART continuation, support services assessment, mental health evaluation, contraception discussion, and cervical cytology. Testing partners and older children for HIV is recommended for newly diagnosed women.\\n\\nEP commenced within 4 hours of delivery.  \\n12 Proportion of HIV infected infants reported back to delivering obstetric unit for review  \\n13 Proportion of infants born to women living with HIV who have HIV antibody testing for seroreversion \\nperformed at age 22–24 months.  \\n14 Proportion of infants reviewed postpartum by 6 weeks.  \\n15 Proportion of mothers reviewed postpartum by 6 weeks.  \\n16 Proportion with documented mental health assessment at booking, and at 4 –6 weeks postpartum.  \\n\\nA key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimise a woman’s own health. Furthermore, one \\nof the major successes in the management of individuals living with HIV has been the prevention of vertical \\ntransmission of HIV. With the widespread implementation of routine antenatal screening for HIV, vertical \\ntransmission is now a rare occurrence in the UK. Practice continues to evolve based on observational data, theoretical considerations, and expert opinion. These guidelines aim to provide practical guidance for healthcare workers in managing pregnancy in the context of HIV. \\n\\nParticular areas of focus include psychosocial, infant feeding, neonatal, and postnatal management. The guidelines emphasize the need for antenatal HIV care to be delivered by a multidisciplinary team and recommend mental health assessment at booking and 4 –6 weeks postpartum. Infant feeding advice has been updated, and the use of cabergoline in non-breastfeeding women is discussed. The guidelines also address postpartum management of women living with HIV. \\n\\nThe guidelines provide guidance on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum, with a focus on reducing vertical transmission rates and improving outcomes for both mothers and infants.\\n\\n4. The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after pregnancy  \\n4.1 Psychosocial issues around HIV and pregnancy  \\n- Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).  \\n- Pregnant women living with HIV should be offered peer support.  \\n- Some women may experience psychosocial challenges during and/or after pregnancy.  \\n- HIV is associated with a higher risk of poor mental health.  \\n- Women living with HIV may experience significant psychosocial barriers to accessing care.  \\n- Postnatal depression prevalence among women living with HIV is reported to be between 30% and 53%.  \\n- Factors associated with postnatal depression in women living with HIV include past history of mental health issues, financial concerns, lack of social support, and HIV-related stigma.  \\n- The link between gender-based violence and HIV is well established.  \\n4.1.1 Social issues  \\n- Women living with HIV may have issues relating to social support and immigration.  \\n- Dispersal in pregnant women is generally inappropriate, and treatment for HIV is freely available regardless of immigration status.  \\n- Antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal services are required to be considered 'immediately necessary'.  \\n- Advice can be sought from various organizations for access to healthcare in the UK.  \\n4.1.2 Psychosocial care  \\n- Engagement in care from an MDT is crucial for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV.  \\n- Confidentiality processes impact adherence to ART.  \\n- Adherence to medication is vital for the success of ART.  \\n- Reassurance about confidentiality is important for women living with HIV.  \\n- HIV status should be included in the birth plan.  \\n4.1.3 The antenatal HIV MDT  \\n- The minimum team should comprise an HIV specialist, obstetrician, specialist midwife, and pediatrician.  \\n- Peer support workers are a valuable component of care for women living with HIV.  \\n4.1.4 The psychosocial care of women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy  \\n- Women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy may require the support of an MDT.  \\n- Prompt linkage to HIV care is beneficial for newly diagnosed pregnant women.  \\n- Confidence in disclosing an HIV diagnosis varies among women and cultural factors may influence disclosure.  \\n- Talking about HIV should be encouraged in all women.  \\n- HIV testing of existing children should be raised with all women.  \\n4.2 Perinatal mental health assessment  \\n- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken at booking, and 4-6 weeks postpartum and 3-4 months postpartum.  \\n- Existing NICE guidance on the detection of antenatal and postnatal depression should be followed by HIV MDTs.\\n\\n5.1 Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. For women living with HIV already engaged in care who become pregnant, sexual health screening is suggested. Genital tract infections should be treated according to guidelines. Screening for STIs is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV. Cervical cytology should be managed as per guidelines, with routine cytology deferred until postpartum. Contraception should be discussed antenatally. Pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV do not require additional baseline investigations. Resistance testing should be completed before treatment initiation. CD4 cell counts should be monitored throughout pregnancy.\\n\\nDuring pregnancy, women on cART should have regular HIV viral load tests, liver function tests, and interventions if viral load is not suppressed. Women conceiving on cART should continue treatment, with exceptions for certain regimens. Women on dolutegravir should take folic acid, and all women should start folic acid before pregnancy. It is recommended to continue cART throughout pregnancy and lifelong. Recommended and alternative agents in pregnancy are listed in Table 6.1.\\n\\nThe writing group recommends discussing therapy options with pregnant women to individualize treatment based on their concerns and preferences. Recommended nucleoside backbone combinations for HIV in pregnancy include tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine. Zidovudine monotherapy is not recommended. Treatment should be initiated in pregnant women with baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL by the start of the second trimester. Integrase inhibitor-based regimens are recommended for women with high baseline viral load or treatment failure. Raltegravir and dolutegravir can be used from 6 weeks' gestation. Late-presenting women after 28 weeks should start cART immediately, with consideration for raltegravir or dolutegravir-containing regimens.\\n\\nIn untreated women presenting in labor at term, a stat dose of nevirapine should be given along with oral zidovudine, lamivudine, and raltegravir. Intravenous zidovudine should also be administered during labor. In preterm labor, if the infant cannot absorb oral medications, consider adding double-dose tenofovir DF. Women presenting in labor without a documented HIV result should have an urgent HIV test and treatment should be initiated immediately to prevent vertical transmission. \\n\\nData on teratogenicity and neonatal outcomes of ART in pregnancy are based on various studies. Some antiretrovirals have shown no increased risk of birth defects, while others have inconclusive data. The use of dolutegravir in pregnancy has shown conflicting results, with some studies reporting an increased risk of neural tube defects. Pregnant women on dolutegravir should be informed of these risks and supported in their decision-making. \\n\\nRates of preterm delivery in women with HIV remain high, with some studies implicating boosted PIs. However, data on the association between antiretroviral agents and preterm delivery are complex and vary between populations. Studies have shown conflicting results, with some not finding an association between cART and preterm delivery.\\n\\nAn association between PI-containing cART and PTD has been reported in several studies. The timing of cART initiation, particularly in the first trimester, has also been linked to an increased risk of PTD. Studies have shown that lopinavir/r should be avoided, while atazanavir/r may be preferred if a PI is indicated. Randomized controlled trials have not specifically addressed the impact of ART on PTD rates. The pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals in pregnancy can be affected by physiological changes, but most NRTIs do not require dose adjustments. NNRTIs such as rilpivirine and efavirenz have been studied in pregnancy, with recommendations for monitoring and potential dose adjustments. Integrase inhibitors like raltegravir have shown variable levels during pregnancy, but no adverse events have been observed in infants. PIs, particularly cobicistat-boosted regimens, may have lower exposure during pregnancy and should be used cautiously. Overall, the data on cART and PTD remain complex, emphasizing the importance of safety in pregnancy.\\n\\nSwitch from cobicistat to ritonavir when initiating PIs during pregnancy. Protein binding reductions in the third trimester can increase free drug levels. No dose adjustment is needed for lopinavir/r in pregnancy. Atazanavir may require a dose increase to 400 mg in the third trimester. Consider twice daily darunavir dosing in pregnancy. Limited data on PI formulations in pregnancy. Enfuvirtide does not cross the placenta. Stopping ART postpartum is not recommended. A boosted PI-based regimen is recommended in women with HIV-2. Vertical transmission of HIV-2 is less common than HIV-1. Use ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimen and tenofovir with darunavir/r for HIV-2. Limited data on enfuvirtide, tipranavir, and maraviroc in pregnancy.\\n\\nAntiretroviral therapy for pregnant women living with HIV or hepatitis B: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Referral to a specialist is necessary to address all aspects of care, including effects on pregnancy, antiretroviral management, and prevention of vertical transmission. The prevalence of HBV co-infection in pregnant women varies by region and ethnicity. While there is no evidence of increased vertical transmission of HBV in co-infection compared to mono-infection, the impact of HIV on HBV disease progression is significant. Routine monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Treatment with antiretrovirals active against HBV should be continued during pregnancy. Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and lamivudine are recommended as the backbone of an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-naïve patients with HIV/HBV co-infection. Tenofovir DF should be added to cART if not already included, and lamivudine/emtricitabine may be omitted if necessary. Tenofovir alafenamide can be considered after the first trimester.\\n\\nLamivudine or emtricitabine should not be used as the only active drug against HBV in cART. Emtricitabine is the preferred option to be given with tenofovir DF in women with HBV and HIV. Tenofovir DF is effective at suppressing HBV DNA in mono- and co-infected patients. Liver enzymes should be monitored frequently after starting cART. HAV vaccine is recommended for all HAV non-immune women with HBV and HIV. cART active against both HBV and HIV should be continued postpartum. Neonatal immunisation with or without HBIG should commence within 24 hours of delivery. Maternal cART together with prompt post-delivery neonatal immunoprophylaxis is the ideal approach for preventing vertical transmission of HBV. All pregnant women with active HCV and HIV should be managed jointly with a clinician experienced in the management of these co-infections. LFTs should be repeated regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry are relatively contraindicated during pregnancy. In chronic HCV infection, there is unlikely to be a significant change in the HCV viral load during pregnancy.\\n\\nTreatment of HCV infection is not recommended during pregnancy. Ribavirin is teratogenic and should be discontinued immediately if pregnancy occurs during treatment. DAAs in pregnant women have unknown effects. Thyroid function testing should be included in routine blood tests during IFN therapy. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be avoided in male partners of pregnant women. Women with co-infection should discontinue HCV therapy when pregnancy is confirmed. Effective contraception should be used during and after ribavirin therapy. Pregnant women with both HCV and HIV should not be treated with ribavirin-based DAA therapies. Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all women with both HCV and HIV. HAV vaccination is recommended for non-immune women with both HCV and HIV. Normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if effective cART is being received. cART should be continued postpartum in all women with both HIV and HCV.\\n\\n8.1.1 Fetal ultrasound imaging should be performed as per national guidelines regardless of maternal HIV status. \\n8.1.2 The combined screening test for fetal aneuploidies and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for those who screen as high risk is recommended as this has the best sensitivity and specificity and will minimize the number of women who may need invasive testing. \\n8.1.3 Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the woman is known, and should ideally be deferred until HIV viral load has been adequately suppressed to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. \\n8.1.4 If not on cART and the invasive diagnostic test procedure cannot be delayed until viral suppression is achieved, it is recommended that women should commence cART to include raltegravir and be given a single dose of nevirapine 2 –4 hours prior to the procedure.\\n\\nNo transmissions were observed in women with undetectable plasma viral load during amniocentesis. External cephalic version is recommended for breech presentation. Mode of delivery should be based on plasma viral load results at 36 weeks. Vaginal delivery is supported for viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, while PLCS is recommended for viral loads ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL. Limited data suggest no increased risk of vertical transmission with certain obstetric procedures. Vaginal birth after CS can be considered for women with viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL.\\n\\nIn a consultant-led maternity unit, a trial of labour with proper monitoring and rapid recourse to CS if needed has good outcomes for both the woman and neonate. For women attempting VBAC, 70% achieve vaginal delivery with a low uterine rupture rate. CS for prevention of vertical transmission should be done between 38 and 39 weeks' gestation. Timing of CS is crucial to balance the risks of TTN and labor onset. Immediate delivery within 24 hours is recommended for term pre-labour SROM. For women with SROM and a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate induction or CS is recommended. In cases of preterm SROM, decisions should be made in consultation with the full MDT. Intravenous zidovudine infusion is recommended for certain circumstances. Multiple pregnancies in women with HIV should be managed according to obstetric need. Women with HIV are recommended to give birth in a facility with direct access to pediatric care. Water births should be discussed with caution, especially for women with HIV.\\n\\nInfant PEP should be started within 4 hours of delivery. Zidovudine monotherapy for the infant is recommended for very low-risk cases, while combination PEP should be used for high-risk cases. Neonatal PEP should be started as soon as possible after birth, and within 4 hours. Maternal viral load at the time of delivery is crucial in determining the level of risk and treatment approach.\\n\\nIn the last version of the BHIVA pregnancy guidelines, 4 weeks of oral zidovudine was recommended for all infants except in specific HIGH-RISK circumstances relating to detectable or unknown maternal viral load at the time of delivery. This strategy has been successful in reducing vertical transmission rates in the UK and Ireland. In Germany, a 2-week neonatal zidovudine strategy has been recommended for over 10 years without increased transmission. French cohort data supports the safety of reducing neonatal PEP duration. BHIVA guidelines recommend a 2-week course of zidovudine in VERY LOW RISK situations. European cohort data shows that maternal cART initiated more than 10 weeks before delivery reduces transmission risk. For LOW RISK situations, 2 weeks of zidovudine is recommended if specific criteria are met. For HIGH RISK situations, combination therapy in neonates has shown reduced transmission rates. Combination PEP use in neonates has increased over time, with no advantage of combination PEP over single-drug prophylaxis noted. The choice of triple combination PEP for neonates should be based on specific criteria and expert advice. Intravenous ART in neonates is limited to zidovudine, with specific dosing regimens for premature infants. All infant PEP should be initiated within 4 hours of delivery.\\n\\nImmediate administration of PEP is especially important where the woman has not received any ART. For infants born to women on fully suppressive cART, zidovudine monotherapy PEP remains reasonable, even where the woman has a previous history of zidovudine exposure with resistance. Neonatal zidovudine monotherapy remains a reasonable approach for infants born to women with a plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, even if there is a previous history of zidovudine resistance. If a woman is known to have HIV-2 infection, follow the same advice as for HIV infant PEP but if HIGH RISK, nevirapine will not be effective. Seek expert advice. PEP should not be given beyond 2 weeks for VERY LOW-RISK or 4 weeks for LOW-RISK infants even if the infant is breastfed. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended from 1 month of age if HIV PCR screening is positive at any stage or if the infant is confirmed to be diagnosed with HIV. Immunisations should be given as per the national schedule. Breastfeeding advice for women with HIV living in the UK recommends formula feeding to eliminate the risk of postnatal transmission. Women not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of viral load >50 HIV RNA copies/mL, should be offered cabergoline to suppress lactation. Women who are virologically suppressed on cART with good adherence and who choose to breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should be informed about the risks.\\n\\nLow risk of transmission of HIV through breastfeeding in this situation and the requirement for extra maternal and infant clinical monitoring. When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding. Maternal cART is advised to minimize HIV transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the woman’s health. Women who choose to breastfeed should be advised of the small ongoing risk of HIV transmission. They should be supported in their decision if they fulfill specific criteria. Women who breastfeed with a known detectable HIV viral load should be referred to social care as this places their infant at significant risk of HIV infection. Healthcare providers requiring advice on the use of medicines during the breastfeeding period can contact the UK Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service. Women should inform partners/families and healthcare providers about their HIV status. Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on specific occasions for both breastfed and non-breastfed infants. Management of infants diagnosed with HIV should include starting cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and urgent referral to a specialist center. Follow national guidance for the management of maternal HBV and HCV in pregnancy. Timely routine vaccination should be ensured for HIV exposed but uninfected (HEU) children.\\n\\nGuidelines for the management of HIV infection in pregnant women recommend risk-adapted transmission prophylaxis to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission. Effective antiretroviral therapy starting before conception has been shown to prevent perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Shortened zidovudine regimens can also help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Additionally, combination neonatal prophylaxis has been used successfully to reduce transmission rates. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy has led to further declines in mother-to-child transmission rates.\\n\\nHIV during breastfeeding. All women recommended to continue cART postpartum. Support services should be assessed and referrals made without delay. Postnatal follow-up within 4-6 weeks is essential. Mental health assessment and support should be provided. Contraceptive needs should be discussed and ART may be changed to optimize contraception choice. Cytology should be scheduled 3 months post-delivery. Testing of partner and/or older children should be completed for women newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy.\\n\\nClinical guideline on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa.

For infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and ≤2 kg, the dose is 4 mg/kg twice a day. Duration of oral dosing depends on the risk level. Intravenous dosing is different for infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and <34/40 gestation. Lamivudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir, Nevirapine, Raltegravir, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Enfuvirtide, and Co-trimoxazole are all part of combination therapy with specific dosing instructions. PCP prophylaxis with Co-trimoxazole is recommended for HIV-infected infants starting at 4 weeks of age.\",\n    \"Management of Bladder Pain Syndrome\\nInitial clinical assessment should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, completion of a bladder diary, and testing for urinary tract infections. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Severity of BPS can be classified using validated symptom scores and visual analogue scales for pain. Initial management may include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Intravesical treatments such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, and dimethyl sulfoxide may be considered if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Further treatment options should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Referral to secondary care should be considered for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Physiotherapy and psychological support may be beneficial for patients with refractory BPS. Long-term follow-up in secondary care may be necessary until symptoms are controlled. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin.\\n\\nPelvic pain should be thoroughly investigated, including history of physical or sexual abuse. Physical examination should rule out bladder distension, hernias, and trigger points. Baseline investigations include bladder diary, food diary, and urine tests. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Conservative treatments include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Pharmacological treatments may include oral amitriptyline or cimetidine if conservative treatments fail.\\n\\nMultimodal therapy may be considered if single drugs are unsuccessful, but should be commenced by consultants with special expertise and consideration of multidisciplinary input. Intravesical treatments, such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, dimethyl sulfoxide, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate, may be added or substituted if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Options should be individualized based on clinical team expertise. Further treatment options, such as cystoscopic fulguration, neuromodulation, oral cyclosporin A, cystoscopy, and major surgery, should be considered after referral to a pain clinic and discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. Treatments not recommended include oral hydroxyzine, oral pentosan polysulfate, long-term antibiotics, intravesical resiniferatoxin, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, high-pressure long-duration hydrodistension, and long-term oral glucocorticoids. Referral to a physiotherapist, pain team, or clinical psychologist should be considered for additional support. Patients should be followed up periodically in secondary care until symptoms are controlled, with consideration for shared care between the pain team and urogynaecology. Support groups can provide additional resources for patients.\\n\\nThe effect of pregnancy on the severity of BPS symptoms can be variable. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin. DMSO should be avoided in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects. Limited information is available on changes in symptoms during pregnancy. Patients with mild symptoms may experience worsening during pregnancy, while those with severe symptoms may see improvement. Oral amitriptyline is the safest oral treatment option in pregnancy. Heparin is the safest intravesical treatment. Lidocaine crosses the placenta, and corticosteroids may have long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Sacral nerve stimulators should be turned off during pregnancy. There is limited evidence on a genetic predisposition for BPS. DMSO should be avoided during pregnancy. Recommendations for future research include creating a standardized assessment questionnaire and assessing the role of conservative treatments for BPS. Useful links and support groups are available for BPS patients.\\n\\n43. Shorter B, Lesser M, Moldwin RM, Kushner L. Effect of comestibles on symptoms of interstitial cystitis.

Each guideline is developed using a standardized methodology and should be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs and resources. The evidence used in guidelines is graded based on the quality of research studies. Recommendations are formulated based on the evidence level. It is important to note areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be needed.\",\n    \"Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\\nTransvaginal ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice for tubal ectopic pregnancy.\\nTubal ectopic pregnancies should be positively identified by visualizing an adnexal mass.\\nA serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) level is useful for planning management.\\nUltrasound is the primary diagnostic modality for caesarean scar pregnancy.\\nDefined criteria exist for diagnosing various types of ectopic pregnancies.\\nSurgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options are available for different types of ectopic pregnancies.\\nWomen with ectopic pregnancies should be offered anti-D immunoglobulin.\\nLong-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy should be discussed with patients.\\nWomen should be offered support and counseling during treatment for ectopic pregnancy.\\nProviders of early pregnancy care should have access to appropriate management options.\\nClinicians managing ectopic pregnancies must have received appropriate training.\\n\\nClinicians must have appropriate training for ultrasound-guided needle techniques in medical management. If unable to perform full surgical procedures for ectopic pregnancy, support must be available. Virtual reality simulators can aid in training for salpingectomy. Ectopic pregnancies include various types, but not pregnancy of unknown location. Incidence is around 11/1000 pregnancies in the UK, with risk factors such as tubal damage and smoking. Ultrasound is the primary tool for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy, with specific criteria for identification. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are useful for management planning. Cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies have defined ultrasound criteria for diagnosis. Interstitial pregnancy occurs in the fallopian tube and has specific ultrasound criteria for diagnosis.\\n\\nA single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. At presentation, based on clinical symptoms and ultrasound scan, if there is suspicion of interstitial pregnancy, a single serum b-hCG should be carried out. The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy: visualization of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body, gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus and completely surrounded by myometrium, and a vascular pedicle adjoining the gestational sac to the unicornuate uterus. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. Ovarian ectopic pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose with certainty preoperatively, so the diagnosis should be considered whenever ultrasound findings are suspicious. A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. A heterotopic pregnancy is diagnosed when the ultrasound findings demonstrate an intrauterine pregnancy and a coexisting ectopic pregnancy. Heterotopic pregnancy should be considered in all women presenting after assisted reproductive technologies, in women with an intrauterine pregnancy complaining of persistent pelvic pain, and in those women with a persistently raised b-hCG level following miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.\\n\\nCG levels greater than 5000 iu/l are significant predictors of failure in ectopic pregnancies. Methotrexate treatment success is higher with smaller increases in b-hCG levels prior to administration. A decrease in b-hCG levels from day 1 to day 4 after methotrexate administration is associated with higher success rates. Methotrexate should be the first-line management for women with specific criteria. Expectant management is a reasonable option for selected women with minimal pain and low b-hCG levels. Success rates for expectant management are dependent on case selection and lower initial b-hCG levels are associated with higher success rates. Management options for cervical and caesarean scar pregnancies should be tailored based on individual factors and gestational age. Surgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options are available for different types of ectopic pregnancies.\\n\\nInic acid rescue regimen was successful with a 91% success rate. Various methods for treatment include transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration followed by methotrexate injection, endoscopic approaches, and hysteroscopic resection. Selective UAE with methotrexate has been used for reducing hemorrhage. Laparoscopic removal is recommended for cornual pregnancies. Definitive surgical treatment is preferred for ovarian pregnancies. Laparoscopic removal is an option for early abdominal pregnancy, while advanced cases require laparotomy. Management of heterotopic pregnancies should consider the prognosis of the intrauterine pregnancy. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy. Long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy show no difference in fertility rates between management methods. Support and counseling should be offered to women undergoing treatment, including access to patient support groups and local bereavement counseling services. Muscle relaxation training may be beneficial for women undergoing treatment with methotrexate. It is recommended to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again after methotrexate treatment. Plans for follow-up should be clearly recorded, and written information on treatment options and support services should be provided.\\n\\nThe manufacturers of methotrexate recommend a 3-month window after use before conception due to the length of time that it may remain present in some organs and because of concern for subsequent pregnancy and fetal development. A small cohort study showed a higher than expected major malformation rate in women who conceived within 3 months of methotrexate exposure. However, conception within 3 months of methotrexate should not be considered an indication for termination. Providers of early pregnancy care should offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service with direct access for women referred by general practitioners and accident and emergency departments. Women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be managed in dedicated early pregnancy clinics with access to all appropriate management options. Laparoscopic salpingotomy is not part of the core training of gynaecologists, and appropriate support from senior staff trained in all surgical techniques should be available. Clinicians managing women with ectopic pregnancy must have received appropriate training in surgical, ultrasound, and medical management techniques. Virtual reality simulators can be used as a training tool for surgical procedures. The need for anti-D in women with nontubal ectopic pregnancies, methotrexate for the treatment of ovarian ectopic pregnancy, long-term fertility following management of nontubal ectopic pregnancies, and other research topics are recommended for future studies. Auditable topics include the proportion of women offered all relevant management options for ectopic pregnancy and the percentage of women provided with information containing support group details.

It has a success rate of approximately 50% and reduces the chance of a caesarean section. ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation. Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve the success rates of ECV. Regional analgesia may be considered for women unable to tolerate ECV without pain relief. The success of an ECV attempt can be predicted to some extent, but models should not be routinely used. ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of ECV.\\n\\nIn nulliparous women with a low chance of spontaneous version, ECV from 36 weeks of gestation seems pragmatic. ECV may be considered intrapartum with caution. ECV after one caesarean delivery appears to have no greater risk. ECV has a very low complication rate. ECV should be performed by trained practitioners. ECV can be a painful procedure. Methods to improve ECV uptake and success rates are needed.

They should be advised on the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery.\\n\\nWomen who have a breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of ECV should be counseled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section.\\n\\nWomen should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. The reduced risk is due to the avoidance of stillbirth after 39 weeks of gestation, the avoidance of intrapartum risks, and the risks of vaginal breech birth.\\n\\nWhen planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39+0 weeks of gestation, and approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth.\\n\\nPlanned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications but has not been shown to increase the risk of long-term morbidity.\\n\\nWomen should be informed that caesarean section increases the risk of complications in future pregnancies, including the risks of opting for vaginal birth after caesarean section, the increased risk of complications at repeat caesarean section, and the risk of an abnormally invasive placenta.\\n\\nWomen should be informed that caesarean section has been associated with a small increase in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies although this may not be causal.\\n\\nWomen with breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of ECV should be counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section. Women should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. When planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39 weeks of gestation, and approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth. Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care may allow planned vaginal breech birth to be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. Planned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications, but has not been shown to increase the risk of long-term morbidity. Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way that ensures a proper understanding of the absolute as well as relative risks of their different options. Women should also be informed about the maternal complications associated with planned caesarean section, including risks in future pregnancies. Caesarean section has been associated with a small increase in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies.\\n\\nThe safety of vaginal breech delivery depends on case selection, operator skill, and intrapartum management. Factors affecting safety include antenatal assessment for risk factors, such as hyperextended neck on ultrasound or high estimated fetal weight. Skilled birth attendants are essential, and intrapartum management should be based on the stage of labor and availability of expertise. Continuous fetal monitoring may improve outcomes. Delivery in a hospital with immediate access to a cesarean section is recommended. Adherence to a protocol for management reduces neonatal morbidity. The position for delivery during vaginal breech birth can be semirecumbent or all-fours. Assistance during the active second stage should be provided without traction if there is delay or poor fetal condition.\\n\\nAll maneuvers to avoid fetal trauma should be followed, such as grasping the fetus around the pelvic girdle and avoiding hyperextension of the neck. Selective episiotomy is recommended over routine episiotomy. Signs that delivery should be assisted include lack of tone or color, or delay, commonly due to extended arms or neck. Intervention to expedite breech birth is required if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or significant delays in delivery. The position of the fetus should be monitored and managed carefully during delivery. In cases of preterm breech birth, individualized management based on various factors is recommended. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. The decision about mode of delivery for preterm breech babies should be made by an experienced obstetrician following a thorough clinical evaluation. In cases of twin pregnancy with breech presentation, planned caesarean section for the first twin is recommended, while routine caesarean section for the second twin is not recommended. Organizational and governance arrangements should be in place to support a routine vaginal breech delivery service, including simulation equipment for training and guidelines for case selection and management.\\n\\nBreech birth supports adherence to a strict management protocol and the presence of skilled birth attendants. Recommendations for future research include evaluation of all-fours position for vaginal breech birth, the role of pelvimetry in planning vaginal breech delivery, and the effect of epidural analgesia on vaginal breech birth. Auditable topics include documentation of discussion regarding mode of delivery, vaginal delivery rates in women planning vaginal breech delivery, rate of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes following planned and actual breech birth, and percentage of staff who have undergone training in vaginal breech delivery.\\n\\nClinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. Each guideline is developed using a standardized methodology. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using a specific scheme, with different levels of evidence and recommendations. The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2020.\",\n    \"Management of Inherited Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy\\n\\nHaemophilia\\n- Clinicians should be aware of the different phenotypes and severities of haemophilia.\\n- Known or potential female carriers may have low factor VIII/IX levels, increasing the risk of bleeding during procedures or delivery.\\n- Baseline factor levels should be determined before pregnancy.\\n- Genetic counselling should be provided to women at risk.\\n- Options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered to carriers of severe haemophilia.\\n- Antenatal care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team.\\n- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.\\n- A clear plan for intrapartum care should be in place.\\n- The timing and mode of delivery should be decided jointly between the woman and the healthcare team.\\n\\nvon Willebrand disease (VWD)\\n- VWD is classified based on the deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF).\\n- Women with VWD have an increased risk of bleeding during pregnancy.\\n- Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed and VWF levels checked.\\n- Safe management requires a multidisciplinary approach.\\n- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.\\n\\nWhere invasive procedures are required, if VWF activity or factor VIII levels are less than 0.50 iu/ml, women should receive haemostatic support in the form of DDAVP, where responsive, or VWF-containing concentrates. Treatment should be with DDAVP in preference to blood-derived factor concentrates where possible. Fluid intake should be restricted to 1 litre for 24 hours following DDAVP administration to prevent maternal hyponatraemia. Clinicians should be aware that patients with type 2B VWD may develop thrombocytopenia following DDAVP treatment. If VWF replacement therapy is required, a concentrate containing factor VIII and VWF, manufactured from a safe plasma source with adequate viral testing and inactivation procedures should be used. Target peak VWF activity levels should be 1.0 iu/ml and levels maintained above 0.5 iu/ml until haemostasis is secured. For most antenatal procedures, a single preoperative treatment is sufficient, but in some cases, a second dose may be required at 12 –24 hours, depending on the nature of the procedure and the measured levels. The timing of treatment should be as near to delivery as possible, and pre- and post-treatment levels of VWF activity and factor VIII levels should be measured and repeated after delivery, or if labour is prolonged. Tranexamic acid should be considered in combination with treatment for all those with VWF activity less than 0.5 iu/ml, or as sole therapy for those with levels above 0.5 iu/ml if clinically indicated. Platelet transfusions, as well as VWF factor replacement, may sometimes be required in type 2B VWD. The mode of delivery should be guided by obstetric indications. For fetuses at risk of having type 2 or 3 VWD, FBS, external cephalic version, fetal scalp monitoring, ventouse delivery and midcavity forceps should be avoided.\\n\\nFor patients with type 1 VWD, where VWF activity has been normalised by pregnancy or treatment, central neuraxial anaesthesia can be offered. For patients with type 2 disease, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless VWF activity is more than 0.5 iu/ml and the haemostatic defect has been corrected. For patients with type 2N VWD, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless factor VIII level is more than 0.5 iu/ml. Prior to delivery, all women should be given the opportunity to discuss analgesia with a senior obstetric anaesthetist. In patients where an epidural catheter has been placed, consideration should be given to the need for repeat treatment prior to catheter removal. Intramuscular injections and postnatal NSAIDs are only suitable in the short term when VWF activity and factor VIII are more than 0.5 iu/ml.\\n\\nIt is important to ensure that VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at more than 0.5 iu/ml for at least 3 days following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and at least 5 days following instrumental delivery or after caesarean section. Women with VWD should be considered for tranexamic acid for the postpartum period. If thromboprophylaxis is indicated, LMWH may be given to inpatients with adequate correction of VWF:RCo and factor VIII levels. Women with VWD should be made aware of the risk of delayed bleeding and be encouraged to report excessive bleeding. A plan for the diagnostic testing of the neonate following delivery, including cord blood sampling, should be included in the maternal pregnancy management plan. Cord blood samples for VWF activity should be taken for babies at risk of type 2 and 3 VWD. For neonates at risk of type 2 or 3 VWD, vitamin K should be given orally. Neonates with type 3 VWD should be considered for routine cranial imaging prior to discharge and for short-term prophylaxis with factor concentrate if there has been significant potential trauma at delivery.\\n\\nIII de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.\\n\\nFibrinogen disorders\\nWhat is the nature and inheritance of aﬁbrinogenaemia, hypoﬁbrinogenaemia and dysﬁbrinogenaemia?\\nClinicians should be aware that ﬁbrinogen disorders can be autosomal recessive (aﬁbrinogenaemia) or autosomal dominant (with quantitative and/or qualitative defects) and are associated with a variable clinical phenotype.\\n\\nWhat are the risks in pregnancy to mother and baby?\\nClinicians should be aware that severe ﬁbrinogen de ﬁciency may be associated with bleeding, but quantitative and qualitative de ﬁciency can also be associated with thrombosis and pregnancy loss.\\n\\nWhat is the management of pregnancy and delivery?\\nIf functional ﬁbrinogen less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. Higher doses of ﬁbrinogen concentrate are likely to be required to maintain ﬁbrinogen activity as pregnancy progresses. Consider additional ﬁbrinogen concentrate for established labour to ensure ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1.5 g/litre for at least 3 days. Tranexamic acid can be used for minor bleeding.\\n\\nThe bleeding phenotype in haemophilia can be predicted from factor levels, with severe cases requiring regular prophylaxis. Inhibitors to clotting factor treatments can cause significant morbidity. Female carriers are at increased risk of bleeding during procedures and at delivery. Neonates with haemophilia are at risk of bleeding complications. Factor levels in carriers are variable and may increase during pregnancy. Antenatal care should involve a multidisciplinary team and aim for factor levels of at least 0.5 iu/ml. Genetic counselling should be provided to carriers, and options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered. Intrapartum care should be planned in advance for carriers and affected babies. Consideration should be given to mode of delivery to minimize risks.\\n\\nPrecautions required for vaginal delivery include avoiding the use of external cephalic version in pregnancies where the fetus has a bleeding disorder. A joint decision on the timing and mode of delivery should be made between the woman and the multidisciplinary team. For affected male babies, especially those with severe haemophilia, a planned lower segment caesarean section should be discussed. Spontaneous labour is preferred for vaginal delivery, with measures in place to ensure expertise and necessary resources are available. The use of ventouse and midcavity forceps should be avoided for male babies at risk of haemophilia. Fetal blood sampling and fetal scalp electrode should be avoided in babies expected to have severe or moderate haemophilia. The optimal mode of delivery for a carrier may be affected by obstetric considerations and individual factors, including bleeding risk and reproductive expectations. Analgesia and anaesthesia should be managed safely, with factor VIII/IX levels considered for neuraxial anaesthetic techniques. Haemostatic management during labour includes using DDAVP or factor concentrate to raise clotting factor levels if necessary. Tranexamic acid may be considered for women with low normal levels or in conjunction with DDAVP. Treatment should be given as close to delivery as possible.\\n\\n4.12 Postpartum management:\\n- Recommend/offer active management of the third stage of labour to minimize the risk of PPH.\\n- Maintain factor VIII/IX levels above 0.5 iu/ml for 3 days post-vaginal delivery or 5 days post-instrumental delivery or caesarean section.\\n- Continue tranexamic acid postpartum until lochia is minimal.\\n- Avoid pharmacological thromboprophylaxis when factor level is 0.6 iu/ml or less, but consider in women with thrombotic risk factors.\\n- Haemophilia center should maintain contact with the woman post-discharge to report any increase in postpartum blood loss.\\n- Carriers of hemophilia should be identified as at increased risk of PPH and offered uterotonics for the third stage of labour.\\n- Maintain haemostatic levels in the initial postpartum period.\\n- Consider tranexamic acid use in PPH, with no long-term adverse outcomes for breastfeeding children.\\n- Assess risk of venous thromboembolism vs. PPH in normalizing factor levels.\\n- Carriers of hemophilia may have increased duration of lochia and should be monitored for any increase in blood loss.\\n\\n4.13 Neonatal management:\\n- Plan for diagnostic testing of the neonate, including cord blood sampling.\\n- Interpret coagulation results in neonates against age-adjusted reference ranges.\\n- Recommend cord blood sampling and testing for male babies born to carrier mothers.\\n- Inform parents of neonates diagnosed with hemophilia and arrange for follow-up at a hemophilia center.\\n- Administer vitamin K to neonates with low factor levels.\\n- Consider cranial ultrasound prior to discharge in neonates with severe or moderate hemophilia.\\n- Consider cranial MRI in neonates with symptoms of ICH.\\n- Provide information on symptoms and signs of ICH to parents.\\n- Consider short-term prophylaxis in severe and moderate hemophilia neonates.\\n- Manage clinical bleeding events in neonates with hemophilia according to treatment guidelines.\\n\\nDuring pregnancy and childbirth, women with VWD have a significantly increased risk of bleeding, with antepartum hemorrhage increased ten-fold and primary PPH occurring in 15-30% of women. Perineal hematoma is more common in women with VWD, but there is no increased risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, or fetal complications. Neonatal VWF levels are increased at birth, providing some protection against bleeding. Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed, and VWF levels should be monitored throughout pregnancy. DDAVP is safe for use in pregnancy and delivery, but caution should be exercised in certain subtypes of VWD. VWF concentrates may be necessary in cases where DDAVP is contraindicated. Intrapartum management should focus on maintaining VWF activity levels and may involve tranexamic acid or platelet transfusions. Analgesia and anesthesia should be carefully managed based on the type of VWD and VWF activity levels. Central neuraxial anesthesia is generally safe in women with normal VWF activity levels. Intramuscular injections and NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with low VWF levels.\\n\\nPostpartum management should ensure VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at specific levels following delivery. Women with VWD may consider tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis may be necessary in some cases. Follow-up is crucial to monitor bleeding risk. Neonates at risk of VWD should undergo diagnostic testing. Factor XI deficiency is an autosomal disorder with variable inheritance patterns. Factor XI levels do not typically increase during pregnancy. Factor XI-deficient women are at increased risk of PPH. Treatment options include tranexamic acid, factor XI concentrate, and FFP. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for factor XI deficiency. Factor XI inhibitors may occur after treatment. Tranexamic acid alone may be sufficient for managing factor XI deficiency. FFP with factor XI activity should be used if needed.\\n\\nFactor XI or tranexamic acid is not usually required antenatally unless an invasive procedure is undertaken or if there is bleeding following miscarriage or surgical procedure. Delivery plans need to be individualized. Prophylactic factor XI replacement should be considered if homozygous/compound heterozygous, previous history of PPH or general bleeding history. Otherwise, management can be expectant, with tranexamic acid alone and factor replacement reserved for excess bleeding. Due to the unpredictable nature of bleeding and the likely unchanged factor XI level during pregnancy, treatment plans around labor and delivery need to be individualized. Central neuraxial anesthesia should not be given to women with low factor XI levels with a known bleeding phenotype, where the phenotype is not clear or when there is a severe reduction in level. Clinicians should be aware that rare bleeding disorders include inherited deficiencies of fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, X, XI and XIII, combined factor V and factor VIII deficiencies, and congenital deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors. Genetic counseling should be provided, with the understanding that most rare inherited bleeding disorders are autosomal recessive in inheritance and heterozygote carriers are usually asymptomatic. Clinicians should appreciate that coagulation factor levels can change during pregnancy. Treatment plans may need to be modified according to the nature of individual bleeds or procedures, and to the background bleeding phenotype of each case. Central neuraxial anesthesia, postpartum pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and NSAIDs should usually be avoided in women with severe deficiencies as it may be difficult to guarantee consistent normalization of hemostasis even after treatment. If factor II activity is less than 0.2 iu/ml and there is significant bleeding, established labor or prior to caesarean section, give prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg to achieve factor II activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. For significant bleeding or delivery in women with factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml, 15–25 ml/kg FFP should be considered once in established labor or before caesarean section. For factor VII activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester with prior history of bleeding, consider recombinant factor VIIa 15 –30 micrograms/kg every 4 –6 hours for at least 3 or 5 days following caesarean section. For delivery in women with factor X activity less than 0.3 iu/ml in the third trimester who have a history of bleeding and all those who require caesarean section, use prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg (or factor X concentrate if available) to achieve factor X activity more.\\n\\nConsider further prothrombin complex concentrate 10 –20 iu/kg once daily to maintain factor X activity more than 0.3 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Antenatal prophylaxis maybe considered in women with a history of recurrent bleeding or adverse pregnancy outcome using prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –30 iu/kg two or three times a week to maintain trough factor X more than 0.01 iu/ml.\\n\\nDuring pregnancy, increased intensity prophylaxis is required using factor XIII plasma concentrate or recombinant factor XIII (if A-subunit de ﬁciency). Dosing frequency should be increased from every 28 days to every 14 –21 days to maintain factor XIII more than 0.2 iu/ml. For delivery, consider additional factor XIII concentrate 10 –40 iu/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section, depending on the interval since last prophylaxis.\\n\\nFor delivery in women with combined factor V+VIII de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.\\n\\nSevere ﬁbrinogen deﬁciency (aﬁbrinogenaemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder and is associated with mild-to-severe bleeding. If functional ﬁbrinogen is less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. \\n\\nThe spectrum of bleeding in patients with platelet function disorders varies and may ﬁrst present in pregnancy. Women known to have a platelet dysfunction disorder should receive prepregnancy counselling from a multidisciplinary specialist team with expertise in caring for patients with platelet function disorders.\\n\\nBernard Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is caused by genetic abnormality of an important platelet adhesion receptor (GP Ib-IX-V receptor) and is often associated with a severe bleeding phenotype. BSS is associated with signiﬁcant risk of primary and secondary PPH, and wound haematoma. Management of delivery, therefore, requires careful planning with the multidisciplinary team.\\n\\n- Platelet transfusions and/or recombinant factor VIIa should be given prophylactically at delivery for patients with a history of bleeding.\\n- Tranexamic acid should be given from the onset of established labour and continued through the postpartum period until lochia is minimal.\\n- Central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided.\\n- Antenatal bleeding in women with GT is mild, but postpartum bleeding can be severe and occur up to 20 days after delivery.\\n- Prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to delivery has only shown partial success in reducing PPH.\\n- Recombinant factor VIIa is licensed for use in patients with GT who have antibodies to GP IIb/IIIa and/or HLA, and with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions.\\n- DDAVP has not been shown to be effective in GT.\\n- Maternal alloimmunisation to fetal platelet antigens may cause fetal thrombocytopenia and risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\\n- Platelet transfusions can lead to alloimmunisation with a risk of fetal maternal alloimmunisation.\\n- Women with inherited bleeding disorders who request termination of pregnancy require multidisciplinary management in a unit with 24-hour access to blood products and specialist hematological advice.\\n\\nReferral hospital in Rafsanjan, Iran. The optimal mode of delivery for the hemophilia carrier expecting an affected infant is clinically significant. Maternal obesity and maternal health are important factors to consider. The impact of multiple cesarean deliveries on maternal morbidity is noteworthy. Risks of induction of labor in uncomplicated term pregnancies should be evaluated. The risks and benefits of epidural analgesia in patients with bleeding disorders should be carefully considered. Safety of intramuscular injection of hepatitis B vaccine in hemophiliacs is crucial. Prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage in women with bleeding disorders is essential. Identification and management of women with inherited bleeding disorders is important. Development of the human coagulation system in premature infants is a significant consideration. Perinatal management of newborns with hemophilia is a critical aspect of care. The impact, diagnosis, and treatment of bleeding disorders are essential components of care.\\n\\nClinical guidelines for von Willebrand disease diagnosis and management, including pregnancy and delivery, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor changes, and bleeding risks.

The limitations of fetal sexing by cffDNA analysis must be explained to patients prior to testing. Fetal sex should be confirmed by US at 20 weeks of gestation. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in at-risk fetuses. CVS may be offered between 11 and 13+6 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis may be offered after 15 weeks of gestation for PND when CVS is not available or at > 34 weeks of gestation to inform clinical management plans for delivery of an at-risk fetus. An independent maternal blood sample should be provided to the laboratory for confirmatory mutation analysis alongside the PND sample. Amniocentesis in late pregnancy is recommended to inform clinical management of childbirth. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in order to inform the delivery of at-risk fetuses. PGD, an IVF-based process, is an option for couples at risk of transmitting a heritable disorder to their offspring. Noninvasive PND for disease-specific diagnosis is not yet available in general clinical practice. Risk stratification of bleeding risk for the fetus/neonate is categorized into high, medium, mild, and unlikely to be at risk levels based on specific diagnoses. Neonatal bleeding risks and management are outlined based on factor deficiencies and platelet activity in normal term neonates.\",\n    \"Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease\\nAll pregnant women should be provided with an appropriate information leaflet. Universal bacteriological screening is not recommended. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical risk factors for GBS disease. IAP should be offered to women with a previous baby affected by GBS disease. Antenatal treatment for GBS carriage is not recommended. Method of induction should not vary based on GBS carrier status. Membrane sweeping is not contraindicated in GBS carriers. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for planned caesarean sections without labor. Immediate IAP should be offered to known GBS carriers at term. Pyrexial women in labor should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. IAP is recommended for confirmed preterm labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at labor onset is not recommended. Birth in a pool is not contraindicated for known GBS carriers. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. Breastfeeding should be encouraged regardless of GBS status. Parents should seek medical advice if the baby shows abnormal behavior. Term babies of mothers who received IAP do not require special observation. Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated promptly. Evaluation of babies for infection indicators should be done at birth.\\n\\nThere is no clear evidence to show that routine testing for GBS in pregnancy would do more good than harm. Screening is not recommended for all pregnant women due to inaccuracies in testing and potential risks associated with unnecessary treatment. Clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease, such as previous GBS infection, preterm birth, and prolonged rupture of membranes. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy. In cases where GBS is detected incidentally or following intentional testing, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered. Women with known GBS carriage should receive immediate antibiotic prophylaxis and induction of labor to reduce the risk of EOGBS disease. In cases of intrapartum pyrexia, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered to cover GBS.\\n\\nIAP is recommended for women in confirmed preterm labor. IAP is not recommended for women not in labor and having a preterm planned caesarean section with intact membranes. The risk of EOGBS disease in infants of women who deliver preterm is higher, justifying the use of IAP in all cases of preterm labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at the onset of labor is not recommended. Water birth is not contraindicated for GBS-positive women if appropriate IAP is offered. Bacteriological testing for GBS carriage is not recommended for women with preterm rupture of membranes. Swabs for GBS carrier status should be transported to the laboratory in non-nutrient transport medium and processed promptly. Enriched culture medium tests are recommended for testing GBS carriage. Benzylpenicillin is recommended for IAP. Cephalosporin should be used in women with known or suspected penicillin allergy. Women with known GBS colonization who decline IAP should have their baby closely monitored after birth. Adverse effects of IAP should be considered. Vaginal cleansing in labor does not reduce the risk of neonatal GBS disease. Parents and carers should seek urgent medical advice if a newborn shows abnormal behavior or symptoms of infection. Term babies whose mothers received adequate IAP do not require special observation at birth. Well babies at risk of EOGBS disease whose mothers did not receive adequate IAP should be monitored closely for signs of infection. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for asymptomatic term infants without risk factors.\\n\\nThe incidence of EOGBS disease in asymptomatic term infants without known antenatal risk factors in the UK is estimated at 0.2 cases/1000 births. Routine postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated with penicillin and gentamicin within an hour of the decision to treat. Breastfeeding should be encouraged irrespective of GBS status. Babies of mothers who have had a previous baby with GBS disease should be monitored closely for at least 12 hours. There is no evidence to discourage breastfeeding where there are concerns regarding the possible risk of transmission of GBS disease.\\n\\nWater birth, more than a trendy alternative: a prospective, observational study.

Women undergoing caesarean section with more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of infection and wound separation. There is a lack of evidence to recommend routine use of negative pressure dressing therapy, barrier retractors, and subcutaneous drains in obese women undergoing caesarean sections. Maternal obesity should be considered when deciding on postnatal contraception. Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight management services. A waiting period of 12-18 months after bariatric surgery is recommended before attempting pregnancy. Women with previous bariatric surgery should have consultant-led antenatal care and nutritional surveillance during pregnancy. Women with obesity should receive folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy. Obese women are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and may benefit from supplementation.\\n\\niometry scan and were analysed\\nfor the primary endpoint. The neonatal whole-body bone mineral content of infants born to mothersassigned to cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day did not signiﬁcantly differ from that of infants born to mothersassigned to placebo. However, supplementation of women with cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day during pregnancy did demonstrate that this dosage was sufﬁcient to ensure that most pregnant women were vitamin D replete and it was safe.\\nProvision of antenatal care\\nCare of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear local policies and guidelines for care available. Maternity services must develop and implement robust processes to manage the risks associated with obesity, and consistently provide sensitive, comprehensive, and appropriate multidisciplinary care. Specific recommendations include a requirement for all women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater to have multidisciplinary care, a documented antenatal consultation about the intrapartum risks and to be advised to deliver in a consultant-led unit for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater. Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater.\\nMeasuring weight, height and BMI\\nAll pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing women during the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnel required during labour and birth.\\nInformation giving during pregnancy\\nAll pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and how they may be minimised. Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in the pregnancy. Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment. Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a documented risk assessment in the third trimester of pregnancy by an appropriately qualified professional to consider.\\n\\nTissue viability issues should involve the use of a validated scale to support clinical judgment. A BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 and immobility are risk factors for developing pressure sores. A documented assessment of pressure ulcer risk using a validated scale is recommended, with reassessment if there is a change in clinical status. Plans for skin assessment, skin care, repositioning frequency, and pressure redistributing devices should be put in place for those at risk. Pregnant women with a booking BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is a significant risk factor for gestational diabetes and hypertensive complications of pregnancy. Women with obesity should be offered screening and diagnostic tests for mental health problems. Pregnant women with obesity have an increased risk of structural anomalies and should be offered screening and diagnostic tests despite limitations in visualizing fetal structures.\\n\\n11. Fetal surveillance\\n- Serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) recommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation.\\n- Women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound.\\n- Ultrasound can be considered as an alternative method for assessing fetal presentation.\\n- Various methods of estimating fetal growth have been assessed, but all are technically more difficult in women with obesity.\\n- Intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women should follow NICE recommendations.\\n- Obese pregnant women are at increased risk of stillbirth and prolonged pregnancy.\\n\\n12. Planning labour and birth\\n- Planning for labour and birth requires ongoing review of antenatal progress and potential complications.\\n- Women with maternal obesity should have an informed discussion with their obstetrician and anaesthetist about a birth plan.\\n- Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.\\n- Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birth without increasing adverse outcomes.\\n- The decision for a woman with maternal obesity to have a planned caesarean section should involve a multidisciplinary approach.\\n- Induction of labour may be considered when macrosomia is suspected.\\n- Parents should have a discussion about the options of induction of labour and expectant management when macrosomia is suspected.\\n\\nWomen with obesity and a previous caesarean section should have an individualized decision for VBAC following informed discussion and consideration of all relevant clinical factors. Obesity is a risk factor for unsuccessful VBAC, with Class III obesity associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labor and neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is also associated with an increased risk of serious maternal morbidity. Continuous midwifery care is recommended for obese women in established labor, with extra vigilance required for care of pressure areas and fetal heart rate monitoring. Intrapartum care for obese women should follow NICE guidelines, with considerations for venous access, active management of the third stage of labor, and specific surgical techniques for performing cesarean section. Postoperative wound care for obese women should include prophylactic antibiotics and suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of wound infection. Breastfeeding initiation and maintenance may be more challenging for obese women and dedicated support is needed. Postnatal contraception advice should be tailored for women with obesity, and long-term health risks for both mother and child should be discussed and addressed.\\n\\nSupport in the community for minimal interpregnancy weight gain includes postpartum weight loss support and referral to weight management services. Women with previous bariatric surgery should wait 12-18 months before attempting pregnancy to stabilize weight and address nutritional deficiencies. Studies show lower risks of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and macrosomia in women who have had bariatric surgery, but higher risks of small-for-gestational-age newborns. Women with previous bariatric surgery should receive consultant-led antenatal care, nutritional surveillance, and screening for deficiencies during pregnancy. They should also be referred to a dietician for specialized nutritional needs. Pregnancy can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies in women with malabsorptive procedures, requiring vitamin and mineral supplementation. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of obesity on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy.\\n\\nAnesthetic and obstetric outcomes in morbidly obese parturients: a 20-year follow-up retrospective cohort study.

Extreme obesity is associated with postcesarean maternal complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis may help prevent infection after cesarean section. Superficial wound disruption after cesarean delivery may be affected by the depth and closure of subcutaneous tissue. Wound drainage and the use of a plastic sheath wound retractor may reduce surgical site infections and wound disruptions in obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Maternal weight status, diet, and supplement use can impact breastfeeding and complementary feeding. Delayed lactogenesis II and barriers to breastfeeding are concerns for obese women. Interventions for promoting breastfeeding and support for healthy breastfeeding mothers are important. Postpartum weight retention can be reduced through a correspondence intervention. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can develop after gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is associated with various pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, slower labor progress, caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, wound infection, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Stillbirth and neonatal death are also risks associated with maternal obesity.\\n\\n8) \\n33.0% \\nMedian prevalence in obese women.\",\n    \"Key Recommendations:\\n- Diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of membranes made by maternal history followed by sterile speculum examination\\n- Consider IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test if no amniotic fluid observed on speculum examination\\n- Antibiotic (preferably erythromycin) given for 10 days or until established labor in PPROM\\n- Offer corticosteroids to women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestation\\n- Use clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis\\n- Offer expectant management until 37+0 weeks in women with no contraindications to continuing pregnancy\\n- Offer intravenous magnesium sulfate to women with PPROM in established labor between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks gestation\\n\\nBackground:\\n- PPROM complicates up to 3% of pregnancies and is associated with 30-40% of preterm births\\n- Median latency after PPROM is 7 days and shortens with advancing gestational age\\n\\nDiagnosis:\\n- Diagnosis made by maternal history and sterile speculum examination\\n- Consider IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test if no amniotic fluid observed\\n- Ultrasound for amniotic fluid volume unclear\\n- Testing for nitrazine not recommended\\n- Routine vaginal swab for microbiological testing\\n\\nAssessment:\\n- Use clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis\\n- Women advised and observed for symptoms of chorioamnionitis\\n- White cell count and C-reactive protein used to identify infection\\n- Vital signs recorded for inpatients, regular monitoring for outpatients\\n\\nInvolvement of Neonatologists:\\n- Neonatologists informed when PPROM diagnosis confirmed and delivery anticipated\\n- Women offered opportunity to meet with neonatologist antenatally\\n\\nManagement:\\n- Erythromycin given for 10 days following PPROM diagnosis\\n- Antenatal corticosteroids offered from 24+0 to 35+6 weeks gestation\\n- Consideration of individual basis for administration due to potential side effects\\n\\nNG25 recommends that corticosteroids should be considered between 24+0 and 25+6 weeks’ gestation. Corticosteroids should be offered from at least 24+0 weeks’ gestation. In women with PPROM and planned preterm birth within 24 hours, magnesium sulfate should be offered between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation. Tocolysis is not recommended for patients with PPROM. Outpatient care for women with PPROM should be considered on an individual basis. Amnioinfusion is not recommended as routine practice for PPROM. Emotional support should be offered to women with PPROM and their partners. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks should be offered to women with PPROM after 24+0 weeks’ gestation. In subsequent pregnancies following PPROM, women should be cared for by an obstetrician with an interest in preterm birth. Further research is needed on various aspects of PPROM management.

The most common presentation is irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. Less common presentations include hyperemesis, excessive uterine enlargement, hyperthyroidism, early-onset pre-eclampsia, and abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts. Very rarely, women can present with haemoptysis or seizures due to metastatic disease affecting the lungs or brain.\\n\\nHow are molar pregnancies diagnosed?\\nThe definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination.\\n\\nRemoval of a molar pregnancy\\nWhat is the best method for removal of a molar pregnancy?\\nSuction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Ultrasound guidance during removal and curettage may be of use to minimize the chance of perforation and to ensure that as much tissue as possible is removed. Suction curettage is also the method of choice for removal of partial molar pregnancies except when the size of fetal parts deters the use of suction curettage and then medical removal can be used. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended following removal of a molar pregnancy.\\n\\nIs it safe to prepare the cervix prior to surgical removal?\\nPreparation of the cervix immediately prior to uterine removal is safe.\\n\\nCan oxytocic infusions be used during surgical removal?\\nExcessive vaginal bleeding can be associated with surgical management of molar pregnancy, and the involvement of an experienced clinician is advised. The use of oxytocic infusion prior to completion of the removal is not recommended. If the woman is experiencing significant hemorrhage prior to or during removal, surgical removal should be expedited, and the need for oxytocin infusion weighed up against the risk of tissue embolization.\\n\\nIn what circumstances should a repeat surgical removal be indicated and what is the timing?\\nThere is almost always a role for urgent surgical management for the woman who is experiencing heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise, particularly in the presence of retained pregnancy tissue on ultrasound. Outside the context of acute compromise, there should be consultation with the relevant GTD referral center before performing surgical management for the second time in the same pregnancy. \\n\\nHistological examination of pregnancy tissue in the diagnosis of GTD\\nShould pregnancy tissue from all miscarriages be examined histologically?\\nThe histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia if no fetal parts are identified at any stage of the pregnancy. Women who receive care for a miscarriage should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after miscarriage. \\n\\nShould pregnancy tissue be sent for examination after abortion?\\nThere is no need to routinely send pregnancy tissue for histological examination following therapeutic abortion, provided that fetal parts have been identified at the time of surgical abortion or on prior ultrasound examination. Women who undergo medical abortion should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\\n\\nHow should women with an elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin after a possible pregnancy event be managed?\\nReferral to a GTD center should be considered for all women with persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) either after an ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, or after two consecutive treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\\n\\nWhich women should be investigated for GTN after a non-molar pregnancy?\\nAny woman who develops persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event is at risk of having GTN. A urine hCG test should be performed in all cases of persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding lasting more than 8 weeks after a pregnancy event. Symptoms from metastatic disease, such as dyspnea and hemoptysis, or new onset of seizures or paralysis, can occur very rarely.\\n\\nBiopsy of secondary deposits in the vagina can cause major hemorrhage and is not recommended.\\n\\nHow should suspected ectopic molar pregnancy in women be managed?\\nCases of women with ectopic pregnancy suspected to be molar in nature should be managed as any other case of ectopic pregnancy. If there is a local tissue diagnosis of ectopic molar pregnancy, the tissue should be sent to a center with appropriate expertise for pathological review.\\n\\nHow is twin pregnancy of a viable fetus and presumptive coexistent molar pregnancy managed?\\nWomen diagnosed with a combined molar pregnancy and viable twin, or where there is diagnostic doubt, should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center. In the situation of a twin pregnancy where there is one viable fetus and the other pregnancy is molar, the woman should be counseled about the potential increased risk of perinatal morbidity and the outcome for GTN. Prenatal invasive testing for\\n\\nThe incidence of GTD is associated with age at conception, being higher in the extremes of age. GTN may develop after a molar pregnancy, a non-molar pregnancy, or a live birth. Clinicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancy, which include irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. The definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination. Suction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Preparation of the cervix prior to uterine removal is safe. Repeat surgical removal may be indicated in cases of heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise. The histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.\\n\\n- Pregnancy tissue does not need to be routinely sent for histological examination after therapeutic abortion if fetal parts have been identified.\\n- Women who undergo medical abortion should do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\\n- Referral to a GTD center should be considered for women with persistently elevated hCG after excluding ectopic pregnancy or after two treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\\n- Persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event should prompt investigation for GTN.\\n- Women with suspected ectopic molar pregnancy should be managed like any other case of ectopic pregnancy.\\n- Women with combined molar pregnancy and viable twin should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center.\\n- Women with PSTT or ETT should be registered and cared for within a GTD center.\\n- Women with atypical PSN should have their histology reviewed centrally for further management.\\n- All women diagnosed with GTD should be registered at GTD centers for follow-up.\\n- Follow-up for GTD should be based on hCG levels and may include chemotherapy.\\n- Women with GTN may be treated with single-agent or multi-agent chemotherapy based on the FIGO scoring system.\\n- Surgery may be considered for PSTT and ETT as they are less sensitive to chemotherapy.\\n- The recommended interval between a complete or partial molar pregnancy and trying for another pregnancy should be followed.\\n\\nWomen following a successful pregnancy after a previous molar pregnancy are advised not to conceive until their follow-up is complete. Chemotherapy recipients are advised to wait 1 year before conceiving. Women who have a pregnancy after a molar pregnancy that did not require treatment for GTN do not need to send a post-pregnancy hCG sample. The risk of another molar pregnancy is low, and women are not at increased risk of maternal complications. However, women exposed to a molar pregnancy prior to the index birth have an increased risk of preterm birth, large-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. The long-term outcome for women treated for GTN is generally excellent, with a high cure rate and successful pregnancies achieved in about 80% of cases. Women should be cautious about premature menopause after treatment with combination agent chemotherapy. It is important to avoid pregnancy until hCG levels return to normal, and contraception guidance can be found through the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health. Exogenous estrogens and fertility drugs may be used after hCG levels normalize. Hormone replacement therapy is safe to use after GTD. Support is available for women and families affected by GTD. Treatment centres are recommended for GTD care. Further research is needed on predicting molar pregnancy outcomes, refining chemotherapy resistance predictions, and managing multi-relapsed disease.

Trainees should achieve expertise in spontaneous vaginal birth before training in assisted birth. Training in vacuum and forceps birth is essential, with competency demonstrated before unsupervised births. Complex assisted births should be performed by experienced operators or under supervision. Training is crucial for patient safety. The goal of assisted birth is to expedite birth with minimal morbidity. Familiarize with theoretical knowledge and skills, supplemented by simulation training. Competence should be assessed using OSATS. High-risk assisted births should be conducted in settings with immediate access to cesarean birth. Choose instruments based on clinical circumstances and skill level. Vacuum and forceps have different benefits and risks. Birth by vacuum and forceps can lead to maternal and neonatal complications. Maternal outcomes include episiotomy, tears, OASI, postpartum hemorrhage, and incontinence. Neonatal complications include intracranial and subgaleal hemorrhage.\\n\\nPerinatal outcomes:\\n- Cephalhaematoma, facial or scalp lacerations, retinal haemorrhage, jaundice, subgaleal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, cervical spine injury, skull fracture, facial nerve palsy, and fetal death are all potential risks associated with vacuum and forceps deliveries.\\n- The ‘Od on’ device is not recommended for routine use until fully evaluated.\\n- Alternative techniques for rotational assisted vaginal birth should be considered, with Kielland’s forceps showing lower failure rates and neonatal trauma compared to rotational vacuum birth.\\n- Enhanced skills in assisted vaginal birth may reduce the need for second stage caesarean births.\\n- Vacuum-assisted birth should be discontinued if there is no evidence of progressive descent or if there are repeated ‘pop-offs’ of the instrument.\\n- Sequential use of instruments is associated with increased neonatal morbidity and should be approached with caution.\\n- Failed forceps birth is associated with an increased risk of neonatal traumatic injury.\\n- Episiotomy should be discussed with the woman as part of the preparation for assisted vaginal birth.\\n\\nThe evidence supports the use of mediolateral episiotomy at assisted vaginal birth to prevent OASI, especially for nulliparous women and birth via forceps. When performing a mediolateral episiotomy, the cut should be at a 60-degree angle initiated when the head is distending the perineum. Routine episiotomy may not be better than a restrictive policy at assisted vaginal birth. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given after assisted vaginal birth to reduce maternal infection. Good hygiene and aseptic techniques are recommended. Reassess women after birth for venous thromboembolism risk and consider thromboprophylaxis. Offer NSAIDs and paracetamol for pain relief after birth. Educate women about the risk of urinary retention and monitor voiding. Offer physiotherapy-directed strategies to reduce the risk of urinary incontinence. Shared decision making and good communication can reduce psychological morbidity after birth. Inform women of the high probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent labors following assisted vaginal birth. Individualize care for women with perineal tears or ongoing pelvic floor morbidity.\\n\\nWomen who have required more complex assisted vaginal births in theatre have an 80% chance of achieving a spontaneous vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Careful review of future plans is recommended for women who have experienced a third- or fourth-degree tear. Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information for counselling in subsequent pregnancies and adverse outcomes should trigger an incident report. Obstetricians have a duty to be honest with patients when things go wrong and should participate in adverse event reporting and reviews. Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework for women, families, and staff during serious adverse events.\\n\\n41.

The additional risk of miscarriage following these tests is below 0.5%. Amniocentesis should not be performed before 15 weeks of gestation, while CVS should not be performed before 10 weeks. Women with multiple pregnancies have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage. Screening for blood-borne viruses should be reviewed before an invasive test. Care for women undergoing these procedures should be organized according to guidance. It is important to provide information on aftercare and options for continuing or terminating the pregnancy based on test results. Additional risks associated with these tests include infection, failed procedures, and fetal injury. Training and maintaining good practice for these procedures are essential for reducing risks.\\n\\nMaintain competency with Maternal Fetal Medicine subspecialty training, fetal medicine Advanced Skills TrainingModules or equivalent international qualification. Seek support from a more experienced operator if anticipated/encountered difficulties. Review practice where an operator’s annual loss rate of normal babies exceeds 3% for either amniocentesis or CVS. Severe maternal sepsis is a very rare complication. Infection may arise from organisms present on the skin, ultrasound probe, gel, or via needle puncture of the bowel. Perform amniocentesis after 15+0 weeks’ gestation. CVS should not be performed before 10+0 weeks’ gestation. CVS should be performed from 11+0 weeks’ gestation to reduce the risk of technical challenges. Women considering amniocentesis or CVS in multiple pregnancies should receive detailed counseling and pregnancy mapping. Third-trimester amniocentesis may be offered for newly identified fetal structural anomalies, suspected fetal infection, and fetal growth restriction. Review screening results for bloodborne viruses when considering invasive testing. Optimize antiretroviral treatment to aim for an undetectable viral load prior to amniocentesis or CVS. The risk of mother to child transmission of HIV is very low for women on highly active antiretroviral therapy with undetectable viral loads. The risk of mother to child transmission of Hepatitis B is low with a viral load less than 6.99 log copies/ml but increases with higher viral loads. There is no evidence of the risk of mother to child transmission of Hepatitis C based on limited data available.\\n\\nAmniocentesis has shown a significant increase in mother-to-child transmission of HBV when HBV DNA is over 500 copies/ml.

Routine use of other investigations, including for hepatitis C, is no longer recommended. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP. Postnatal resolution of ICP should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after birth. The risk of stillbirth in ICP increases when serum bile acid concentrations are 100 micromol/L or more. Women with ICP have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They should have regular monitoring for these conditions. Women with ICP also have a small increased chance of developing hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases later in life. Women with moderate or severe ICP have a higher chance of preterm birth, meconium stained amniotic fluid, and their baby requiring neonatal care.\\n\\nActive management with planned early birth is recommended for women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Women with ICP should be monitored closely, with regular liver function tests and bile acid measurements. Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised. Drug treatments for ICP, such as topical emollients and antihistamines, can help alleviate symptoms but do not improve pregnancy outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes. Other treatments for ICP should only be considered in research studies or under specialist care. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies.\\n\\nDietary fat absorption is impaired in women with ICP, but routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms such as steatorrhoea are present. Women with ICP should consider planned birth based on peak bile acid concentration and other risk factors. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered to women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more. Standard analgesia and anaesthesia options should be offered for women with uncomplicated ICP during birth. Follow-up should be arranged at least 4 weeks postpartum for women with uncomplicated ICP to confirm resolution. ICP does not impact the choice of contraception or hormone replacement therapy. Women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and should have baseline liver function tests and bile acid concentrations checked at booking blood investigations.\\n\\nIn subsequent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests and bile acid concentrations should be performed to establish normal levels. Repeat testing should only be done if clinically indicated. \\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:\\n- Identify prognostic tools for adverse perinatal outcomes in women with ICP\\n- Determine if women with ICP should be tested for gestational diabetes\\n- Investigate effective treatments for itching and prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes\\n\\nAUDITABLE TOPICS:\\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered appropriate timing of birth\\n- Proportion of women with uncomplicated raised bile acid concentrations receiving additional investigations\\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered ursodeoxycholic acid\\n- Proportion of women with severe ICP offered continuous fetal monitoring during labor\\n\\nUSEFUL LINKS AND SUPPORT GROUPS:\\n- Information for healthcare professionals on maternal medication use in pregnancy\\n- Information for women and families from ICP Support and RCOG\\n- Information for women and families on medication use in pregnancy\\n\\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS:\\nJG, CLK, and LC have declared no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nFUNDING INFORMATION:\\nAll individuals involved in developing the Green-top Guidelines are unpaid volunteers except for RCOG staff.

Key recommendations\\n- Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage.\\n- Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may be offered cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less at gestations less than 24 weeks.\\n- For women with a singleton pregnancy and no other risk factors for preterm birth, insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women who have a short cervix incidentally identified on a late second trimester ultrasound scan.\\n- In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be considered.\\n- In women with a singleton pregnancy, insertion of an emergency cerclage may delay birth and reduce the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation.\\n- The choice of transvaginal cerclage technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon, but the cerclage should be placed as high as possible.\\n2. Background and scope\\nCerclage remains a standard option for prophylactic intervention in women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss.\\n3. Identification and assessment of evidence\\nThis guideline was developed using standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.\\n4. Definitions\\n- History-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth.\\n- Ultrasound-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in cases of cervical length shortening seen on transvaginal ultrasound.\\n- Emergency cerclage: Insertion of cerclage in the case of premature cervical dilatation with exposed fetal membranes.\\n- Transvaginal cerclage: A purse-string suture at the cervical isthmus junction.\\n- Transabdominal cerclage: A suture placed via laparotomy or laparoscopy at the cervicoisthmic junction.\\n- Occlusion cerclage: Occlusion of the external os by placement of a continuous non-absorbable suture.\\n5. History-indicated cerclage\\n- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered history-indicated cerclage.\\n- History-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with less than three previous preterm births without additional risk factors.\\n6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage\\n- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.\\n\\nAn ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical shortening in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks gestation. Cerclage is not recommended for funnelling of the cervix without cervical shortening. Serial sonographic surveillance may help identify women who may benefit from cerclage. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies or in women with Mullerian anomalies or previous cervical surgery. Further research is needed in these areas.\\n\\nCerclage is effective in women with a raised BMI. In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be discussed and considered. Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy. Decisions on care and treatment in cases of delayed miscarriage or fetal death in women with an abdominal cerclage can be difficult and should be aided by a senior obstetrician. The decision to place an emergency suture should be individualized, taking the parents' views carefully into account. The contraindications to cerclage insertion are active preterm labor, clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, continuing vaginal bleeding, PPROM, evidence of fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Before cerclage insertion, women should be informed of potential complications.\\n\\nWomen should be informed of potential complications associated with cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labour, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage. Complications such as bladder damage, cervical trauma, membrane rupture, and bleeding are rare. Cerclage insertion is associated with an increased risk of maternal pyrexia but not chorioamnionitis, PPROM, or induction of labour. Women should receive appropriate information before cerclage insertion. Investigations before insertion should include a first-trimester ultrasound and screening for aneuploidy. Amniocentesis before rescue or ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not routinely recommended. Perioperative tocolysis is not recommended, and the choice of anaesthesia should be made on a case-by-case basis. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of cerclage placement should be at the discretion of the operating team. Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure. The choice of suture material and technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon. Additional cervical occlusion suture is not routinely recommended.\\n\\nPregnancy and cervical length less than 25mm between 16 and 23 weeks were randomized to McDonald cerclage or no cerclage. Outcomes of women who underwent cerclage were analyzed by the type of suture material comparing polyester braided thread to mersilene tape. Rates of preterm birth less than 35 weeks were similar between polyester braided thread and mersilene tape. An RCT is currently ongoing assessing the type of suture material. Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efficacy of single versus double cerclage. Limited data exist on the role of cervical occlusion at the time of cerclage. Adjuvant management such as bed rest, sexual intercourse, serial sonographic surveillance of cervical length, fetal fibronectin testing, and progesterone supplementation following cerclage should be individualized based on clinical circumstances. There is no evidence to recommend abstinence from sexual intercourse following cerclage insertion. Routine fetal fibronectin testing post-cerclage is not recommended. Routine use of progesterone supplementation following cerclage is not recommended. There is no evidence that progesterone or Arabin pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical cerclage. A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before labor, usually between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. In women with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks, the cerclage should be removed.\\n\\nDelayed removal of cerclage until labor or birth is indicated is not recommended due to increased risk of maternal/fetal sepsis. Data from a study suggest that leaving the cerclage in place may lead to higher rates of chorioamnionitis. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes before 23 or after 34 weeks of gestation, delayed removal of cerclage is unlikely to be beneficial.\\n\\nCerclage for prevention of preterm birth in women with a short cervix found on transvaginal ultrasound examination: a randomized trial.

For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids. Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth, and benefits are still seen if given within 24 hours of birth.\\n\\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation. Steroids have short-term respiratory benefits for the neonate but may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons. Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended. Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage, corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth is likely. Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.\\n\\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. There is limited evidence to recommend repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after administration. The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS in pregnancies that birth between 24 hours and 7 days of administration of the second dose.\\n\\nAntenatal corticosteroids have shown significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage among infants born within specific time frames after administration. There is a reduction in fetal and neonatal death for births within 24 hours to seven days after administration. However, caution is advised in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Population-based cohort studies support the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with the largest effect seen 24 hours to seven days after the first injection. Concerns about potential risks to both women and babies include effects on maternal blood glucose levels, fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, long-term metabolic and neurological consequences, and potential impacts on brain development. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of maternal and neonatal hospital services are available.\\n\\nAntenatal corticosteroids should not be delayed in serious maternal or fetal conditions. In the presence of systemic infection, the use of corticosteroids should be carefully balanced due to the risk of exacerbating the infection. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies. The maximum number of corticosteroid courses in pregnancy should not exceed three. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions and to investigate potential off-target effects. Recommendations for future research include determining the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing neonatal morbidity in elective caesarean births at term and investigating the safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancies and women with diabetes. Auditable topics include discussions about corticosteroids in planned caesarean births and the proportion of women offered corticosteroids for preterm birth.

A safety checklist should be considered before hysteroscopy, including exclusion of pregnancy. Care after hysteroscopy should include discussing clinical findings, providing contact information, and offering a dedicated recovery area. Training in hysteroscopy should cover basic and advanced skills, and analgesia with NSAIDs or alternatives should be recommended.\\n\\nA statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, and antispasmodics given prior to hysteroscopy. NSAIDs and TENS showed no significant difference in side effects, while opioids and antispasmodics had a higher likelihood of side effects. Cervical preparation with vaginal prostaglandins can be considered in selected cases, but is associated with side effects and complications. Miniature hysteroscopes of 3.5mm or less in outer diameter should be used for diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy to reduce pain. When performing operative hysteroscopy, smaller diameter hysteroscopes and mechanical tissue removal systems should be used for less pain. The choice of hysteroscope lens angle is at the discretion of the clinician.\\n\\nAdverse events were not meta-analysed. Image quality showed no significant difference between scope sizes, or found significantly better visualisation with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Studies reported a significant increase in success when using a smaller-diameter hysteroscope. Procedural duration was significantly shorter with a miniaturised hysteroscope in some studies. The incidence of vasovagal reactions was significantly lower with a smaller-diameter hysteroscope in one study. Flexible hysteroscopes are associated with less pain during diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy. Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems are preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for endometrial polyp removal. Inactivated mechanical mini-scissors should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes for uterine septa removal. Saline is recommended as the distension medium for outpatient hysteroscopy due to less pain, better image quality, and greater patient satisfaction. Saline should be instilled at the lowest possible pressure to achieve a satisfactory view. Warming saline to body temperature can be considered for outpatient hysteroscopy.\\n\\nRoutine cervical dilatation should be avoided prior to outpatient hysteroscopy. Blind dilatation of the cervix causes pain, discomfort, and uterine trauma in the outpatient setting. Local anaesthesia should not be routinely administered prior to outpatient hysteroscopy if a vaginoscopic approach is used, but should be considered if a vaginal speculum is planned. The choice of local anaesthetic agent and route of administration should be left to the discretion of the hysteroscopist. Conscious sedation should not be routinely used in outpatient hysteroscopic procedures. If conscious sedation is used, appropriate patient selection and monitoring are essential.\\n\\nConscious sedation is defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which women respond purposefully to verbal commands. It is imperative to follow guidance on safe use to prevent life-threatening complications. Different sedation levels affect airway, ventilation, and cardiovascular function. Intravenous conscious sedation reduces pain during outpatient hysteroscopy compared to local anesthesia. Inhaled conscious sedation shows the greatest pain reduction but lacks recorded side effects. Close monitoring is necessary to identify and respond to over-sedation. Vaginoscopy is recommended for outpatient hysteroscopy due to reduced pain and quicker procedures. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, but antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected. Standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings is essential.\\n\\nEffect of cervical preparation with prostaglandins on pain relief and feasibility in outpatient hysteroscopy. Safety, acceptability and feasibility of hysteroscopy according to angle of distal optical lens. Effectiveness of the vaginoscopic approach to outpatient hysteroscopy in relieving pain compared with traditional approaches with local anaesthesia. Relative effectiveness of different types, routes, doses and timings of local anaesthesia on pain and incidence of vasovagal reactions. Effectiveness of warming fluid distension media on pain relief and satisfaction. Effectiveness of methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) on pain relief and satisfaction.

These studies have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in reducing pain associated with hysteroscopy. Additionally, studies have evaluated the optimal timing and methods of cervical preparation prior to hysteroscopy in different patient populations. Complications such as uterine perforation have also been reported in some cases.\\n\\nOUTPATIENT HYSTEROSCOPY\\nSeveral clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of different medications for cervical priming before hysteroscopy, including misoprostol, carboprost methylate suppository, and vaginal dinoprostone. These studies have shown varying levels of efficacy and pain relief in different patient populations. Additionally, studies comparing different types of hysteroscopes, such as flexible versus rigid endoscopes, have been conducted to determine the feasibility and patient discomfort associated with each type. Overall, the choice of medication and hysteroscope type can impact the success and patient experience of outpatient hysteroscopy.\\n\\nPain management in outpatient hysteroscopy is important for patient comfort and procedure completion rates. Various methods, such as warm saline distension media, topical anesthesia, and paracervical blocks, have been studied in randomized controlled trials to assess their efficacy in reducing pain during hysteroscopy.

Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.\\n\\nWhen women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).\\n\\nHistory should include details on the last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed, bleeding pattern before starting HRT, pelvic pain, discharge, vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, bleeding pattern on HRT, HRT use details, application, contraceptive usage, pregnancy risk, cervical screening history, sexual history, drug interactions, malabsorption syndromes, and endometrial cancer risk factors.\\n\\nExamination and initial investigations should include abdominal assessment, vulvo-vaginal assessment, cervical appearance assessment, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, pregnancy test, and BMI assessment.\\n\\nThe document outlines major and minor risk factors affecting endometrial cancer risk in women taking HRT, as well as risk factors independent of HRT use. It also discusses the effect of HRT preparation on endometrial cancer risk and provides recommendations for different HRT regimens.\\n\\nContinuous combined HRT with daily progestogen is recommended for endometrial protection. Sequential/cyclical HRT should be considered in women over 50 with no unscheduled bleeding. Tricycling progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\\n\\nUnopposed estrogen use in people with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Different progestogen types can provide endometrial protection, with specific recommendations for each type. The use of a levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device is also discussed for endometrial protection.\\n\\nIt is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about the limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium if unscheduled bleeding occurs. A change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered if new unscheduled bleeding develops at 4 years of use. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. Normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT should be understood. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is important. Clinical pathways for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed based on risk factors and time-frames.\\n\\nConservative management strategies can be offered for unscheduled bleeding in women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer. Adjustments to HRT can be made if bleeding persists after changes in dose or preparation. Referral for ultrasound is recommended for certain criteria, and HRT can be continued during assessment. Recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options are provided based on ultrasound findings. Endometrial assessment is also recommended for asymptomatic women with a thickened endometrium on TVS. Blind outpatient endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling are options for further assessment.\\n\\nMenopausal women with unscheduled bleeding may benefit from adjustments in progestogen and hysteroscopic assessment. Recommendations include reassurance and progestogen adjustments after a normal biopsy, urgent hysteroscopy for thickened endometrial tissue, and referral to gynaecology oncology for hyperplasia or cancer. Adjustments in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and non-hormonal alternatives should be considered based on endometrial histology. Progestogen type and route of HRT can impact bleeding profiles, with options such as the Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD) and transdermal preparations showing potential benefits. Recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, considering low dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial in reducing unscheduled bleeding episodes.\\n\\nCounsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding in perimenopausal women with sequential preparations. Consider timing and offering desogestrel or combined oral contraceptives. Adjust progestogen dose or type as needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists.\\n\\nStute P, Neulen J, Wildt L.

It was based on best available evidence, applied robust methodological processes, and addressed shared priorities. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, and evidence-practice gaps persist.\\nMain results and the role of chance: The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past 5 years but remains of low to moderate quality. Key updates include further refinement of diagnostic criteria, recognition of broader features of PCOS, emphasis on diverse burden of disease, and evidence-based medical therapy and fertility management.\\nWider implications of the findings: The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert input, and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated to address key gaps in knowledge and promote future research.\\n\\nThe true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very Low confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.\\n\\nGeneral principles:\\n- All diagnostic assessments recommended for use in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm.\\n- Irregular menstrual cycles defined based on age and cycle length.\\n- Adolescents with irregular cycles should discuss assessment and diagnosis of PCOS considering diagnostic challenges.\\n- For adolescents with PCOS features, but not meeting diagnostic criteria, increased risk should be considered.\\n- Ovulatory dysfunction can occur with regular cycles, and serum progesterone levels can confirm anovulation.\\n\\nBiochemical hyperandrogenism:\\n- Total and free testosterone should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS diagnosis.\\n- Laboratories should use accurate assays for measuring androgens.\\n- Assessing biochemical hyperandrogenism is valuable in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism.\\n\\nClinical hyperandrogenism:\\n- Hirsutism alone predicts biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults.\\n- Female pattern hair loss and acne are weak predictors of hyperandrogenism.\\n- Comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for clinical hyperandrogenism symptoms.\\n\\nUltrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology:\\n- Follicle number per ovary is an effective ultrasound marker for PCOM in adults.\\n- Criteria for PCOM should be based on follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement.\\n- Thresholds for PCOM should be regularly revised with advancing ultrasound technology.\\n\\nAnti-Müllerian hormone in the diagnosis of PCOS:\\n- Serum AMH may be used for defining PCOM in adults.\\n- Serum AMH should not be used as a single test for PCOS diagnosis.\\n- Serum AMH should not be used in adolescents.\\n\\nEthnic variation:\\n- PCOS prevalence is high across all ethnicities and regions.\\n- Presentation of PCOS may vary across ethnic groups.\\n\\nMenopause life stage:\\n- PCOS diagnosis may be considered enduring/lifelong.\\n- Clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism may persist post-menopause in women with PCOS.\\n\\nCardiovascular disease risk:\\n- Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n- All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors.\\n- Lipid profile and blood pressure should be measured regularly in women with PCOS.\\n\\nCardiovascular guidelines should consider PCOS as a risk factor. Healthcare professionals and women with PCOS should prioritize preventative strategies for cardiovascular risk. Consideration should be given to differences in risk factors across ethnicities and ages. PCOS increases the risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, requiring regular assessment. Healthcare professionals should prioritize preventative strategies for diabetes risk in women with PCOS. PCOS is associated with higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial hyperplasia, and cancer. Screening and management strategies should be implemented. Psychological features are common in PCOS and should be addressed. Lifestyle interventions, including healthy eating and physical activity, are recommended for all women with PCOS to improve metabolic health. Behavioral strategies can also optimize weight management and emotional well-being.\\n\\nBehavioural or cognitive behavioural interventions could be considered to increase support, engagement, retention, adherence, and maintenance of healthy lifestyle and improve health outcomes in women with PCOS. Healthcare professionals and women should consider that there is no evidence to support any one type of diet composition over another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, or psychological outcomes. Any diet composition consistent with population guidelines for healthy eating will have health benefits. Tailoring of dietary changes to food preferences, avoiding unduly restrictive diets, and discussing barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to dietary change are important. Healthcare professionals should encourage physical activity consistent with population guidelines and discuss barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to physical activity. Self-monitoring with fitness tracking devices could be considered to support and promote active lifestyles. Many women with PCOS experience weight stigma, and healthcare professionals should be aware of their weight biases. Weight stigma education and minimization strategies should be promoted. Weight-inclusive practices should be followed in PCOS care. Metformin may be considered for adults with PCOS for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes. Combined oral contraceptive pills could be recommended for management of hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. Inositol could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values.\\n\\n4.7.5 PP Shared decision-making should include discussion about the regulatory status and quality control of inositol in any form.\\n4.7.6 PP Policy makers and healthcare professionals should ensure women have access to evidence-based information for shared decision-making.\\n4.8 Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism in women with PCOS.\\n4.9 Bariatric/metabolic surgery could be considered to improve various health outcomes in women with PCOS.\\n4.10 Women with PCOS have higher risk pregnancies and should receive appropriate monitoring and support during antenatal care.\\n4.11 Metformin in pregnancy has not been shown to prevent certain complications but could be considered in some circumstances.\\n5 Assessment and treatment of infertility should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm and include lifestyle interventions.\\n\\nIn women with anovulatory PCOS, IVF is effective, with elective single-embryo transfer to minimize multiple pregnancies. Women should be counseled about the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome during IVF/ICSI treatment. The use of a GnRH antagonist protocol is recommended to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing embryos is recommended in certain IVF/ICSI cycles. Metformin therapy may be used to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and miscarriage. In vitro maturation and ICSI could be considered as alternatives to stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles. Inositol therapy is considered experimental in PCOS. Anti-obesity agents should only be used in research settings for reproductive outcomes. Letrozole is the preferred first-line therapy for infertility in women with PCOS. IVF may be considered as a third-line therapy for anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS. Single embryo transfer is preferred to minimize pregnancy complications.\\n\\nThe Australian Diabetes Society, along with other relevant organizations, developed guidelines for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome. The effort was funded by the Australian Government and supported by various partner organizations. Conflict of interest disclosures were made and the guideline was peer-reviewed. The data extracted is available in a repository. The authors' contributions and a list of key contributors are provided in the guideline.\",\n    \"The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline to improve healthcare delivery for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age, with symptoms including pain and infertility. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, including hormone therapies and surgical options. While there are still gaps in knowledge, the guideline aims to address the clinical needs of patients with endometriosis.\\n\\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments like GnRH agonists or antagonists, and surgical options. The use of Danazol, anti-progestogens, LUNA, PSN, and anti-adhesion agents is no longer recommended. Surgical options include excision over ablation and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma. Referral to a center of expertise is recommended for deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who do not wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.\\n\\n33 Consider long-term consequences of early menopause before removing ovaries.

regarding the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. \\n89 Consider aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain. \\n90 Consider combined MHT for postmenopausal symptoms\\n\\nClinicians should be aware that women with endometriosis who have undergone an early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have an increased risk of diminished bone density, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Women with endometriosis also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, regardless of surgical menopause. For extrapelvic endometriosis, surgical removal is preferred for abdominal cases, while hormone treatment may be an option when surgery is not possible. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis, with surgery recommended when indicated in a multidisciplinary manner. Women with asymptomatic endometriosis should be informed and counseled, but surgical excision or medical treatment is not recommended. Routine ultrasound monitoring for asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered. While there is no direct evidence, aiming for a healthy lifestyle with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity may help prevent endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have a slightly higher risk of certain cancers, but general cancer prevention measures are recommended.\\n\\nClinical symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, and infertility should prompt consideration of endometriosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and previous diagnoses of certain conditions increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may be predictive of endometriosis, but overall, clinical symptoms alone are not reliable for diagnosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be considered if the examination is normal.\\n\\nThe guideline recommends using clinical examination for diagnosing endometriosis and further diagnostic steps if needed. Medical technologies like imaging and biomarkers can also be used, but there are limitations in their reliability. Imaging techniques like ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but they may not always be conclusive, especially for superficial disease. Laparoscopy may still be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, especially if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful.\\n\\nThe guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis. Laparoscopy is considered the standard for diagnosis, but it is invasive and costly. Empirical treatment following imaging results can be considered for symptomatic patients. Long-term monitoring for endometriosis is not recommended for preventing adverse outcomes. Individualized follow-up based on previous treatments and disease severity is suggested. Further research is needed to develop consensus criteria for diagnosis and to investigate long-term management approaches.\\n\\nImpact of the time of diagnosis on quality of life: Early diagnosis of endometriosis may reduce pain, infertility risk, and provide relief, empowerment, and understanding for affected women. While no studies directly compare early versus late diagnosis on quality of life, diagnosis can lead to positive adjustments and support services. The guideline recommends symptom relief or treatment after diagnosis. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on quality of life.\\n\\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain: Analgesics, such as NSAIDs, may be offered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence supporting their use is limited. Hormone treatments, including combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, or antagonists, are recommended to reduce pain. Individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability should be considered when choosing hormone treatments. Hormone treatments have shown to be effective in reducing pain symptoms associated with endometriosis.\\n\\nBased on clinical trials, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have been shown to improve pain associated with endometriosis. Continuous use of OCP may be more effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain compared to cyclic use. The vaginal ring and transdermal patch have also been studied for their efficacy in treating endometriosis. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have shown to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with some adverse effects. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems and subdermal implants is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol is not recommended due to severe side effects. GnRH agonists have been found to be effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain, but may be less effective than other treatments. Further details are available in the full guideline.\\n\\nIn studies comparing different routes of administration, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches, and decreased libido were reported, but there was no difference between intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intranasal administration. The bone mineral density was decreased in both groups at 20 weeks after treatment, but the degree of loss of BMD was significantly higher in the full dose group. Reduction of bone mineral density is one of the undesirable effects of long-term GnRH-agonist treatment. It is recommended to prescribe women GnRH agonists to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Clinicians should consider prescribing combined hormonal add-back therapy alongside GnRH agonist therapy to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms. A meta-analysis found that Lumbar spine BMD after treatment and at 6 months of follow-up were superior with GnRH agonist + add-back therapy than with GnRH agonist alone. GnRH antagonists have been added to the medical treatment options for endometriosis. GnRH antagonists can be considered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination with other medications to reduce endometriosis-associated pain.\\n\\nSurgical treatment to eliminate endometriotic lesions and divide adhesions has long been an important part of the management of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is recommended over ablation for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Superficial peritoneal endometriosis may be a separate entity, but more research is needed on its surgical treatment outcomes. Research should investigate the effect of surgery on pain and quality of life parameters in different subtypes of endometriosis.\\n\\nSurgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea was analyzed in a Cochrane review. Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) did not offer additional benefit, but presacral neurectomy (PSN) showed significant benefits in reducing pain and improving quality of life. PSN is associated with increased risk of adverse effects. \\n\\nFor ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy is recommended over drainage and coagulation to reduce recurrence of pain and endometrioma. CO2 laser vaporization can also be considered, with similar recurrence rates beyond the first year. It is important to minimize ovarian damage during surgery. \\n\\nFor deep endometriosis, excision of nodules is recommended, especially for colorectal involvement. Various surgical techniques have shown improvement in pain and quality of life, with segmental bowel resection being a widely acceptable option. Standardized reporting of surgical trials is recommended for deep endometriosis.\\n\\nA multicentre study showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life after laparoscopic excision of deep rectovaginal endometriosis. Analgesia use decreased, and complications occurred in 6.8% of cases. Surgical removal of deep endometriosis can reduce pain and improve quality of life. Referral to a centre of expertise is recommended, and patients should be informed of potential risks and benefits. Surgery improves pain and quality of life, but caution is advised due to varying study methods and outcomes. Different surgical approaches for bowel endometriosis have shown improvements in pain and quality of life. A minimally invasive approach is preferred for radical removal of endometriosis lesions. Complications of surgery for bowel endometriosis are significant, especially with rectal surgery.\\n\\nThe reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed improvement in pain symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder and ureteral endometriosis resulted in significant improvement in pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy can reduce the risk of urinary retention. Hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain can relieve symptoms and reduce the need for re-operation. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic factors to predict improvement in pain symptoms. Further research is needed in this area.\\n\\nSurgical treatment for endometriosis includes excision or ablation techniques, with excision showing better outcomes in terms of pain improvement. Laparoscopic surgery is effective for deep infiltrating endometriosis, with various techniques used for different locations of endometriotic lesions. Quality of life and fertility outcomes are important considerations in the surgical management of endometriosis. Recurrence rates after surgery vary depending on the type of procedure performed. It is essential to consider the impact of surgery on symptoms and quality of life when choosing a surgical approach for endometriosis.\\n\\nClinical outcomes after surgical treatment of endometriosis with colorectal involvement: a review of studies on laparoscopic excision and bowel resection.\\n\\nII.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  \\nThe question on whether medical therapies are effective as an adjunct to surgical therapy considers both therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes, and therapies aimed at secondary prevention. A good practice point in this respect was formulated in the previous ESHRE guideline for endometriosis: “The GDG recommends that clinicians clearly distinguish adjunctive short-term (<6 months) hormone treatment after surgery from long-term (>6 months) hormone treatment; the latter is aimed at secondary prevention.” The evidence and recommendations are separated into ‘therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes’ and ‘therapies for secondary prevention’. \\n\\nPICO QUESTION: ARE MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT TO SURGICAL THERAPY?\\n\\nIt is not recommended to prescribe preoperative hormone treatment to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis. Surgeons may prescribe preoperative medical treatment with GnRH agonists to facilitate surgery, but there are no controlled studies supporting this. Postoperative hormone therapy may be prescribed for pain in women with endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. \\n\\nII.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis\\n\\nThere is no conclusive evidence to make any definite recommendation on whether medical therapies or surgery are more effective for relieving pain in women with endometriosis. The decision between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain should be based on shared decision-making, individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. \\n\\nII.6. Non-medical management strategies\\n\\nNon-medical management strategies for endometriosis include complementary and alternative medicine, self-management strategies, and psychological and physical therapies. Research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these strategies in women with endometriosis. Acupuncture, psychological therapy, exercise, and other non-medical approaches are discussed in recent studies for relieving endometriosis-associated pain and improving quality of life.\\n\\nOne RCT compared ‘sham’ acupuncture with verum acupuncture in women with endometriosis and found that verum acupuncture resulted in significantly less pain and improved psychological well-being. Another study concluded that Japanese acupuncture is a safe and effective adjunct therapy for endometriosis-related pain. Overall, acupuncture was found to alleviate dysmenorrhea and pain in women with endometriosis, with little to no reported adverse effects.\\n\\nPhysiotherapy interventions for endometriosis are not well documented, but pelvic floor exercises have shown moderate evidence for addressing pelvic floor dysfunction. However, no specific research was identified for pelvic floor training for women with endometriosis. Massage and trigger point release therapy have not shown significant reduction in pain compared to general massage in chronic noncancer pain.\\n\\nExercise has benefits for mental health and overall health, but there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion on its effects on endometriosis-related pain. Psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and mindfulness-based programmes, have shown some improvements in pain and quality of life for women with endometriosis, but more research is needed. Overall, no recommendation can be made about physical therapies, exercise, or psychological interventions for improving quality of life and reducing pain in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nParticipants were included up to 5 years after their laparoscopic diagnosis, with most indicating their post-endometriosis-treatment condition as \\\"recovered\\\" and no current symptoms collected. No recommendations can be made regarding the effectiveness of psychological approaches for pain and quality of life in women with endometriosis. Studies on the impact of psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Nutrition may affect endometriosis symptoms, with limited studies evaluating the benefit of dietary interventions. Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may have positive effects on pain scores. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy were not well studied. Women with endometriosis may change their diets to alleviate symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine studies were generally poorly constructed. No recommendations can be made for nutrition or Chinese Medicine to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with endometriosis. Adequately designed trials are needed to define the potential benefits of non-medical interventions in endometriosis.\\n\\nWomen with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis associated pain, infertility, or both. For clarity, the GDG decided to separately discuss the evidence on pain as the outcome in chapter II; infertility as an outcome is addressed in this chapter. The first part of this chapter deals with treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility, including medical, surgical, and non-pharmacological treatments. Medically assisted reproduction and adjunctive treatments are discussed in the second part of the chapter. In the last part of the chapter, the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcome is discussed, as well as indications for ART after surgery, and indications for fertility preservation.\\n\\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility. Women seeking pregnancy should not be prescribed postoperative hormone suppression with the sole purpose to enhance future pregnancy rates. Those women who cannot attempt to or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery may be offered hormone therapy as it does not negatively impact their fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors have shown uncertain effects on pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase the chance of natural pregnancy, although no data from comparative studies exist. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis improves fertility, it may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated Endometriosis Fertility Index.\\n\\nThe Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their reproductive options after surgery. It can help reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or other fertility management options for women with endometriosis-related infertility. It is recommended to use the EFI for better patient phenotyping in studies on surgical treatment and/or the place of medically assisted reproduction in endometriosis-related infertility. Studies should clarify whether intrauterine insemination (IUI) with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women with different subtypes of endometriosis, and the value of the EFI to predict the relevance of IUI could be further investigated. \\n\\nIn infertile women with stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may consider performing IUI with ovarian stimulation instead of expectant management or IUI alone, as it increases pregnancy rates. The benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI in women with stage III/IV endometriosis is uncertain, but it could be considered. \\n\\nThere are currently no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of assisted reproductive technology (ART) versus no intervention in women with endometriosis. Studies comparing the outcomes of ART in women with endometriosis to women without endometriosis have reported lower fertilization rates and pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. The impact of endometrioma on ART reproductive outcomes has been summarized, with lower numbers of oocytes retrieved in women with endometrioma. Studies evaluating different ovarian stimulation protocols in women with endometriosis have not shown significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates.\\n\\nIn women with endometriosis, both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols can be offered for ART based on patient and physician preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been demonstrated. Women with endometriosis can be reassured regarding the safety of ART, as recurrence rates are not increased compared to those not undergoing ART. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometriomas is recommended. Overall, evidence does not show a negative impact of endometriosis on live birth rate after ART, although ovarian response and clinical pregnancy rates may be lower. ART may be effective for endometriosis-associated infertility, especially in cases where other treatments have failed. The severity of the disease may affect live birth rates, with stage III-IV endometriosis potentially decreasing the rate. Studies evaluating IUI and ART outcomes in women with endometriosis are recommended to report clinically relevant outcomes and perform subgroup analysis by stage of endometriosis and type of disease. Further research on medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility is needed to clarify treatment effectiveness.\\n\\nSurgical therapies as an adjunct to MAR for endometriosis-associated infertility may be effective. Surgery for peritoneal endometriosis prior to ART has shown higher implantation, pregnancy, and live birth rates. However, surgery for ovarian endometrioma before ART does not improve live birth rates and may negatively impact ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be guided by pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain. More data are needed to confirm the benefits of surgery for improving ART outcomes.\\n\\nIn symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis, surgical removal of the lesions may be (re)considered. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery, and complication rates are discussed in further detail in section II.3.f. Non-medical management strategies for infertility associated with endometriosis have not shown clear evidence of benefit. Fertility preservation should be discussed with women with severe endometriosis, as surgical treatment can impact ovarian reserve and AMH levels. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcomes is still unclear.\\n\\nEndometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show a variety of changes, including decidual reaction, atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis. Management may involve serial monitoring or surgery if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy does not consistently improve symptoms of endometriosis, and women should continue medical treatment after giving birth. Endometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, requiring referral to a specialized center. Complications from endometriosis during pregnancy are rare but may be life-threatening, necessitating surgical management. Women with endometriosis have an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms in the first trimester. Larger studies are needed to understand the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes. Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association between endometriosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the second and third trimesters. Complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth, placenta previa, and hypertensive disorders may be more common in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nWomen with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth and Caesarean section. They may also be more likely to have babies that are small for gestational age and experience neonatal death. Endometriosis does not seem to increase the risk of obstetric hemorrhages. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, but currently, there is no need for increased monitoring or discouraging pregnancy in women with endometriosis. Studies on interventions for risk reduction are lacking. Risk factors for endometriosis recurrence include surgery-related variables and patient-related factors. Surgical techniques for prevention of recurrence include ovarian cystectomy for endometrioma.\\n\\nCystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma ≥3 cm. Ovarian surgery should consider impact on ovarian reserve. Hormone therapy post-surgery can prevent disease recurrence. OCP and LNG-IUS have shown effectiveness in reducing pain and recurrence. Progestogens and GnRH agonists are also options. Long-term hormone treatment can prevent endometriosis recurrence. ART does not increase endometriosis recurrence. LNG-IUS or combined hormonal contraceptives can be used post-surgery for prevention. Consider patient preferences, costs, risks, and side effects when choosing treatment. Data on subtype-specific treatments are limited. Recommendations are strong for ovarian endometrioma and weak for deep endometriosis.\\n\\nIV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis  \\nMedical treatment for recurrent endometriosis after surgery has been described in few RCTs and uncontrolled observational studies. In an RCT, 242 women with recurrent pelvic pain within 1 year following laparoscopic surgery were randomised to dienogest or depot leuprolide acetate. VAS scores for pelvic pain, back pain, dyspareunia or endometrioma size were significantly lower at 12 weeks follow-up. Another RCT compared 6-month treatment with desogestrel or OCP in 40 women with recurrent dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain after conservative surgery. Both treatments resulted in a significant decrease of VAS scores at 6 months compared to baseline. In the RCT by Vercellini and colleagues, 90 women with recurrent moderate or severe pelvic pain after conservative surgery for symptomatic endometriosis were randomised to 6-month treatment with cyproterone acetate or a continuous monophasic OCP. The study showed no difference in efficacy for cyproterone acetate versus a continuous monophasic OCP. Dienogest treatment immediately after recurrence was effective in controlling disease progression in a small cohort study. Dienogest was also effective in reducing the size of endometriomas and providing symptomatic relief in another study. Retreatment with nafarelin for recurrent endometriosis symptoms showed improvements in symptoms. \\n\\nSurgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis has limited evidence, with one small, uncontrolled study showing recurrence of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain in some women. A small prospective study showed that surgery for recurrent endometriomas may harm healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserve. \\n\\nAny hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. Recurrence of endometriosis is a prevalent clinical observation, and the lack of evidence should not prioritize certain treatments over others that have been shown effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain. Other causes for pain symptoms, such as adenomyosis or pelvic floor dysfunction, should be investigated if symptoms recur soon after surgery.\\n\\nIn adolescents, diagnosis of endometriosis is often based on pain symptoms only, which may have a more varied presentation compared to adults. Symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and nausea with pelvic pain should raise suspicion for endometriosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, should be considered, and transvaginal ultrasound is recommended for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents. Serum biomarkers are not recommended for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. If imaging is negative and medical treatments have not been successful, diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered. Histological confirmation of endometriosis through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended, as negative histology does not entirely rule out the disease.\\n\\n28: 2026- 2031.  \\nQuestioning patients about their adolescent history can identify markers associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis.

Clinicians may consider NSAIDs as treatment for endometriosis-associated pain in adolescents with (suspected) endometriosis. In adolescents with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and associated pain, clinicians may consider prescribing GnRH agonists for up to 1 year, as they are effective and safe when combined with add-back therapy. In young women and adolescents, if GnRH agonist treatment is considered, it should be used only after careful consideration and discussion of potential side effects and potential long-term health risks with a practitioner in a secondary or tertiary care setting. \\n\\nIn adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians may consider surgical removal of endometriosis lesions to manage endometriosis-related symptoms. If surgical treatment is indicated in adolescents with endometriosis, it should be performed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon, and, if possible, complete laparoscopic removal of all present endometriosis should be performed. \\n\\nThe effect of long-term treatment with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery for endometriosis in adolescents showed low recurrence rates.\\n\\nEndometriosis symptoms may persist after menopause, with a prevalence of 2-5% in postmenopausal women. Hormone therapy may stimulate endometriosis growth. Surgical treatment is recommended as first-line for postmenopausal women with endometriosis.\\n\\n2007 , Pavone and Bulun, \\n2012 , Polyzos , et al. , 2011 ). Also, there are very little options available for medical treatment - besides \\nusing analgesics or aromatase inhibitors (see  below) - due to the naturally low levels of estrogen in \\npostmenopausal women.\\n  \\nVI.2.a. Surgical treatment  \\nWe identified five cohort studies on surgery in postmenopausal endometriosis patients: three studies \\ndescribed a cohort of postmenopausal women who presented with pain and subsequently underwent \\nsurgery whilst two retrospective cohort studies reported on women in whom endometriosis was \\nidentified based on histology.   \\nVI.2.a.1. Efficacy of surgery in postmenopausal women  \\nA prospective cohort by Redwine et al.  included 75 women with previous bilateral salpingo -\\noophorectomy ( BSO) who received excision of histologically confirmed  endometriosis as treatment for \\npain. Most women had a marked alleviation of pain after excision of endometriosis, although only 13 patients underwent a re -operation due to pelvic pain. No malignancy was found in this study.  \\nBehera et al.  described a retrospective cohort of 124 women with chronic pelvic pain after hysterectomy and BSO. Laparoscopic treatment of any pelvic pathologic condition improved pain symptoms in the majority of women. In 2 women a malignancy of the bowel was found.  \\nClayton et al.  described a case series of five women with recurrent pain after BSO and hysterectomy who had residual endometriosis managed by laparoscopic excision. The women had improved pain symptoms at 4 months after surgery.\\nVI.2.a.2. Risk of malignant transformation in postmenopausal women  \\nConsideration of the possibility of malignancy should be taken in postmenopausal women with endometriosis irrespective of symptoms. This may require further imaging studies and/or the surgical exploration of the area.  \\nA retrospective cohort study identified 72 postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis, of which 57 had endometriomas. In 35% of these endometriomas a (pre)malignancy was found. \\nSun et al.  described a retrospective cohort study of postmenopausal patients in whom endometriosis was histologically confirmed. In 62 women an endometrioma was found and 10 women had a coexisting ovarian, endometrial,  or cervical malignancy.  \\n\\nRecommendations: \\nClinicians may consider surgical treatment for postmenopausal women presenting with signs of endometriosis and/or pain. \\nThe GDG recommends that clinicians acknowledge the uncertainty towards the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women.\\nFor postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain, clinicians may consider aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option especially if surgery is not feasible. \\n\\nJustification: \\nSurgical treatment can improve pain in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors have shown effectiveness in reducing endometriosis-associated pain in premenopausal women and may be a medical alternative to surgery for postmenopausal endometriosis.\\n\\nResearch recommendation: \\nMore evidence is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors or other medical treatments in postmenopausal women with endometriosis-related pain symptoms.\\n\\nAbdominal wall endometriosis is frequently associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI. The appearance of scar endometriosis on imaging depends on various factors. CT imaging has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing abdominal wall endometriosis. MRI is preferred in younger patients due to improved tissue characterization and lack of ionizing radiation. Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms with a catamenial pattern.\\n\\nCatamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. In a review of data on 490 cases of catamenial pneumothorax, pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in a high percentage of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain, with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, while hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis. In cases of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.\\n\\nWomen with incidental findings of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment unless there is evidence of disease progression. Surgical excision or ablation is not recommended due to associated risks. Medical treatment is also not recommended. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about any incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical procedures or prescribe medical treatment. Monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered, but there is limited evidence supporting its benefit. Women can be advised to aim for a healthy lifestyle and diet to potentially reduce the risk of developing endometriosis in the future. The use of hormonal contraceptives for primary prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk assessment should only be done in a research setting.\\n\\nEndometriosis shares features with cancer, such as resistance to apoptosis and chronic inflammation. While there is a small increased risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer with endometriosis, the absolute risk remains low. Clinicians should reassure patients and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with OCPs potentially reducing ovarian and endometrial cancer risk but increasing breast and cervical cancer risk. More research is needed on the impact of hormone treatments on cancer risk.\\n\\nAmong women with endometriosis, hormonal treatments do not impact ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy through CA-125 measurement or imaging is not recommended for women with endometriosis without additional risk factors. Monitoring for other types of malignancy is not justified given the low absolute risk in women with endometriosis. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis to guide monitoring needs.\\n\\nSome authors advocate for earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete disease removal to reduce future ovarian cancer risk. However, preventative surgery may not significantly reduce the future risk of cancer due to the relapsing nature of endometriosis. Studies have shown that unilateral oophorectomy or removal of all visible endometriosis during surgery can dramatically reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Other types of surgical treatment were not significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should consider the epidemiological data showing that complete excision of visible endometriosis may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, weighing the potential benefits against the risks of surgery.\\n\\nPrevention of endometriosis is essential. Endometriosis and cancer are linked. Conflicts of interest among members of the guideline development group should be declared. Key questions related to the diagnosis, treatment, recurrence, adolescence, menopause, extrapelvic endometriosis, asymptomatic endometriosis, primary prevention, and endometriosis and cancer should be addressed in the guideline. The methodology for guideline development involves literature searches, evidence collection, and consensus meetings.\\n\\nThe justification section provides data on the interpretation of supporting evidence and other factors considered. Costs and resource impact are discussed where relevant. Recommendations are labeled as 'strong' or 'weak' based on the GRADE approach. Good practice points are based on expert opinion. The guideline draft underwent a review process before publication. Implementation strategies include dissemination and development of patient versions. The guideline will be considered for revision in 2025. Errors or omissions will be corrected in the web version of the document. Diagnosis of endometriosis includes considering symptoms and clinical examination. Treatment options for pain and infertility are discussed. Pregnancy and endometriosis have variable effects. Stakeholder review was conducted before publication. Copyright restrictions apply to the use of the guidelines.\",\n    \"The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline for endometriosis to improve healthcare delivery. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age. Symptoms include pain and infertility, impacting quality of life. Diagnosis can take years, and treatment options include hormone therapy and surgery. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nTreatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments, combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and aromatase inhibitors. Surgical options such as excision of endometriosis lesions or cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma are also recommended. Referral to a center of expertise is advised for women with deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who no longer wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.\\n\\n33 When deciding whether to remove the ovaries, consider the long-term consequences of early menopause and the possible need for hormone replacement therapy. \\n34 Total hysterectomy is preferred when performing hysterectomy. \\n35 Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis. \\n36 Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. \\n37 Consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. \\n39 Do not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility in infertile women with endometriosis. \\n40 Postoperative hormone suppression should not be prescribed solely to enhance future pregnancy rates in women seeking pregnancy. \\n41 Hormone therapy may be offered to women who cannot or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery as it does not negatively impact fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. \\n42 Avoid prescribing pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation induction to improve natural pregnancy rates in infertile women with endometriosis. \\n43 Consider operative laparoscopy as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. \\n44 Consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility to increase the chance of natural pregnancy. \\n45 Operative laparoscopy may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive, although evidence is limited. \\n46 The decision to perform surgery should be guided by pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI). \\n47 In infertile women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis, intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation may increase pregnancy rates. \\n48 Consider the use of IUI with ovarian stimulation in infertile women with rASRM stage III/IV endometriosis with tubal patency. \\n49 ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis, especially if tubal function is compromised, there is male factor infertility, low EFI, or if other treatments have failed. \\n50 Offer both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols for ART based on patients' and physicians' preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been demonstrated. \\n51 Reassure women with endometriosis regarding the safety of ART as recurrence rates are not increased compared to those not undergoing ART. \\n52 Consider antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometrioma. \\n53 Extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART treatment is not recommended to improve live birth rate in infertile women with endometriosis. \\n54 Prolonged administration of COC/progestogens as a pre-treatment to ART to increase live birth rates is not recommended. \\n55 Avoid routinely performing surgery prior to ART to improve live birth rates in women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis. \\n56 Avoid routinely performing surgery for ovarian endometrioma prior to ART to improve live birth rates as evidence shows no benefit and surgery may impact ovarian reserve. \\n57 Surgery for endometrioma prior to ART can be considered to improve endometriosis-associated pain or accessibility of follicles. \\n58 Surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART should be guided mainly by pain symptoms and patient preference as its effectiveness on reproductive outcome is uncertain. \\n59 Discuss the pros and cons of fertility preservation with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. \\n60 Do not advise patients to become pregnant solely to treat endometriosis as pregnancy does not always lead to symptom improvement or disease progression reduction. \\n61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma during pregnancy to a centre with appropriate expertise. \\n62 Be aware of the increased risk of first-trimester miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. \\n63 Be aware of endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy, although rare, and interpret findings with caution. \\n64 Perform ovarian cystectomy instead of drainage and electrocoagulation for the secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated symptoms. \\n65 Consider postoperative use of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptive for the secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated symptoms. \\n66 Offer long-term hormone treatment for the secondary prevention of endometrioma and endometriosis-associated symptom recurrence after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma. \\n67 Consider long-term administration of postoperative hormone treatment for the prevention of recurrence of deep endometri\\n\\nClinicians should continue to treat women with a history of endometriosis after surgical menopause with combined estrogen-progestogen until natural menopause. Women with endometriosis who have undergone early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have an increased risk of bone density loss, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Extrapelvic endometriosis may present with symptoms such as cyclical shoulder pain or cough, and surgical removal is preferred for abdominal cases. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical excision or prescribe medical treatment for asymptomatic cases. Routine ultrasound monitoring can be considered for asymptomatic endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have a slightly higher risk of certain cancers, but the absolute risk increase is low. Clinicians should reassure women about their cancer risk and recommend general cancer prevention measures.\\n\\nWomen with symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, haematuria, shoulder tip pain, catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, cyclical scar swelling and pain, fatigue, and infertility should be considered for endometriosis diagnosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and a history of certain conditions increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may also indicate the presence of endometriosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps should be considered even if the examination is normal.\\n\\nThe guideline recommends clinical examination for the diagnosis of endometriosis and further diagnostic steps using medical technologies. Vaginal and rectovaginal examinations may be inappropriate in certain situations and painful for some women. Biomarkers are not reliable for diagnosing endometriosis. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but a negative finding does not exclude endometriosis. Laparoscopy may be considered if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful. Laparoscopic identification of lesions should be confirmed by histology.\\n\\nThe guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis, with laparoscopy or empirical treatment as options. Long-term monitoring may not be beneficial for preventing adverse outcomes, but follow-up and psychological support are recommended. Research is needed to develop consensus criteria for diagnosis and investigate long-term management approaches for endometriosis.\\n\\nEndometriosis can have a detrimental effect on the lives of affected women, partners, and families. An early diagnosis, ideally followed by early, adequate treatment, may reduce pain, reduce the risk of infertility, and provide an explanation for symptoms. Although no studies exist to support the benefits of early versus late diagnosis, women may experience relief, legitimation, and empowerment from the diagnosis. The impact of endometriosis on quality of life should be assessed using validated tools. In symptomatic women, attempts should be made to relieve symptoms, either by empirical treatment or after a diagnosis of endometriosis. Large longitudinal studies are recommended to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on the quality of life of women with endometriosis.\\n\\nBased on clinical trials, continuous use of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) is recommended for treating endometriosis-associated pain. Continuous OCP use has shown to be more effective in reducing dysmenorrhea recurrence compared to cyclic use. Safety profiles of continuous and cyclic OCP use are similar. Different modes of administration, such as vaginal ring and transdermal patch, have been studied, with varying results in terms of effectiveness. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have also been found to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with different side effect profiles to consider. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol is not recommended due to severe side effects. GnRH agonists have shown effectiveness in relieving endometriosis-associated pain, but may not be as effective as other treatments such as levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or oral danazol.\\n\\nThere was no significant difference between treatments after resumption of menstruation. Safety concerns for GnRH agonists include vaginal dryness, hot flushes, headaches, weight gain, and acne. Add-back therapy can prevent bone loss when used with GnRH agonists. Aromatase inhibitors can reduce endometriosis-associated pain but have side effects like vaginal dryness, hot flushes, and diminished bone mineral density. It is recommended to prescribe GnRH agonists as a second-line treatment and consider add-back therapy to prevent bone loss. GnRH antagonists can also be considered as a second-line treatment for endometriosis-associated pain. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination with other medications for treatment.\\n\\nSurgical treatment is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is superior to ablation in reducing symptoms. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of surgery for superficial peritoneal endometriosis.\\n\\nSurgical intervention for endometriosis, such as pelvic nerve pathway interruption and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma, has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and recurrence. However, these procedures come with risks and require careful consideration. For deep endometriosis involving the bowel, various surgical techniques have been used with promising results in improving quality of life and reducing symptoms. Standardization of reporting and further research is needed to guide treatment decisions.\\n\\nMultiple studies have shown that surgical removal of deep endometriosis can significantly improve pain and quality of life in women. The largest prospective case series reported reductions in pelvic pain, improved quality of life, and decreased analgesia use post-surgery. It is recommended that women with deep endometriosis are referred to a center of expertise and informed about potential risks and benefits of surgery. Different surgical approaches, such as discoid excision and segmental resection, have shown positive outcomes in improving pain and quality of life. It is important to consider the type of study, surgical technique, and outcome measurement when interpreting the literature on deep endometriosis surgery. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be performed in a center of expertise to minimize complications and maximize outcomes.\\n\\nThe reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed improvements in pain scores and symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder endometriosis and ureteral lesions was associated with significant improvement of pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy showed a reduction in urinary retention. Hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain may reduce the need for re-operation. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic markers for pain symptom improvement. Further research is needed in this area.\\n\\nEndometriosis surgical outcomes and quality of life improvements are studied in various research articles. Studies have looked at different surgical techniques and their impact on symptoms and quality of life for patients with endometriosis. Some research has focused on specific procedures, such as laparoscopic excision or ablation, while others have examined the long-term effects of surgery on pain, fertility, and recurrence rates. Overall, surgical management of endometriosis has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life for many patients.\\n\\nSurgical treatment of endometriosis: correlation between histological pattern and clinical outcomes. Various studies on surgical management of endometriosis and its impact on pain relief and quality of life. Recommendations for surgical treatment of endometriosis.\\n\\nII.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  \\nThe effectiveness of medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy for endometriosis is discussed. The recommendation is to clearly distinguish between short-term and long-term hormone treatment after surgery. Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain if pregnancy is not desired. Further research is recommended to compare the risks and outcomes of laparoscopy and empirical treatment.\\n\\nII.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis  \\nThe effectiveness of surgical versus medical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain is discussed. There is no conclusive evidence to recommend one over the other, and a shared decision-making approach is recommended considering individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. Research is recommended for randomized clinical trials to directly compare laparoscopy and empirical treatment.\\n\\nII.6. Non-medical management strategies  \\nNon-medical management strategies, such as complementary and alternative medicine, self-management strategies, and self-help groups, are explored for women with endometriosis. The limited research supports the use of these strategies, and more studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Acupuncture is discussed as a complementary treatment, but there is insufficient high-quality evidence to recommend it for endometriosis patients. Additional research is recommended for non-medical management strategies for endometriosis-associated pain and quality of life.\\n\\nOne RCT showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life with verum acupuncture compared to 'sham' acupuncture in women with endometriosis. Japanese acupuncture was also found to be effective. Overall, acupuncture was safe and could be used as an adjunct therapy for pain relief in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nPhysiotherapy interventions for endometriosis lack significant literature, but pelvic floor exercises have shown effectiveness for urinary incontinence. Massage and trigger point release therapy have mixed results and may not be recommended for chronic pain.\\n\\nExercise, while beneficial for overall health, has not been well studied for endometriosis-related pain relief. While some studies show potential benefits, more research is needed to make firm recommendations.\\n\\nElectrotherapy studies have shown improvements in pain and quality of life, but caution is advised due to study design limitations and small sample sizes.\\n\\nPsychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and mindfulness-based programmes, have shown promise in reducing pain and improving quality of life in women with endometriosis. However, more research is needed to make conclusive recommendations.\\n\\nParticipants included up to 5 years after laparoscopic diagnosis, limiting the significance of found efficacy. No recommendations on psychological approaches for endometriosis pain and quality of life. Limited evidence on the impact of psychological interventions for endometriosis symptoms. Nutrition may affect symptoms, with limited studies on dietary interventions. Some studies suggest omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may help with pain. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy not well studied. Dietary changes may improve symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine studies are generally poorly constructed. No specific recommendations for nutrition or Chinese Medicine for endometriosis. Clinicians should discuss non-medical strategies for quality of life and psychological well-being in women with endometriosis. Further research is needed on non-medical interventions for endometriosis.\\n\\nWomen with endometriosis are confronted with endometriosis-associated pain, infertility, or both. The use of ovarian suppression therapy to improve fertility in women with endometriosis is ineffective and should not be prescribed. However, postsurgical medical therapy may increase pregnancy rates compared to surgery alone, but the evidence should be interpreted with caution. Other medical treatments such as anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors have uncertain effects on pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nIn infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase their chance of natural pregnancy. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis improves fertility, it may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age, history of previous surgery, and ovarian reserve. Research is needed to evaluate the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis in improving natural pregnancy rates. Before and after surgery for endometriosis, individuals who wish to become pregnant should be counseled objectively on their chances of achieving a pregnancy. The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) can be used to predict non-ART pregnancy rates after surgery.\\n\\nThe Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their reproductive options post-surgery. It has been shown to reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or other fertility management options. It is recommended to use IUI with ovarian stimulation in women with stage I/II endometriosis to increase pregnancy rates. The efficacy of ART in women with endometriosis is uncertain, with some studies showing lower outcomes compared to women without endometriosis. Studies are needed to clarify the relevance of IUI with or without ovarian stimulation in women with endometriosis and to investigate the value of EFI in predicting the success of IUI.\\n\\nbe recommended. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous combined oral contraceptive/progestogens as a pre-treatment to ART to increase live birth rates. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medical therapies in improving outcomes for women with endometriosis undergoing ART.\\n\\nSurgery prior to ART for endometriosis-associated infertility may improve reproductive outcomes, but the evidence is limited and more data is needed. Clinicians are not recommended to routinely perform surgery for endometriosis prior to ART to improve live birth rates, as the potential benefits are unclear. Surgery for endometrioma prior to ART is not recommended to improve live birth rates, as it may have a negative impact on ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis prior to ART should be guided mainly by pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain.\\n\\nSymptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis may consider surgical removal of lesions. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis is discussed in detail. Non-medical interventions for infertility in endometriosis have unclear benefits. Fertility preservation in women with endometriosis should be discussed, but the true benefit remains unknown. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcomes is not well understood.\\n\\nEndometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show a range of changes, including decidual reaction and atrophy. Management may involve monitoring and expectant management or surgery if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy may not always benefit women with endometriosis, so continued evaluation and treatment postpartum is recommended. \\n\\nEndometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, and if atypical findings are seen on ultrasound, referral to a specialized center is advised. Complications from pre-existing endometriosis lesions during pregnancy are rare but may require surgical intervention. \\n\\nWomen with endometriosis may have an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in the first trimester. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms and consider closer monitoring. \\n\\nStudies have shown conflicting results regarding the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes in the second and third trimesters. Associations have been reported with gestational diabetes, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and placenta previa. \\n\\nOverall, complications related to pre-existing endometriosis lesions during pregnancy are rare but may require surgical management. Further research is needed to assess the impact of surgery on pregnancy outcomes in women with endometriosis.\\n\\nWomen with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth, caesarean section, and small for gestational age babies. Endometriosis does not seem to increase the risk of obstetric hemorrhages or postpartum hemorrhage. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks in pregnancy, but current evidence does not warrant increased monitoring or discourage pregnancy. Research is needed to better understand obstetric risks in women with endometriosis. Surgical techniques, such as ovarian cystectomy, may be beneficial in preventing recurrence of symptoms associated with endometriosis.\\n\\nCystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma in women, with a strong recommendation in favor of cystectomy. Hormone treatment post-surgery can prevent recurrence of endometriosis-associated symptoms. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptives are recommended for at least 18-24 months post-surgery. ART in women with deep endometriosis does not increase recurrence. Consider long-term hormone treatment for prevention of deep endometriosis recurrence and associated symptoms. The choice of treatment should consider patient preferences, costs, availability, risks, and side effects. Further information is available in Annex 7 and Annex 8.\\n\\nIV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis: \\nMedical treatment options for recurrent endometriosis after surgery include dienogest, depot leuprolide acetate, desogestrel, OCP, cyproterone acetate, and nafarelin. These treatments have shown efficacy in reducing symptoms such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and endometrioma size. Surgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis is less studied, but one small study reported recurrence of symptoms in a percentage of women after surgery. It is important to consider all available hormone and surgical treatment options for managing recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. \\n\\nV. Endometriosis and adolescence: \\nDiagnosing endometriosis in adolescents can be challenging due to a lack of awareness among medical professionals and caregivers. Risk factors for adolescent endometriosis include a positive family history, genital malformations, early menarche, and short menstrual cycles. Clinicians should take a careful history to identify possible risk factors and consider endometriosis in young women presenting with symptoms such as cyclical absent.\\n\\nIn adolescents, a careful history should be taken to consider symptoms suggestive of endometriosis, such as chronic pelvic pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, and other associated symptoms. Diagnosis in adolescents may differ from adults, with a more varied clinical presentation. Imaging with transvaginal ultrasound can be effective, and diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered if other treatments are unsuccessful. Histological confirmation through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis, although negative histology does not rule out the disease entirely.\\n\\nIn adolescents with endometriosis, hormonal contraceptives or progestogens are recommended as first-line treatment for pain relief. NSAIDs can be considered as an additional option. GnRH agonists may be used as a second-line treatment if initial hormone therapy fails, but careful consideration of potential side effects is necessary. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be considered for symptom management, but recurrence rates should be taken into account. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended by experienced surgeons. Combination therapy with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery may also be effective in reducing recurrence.\\n\\nEndometriosis symptoms may persist after menopause, with a prevalence estimated at 2-5%. Hormone therapy may stimulate endometriosis growth, but it can also occur in women not using hormone therapy. Clinicians should be aware that endometriosis can still be active after menopause. Surgical treatment is recommended as first-line for postmenopausal women with endometriosis.\\n\\nIn postmenopausal women with endometriosis, surgical treatment has been shown to alleviate pain and improve symptoms. Consideration of malignancy is important, with some studies showing a risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors may be a medical alternative to surgery for treating endometriosis in postmenopausal women. More research is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors in this population. Hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis is not well studied, but may be effective in reducing symptoms. The risk of recurrence of endometriosis with hormone therapy is small but present, and continuous combined estrogen-progestogen therapy may be preferred to limit proliferation of endometriosis tissue. Tibolone could be a safe alternative for combined hormone therapy.\\n\\nAbdominal wall endometriosis is associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI. Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms with a cyclical pattern.\\n\\nCatamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. In a review of 490 cases, pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in 89% of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis when possible. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis. In cases of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.\\n\\nWomen with incidental finding of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment, as there is low risk of progression to symptomatic disease. Surgical treatment is not recommended due to associated risks, and medical treatment is not advised without evidence of disease progression. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about the incidental finding, but surgical excision or ablation is not recommended. Monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered, but the benefits are uncertain. Primary prevention of endometriosis can involve aiming for a healthy lifestyle and diet, with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity, but the usefulness of hormonal contraceptives for prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk should only be done in a research setting.\\n\\nEndometriosis shares features with cancer but is not significantly associated with increased overall cancer risk. Specific risks include higher risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer, but the absolute increase in risk is low. Clinicians should reassure patients about their cancer risk and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with OCP potentially reducing ovarian and endometrial cancer risk but increasing breast and cervical cancer risk. More research is needed on the impact of hormone treatments on cancer risk.\\n\\nAmong women with endometriosis, hormonal treatments have no appreciable impact on ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy could be performed but has shown no benefit in early detection or mortality reduction. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is not recommended for women with endometriosis without further risk factors for ovarian cancer. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis to guide monitoring needs.\\n\\nSome authors suggest earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete removal of endometriosis to reduce the future risk of ovarian cancer. A study in Sweden found that women who had undergone surgery for endometriosis had a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, especially those who had unilateral oophorectomy. Surgical treatment like tubal ligation or hysterectomy was not significantly associated with the risk of ovarian cancer. Clinicians should consider the potential benefits of complete excision of visible endometriosis to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, weighing them against the risks of surgery.\\n\\nPrevention of endometriosis  \\nEndometriosis and cancer  \\nDeclarations of interest  \\nConflicts of Interest  \\nAbbreviations  \\nKey Questions  \\nMethodology\\n\\nIn the justification section, more data are provided on the interpretation of the supporting evidence and how other factors were considered.

Introduction\\nCTG monitoring should never be regarded as a substitute for good clinical observation and judgement, or as an excuse for leaving the mother unattended during labor.\\n2. Indications\\nContinuous CTG monitoring should be considered in all situations where there is a high risk of fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG is also recommended when abnormalities are detected during intermittent fetal auscultation. The routine use of admission CTG for low-risk women on entrance to the labor ward has been associated with an increase in cesarean delivery rates and no improvement in perinatal outcomes.\\n3. Tracing acquisition\\nMaternal supine recumbent position should be avoided for prolonged monitoring. CTG acquisition can be performed by portable sensors that transmit signals wirelessly to a remote fetal monitor. External FHR monitoring is the recommended initial method for routine intrapartum monitoring. Simultaneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate can be useful in specific maternal health conditions.\\n4. Analysis of tracings\\nCTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions) followed by overall CTG classification.\\n\\nAcute fetal hypoxemia can result in tachycardia. Bradycardia is defined as a baseline value below 110 bpm lasting more than 10 minutes. Variability in fetal heart rate signal is important, with reduced variability indicating potential issues. Accelerations in fetal heart rate above the baseline are a sign of a neurologically responsive fetus. Decelerations below the baseline can indicate fetal hypoxia. Sinusoidal patterns may indicate severe fetal anemia. Clinical decisions should integrate CTG analysis with other clinical information. Action in cases of suspected fetal hypoxia may involve identifying and reversing underlying causes.\\n\\nManagement of fetal hypoxia/acidosis during labor requires careful assessment and intervention. Oxygen administration and intravenous fluids may not be effective in improving fetal oxygenation. Clinical judgment is needed to diagnose and address underlying causes of abnormal CTG patterns. Prompt action should be taken to avoid prolonged fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Limitations of cardiotocography include observer disagreement and the inability to accurately predict hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG monitoring may not significantly improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary interventions. Clinical guidelines should be simple and objective for proper use of technology. Regular training of labor ward staff is essential for safe monitoring.\\n\\net Gynaecol Res 2007;33(3):266 –73.\\nAbnormal uterine action during labour.

This guideline aims to reduce complications related to laparoscopic entry techniques. Bowel damage associated with laparoscopic surgery may not be immediately recognized, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques, and the primary trocar should be inserted in a controlled manner at 90 degrees to the skin. The Veress needle or open (Hasson) approach can be used for entry, with no significant safety advantage to either technique. Direct trocar insertion is an acceptable alternative method, and there are devices available to minimize risks during trocar insertion. Surgeons should be aware of the risks and complications associated with laparoscopy and counsel patients accordingly. Women should be informed of the risks and potential complications, including injury to the bowel, urinary tract, major blood vessels, and later complications associated with entry ports. Surgeons should ensure appropriate training, supervision, and experience in laparoscopic surgery. Intra-abdominal pressure should be maintained at 20-25 mmHg before inserting the trocar. Alternative entry techniques, such as direct trocar insertion or alternative devices, can also be considered.\\n\\nAlternative sites for primary trocar or Veress needle insertion include Palmer's point, especially in cases of previous surgery or splenomegaly. Adhesion formation at the umbilicus may make it an inappropriate site for insertion after abdominal surgery. Secondary ports should be inserted under direct vision perpendicular to the skin, ensuring pneumoperitoneum at 20-25 mmHg. In obese women, the open (Hasson) technique or entry at Palmer's point is recommended. For very thin women, the Hasson technique or insertion at Palmer's point is preferred. Special care is needed for entry in young, thin, nulliparous women with well-developed abdominal musculature. Documentation of appropriate counseling and reporting of adverse events or complications are essential auditable standards.\\n\\nGuidelines and Audit lead reviewers were: Dr DE Parkin FRCOG, Aberdeen, Scotland; Mr MC Slack FRCOG, Cambridge; and Mr P Hilton FRCOG, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.\\nThe final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines and Audit Committee of the RCOGRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 10 of 10Grades of recommendations\\nRequires at least one randomised controlled trial as part of a body of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation.

Purpose and scope\\nThe aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based information about the prevention of malaria in pregnancy for UK-based residents visiting malaria endemic areas. This guideline covers malaria prevention recommendations for women planning a pregnancy and those already pregnant or breastfeeding.\\n2. Background\\nMalaria can be life-threatening and is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. The species of malaria can determine the pattern of the disease. The majority of imported malaria cases in the UK are caused by P. falciparum. Pregnant women are at increased risk of malaria complications.\\n4. Medical complications of malaria in pregnancy\\nMalaria infection in pregnancy can result in maternal mortality, pregnancy loss, reduced birth weight, and other complications. Pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting and dying from malaria compared to non-pregnant individuals.\\n5. Prevention of malaria infection in pregnancy\\nPregnant women should consider postponing travel to malaria endemic areas if possible. If travel is unavoidable, they should seek guidance on malaria risks and prevention strategies. Awareness of risk, bite prevention, chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are important in preventing malaria. Pregnant women should be educated on malaria prevention measures and provided with written information. The risk of contracting malaria varies depending on the destination.\\n5.4. Chemoprophylaxis for pregnant or breastfeeding women\\nMefloquine is recommended for prophylaxis in the second and third trimesters in chloroquine-resistant areas. Pregnant women should be cautious about drug choices and seek advice from specialists if needed. Atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are also options for prophylaxis in certain areas. Waiting times before becoming pregnant after taking prophylactic drugs should be considered to avoid potential adverse effects.\\n\\nIn pregnancy, chloroquine and proguanil are safe but not effective in areas of chloroquine resistance. Mefloquine can be considered if necessary, and atovaquone and proguanil can be used in consultation with a specialist. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Emergency standby treatment instructions should be given to pregnant travelers for suspected malaria without access to medical care. Quinine and clindamycin are recommended treatments for pregnant women. Standby treatment should be started if malaria is suspected with a fever, and medical treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Quinine, Co-artem, or atovaquone-proguanil can be used as standby emergency treatment.\\n\\nGambian multigravidae.

These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment and must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs and resources. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using a standardised scheme. Once adapted for local use, these guidelines are no longer representative of the RCOG.\",\n    \"The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based information on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy is detrimental to the woman and her fetus, with risks of adverse effects outweighing those of treatment. Prompt treatment with appropriate antimalarials is crucial, with intravenous artesunate recommended for severe falciparum malaria. Pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria should be admitted to the hospital, while those with severe and complicated malaria should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Seek advice from infectious diseases specialists for severe and recurrent cases. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with death from severe malaria. Physicians should prescribe treatment, and hospitalization is advisable for pregnant women with P. falciparum.\\n\\nBlood films are monitored every 24 hours, with clinical deterioration indicating a repeat. Severe or complicated malaria requires IV artesunate or quinine. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated with oral quinine or Riamet®. For preventing relapse during or after pregnancy, chloroquine or primaquine is recommended. Recurrent malaria in pregnancy may require alternative treatments. Severe malaria in pregnancy is a medical emergency, requiring monitoring for hypoglycaemia and pulmonary oedema. Obstetric management includes monitoring for preterm labor and fetal growth restriction, with prompt antimalarial treatment to prevent adverse effects on the fetus. Vertical transmission risk should be discussed with women. Monitoring for fetal distress and appropriate treatment are essential in severe malaria cases.\\n\\nIn women with severe malaria, obstetric advice should be sought at an early stage. Fetal distress is common and has been related to malaria fever. Standard obstetric principles apply, and instrumental birth may be necessary in the presence of maternal or fetal distress. Acute malaria can cause thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Maternal malaria close to delivery can result in congenital malaria, which may present in the first weeks to months of life. Reporting of malaria in pregnancy in the UK is mandatory.\\n\\nRamshesh P , et al.

Am J Med\\n1982;73:564–72.\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy is crucial to prevent mortality\\n- Symptoms of malaria include flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise\\n- Urgent investigations include thick and thin blood films, malaria rapid antigen tests, and other tests\\n- Treatment for non-falciparum malaria is chloroquine, for falciparum malaria admit to hospital and use IV artesunate or quinine\\n- Regular monitoring and management of malaria in pregnancy is essential\\n- Severe malaria in pregnancy should be treated with IV artesunate if available, otherwise use IV quinine\\n- Quinine monotherapy is not recommended for uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy, use quinine with clindamycin\\n- Clindamycin is slow-acting and may not add value to IV artesunate\\n- Treatment should not be delayed, seek expert consultation for IV artesunate if needed\\n- IV artesunate is not currently licensed in the UK but can be obtained from specialist centers or Idis Pharma if needed.\\n\\nClindamycin should not be used in pregnancy. Patients may deteriorate under treatment, at which point, management should be upgraded to account for severity. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters, ahead of quinine and clindamycin. Atovaquone-proguanil alone and atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate were safe and efficacious for uncomplicated P. falciprum in the second and third trimesters. Artemether-lumefantrine treatment in pregnancy showed disappointing efficacy. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is not recommended in pregnancy. Weekly chloroquine can be given to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale before delivery. Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax should be treated similarly to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs are often reduced in late pregnancy, leading to under-dosing.\\n\\nThe persistence of Plasmodium falciparum in the placenta after apparently adequate therapy with quinine has been described. This phenomenon is described in the placenta of a 19-year-old woman with falciparum malaria, who was treated with a combination of quinidine and clindamycin. Although this therapy was effective and diminished her peripheral blood parasitemia, vast numbers of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were present in the maternal sinusoids of the placenta. This sequestration of infected erythrocytes produced a local parasitemia in the placenta. Additionally, rare Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes were also seen in the fetal blood of the placenta. Malaria in pregnancy and parasitic involvement of the placenta are reviewed, emphasizing that Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes may persist in the placenta even after clearance of parasites from the peripheral blood.\",\n    \"Antepartum Haemorrhage\\nAntepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. The most important causes of APH are placenta praevia and placental abruption. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Up to one-fifth of very preterm babies are born in association with APH, and the known association of APH with cerebral palsy can be explained by preterm delivery. Recurrent APH is the term used when there are episodes of APH on more than one occasion. It is important to assess for signs of clinical shock when estimating blood loss, as the amount of blood lost is often underestimated. Spotting, minor haemorrhage, major haemorrhage, and massive haemorrhage are defined based on the amount of blood loss. Antepartum haemorrhage is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pregnancies complicated by unexplained APH are also at increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Women with repeated presentations that may include APH should be asked about domestic violence. Women with APH should report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider and be managed in a hospital maternity unit with facilities for resuscitation and emergency operative delivery.\\n\\nClinical assessment in women presenting with APH is crucial to establish the need for urgent intervention to manage maternal or fetal compromise. Triage includes history-taking, assessment of vaginal bleeding, maternal cardiovascular condition, and fetal wellbeing. If major haemorrhage persists or the woman is unable to provide a history, immediate maternal stabilization is priority. A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of APH, such as placental abruption or placenta praevia. Abdominal palpation and speculum examination can aid in identifying the cause of bleeding. Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH. Fetal investigations, including fetal heart rate assessment and ultrasound scans, are important to monitor fetal wellbeing. Hospitalization is recommended for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding. Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth. Tocolytic therapy should not be used in cases of major APH or placental abruption. Antenatal care should be altered following APH, with increased fetal surveillance for high-risk pregnancies. Delivery should be determined based on maternal and fetal condition, with immediate delivery required for compromised cases.\\n\\nIn women with antepartum hemorrhage (APH) due to placenta praevia, management includes maternal resuscitation and delivery of the fetus to control bleeding. Delivery is usually by caesarean section in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. For women with APH before 37 weeks of gestation without compromise, elective premature delivery is not recommended. In cases after 37 weeks, induction of labor may be considered. Fetal monitoring during labor should be continuous for active bleeding or if there are concerns of placental insufficiency. Regional anesthesia is recommended for operative delivery in cases of APH, unless contraindicated. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated and active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH. Massive APH should be managed following multidisciplinary protocols, and blood products should be ordered as needed. Women with coagulopathy should receive appropriate transfusions. Neonates should be assessed by a senior pediatrician/neonatologist in cases of major APH. In cases of extremely preterm pregnancy with APH, maternal stabilization is the priority before considering delivery of the baby. Postnatal issues include thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, and clinical incident reporting. Obstetric skill drills should include management of major APH to improve patient safety.\\n\\nteamworking and ensure prompt and efficient management in such an emergency.\\nSuggested audit topics:\\n1.

Purpose and scope: This document provides clinical guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer.\\n\\n2. Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females, with a lifetime risk of one in nine in the UK. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer occurs in younger women and may have an inferior prognosis. Treatment should be in a multidisciplinary team.\\n\\n4. What is the optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: Prognosis for women diagnosed during pregnancy is not worsened compared to non-pregnant controls. Diagnosis may be difficult, and treatment should be based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage.\\n\\n5. Contraceptive choices for women wishing to avoid pregnancy after treatment of breast cancer: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods are recommended. Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer.\\n\\n6. What advice should be given to women planning pregnancy following breast cancer: Women planning pregnancy after treatment should consult their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon, and obstetrician. Long-term survival after breast cancer is not adversely affected by pregnancy.\\n\\nSeveral studies show better survival outcome in women who conceive after treatment for breast cancer. In the largest series, women who had a full-term pregnancy had a relative risk of death. The impact of pregnancy does not seem to be modified by tumor characteristics, but there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy. Advice on postponement of pregnancy should be individualized based on treatment needs and prognosis over time. Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception. Women with estrogen receptor-positive diseases should be advised on the recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment. The majority of pregnancies after breast cancer proceed to live birth. Women can be reassured concerning the risk of malformation in children conceived after treatment. Pregnancy following breast cancer should be jointly supervised by the obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon. Echocardiography should be performed during pregnancy in women at risk to detect cardiomyopathy. A slightly increased risk of delivery complications and caesarean section has been reported in breast cancer survivors. Women can breastfeed from the unaffected breast and there is no evidence that breastfeeding increases the risk of recurrence. The effect of breast cancer treatment on fertility should be discussed with all women of reproductive age diagnosed with breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea with complete loss of germ cells. The effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy on fertility should also be considered. Women are generally advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years after treatment, but age is a major determinant of fertility. Fertility preservation options should be discussed with women before treatment, including the use of GnRH analogues and cryopreservation. Every breast oncology service should have a designated pathway for prompt referral to a fertility specialist able to offer assisted conception.\\n\\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends universal access to sperm, egg, and embryo storage for individuals undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. However, NHS funding is not available in all areas, and the oncology referral pathway may not align with local IVF arrangements. Assisted reproduction after breast cancer treatment is limited due to loss of ovarian reserve, but options such as donated eggs and surrogacy can be considered. Women may need hormone replacement therapy for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause.\\n\\nReproductive concerns for young women with breast cancer are important to address. Fertility preservation options, such as GnRH agonist cotreatment and cryopreservation, can help protect ovarian function. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea and its impact on fertility should be considered in treatment planning. It is recommended to discuss fertility preservation options with patients before starting treatment.\",\n    \"The Initial Management of Chronic Pelvic Pain \\nThis guideline provides an evidence-based summary for appropriate investigation and management of women with chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain can significantly impact a woman's ability to function and may have multiple contributing factors. Pain is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and may be influenced by physical, psychological, and social factors. The initial assessment aims to identify factors contributing to the pain and develop a management plan. Adequate time should be allowed for the initial assessment, and a partnership between the clinician and the woman should be established to plan a management program. Referral to a specialist may be considered if the pain is not adequately controlled. The history should include questions about the pattern of pain, association with other symptoms, and the effect of movement and posture on the pain. Red flag symptoms should be noted for further investigation. Additionally, asking about past or present sexual assault may be helpful. Completing a daily pain diary may help identify provoking factors or associations.\\n\\nEstablishing the woman's level of function at the start of treatment is important for monitoring progress and setting functional goals. Symptom-based diagnostic criteria can confidently diagnose IBS. Referral to relevant healthcare professionals should be considered if a non-gynaecological component to the pain is suspected. Examination should include abdominal and pelvic examination. Screening for infection, particularly STIs, should be offered to sexually active women with chronic pelvic pain. TVS and MRI are useful for identifying structural abnormalities. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered as a second-line investigation. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatment for cyclical pain and antispasmodics for IBS. Other treatments such as analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications may also be beneficial. Self-management techniques and support from organizations can be valuable for patients. Chronic pelvic pain should be seen as a symptom with multiple contributing factors, and a comprehensive management plan should be developed in partnership with the woman.\\n\\nGastroenterol 2009;23:593–610.

The WHO classification should be used for classification. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens are effective in managing hyperplasia without atypia, with LNG-IUS being the first-line treatment. Treatment should last at least 6 months with follow-up biopsies. Surgical management may be considered in certain cases. Atypical hyperplasia should be managed with total hysterectomy. Women wishing to preserve fertility should be counseled about risks. HRT should be used cautiously. Women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer should be monitored for hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to a polyp should be managed with complete removal. Regular surveillance is recommended. Management in women wishing to conceive should focus on achieving disease regression before attempting conception.\\n\\nThe 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia. Diagnosis requires histological examination. Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy may be necessary for further assessment. CT or MRI are not routinely recommended. Biomarkers have not been found to be clinically useful. Management of hyperplasia without atypia includes addressing reversible risk factors and considering progestogen treatment if regression does not occur. Weight loss and hormone therapy should be reviewed. Anovulatory cycles may regress with ovulation. Progestogen treatment may reduce the risk of progression to cancer. More evidence is needed to determine the appropriate management approach.\\n\\nMany women with endometrial hyperplasia may require treatment due to the risk of progression to cancer. The first-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens. Treatment should last for a minimum of 6 months to induce regression. Endometrial surveillance should be done every 6 months, with at least two consecutive negative biopsies before discharge. Surgical management, such as hysterectomy, should be considered if there is no regression after 12 months of treatment or if there is relapse. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred. Endometrial ablation is not recommended. Annual endometrial biopsies can be considered for high-risk women. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be based on individual factors and patient preferences.\\n\\nEndometrial ablation is not recommended for atypical hyperplasia, as complete endometrial destruction cannot be guaranteed, and there is a risk of tissue regeneration. Total hysterectomy is advised for women with atypical hyperplasia to reduce the risk of underlying malignancy or cancer progression. In cases where fertility preservation is desired or surgery is not suitable, first-line treatment with LNG-IUS is recommended, with oral progestogens as an alternative. Women should be counselled about the risks of fertility-sparing therapy, including the potential for cancer progression. Follow-up for women not undergoing hysterectomy should include routine endometrial surveillance with biopsies every 3 months until negative results are obtained. Women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to conceive should achieve disease regression before attempting to conceive and may consider assisted reproduction for higher live birth rates and to prevent relapse. It is important to monitor disease regression and consider referral to a fertility specialist for further assessment and treatment options.\\n\\n- A small trial showed that LNG-IUS treatment was more effective than observation alone in regressing simple hyperplasia and improving pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.\\n- Hysterectomy is recommended for women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia once fertility is no longer required.\\n- Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in women with a uterus.\\n- Women with endometrial hyperplasia on HRT should consider switching to continuous progestogen intake using LNG-IUS or continuous combined HRT.\\n- Tamoxifen users should be aware of the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\\n- Aromatase inhibitors do not increase the risk of endometrial pathology or vaginal bleeding.\\n- LNG-IUS may reduce the incidence of endometrial polyps and hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen.\\n- Women with endometrial hyperplasia while on tamoxifen should reassess the need for tamoxifen with their oncologist.\\n- Complete removal of endometrial polyps is recommended for management.\\n- Recommendations for future research include evaluating the role of biomarkers in diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia and studying the effect of weight loss on regression of the condition.\\n- Auditable topics include advising weight loss for obese women with endometrial hyperplasia and ensuring appropriate follow-up biopsies.\\n- Useful links and support groups for endometrial hyperplasia.\\n\\nAccuracy of outpatient endometrial biopsy in the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia.

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG.\",\n    \"Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth\\nRecommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS to facilitate counselling and decision-making. Planned VBAC is suitable for most women with a singleton pregnancy and previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with complicated uterine scars should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Labour for women with two or more prior caesareans should be in a center with expertise and immediate surgical delivery. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery increasing the likelihood of success. VBAC should be conducted in a well-equipped delivery suite with continuous monitoring. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be performed after 39+0 weeks of gestation, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis administered. VBAC may not be suitable in certain circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, or antepartum stillbirth. Overall, planned VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery.\\n\\nWomen with two or more prior caesarean deliveries may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Labour should be conducted in a centre with suitable expertise and recourse to immediate surgical delivery. A multivariate analysis showed no significant difference in uterine rupture rates between VBAC with two or more previous caesarean births compared to a single prior caesarean birth. Women considering VBAC should be counselled about success rates, uterine rupture rates, and maternal morbidity. Antenatal counselling should consider factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture, such as short inter-delivery interval, maternal age, obesity, and myometrial thickness. VBAC success rates with two previous caesarean births are similar to those with a single prior caesarean birth. Women seeking multiple future pregnancies should be counselled about the risks associated with repeated caesarean deliveries and the benefits of attempting VBAC. Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of planned VBAC versus ERCS from 39+0 weeks of gestation, including the risks of uterine rupture, perinatal death, and maternal and fetal outcomes. VBAC has a lower risk of adverse outcomes compared to ERCS, but both options have associated risks. Women should be provided with a patient information leaflet and the decision for mode of birth should be agreed upon before the expected delivery date.\\n\\nThe NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase for serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared with ERCS. A review of outcomes suggests a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Factors such as maternal height, age, BMI, gestation, and birthweight also influence VBAC success. Induction and augmentation of labour in VBAC are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be administered, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Practice guidelines for ERCS are provided in the NICE caesarean section guideline.\\n\\nWomen considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables around a 5% reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, but may be associated with a 5 per 10,000 increase in the risk of antepartum stillbirth. Consideration should be given to administering maternal corticosteroids if ERCS is performed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics achieve a greater reduction in the risk of maternal infection than prophylactic antibiotics administered after making the skin incision. The choice of method of thromboprophylaxis should be as per RCOG guidance. Women in special circumstances, such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more, should be approached cautiously when considering VBAC. The NICE induction of labor guideline recommends induction of labor from 41+0 weeks to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates for preterm and term pregnancies are similar, but the rates of uterine rupture and dehiscence are significantly lower in preterm compared with term VBAC. Future research should focus on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC or uterine rupture using ultrasound, investigating the etiology and prevention of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery, and factors impacting the uptake of VBAC.\\n\\nThis clinical guideline provides information on various factors affecting pregnancy outcomes, including uterine rupture, mode of delivery after previous cesarean section, and risks associated with different delivery methods. It also discusses the use of decision aids for pregnant women and the impact of previous cesarean deliveries on subsequent pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of patient preferences and personalized decision-making in childbirth.\\n\\nIncidence of neonatal respiratory distress after elective caesarean section: pragmatic randomised trial.

Active management of the third stage of labor reduces postpartum blood loss. Women at high risk of hemorrhage should deliver in units with immediate access to care. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained whenever possible. Group and screen samples should be taken regularly for pregnant women. Cell salvage is recommended for patients with significant blood loss. Mechanical strategies can be used to reduce postpartum blood loss. Red cell transfusion should be based on clinical and hematological grounds. FFP should be given during major obstetric hemorrhage. Close monitoring of clotting tests is necessary for subsequent FFP transfusion.\\n\\n- Regular full blood counts and coagulation screens should be performed during a bleeding episode.\\n- Cryoprecipitate should be administered early in major obstetric hemorrhage and subsequent transfusion guided by fibrinogen levels.\\n- FFP and cryoprecipitate should ideally be of the same blood group as the recipient.\\n- No anti-D prophylaxis is required if a RhD-negative woman receives RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate.\\n- Platelet count should be maintained above 50 x 10^9/l in acutely bleeding patients.\\n- Platelets should ideally be group compatible.\\n- Tranexamic acid may be considered during major obstetric hemorrhage.\\n- Blood transfusions should be based on careful clinical assessment in conjunction with Hb levels.\\n- Iron deficiency should be recognized and treated promptly to reduce the need for blood transfusions.\\n- Women declining blood products should have their Hb optimized before delivery and a multidisciplinary plan in place.\\n\\nPBM involves an approach to avoid unnecessary transfusion by optimizing preoperative/predelivery Hb, avoiding overtransfusion, using cell salvage where appropriate, accepting evidence-based lower transfusion triggers, and using iron supplements. Evidence supports the use of autologous blood from IOCS to decrease the requirement for allogeneic transfusion. Current evidence supports the use of IOCS in obstetrics. Recommendations for future research include defining coagulation abnormalities during major obstetric hemorrhage and investigating the role of point of care testing in the diagnosis and management of obstetric hemorrhage. Auditable topics include standards for audit of documentation and practice related to obstetric hemorrhage.\\n\\nRecommendations for the management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma, pre-anaesthetic assessment of coagulation abnormalities in obstetric patients, and the decrease of fibrinogen as an early predictor of postpartum hemorrhage are clinically significant. The use of recombinant activated factor VII in obstetric hemorrhage, the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss after cesarean section, and the use of intravenous iron sucrose versus oral iron ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy are also important considerations. Good practice points and recommended best practices are included in the guidelines for the surgical management of Jehovah's Witnesses and the management of anesthesia for Jehovah's Witnesses.\",\n    \"Chickenpox in Pregnancy\\nThis guideline addresses varicella prevention and management in pregnant women. It recommends considering varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy. Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles. If exposed, a blood test for VZV immunity should be done. Treatment with VZIG is recommended if non-immune and exposed. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their doctor immediately and may be prescribed aciclovir. Hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Risks to the fetus and newborn are also discussed, with recommendations for care and follow-up. Delivery should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. Varicella vaccination is considered cost-effective for susceptible women. Routine screening for VZV immunity is not recommended in the UK. Contact with chickenpox or shingles should be carefully assessed, and VZIG may be offered if non-immune and exposed. Awareness of VZV infection risks and prevention strategies is crucial in managing chickenpox in pregnancy.\\n\\nPregnant women with shingles or chickenpox should notify their doctor early if a rash develops. Isolation is recommended for pregnant women with chickenpox. VZIG may be needed for further exposure to chickenpox. Chickenpox is infectious before and during the rash, ceasing when lesions crust over. Susceptibility to varicella infection should be determined through history or serology. VZIG should be offered to non-immune pregnant women with significant exposure to chickenpox. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their GP and avoid contact with others until lesions crust over. Aciclovir may be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox. Hospital assessment is recommended for severe chickenpox cases. Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. The risks of varicella infection to the fetus include FVS, which can be diagnosed prenatally through ultrasound. Amniocentesis may be considered for detecting varicella DNA in the fetus.\\n\\nAmniotic fluid PCR for VZV DNA has high sensitivity but low specificity for FVS. Ultrasound abnormalities may not always detect FVS. Neonatal risks of varicella infection in pregnancy can be prevented by delaying delivery after maternal rash onset. Varicella infection in newborns can result from maternal infection near delivery. Prophylaxis with VZIG is vital for newborns exposed to chickenpox around delivery. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox. Future research recommendations include randomized trials for screening and treatment. Auditable topics include referrals to specialists for pregnant women with chickenpox and informing neonatologists of affected births.

Clinicians should be aware of the short- and long-term complications of FGM. Reported complications include haemorrhage, urinary retention, genital swelling, infection, fever, scarring, urinary tract symptoms, dyspareunia, bacterial vaginosis, genital scarring, urinary tract complications, damage to the urethra, dyspareunia, sexual consequences, psychological effects, menstrual difficulties, genital infection, infertility, HIV and hepatitis B infection, and obstetric complications. Health professionals must understand the legal responsibilities regarding FGM in the UK, including mandatory reporting of FGM in girls under 18 years. FGM is illegal in the UK and health professionals must be familiar with the requirements of the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset. Reporting and recording guidelines are provided for health professionals.\\n\\nWomen with FGM should be assessed during pregnancy and appropriate care provided, including referral to designated consultants and midwives. Healthcare professionals should be trained in FGM management and ensure safe and sensitive care. De-infibulation may be necessary for women with FGM, and should be offered before pregnancy if possible. Postnatal care should include follow-up for women who did not undergo de-infibulation during delivery.\\n\\nWomen with FGM should be offered de-infibulation before pregnancy. Discharging midwives should ensure legal processes are followed before discharge. A postnatal debrief may be considered for education on FGM. Future research should focus on stillbirth rates and the role of de-infibulation. Auditable topics include healthcare worker training and referrals for FGM patients. Useful links and support groups are available for further information.\\n\\nAdditional management in pregnant women:\\n- Refer to designated consultant obstetrician or specialist midwife with responsibility for women with FGM.\\n- Local protocols will determine which elements of care should be undertaken by the designated midwife or obstetrician.\\n- Make an individual risk assessment using an FGM safeguarding risk assessment tool.\\n- Offer screening for hepatitis C in addition to routine screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis.\\n- Manage as high obstetric risk.\\n- Document maternal history of FGM in the personal child health record.\\n- Notify designated child protection midwife if delivery of a baby girl.\\n- Offer postnatal follow-up if de-infibulation performed intrapartum or if planned de-infibulation did not occur because of delivery by caesarean section.\",\n    \"Epilepsy in Pregnancy \\nDiagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform seizures should be made by a neurologist. Different types of epilepsy should be assessed for specific risks to the mother and baby. Other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnant women. \\nWomen with epilepsy planning pregnancy should have a clinician manage their AEDs based on fetal risk and seizure control. Folic acid intake and minimizing AED exposure can reduce congenital malformations. \\nMost women with epilepsy will not have seizure deterioration in pregnancy. Risks and safety precautions should be communicated to women with epilepsy. \\nRegular antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team is recommended. Screening for fetal abnormalities and monitoring AED levels in pregnancy should be individualized. \\nSeizures in labour should be managed promptly to avoid complications. Pain relief options for women with epilepsy in labour should be prioritized. \\nPostnatal care should include continued AED use and monitoring for seizure triggers. Neonates exposed to AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects. \\nEffective contraception is important for women with epilepsy to stabilize their condition and optimize outcomes. \\nHealthcare providers should be aware of disability legislation protecting individuals with epilepsy from discrimination.\\n\\nEpilepsy review services and engagement with WWE during the preconception period and in pregnancy have been a focus of maternal and child health in the UK. Any service caring for WWE needs to provide evidence-based information on risks and benefits to empower parents to make informed choices. Diagnosis of epilepsy should be made by a neurologist, considering seizure history, impact on the mother, and drug history. Classification of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome is important to choose appropriate treatment and prevent seizure deterioration. Differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnancy should consider eclampsia, cardiac, metabolic, and intracranial conditions. Prepregnancy counselling for WWE should discuss the risk of congenital malformations based on AED exposure and emphasize the importance of folic acid supplementation. Exposure to AEDs, especially sodium valproate, may impact long-term neurodevelopment in infants. Minimizing exposure to AEDs and maximizing folic acid intake can help reduce the risk of congenital abnormalities in WWE.\\n\\nAED polytherapy should have a detailed discussion with the epilepsy specialist on the risks and benefits of continuing or changing the AED prior to planning pregnancy. Where possible, the aim will be to avoid sodium valproate and AED polytherapy. However, if the risk of maternal seizure deterioration from changing the AED is deemed to be high, women will need to be advised to continue the sodium valproate or AED polytherapy. Pregnant women should be informed that two-thirds will not have seizure deterioration in pregnancy. The majority of women do not experience a seizure in pregnancy. Women who were seizure-free for at least 9 months to 1 year prior to pregnancy continued to be seizure-free in pregnancy. Pregnant women with idiopathic generalised epilepsies were more likely to remain seizure-free than those with focal epilepsies. Healthcare professionals should provide verbal and written information on prenatal screening, risks of self-discontinuation of AEDs, effects of seizures and AEDs on the fetus, and breastfeeding. Women should be fully aware of the implications of future pregnancy on their epilepsy and the health of their offspring in the short and long term. WWE tend to overestimate the risks of teratogenicity associated with intake of AEDs in pregnancy. Healthcare professionals should acknowledge the concerns of WWE and be aware of the effect of such concerns on their adherence to AEDs. Pregnant WWE taking levetiracetam or carbamazepine showed that some mothers self-discontinued their AED in pregnancy. Women have concerns regarding the effect of epilepsy and its treatment on motherhood. WWE feel that there is a lack of understanding among healthcare professionals about epilepsy and the specific issues related to pregnancy. Pregnant WWE should have access to regular planned antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team. WWE taking AEDs who become unexpectedly pregnant should be able to discuss therapy with an epilepsy specialist on an urgent basis. All pregnant WWE should be provided with information about the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register and invited to register. Pregnant WWE should be regularly assessed for risk factors for seizures, adherence to AEDs, and seizure type and frequency. Serial growth scans are required for detection of small-for-gestational-age babies in WWE exposed to AEDs. All babies born to WWE taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should be offered 1 mg of intramuscular vitamin K to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.\\n\\nGiving vitamin K to WWE to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Enzyme-inducing AEDs can increase the risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Parenteral vitamin K supplementation should be offered routinely to babies born to mothers on enzyme-inducing AEDs. WWE with well-controlled seizures do not require early delivery, but elective caesarean section may be considered in cases of significant deterioration of seizures. Non-epileptic attack disorder should be managed with specialist psychiatric or psychological services. Antenatal administration of oral vitamin K for postpartum hemorrhage prevention has not been evaluated. Adequate analgesia and care in labor can minimize the risk of seizures in WWE. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for managing seizures in labor. Pain relief options in labor for WWE should be prioritized, with caution advised for pethidine use. Induction of labor does not have contraindications in WWE taking AEDs. WWE at risk of peripartum seizures should deliver in a consultant-led unit with facilities for resuscitation. WWE should continue their AEDs postnatally to minimize seizure triggers. AED dose adjustments may be needed post-delivery to avoid toxicity. Neonates born to WWE taking AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects, and breastfeeding is encouraged.\\n\\nIncreasing concentrations of AED in the neonate by 25% during the follow-up period to be clinically important. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate transfer to the child from breast milk to a larger extent compared with sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and phenytoin. Breastfeeding has not been shown to affect cognitive outcomes at 3 years of age in children exposed to certain AEDs. Other options such as alternating breast and bottle milk could be considered. Postpartum safety advice and strategies should be discussed with mothers with epilepsy. Generalised seizures can result in accidental injuries to the mother and baby. Depression should be screened for in the postpartum period. Effective contraception should be offered to women taking AEDs to avoid unplanned pregnancies. Women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should be informed that a copper IUD is the preferred choice for emergency contraception. Contraceptive efficacy may be improved by adjusting the oestrogen component and pill-free interval. Barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives for women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs. The risks of contraceptive failure and adverse effects of each method should be explained to women. Healthcare providers should be aware of equality legislation protecting individuals with disabilities. Future research should focus on optimal monitoring strategies for pregnant women with epilepsy and the effects of AED exposure on offspring. Audit topics should include multidisciplinary input into care and documentation of risks associated with epilepsy and AEDs. Useful links and support groups are provided for further information.\\n\\nThis guideline provides information on the management of epilepsy during pregnancy, including the risks associated with antiepileptic drugs and the importance of monitoring seizures.

Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do not need investigations if they have endometrial thickness <11 mm on ultrasound.\\n2. Further endometrial investigations should be decided on an individual basis, based on specific ultrasound findings and the patient’s personal risk for endometrial cancer.\\n\\nKEY MESSAGES\\n1. Routine pelvic ultrasound is not recommended to screen for endometrial cancer.\\n2. Most patients with endometrial cancer present with postmenopausal bleeding.\\n3. Endometrial thickness <11 mm is associated with a low risk of malignancy.\\n4. Patients with endometrial thickening and risk factors may need further assessments.\\n5. Hormone therapies in a continuous combined formulation do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\\n6. Patients on tamoxifen do not need routine ultrasound if asymptomatic.\\n7. Endometrial biopsy in patients with global thickening on ultrasound is accurate.\\n8. Invasive endometrial procedures have a low but significant complication risk.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\n1. Endometrial tissue sampling should not be extrapolated to asymptomatic women.\\n2. Women with endometrial thickness >11 mm and other positive ultrasound findings should have endometrial sampling or be referred for further investigations.\\n3. Further investigations should be based on individual risk factors in asymptomatic women with increased endometrial thickening.\\n4. Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors and endometrial thickening <11 mm do not need invasive investigations.\\n5. Transvaginal ultrasound is not recommended for screening for endometrial cancer.\\n6. Further investigations for women with endometrial thickening >11 mm should include hysterosonogram, diagnostic hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, or monitoring.\\n7. Women on continuous combined hormone therapy without bleeding do not need screening ultrasounds.\\n8. Women on tamoxifen do not need routine ultrasound.\\n9. Women with cervical stenosis and no bleeding should be managed based on individual factors.\\n\\nClinical characteristics such as menopausal status, polycystic ovary syndrome, a long menstrual history, and infertility may increase the risk of hyperplasia. Lynch syndrome is an inherited risk factor for hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Exposure to estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy post-menopause has been shown to increase the risk of hyperplasia in some studies. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, typically diagnosed in postmenopausal women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. Endometrial thickness >11 mm or increased vascularity on ultrasound may warrant additional investigation with endometrial biopsy. Endometrial biopsy is recommended for assessment of endometrial tissue, with blind outpatient endometrial biopsy being a cost-effective and minimally invasive option. Systemic menopausal hormone treatments can affect endometrial thickness, with unopposed systemic estrogen increasing thickness. Newer estrogen-progestin therapies have not shown significant increases in endometrial thickness or hyperplasia.\\n\\nLevonorgestrel intrauterine system combined with estrogen therapy has been shown to be effective in managing menopausal symptoms. Tibolone and tissue selective estrogen complex tablet are also options for hormone therapy. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the risk of endometrial cancer with these therapies. Transdermal testosterone as an adjunct to estradiol does not increase endometrial thickness. Limited studies on herbal or complementary menopausal products show no increase in endometrial thickness. Local hormone therapies containing estradiol, conjugated equine estrogen, or testosterone are also effective in managing genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Tamoxifen therapy is associated with thicker endometrium in postmenopausal patients. Aromatase inhibitors have been shown to reduce endometrial thickness. Cervical stenosis can complicate endometrial biopsy, and medical management options include prostaglandin E1 and osmotic dilators. Operative techniques may be necessary in cases of cervical stenosis. Routine screening for asymptomatic women on tamoxifen is not recommended. Endometrial biopsy should be considered in women with suspected pathology or at high risk for cancer.\\n\\nWatchful monitoring with repeat ultrasound over 4 months may be an option if the patient is counselled with respect to her individual endometrial cancer risk. Newer literature continues to support the extremely low risk of malignancy in women with asymptomatic global endometrial thickening <10-11 mm.\\n\\nHormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia: a Cochrane review summary. Various studies have investigated the effects of different hormone therapies on endometrial safety and bleeding profiles in postmenopausal women. Results have shown varying effects on endometrial thickness and safety, with some therapies showing no significant impact. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of hormone therapy on endometrial health in postmenopausal women.\\n\\nPreoperative ripening of the cervix before operative hysteroscopy is recommended. Misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy in premenopausal and post-menopausal women is also recommended. Self-administered vaginal misoprostol is compared to placebo for cervical ripening before operative hysteroscopy. Resectoscopic cervical trauma can be minimized by inserting Laminaria digitata preoperatively. Complications of hysteroscopy should be considered in a prospective, multicenter study. Experience of hysteroscopy indications and complications should be monitored. A multicenter survey of complications associated with operative hysteroscopies is recommended. Ultrasonography can be used in difficult postmenopausal dilation and curettage. Dilute vasopressin solution can affect the force needed for cervical dilatation. Hysteroscopic management of a stenotic cervix can be achieved. A hysteroscopic morcellator may help overcome cervical stenosis. Ultrasonography-guided transvaginal endometrial biopsy is useful in patients with cervical stenosis.\",\n    \"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a common condition in late pregnancy, characterized by itching and elevated bile acids. Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth based on bile acid levels. Fetal monitoring has not shown to improve outcomes. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common. Clinicians should consider ICP in pregnant individuals with itching, perform bile acid testing, and offer ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment. Monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended during labor. Resolution of symptoms should be confirmed postpartum. Patients and family members are at higher risk for ICP in future pregnancies.\\n\\nThis clinical practice guideline aims to evaluate and summarize the available literature on ICP and provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical care. ICP is a common gestational disease that targets the liver, with varying incidence rates globally. Bile acids play a key role in the pathophysiology of ICP, and genetic susceptibility may contribute to its development. Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities. The most common symptom of ICP is pruritis, with elevated serum bile acids being a common laboratory finding. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated total serum bile acids, and monitoring levels is important for fetal outcomes. Maternal and fetal sequelae of ICP include an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Further testing for alternative diagnoses is recommended in certain cases.\\n\\nUrocholate impacted the rate and rhythm of cardiomyocyte contraction and abnormal calcium dynamics. Evaluation of pregnancies with ICP have supported the presence of alterations to fetal cardiac parameters. The goal of treating ICP is to ameliorate maternal symptomatology of pruritus and improve fetal outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most frequently used medication for ICP. Treatment with UDCA may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Refractory cases of ICP may benefit from a referral to a specialist. Follow-up laboratory testing and monitoring should be performed to gauge the magnitude of fetal risk. Fetal monitoring with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasound may be considered. Delivery timing should be based on the highest recorded non-fasting bile acid level. Postpartum outcomes, contraception considerations, and recurrence risk should be discussed. The recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies is around 70%. Individuals with ICP are at an increased risk of acquiring metabolic disease during adulthood. The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception for those with ICP. Overall, ICP is a multifactorial and common hepatic disease unique to pregnancy.\\n\\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a condition that can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal complications. It is associated with elevated serum bile acid concentrations and may increase the risk of preeclampsia. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to be effective in managing the condition. Induction of labor may be necessary in some cases to reduce the risk of complications. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and optimal management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.\\n\\nIntrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy\\nDifferential diagnoses for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy include AFLP, allergic or drug reaction, autoimmune hepatitis, biliary obstruction, drug-induced liver injury, HELLP syndrome, and more. Recommendations for iatrogenic birth are based on non-fasting bile acid levels. Contraceptive eligibility for women with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is outlined.\",\n    \"Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy\\nObjective and scope\\nThis guideline provides recommendations for the management of genital herpes simplex virus infection in pregnant women. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. The target population includes pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. Healthcare professionals in maternity units and level 3 care services are the intended audience.\\nStakeholder involvement\\nClinicians from BASHH and RCOG, along with patient input from the Herpes Viruses Association, were involved in developing this guideline. External peer review was conducted by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\\nSearch strategy\\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using various databases and guidelines to inform the recommendations in this guideline.\\nBackground\\nNeonatal herpes is a rare but serious viral infection with varying presentations and outcomes. It is primarily caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The incidence of neonatal herpes is low in the UK compared to other countries. Transmission risk factors include maternal infection type, duration of rupture of membranes, and mode of delivery.\\nManagement of pregnant women with first episode genital herpes\\nTreatment with aciclovir is recommended for pregnant women with first episode genital herpes, with no evidence of increased risk of birth defects. Symptomatic relief options like paracetamol and lidocaine gel can be considered. Vaginal delivery is generally safe, and suppressive aciclovir therapy from 36 weeks gestation can reduce HSV lesions and viral shedding. Caesarean section is advised for women with third trimester acquisition to prevent neonatal transmission.\\nThird trimester acquisition\\nFor women acquiring genital herpes in the third trimester, daily suppressive aciclovir until delivery is recommended. Caesarean section is the preferred delivery mode to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can help differentiate between primary and recurrent infections, influencing management decisions.\\n\\nIt is recommended that an initial plan of delivery should be based on the assumption that all first episode lesions are primary genital herpes. Women with recurrent genital herpes should be informed that the risk of neonatal herpes is low, even if lesions are present at the time of delivery. Vaginal delivery should be anticipated in the absence of other obstetric indications for caesarean section. Daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered from 36 weeks of gestation. Management of pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes should be based on clinical assessment. Caesarean section should be recommended to all women presenting with primary episode genital herpes lesions at the time of delivery. In cases of recurrent genital herpes lesions at the onset of labor, vaginal delivery should be offered. In cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, management should be guided by a multidisciplinary team discussion. For HIV-positive women with HSV infection, daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered. Management of the neonate born to mothers with HSV infection should involve informing the neonatal team and considering appropriate testing and treatment. Efforts to prevent postnatal transmission of HSV are important.\\n\\nManagement of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy\\nTreat episodes with standard doses of aciclovir if necessary. Treat primary episode with standard doses of aciclovir. Consider aciclovir 400 mg tds from 36/40 gestation. Offer vaginal delivery. Perform lumbar puncture for HSV PCR if necessary. Recommend planned CS especially if within 6 weeks of delivery. Start aciclovir 20 mg/kg tds for 10 days while awaiting results.\",\n    \"Management of Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women\\nThis guideline provides information for clinicians on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and referral for improved outcomes. Conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign ovarian masses, with referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings are key factors in assessing the risk of malignancy. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules can aid in estimating the risk of malignancy without relying solely on CA-125 levels. Women with specific ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy should be referred to a gynaecological oncology service. Other guidelines from the USA and Canada also provide recommendations for managing premenopausal women with pelvic masses. Asymptomatic women with small simple ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly.\\n\\nWomen with simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter should have yearly ultrasound follow-up, and those with larger simple cysts should be considered for further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or increasing ovarian cysts may warrant surgical management, especially in cases of mature cystic teratomas. Combined oral contraceptives do not help in the treatment of functional ovarian cysts. The laparoscopic approach is preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses, with lower morbidity and quicker recovery time. Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is less effective and has a high rate of recurrence. Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent potential malignancy. The possibility of removing an ovary should be discussed preoperatively. Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy after laparoscopic surgery and complications following surgery for ovarian cysts.\\n\\nThree-dimensional quantification of tumor vascularity as a tertiary test after B-mode and power Doppler evaluation for detection of ovarian cancer.

It emphasizes the importance of experienced laparoscopists performing these procedures to ensure maternal and fetal safety. Studies have shown that laparoscopy is safe for both mother and fetus, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. The incidence of non-obstetric abdominal surgical emergencies in pregnancy is low, and hormonal changes may affect the risk of certain conditions like gallbladder disease. Overall, laparoscopy is considered a viable surgical option in pregnancy when performed by skilled professionals.\\n\\nLaparoscopic appendectomy in pregnancy has been associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous miscarriage compared to open appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is more common in the first trimester, which may contribute to the increased risk of miscarriage. However, laparoscopic surgery offers benefits such as faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower rates of wound infection for pregnant women. When considering the type of surgery, factors such as expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference should be taken into account. Maternal risks of laparoscopy include potential vascular and organ trauma, while anaesthetic risks should be carefully managed with early involvement of an obstetric anaesthetist and consideration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is typically recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy to ensure optimal safety for both the mother and fetus.\\n\\nPregnant women requiring laparoscopy for non-obstetric conditions should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Surgery should be postponed if non-urgent, but if necessary, can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally good for laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Surgeons with experience in laparoscopy have better outcomes. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed by skilled surgeons to reduce complications. Urgent surgery should not be delayed in pregnancy. Both laparoscopic and open surgery are acceptable options. Intraoperative monitoring may be needed in selected cases. Antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium may be used if preterm delivery is a risk. Routine tocolysis is not recommended. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed in facilities with appropriate expertise and monitoring. Fetal monitoring may be done before and after surgery. Caution is needed in steroid administration for maternal sepsis. Routine intraoperative fetal monitoring is not always necessary. Ports should be placed based on uterine size and location of pathology. The Hasson technique may reduce the risk of uterine trauma. Secondary port placement should consider uterine size and pathology. Pneumoperitoneum pressures below 12 mmHg are safe for the fetus.\\n\\nInsufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended for gas insufflation in laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy. Operating pressures of 12 mmHg are supported by current evidence. Both 5 and 10 mm diameter laparoscopes can be used, depending on surgical requirements. The choice of laparoscope degree depends on surgeon preference. Ultrasound, bipolar, and monopolar energy sources are safe to use during laparoscopy in pregnancy. The choice of extraction method for surgical specimens should be based on surgeon preference. Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process. Timely surgical intervention is preferable in suspected appendicitis in pregnancy to avoid adverse outcomes. Delay in surgery for appendicitis can lead to increased complications.\\n\\nShould the laparoscopic approach to appendicectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? There is controversy regarding the association of laparoscopic appendicectomy and miscarriage, and further research is needed to distinguish between association and causality. In the case of cholecystectomy, laparoscopic approach is associated with better outcomes than open approach, with fewer complications and shorter hospital stay. When surgery is indicated for ovarian cysts, laparoscopic cystectomy is associated with better maternal outcomes than laparotomy. The choice of approach should be based on local circumstances and expertise.\\n\\nAdnexal masses in pregnancy can be safely managed laparoscopically, especially for appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and symptomatic adnexal cysts. Adequately trained laparoscopists should perform these procedures with proper peri-operative preparations. More high-grade evidence is needed, and national large databases may be beneficial due to the difficulty in conducting randomized controlled trials for these conditions.\\n\\nAdnexal torsion: cystectomy and ovarian fixation are equally important in preventing recurrence.

It emphasizes the importance of involving partners in care decisions and providing comprehensive care for pregnant women. The guideline also includes recommendations for starting antenatal care, antenatal appointments, and involving partners in the care process.\\n\\nConsider reviewing the woman's previous medical records if needed, including records held by other healthcare providers. Be aware that women and babies from some minority ethnic backgrounds and those who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of death and may need closer monitoring and additional support. Assess the woman's risk of and, if appropriate, discuss female genital mutilation (FGM) in a kind, sensitive manner. Refer the woman for a clinical assessment by a doctor to detect cardiac conditions if there is a concern based on the pregnant woman's personal or family history. Refer the woman to an obstetrician or other relevant doctor if there are any medical concerns or if review of current long-term medicines is needed. Ask the woman about domestic abuse in a kind, sensitive manner at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for venous thromboembolism at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for gestational diabetes at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for pre-eclampsia at the first antenatal appointment and again in the second trimester. Measure and record the woman's blood pressure at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a urine dipstick test for proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a risk assessment for fetal growth restriction at the first antenatal appointment, and again in the second trimester. Offer symphysis fundal height measurement at each antenatal appointment after 24+0 weeks. If there are concerns about the symphysis fundal height, consider an ultrasound scan for fetal growth and wellbeing.\\n\\n1.2.34 Discuss the topic of babies' movements with the woman after 24 weeks, ask about concerns and advise to contact maternity services if needed.\\n1.2.35 Structured fetal movement awareness packages have not been shown to reduce stillbirth rates.\\n1.2.36 Offer abdominal palpation after 36 weeks to identify possible breech presentation.\\n1.2.37 Offer an ultrasound scan if breech presentation is suspected.\\n1.2.38 For women with confirmed breech presentation after 36 weeks, discuss different birthing options.\\n1.3.1 Listen to the pregnant woman's needs and preferences.\\n1.3.2 Discuss risks, benefits, and implications of assessments with the woman.\\n1.3.3 Respect women's decisions even if they differ from healthcare professionals.\\n1.3.4 Provide information in a clear, tailored, and supportive manner.\\n1.3.5 Individualize discussions based on the woman's knowledge.\\n1.3.6 Ensure understanding of information provided and allow time for questions.\\n1.3.7 Discuss antenatal care and schedule appointments at the first visit.\\n1.3.8 Provide information on various aspects of antenatal care.\\n1.3.9 Discuss nutrition, diet, physical activity, and substance use in a non-judgemental way.\\n1.3.10 Discuss the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\\n1.3.11 Provide information on pregnancy changes, support, and resources.\\n1.3.12 Refer to guidance on pelvic floor dysfunction.\\n1.3.13 Discuss babies' movements after 24 weeks.\\n1.3.14 Start discussing birth preferences before 28 weeks.\\n1.3.15 Provide information on preparing for labor, postnatal care, and newborn care.\\n1.3.16 Continue discussing birth preferences throughout pregnancy.\\n1.3.17 Discuss prolonged pregnancy options after 38 weeks.\\n1.3.18 Provide support for women with babies at increased risk of neonatal admission.\\n1.3.19 Offer appropriate information and support based on risk factors.\\n\\n1.3.23 Discuss the potential benefits of peer support with pregnant women (and their partners), and explain how it may provide practical support, help to build confidence, and reduce feelings of isolation.\\n1.3.24 Offer pregnant women (and their partners) information about how to access local and national peer support services.\\n\\n1.3.25 Advise women to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks of pregnancy and to consider using pillows to maintain their position while sleeping.\\n1.3.26 Explain to the woman that there may be a link between going to sleep on her back and stillbirth in late pregnancy (after 28 weeks).\\n\\n1.4 Interventions for common problems during pregnancy\\nNausea and vomiting\\n1.4.1 Reassure women that mild to moderate nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy and are likely to resolve before 16 to 20 weeks.\\n1.4.2 Recognize that by the time women seek advice from healthcare professionals about nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, they may have already tried a number of different interventions.\\n1.4.3 For pregnant women with mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting who prefer a non-pharmacological option, suggest that they try ginger.\\n1.4.4 When considering pharmacological treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different antiemetics with the woman. Take into account her preferences and her experience with treatments in previous pregnancies.\\n1.4.5 For pregnant women with nausea and vomiting who choose a pharmacological treatment, offer an antiemetic.\\n1.4.6 For pregnant women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting, consider intravenous fluids, ideally on an outpatient basis, and consider acupressure as an adjunct treatment.\\n1.4.7 Consider inpatient care if vomiting is severe and not responding to primary care or outpatient management. This will include women with hyperemesis gravidarum.\\n\\nModels of antenatal care and the identification of breech presentation were discussed, as well as the management of severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Recommendations were made based on the need for timely access to antenatal care, involvement of partners, and the importance of taking and recording the woman's history. The impact on practice was considered, with a focus on improving care for women without major changes in practice.\\n\\nAddressing inequalities is important in antenatal care. It is essential to discuss a woman's past and present conditions and experiences to identify potential risks and tailor care to her needs. This includes reviewing medication use and discussing home and family situations. Healthcare professionals should be aware of disparities in maternal mortality rates among different populations and address them. It is crucial to inquire about domestic abuse and female genital mutilation to provide appropriate support and safeguarding. Identifying underlying cardiac problems is also important to prevent maternal mortality. Antenatal appointments allow for monitoring and reassessment of care needs. Overall, the recommendations aim to improve current best practices in antenatal care.\\n\\nThe committee discussed the importance of fetal movements and the need for structured fetal movement awareness packages. Evidence did not show a significant benefit from these packages, but the committee agreed that fetal movements should be routinely discussed and women's concerns taken seriously. There is no agreed definition of normal fetal movements, so discussions on changes throughout pregnancy are important. The recommendations on fetal growth monitoring reflect current practice, with potential changes in offering ultrasound scans after 28 weeks. Managing reduced fetal movements should follow the NHS saving babies' lives care bundle. The recommendations on breech presentation and communication emphasize informed decision-making and listening to women's needs. Providing information about antenatal care and scheduling appointments can improve engagement and follow-up. Antenatal classes can benefit women, especially nulliparous women, and should be accessible to all groups. Peer support during the antenatal period can be valuable, especially for specific subpopulations. Lastly, recommendations on sleep position aim to reduce the risk of stillbirth and babies being born small for gestational age.\\n\\n28 weeks if women fall asleep on their backs. The committee agreed that there is some uncertainty about this risk because the evidence was from relatively small studies whose design made it difficult to assume that sleep position caused the adverse outcomes. Further research is unlikely because conducting sufficiently powered prospective cohort studies is not feasible given the relatively low incidence of stillbirth. On balance, the committee agreed that the evidence was strong enough to advise women to try to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks.\\n\\nThe committee recognized the potential anxiety and feelings of guilt that women may experience if they wake up on their backs. Healthcare professionals may need to spend more time talking to women about sleep position in pregnancy, but the recommendations are not expected to have a significant cost or resource impact.\\n\\nNausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect daily functioning and quality of life. The committee agreed that it is important to reassure pregnant women who experience mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting that these are common symptoms in early pregnancy and will usually settle later in the second trimester. Some women prefer non-pharmacological treatments while others may prefer pharmacological treatments, so both options are recommended.\\n\\nThere was evidence that ginger is effective in treating mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting in pregnancy compared with placebo. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and ondansetron were also found to be effective in improving symptoms. The committee recommended considering acupressure for women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting as an additional treatment. No recommendation was made on the use of corticosteroids for severe nausea and vomiting in pregnant women.\\n\\nThe treatment options for heartburn in pregnancy reflect current clinical practice. Lifestyle and diet information may help alleviate symptoms. Antacids and alginates are recommended as they are equally effective. No recommendations were made on acupuncture or proton pump inhibitors.\\n\\nLimited evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for symptomatic vaginal discharge in pregnant women led the committee to base their recommendations on their knowledge and clinical experience. Antifungal treatments for vaginal candidiasis and antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis were recommended, either orally or vaginally. No recommendations were made for metronidazole to treat symptomatic vaginal discharge due to vaginal trichomoniasis.\\n\\nExercise advice from a physiotherapist may reduce pelvic girdle pain intensity and functional disability. Referral to physiotherapy services is recommended, as non-rigid lumbopelvic belts together with general information and advice were found to reduce pain intensity.\\n\\nNo evidence was identified about adverse effects of using a lumbopelvic belt. Providing a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt was also found to be cost-effective, but due to limited clinical evidence, a strong recommendation was not made. Manual therapy alone was not found to have any benefits for women with pelvic girdle pain. The evidence for acupuncture to treat pelvic girdle pain was mixed and of poor quality, therefore not enough to justify a recommendation with substantial resource impact. Providing a lumbopelvic belt is not current practice in all units, so the recommendation may have cost implications. However, health economic modeling showed that it is cost-effective even if women are referred for physiotherapy. The recommendation may increase the number of pregnant women seeking referral to physiotherapy services.\\n\\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks should prompt a review in secondary care for monitoring, administering corticosteroids, and neonatal unit care if the baby is born preterm. Hospitalization should be considered for these cases. Recommendations reflect current practice. \\n\\nAround 660,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year. The antenatal period is crucial for providing support, information, and assessing the risk of complications. Good quality antenatal care is essential to identify and address potential problems and reduce the chance of poor outcomes for both the woman and the baby. This guideline covers routine antenatal care for all women. It does not cover specialized care for women with underlying medical conditions or obstetric complications.\\n\\nFor more information and committee details, refer to the NICE topic page on pregnancy. See evidence reviews for full details of the evidence and committee discussions. NICE has tools and resources to help implement this guideline. \\n\\nUpdate information: This guideline updates and replaces NICE guideline CG62 (published March 2008). Minor changes have been made since publication.\",\n    \"Laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer is safe and effective, provided proper arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent, and audit. Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, with additional training recommended. The procedure aims to provide a less invasive option with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery. Conversion to laparotomy rates vary but postoperative complications are fewer with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Further data on long-term outcomes would be beneficial for future reviews.\",\n    \"Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management guideline covers diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with complications in early pregnancy. It aims to improve early pregnancy loss diagnosis and support for women. Healthcare professionals, commissioners, and women with complications in early pregnancy are the target audience. Recommendations include providing support and information with dignity and respect, early pregnancy assessment services available 7 days a week, and recognizing the symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy for prompt referral.\\n\\nIn women of reproductive age, consider offering a pregnancy test even with non-specific symptoms. Healthcare professionals should have access to pregnancy tests. Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment. Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors. Refer women with early pregnancy complications for assessment based on clinical situation. Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies. Consider signs indicating tubal ectopic pregnancy during ultrasound scans. Use serum hCG measurements cautiously in women with pregnancies of unknown location. Provide written information to women with pregnancies of unknown location for monitoring symptoms and accessing emergency care.\\n\\n1.4.29 For a woman with an increase in serum hCG levels greater than 63% after Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management:\\n- Inform her that she is likely to have a developing intrauterine pregnancy.\\n- Offer her a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the location of the pregnancy between 7 and 14 days later. Consider an earlier scan for women with a serum hCG level greater than or equal to 1,500 IU/litre.\\n- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed, offer her routine antenatal care. \\n- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not confirmed, refer her for immediate clinical review by a senior gynaecologist.\\n\\n1.4.30 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels greater than 50% after 48 hours:\\n- Inform her that the pregnancy is unlikely to continue but this is not confirmed.\\n- Provide her with oral and written information about where she can access support and counselling services.\\n- Ask her to take a urine pregnancy test 14 days after the second serum hCG test.\\n\\n1.4.31 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels less than 50%, or an increase less than 63%, refer her for clinical review in the early pregnancy assessment service within 24 hours.\\n\\n1.4.32 For women with a pregnancy of unknown location, when using serial serum hCG measurements, do not use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\nOffer systemic methotrexate to women with an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy who have no significant pain, an adnexal mass smaller than 35mm, a serum hCG level less than 1,500 IU/litre, and no visible heartbeat. Surgery should be offered if methotrexate is not acceptable or if the woman has significant pain, a larger adnexal mass, a visible heartbeat, or a serum hCG level of 5,000 IU/litre or more. Women with an ectopic pregnancy and a serum hCG level between 1,500 and 5,000 IU/litre can choose between methotrexate and surgical management if they meet certain criteria. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed when surgical treatment is needed, and competent surgeons should be available. Salpingectomy should be offered unless there are other risk factors for infertility, and salpingotomy can be considered for women with infertility risk factors. Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis should be offered to all Rh-negative women undergoing surgery for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Do not offer it to women receiving solely medical management or with certain pregnancy conditions.\\n\\nOver the past 2 decades, there have been significant changes in the management of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, with a shift towards outpatient or day case care and the introduction of medical and expectant management as alternatives to surgery. However, there is a lack of research into the effects of these different approaches from the woman's perspective, particularly their psychological and emotional impact. Miscarriage is distressing for most women, and the type of management itself might affect women's need for counseling, resulting in a cost to the NHS. Therefore, further research in this area is important.\\n\\nA comparative study should be conducted to assess how the type of intervention impacts women's experience, including psychological and emotional outcomes. Currently, there is no evidence exploring the psychological impact of different treatments for ectopic pregnancy. A qualitative comparative study is needed to reduce the emotional impact of the condition and maximize women's emotional recovery in the short and long term.\\n\\nAdditionally, recommendations have been made regarding the use of ultrasound for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy and the use of progestogens for preventing miscarriage. Standardizing practices across the NHS based on evidence will improve the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and reduce risks to women. The use of progestogens to prevent miscarriage is cost-effective and will standardize the preparation of progesterone used in such cases.\\n\\nFurthermore, recommendations have been made for the medical management of miscarriage, including the use of a combination of medications to reduce the need for surgical intervention. These recommendations aim to improve the management of miscarriage and reduce costs for the NHS.\\n\\nLastly, recommendations have been made for the expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, offering clinically stable women an alternative to medical management. These recommendations aim to standardize the management of ectopic pregnancy and make expectant management available when clinically appropriate, potentially resulting in cost savings through a reduction in drug use.\\n\\nEctopic pregnancy and miscarriage have an adverse effect on the quality of life of many women. Approximately 20% of pregnancies miscarry, and miscarriages can cause considerable distress. Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is 11 per 1,000 pregnancies, with a maternal mortality of 0.2 per 1,000 estimated ectopic pregnancies. About two-thirds of these deaths are associated with substandard care. Women who do not access medical help readily are particularly vulnerable. Improvement in the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy loss is therefore of vital importance, in order to reduce the incidence of the associated psychological morbidity and avoid the unnecessary deaths of women with ectopic pregnancies.\",\n    \"Endometriosis: diagnosis and management \\nNICE guideline \\nPublished: 6 September 2017 \\nLast updated: 16 April 2024 \\n\\nThe recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available.

Ensure that pelvic MRI scans are interpreted by a healthcare professional with specialist expertise in gynaecological imaging. Consider laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis in women with suspected endometriosis, even if the ultrasound was normal. For women with suspected deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter, consider a pelvic ultrasound or MRI before an operative laparoscopy. During a diagnostic laparoscopy, a gynaecologist with training and skills in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis should perform a systematic inspection of the pelvis. Consider taking a biopsy of suspected endometriosis during a diagnostic laparoscopy. Offer endometriosis treatment according to the woman's symptoms, preferences, and priorities rather than the stage of the endometriosis. Consider outpatient follow-up for women with confirmed endometriosis, particularly women with deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter or large endometrioma. For women with endometriosis-related pain, discuss the benefits and risks of analgesics. Consider hormonal treatment for women with suspected, confirmed, or recurrent endometriosis. Discuss surgical management options with women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. Perform surgery for endometriosis laparoscopically unless there are contraindications. Consider excision rather than ablation to treat endometriomas. Offer excision or ablation of endometriosis plus adhesiolysis for endometriosis not involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter to improve the chance of spontaneous pregnancy. Offer laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or drainage and ablation to improve the chance of spontaneous pregnancy in women with endometriomas. Discuss the benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery as a treatment option for women with deep endometriosis trying to conceive. Do not offer hormonal treatment alone or in combination with surgery to women trying to conceive as it does not improve spontaneous pregnancy rates. Terms used in this guideline: Chronic pelvic pain, Paediatric and adolescent gynaecology service, Ovarian cystectomy, Managed clinical networks. Recommendations for research: Pain management programs - Are pain management programs a clinically and cost-effective intervention for women with endometriosis?\\n\\nProvide an additional or alternative treatment option for women experiencing endometriosis-related pain. Groups of particular interest are women for whom hormonal and surgical options have been exhausted, women who would prefer an alternative to a pharmacological or surgical approach, and women who may be prioritizing trying to conceive.\\n\\nIs laparoscopic treatment (excision or ablation) of peritoneal disease in isolation effective for managing endometriosis-related pain? Isolated peritoneal endometriosis can be an incidental finding in women who may or may not experience pain or other symptoms. Research is needed to determine whether laparoscopic treatment of isolated peritoneal endometriosis in women with endometriosis-related pain results in a clinical and cost-effective improvement in symptoms.\\n\\nAre specialist lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) effective, compared with no specialist lifestyle interventions, for women with endometriosis? Endometriosis is a long-term condition that can cause acute and chronic pain, and fatigue. It has a significant and sometimes severe impact on the woman's quality of life and activities of daily living, including relationships and sexuality, ability to work, fertility, fitness, and mental health.\\n\\nWhat information and support interventions are effective to help women with endometriosis deal with their symptoms and improve their quality of lives? This guideline has identified that women with endometriosis and their partners feel that information and support is not always provided in the way that best meets their needs. However, the direct effectiveness of different types or formats of information and support interventions on measurable outcomes such as health-related quality of life and level of function has not been tested.\\n\\nWhat is the effect of different doses and durations of hormonal treatments given either before, after, or both before and after surgery on fertility outcomes in people with endometriosis where fertility is a priority?\",\n    \"Inducing labour \\nNICE guideline \\nPublished: 4 November 2021 \\n\\nThe recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences, and values of their patients or the people using their service. \\n\\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. \\n\\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. \\n\\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible. \\n\\nOverview: This guideline covers the circumstances for inducing labour, methods of induction, assessment, monitoring, pain relief, and managing complications. It aims to improve advice and care for pregnant women who are thinking about or having induction of labour. \\n\\nWho is it for? Healthcare professionals, commissioners and providers, pregnant women, their families, and carers. \\n\\nRecommendations: People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care. \\n\\n1.1 Information and decision making: Discuss preferences about mode of birth with women early on in their pregnancy. Take into account their individual circumstances and discuss the options for birth. Record these discussions and the woman's preferences in her notes. Confirm a woman's preferences for birth at antenatal visits towards the end of pregnancy, as these may have changed since earlier discussions. Explain to women that induction of labour is a medical intervention that will affect their birth options and their experience of the birth process. \\n\\n1.2 Induction of labour in specific circumstances: Give women with uncomplicated pregnancies every opportunity to go into spontaneous labour. Explain to women that labour usually starts naturally before 42 weeks. Discuss with women the risks associated with a pregnancy continuing beyond 41 weeks and the potential benefits of induction of labour. Be aware of the increased risk of stillbirth for women from some minority ethnic backgrounds or living in deprived areas. Offer additional fetal monitoring for women who choose not to have their labour induced if they wish to have monitoring from 42 weeks. Offer women who choose to await the spontaneous onset of labour the opportunity.\\n\\nAdvise women to contact their midwife or maternity unit if they change their mind before their next appointment or have concerns about their baby. Do not carry out induction of labor before 34+0 weeks for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes unless there are additional obstetric indications. Offer expectant management until 37+0 weeks. Discuss the options of expectant management or induction of labor for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks but before 37+0 weeks. Consider risks to the woman and baby, availability of neonatal intensive care facilities, and the woman's individual circumstances and preferences. If a woman has preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or cesarean birth. Offer women with prelabor rupture of membranes at term a choice of expectant management for up to 24 hours or induction of labor as soon as possible. Respect the woman's decision if she chooses to wait for spontaneous onset of labor for over 24 hours after prelabor rupture of membranes at term. If a woman has prelabor rupture of membranes at term and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or cesarean birth. Discuss methods of induction with a woman who has had a previous cesarean birth to make an informed decision about the most appropriate choice. Consider requests for induction of labor after discussing the benefits and risks with the woman. Induction of labor is not generally recommended if a woman's baby is in the breech position. Consider induction of labor for babies in the breech position if birth needs to be expedited and external cephalic version is unsuccessful, declined, or contraindicated, and the woman chooses not to have a planned cesarean birth. Do not induce labor if there is fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise. Do not routinely offer induction of labor to women with a history of precipitate labor to avoid a birth unattended by healthcare professionals. In the event of an intrauterine fetal death, offer support to help women and their partners and family cope with the emotional and physical consequences of the death. If a woman with an intrauterine fetal death chooses induced labor, follow the recommendations on monitoring of uterine contractions and provide one-to-one midwifery care of the woman during labor and birth. Explain to women what a membrane sweep is and that it might make it more likely that labor will start without the need for additional methods of induction. Discuss with women if they would like a vaginal examination for membrane sweeping after 39+0 weeks. Discuss with women if they would like to have additional membrane sweeping if labor does not start spontaneously following the first sweep. Explain to women that a vaginal examination to assess the readiness of the cervix will help decide which method of induction they will be offered first and discuss the risks and benefits of different methods to induce labor. Include that both dinoprostone and misoprostol can cause hyperstimulation.\\n\\nUterine activity and fetal condition must be monitored regularly. If hyperstimulation occurs, the induction treatment will be stopped. Different vaginal products have varying ease of removal. Hyperstimulation can be treated with tocolysis. Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation than pharmacological methods. Follow manufacturers' guidance on the use of dinoprostone and misoprostol preparations for induction of labor. Consider induction options based on Bishop score. Offer induction with amniotomy and oxytocin infusion for Bishop score of more than 6. Assess fetal wellbeing and uterine contractions during induction. Offer pain relief options and discuss with women. Consider outpatient induction with appropriate monitoring. Monitor fetal wellbeing and progress during induction. Manage complications like uterine hyperstimulation, unsuccessful induction, cord prolapse, and other issues. Definitions provided for Bishop score, Dinoprostone, and Expectant management.\\n\\nHyperstimulation is the overactivity of the uterus as a result of labor induction. It is defined by increased contractions and may be associated with changes in fetal heart rate. Membrane sweeping involves separating membranes to induce labor. Mothers and babies are audited to reduce risks. Precipitate labor is a very quick labor. Suspected fetal macrosomia is when a baby is large for its gestational age. Unsuccessful induction is when labor does not start after treatment. Research recommendations include optimal timing of induction and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Inducing labor for suspected fetal macrosomia requires informed decision-making. Inducing labor after intrauterine fetal death after a previous cesarean birth needs further research.\\n\\nThe committee recommends discussing different birth options with women after intrauterine fetal death if they have had a previous cesarean birth. Women with IUFD should be cared for on a one-to-one basis and monitored. Women with a scarred uterus are at increased risk of uterine rupture after IUFD. Mechanical methods of induction may be safe to use in women with a previous cesarean birth. Inducing labor methods depend on the readiness of the cervix, with options including vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol, and mechanical methods. The aim is to provide advice to healthcare professionals and pregnant women on the information and support needed to make decisions about induction of labor.\",\n    \"BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology\\nRCOG GUIDELINE\\nManagement of Thyroid Disorders in Pregnancy\\nGreen- top Guideline No. 76\\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\\n• Trimester-  and manufacturer-  specific pregnancy reference ranges for serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) are recommended for correct interpretation of thyroid function tests.\\n• Consideration should be given to increasing dietary intake of iodine-  rich foods or consuming daily oral supplementation of 150μg iodine in the form of potassium iodide during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\\n• Subpopulations with specific risk factors for thyroid disorders should be tested in the first trimester of pregnancy.\\n• Titration of levothyroxine to achieve a preconception TSH ≤ 2.5 mU/L is recommended for women with overt hypothyroidism.\\n• Women treated with levothyroxine should increase their dose upon a positive pregnancy test.\\n• TSH and fT4 concentrations should be checked regularly during pregnancy for women treated with levothyroxine.\\n• Treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for women with subclinical hypothyroidism.\\n• Routine testing for TPOAb in euthyroid women is not recommended during pregnancy.\\n• Levothyroxine treatment is not recommended for women with TPOAb in the absence of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.\\n\\nFertility and recurrent miscarriage should be addressed by clinicians with appropriate experience. Care should be optimized prior to conception, during pregnancy, and after birth. There should be a clear designated primary clinician to ensure continuity of care. Women with thyroid disorders should be seen in joint multidisciplinary clinics. \\n\\nThyroid function tests in pregnancy should use trimester- and manufacturer-specific pregnancy reference ranges for serum TSH and fT4. Treatment targets for TSH and fT4 are recommended for pregnant women on thyroid-related medication. Iodine supplementation of approximately 200-250μg daily is recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Universal testing for thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy is not recommended.\\n\\nThe benefit of treatment is not yet proven. Targeted testing for thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women at risk is recommended for improving pregnancy outcomes. Testing should be carried out in women with specific risk factors, such as a personal history of thyroid disorder, autoimmune conditions, or a history of late miscarriage or stillbirth. Levothyroxine treatment is recommended for pregnant women with severe subclinical hypothyroidism to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism. Testing and treatment should be initiated as early as possible in pregnancy for optimal outcomes.\\n\\nTo reduce the risk of hypothyroidism in pregnancy, women with low fT4 should be referred for further investigation. Women on levothyroxine therapy should increase their dose by 25%-30% upon a positive pregnancy test. Dose adjustments may be needed during pregnancy. Regular monitoring of TSH and fT4 levels is recommended to maintain thyroid function within normal ranges. Routine testing for TPO antibodies in pregnancy is not recommended unless there is thyroid dysfunction. Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to adverse outcomes in pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy counseling is advised for women with hyperthyroidism to minimize risks to the mother and fetus. Definitive treatment options should be discussed before conception.\\n\\nMaintenance of euthyroidism during pregnancy is easier in women who have been rendered hypothyroid by definitive treatment. They would require levothyroxine replacement, with dose titrations in pregnancy. Further, the risk of teratogenicity with antithyroid drugs can be avoided. A persistently increased TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level assessed around 6 months post-treatment is associated with increased risk of fetal Graves' disease. Retrospective studies show increased risks of fetal/neonatal Graves' disease with TRAb more than 3 times the assay threshold for positivity. Hyperthyroidism requiring treatment with antithyroid drugs while trying to conceive should use propylthiouracil (PTU) in preference to carbimazole (CMZ), at the lowest effective dose to maintain fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the reference range. All women of childbearing age who develop hyperthyroidism should have a discussion regarding potential future pregnancy. The risks and benefits of all treatment options should be discussed. If the woman is on levothyroxine replacement following definitive thyroid ablation or thyroidectomy, then optimal TSH and fT4 concentrations should be achieved prior to trying conception. Following radioiodine treatment, TRAb concentrations may rise, increasing the risk of fetal Graves' disease. Surgery may be the better option in women with high TRAb concentrations. Women who are in remission from Graves' disease are unlikely to relapse during pregnancy. Antithyroid drugs should be monitored regularly during pregnancy. Titration of antithyroid drugs should target fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the pregnancy reference range. Neonates of women with known Graves' disease should have their thyroid function monitored soon after birth. Treatment with antithyroid drugs is the mainstay of treatment of active hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Potential teratogenic effects have been linked to antithyroid drugs. The lowest effective dose of antithyroid drugs should be used targeting serum fT4 at the upper half of the pregnancy reference range. In rare cases of isolated fetal hyperthyroidism, a block replace regimen may be indicated. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be used temporarily for control of hyperthyroid symptoms.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that antithyroid drugs will affect the fetus. Women with a history of hyperthyroidism in remission do not require additional fetal surveillance. However, in those with active Graves' hyperthyroidism, fetal surveillance is recommended. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is self-limiting and does not require treatment. Women with a history of hyperthyroidism should have thyroid function tested postpartum. Antithyroid drugs are safe during breastfeeding. Thyroid nodules in pregnancy should be monitored, and if there is suspicion of malignancy, a fine needle aspiration can be safely performed. Surgical intervention for thyroid enlargement should be considered between 14-22 weeks of gestation.\\n\\nWomen should be counseled that there is no difference in the rate of recurrence or long-term survival with well-differentiated thyroid cancer identified during pregnancy compared with those diagnosed outside of pregnancy. Generally, surgery for most common thyroid cancers diagnosed in pregnancy can be deferred until after birth unless there is substantial growth, significant airway compression, or rapidly progressive disease. Postpartum Thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies to TPO and thyroglobulin, occurring in 5%-10% of unselected pregnancies. The classical form of PPT is triphasic with an initial thyrotoxic phase followed by a transient hypothyroid phase and then a return to euthyroidism. Routine testing for PPT is not recommended. In women with risk factors for PPT who experience symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, thyroid function tests should be performed. Levothyroxine replacement is appropriate for women who are very symptomatic during the hypothyroid phase of PPT or actively trying to become pregnant. Antithyroid drugs are not indicated in the management of the thyrotoxic phase of PPT. Consider treatment of symptomatic women in the thyrotoxic phase with beta-blockers. Following restoration of euthyroidism, monitor serum TSH annually in women with a history of PPT as they continue to be at risk of developing permanent hypothyroidism. There is insufficient evidence to recommend levothyroxine prophylaxis, or either iodine or selenium supplementation to prevent or treat PPT.\\n\\nImportance of Iodine Nutrition During Pregnancy, Placenta as a Compensatory Iodine Storage Organ, Effects of Iodine Deficiency in Pregnancy and Infancy, Thyroid Hormone Action in the Placenta, Neurodevelopmental Actions of Thyroid Hormone, Maternal Thyroid Hormones and Fetal Brain Development, Role of the Placenta in Thyroid Hormone Delivery to the Fetus.\\n\\nClinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and postpartum.

It is important to monitor thyroid function in pregnant women with thyroid antibodies to prevent postpartum depression.

Any deviation from local protocols should be documented in the patient's case notes.\",\n    \"Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth\\nRecommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS, offering planned VBAC to most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. VBAC success rate is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being a predictor of success. Planned VBAC should be conducted in a suitably staffed delivery suite. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis given. VBAC may not be suitable for pregnancies with certain complications. A structured antenatal care schedule should be followed, with counselling by a member of the maternity team. VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with certain risk factors may have increased adverse outcomes with VBAC.\\n\\nPrevious caesarean deliveries increase the risk of placenta praevia and placenta accreta in subsequent pregnancies. Women with two or more prior caesareans may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, post-date pregnancy, maternal age over 40, obesity, and decreased myometrial thickness. Antenatal counselling should be individualized and documented, with consideration of VBAC success rates and future reproductive preferences. Planned VBAC has fewer complications than ERCS, with a small risk of uterine rupture. VBAC is associated with a slightly increased risk of stillbirth, while ERCS has a higher risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Long-term outcomes of repeated ERCS include increased risks of placenta praevia and accreta. Consideration should be given to attempting VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies.\\n\\nThe NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase in serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared to ERCS. A summary of outcomes indicates a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC compared to ERCS. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Induction and augmentation of VBAC labour are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be given, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Recommended practices for ERCS are outlined in the NICE caesarean section guideline.\\n\\nWomen considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables a reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, particularly reducing the risk of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. Administering maternal corticosteroids may be considered if ERCS is needed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics are more effective in reducing the risk of maternal infection. The choice of thromboprophylaxis should follow RCOG guidance. Special circumstances such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more require a cautious approach when considering VBAC. Induction of labor from 41+0 weeks is recommended to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates in twin pregnancies are similar to singleton pregnancies. Antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is important. Further research is needed on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC with ultrasound, and understanding the increased risk of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery. Auditable topics include documented discussions of risks and benefits of VBAC, successful versus unsuccessful VBAC rates, and maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality.\\n\\nCondensed version:\\n- Various studies have been conducted on the risks and outcomes associated with different modes of delivery after a previous cesarean section.\\n- Factors such as uterine rupture, placenta previa, and maternal morbidity have been examined in relation to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and repeat cesarean sections.\\n- Patient decision aids and personalized decision-making tools have been developed to assist women in choosing the mode of delivery.\\n- It is important to consider the risks and benefits of different delivery options, including the impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes.\\n\\nIncidence of neonatal respiratory distress after elective caesarean section: pragmatic randomized trial.

Successful VBAC is a vaginal delivery, while unsuccessful VBAC is a cesarean during labor. Uterine rupture is a disruption of the uterine muscle, while uterine dehiscence is a disruption with intact uterine serosa. Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Term delivery-related perinatal death is specific to births at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Neonatal respiratory morbidity includes transient tachypnea and respiratory distress syndrome. Antenatal care includes counseling on delivery options and routine tests. VBAC success rates are influenced by various factors, and guidelines outline intrapartum care for VBAC and ERCS. The pathway for birth choices after cesarean delivery considers risks and benefits, with a focus on VBAC success and uterine rupture risks. The guidelines are based on evidence levels and grades of recommendations.\\n\\nThe final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2018.\",\n    \"Anaemia during Pregnancy  \\nSummary statement: By providing evidence based guidance for Obstetric, Midwifery and Haematology staff on the parameters and treatment for anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. \\n\\nPurpose: To provide evidence based guidance for staff when caring for women and people with anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. \\n\\nKey related documents: UH Sussex Maternity SRH& WH guidelines: Antenatal Care and Patient Information, Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage, Postpartum Haemorrhage \\n\\nApproved by: Joint Obstetric Guideline Group (JOGG): 18th October 2023 \\n\\nManagement of iron deficiency in pregnancy includes dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy. Anaemia in pregnancy is diagnosed based on hemoglobin levels. \\n\\nCauses of anaemia in pregnancy include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and other inflammatory disorders. Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. \\n\\nConsequences of anaemia in pregnancy include higher risk of perinatal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and preterm birth. \\n\\nScreening for anaemia should be done at booking and 28 weeks, with treatment initiated if hemoglobin levels are below certain thresholds. \\n\\nWomen and people at high risk for iron deficiency should receive prophylactic iron or have serum ferritin checked. Red cell indices and ferritin levels are used to diagnose iron deficiency. \\n\\nDietary advice should be given to all pregnant women and people to meet increased iron requirements during pregnancy.\\n\\nDaily intake of iron during pregnancy is 27 mg, twice that of a non-pregnant person. Iron-rich foods include meat, nuts, beans, dried fruit, whole grains, fortified cereals, soybean flour, and dark green leafy vegetables. Oral iron supplementation is needed once iron deficiency occurs. Oral iron replacement therapy should be recommended if anemia is diagnosed, with a recommended elemental iron dose of 40-80 mg each morning or alternate day. Side effects of oral iron include gastric irritation, nausea, and disturbed bowel function. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, with further checks depending on the degree of anemia and gestational period. Intravenous iron therapy can be considered in cases of non-compliance, intolerance to oral preparations, malabsorption, GI diseases, or poor response to oral iron. IV iron therapy should not be administered out of hours to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Contraindications include a history of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, first trimester of pregnancy, acute or chronic bacteremia, and decompensated liver disease. Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos is the preparation used for IV iron therapy. Techniques to minimize the risk of iron staining during infusion should be followed. Management of hypersensitivity reactions and iron extravasation is important. Efforts should be made to maximize management at birth.\\n\\nPrioritize iron infusion for pregnant individuals with Hb <100 approaching term to reduce the risk of postpartum complications. Consider IV iron therapy or blood transfusion for those with moderate symptoms of anaemia. Monitor Hb levels postpartum and offer oral iron replacement if needed. Consider blood transfusion only after careful evaluation and explore alternative treatments. Ensure patients are informed of the risks and benefits of transfusion and document discussions and consent.\",\n    \"Clinical Protocol: Cord Prolapse Management\\n\\nCord prolapse is defined as the descent of the umbilical cord through the cervix alongside or past the presenting part in the presence of ruptured membranes. The overall incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%, with higher rates in breech presentations. Risk factors include long cord, breech presentation, and iatrogenic factors like artificial rupture of membranes.\\n\\nImmediate action is crucial upon diagnosis, with methods like bladder filling to relieve cord compression. In the hospital setting, a category 1 caesarean birth is recommended within 30 minutes for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. In community settings, immediate transfer to a labor ward is advised.\\n\\nTraining for maternity care staff is essential, and monitoring through clinical incident forms and audits is recommended. Postnatal debriefing is also encouraged to reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.\\n\\nClinical Protocol: Cord Prolapse Management v1.0\\n\\nApproval:\\n- Departmental Joint Obstetric Guideline Group\\n- Women’s and Children Divisional Governance Group\\n- Medicines Governance Committee\\n- Clinical Document Approval Group\\n\\nProtocol version control log:\\n- Version 1.0, June 2024, S.

If the woman decides to remain on continuous CTG monitoring, so be it.\\n\\nHourly review\\nPerform and document a systematic assessment of the condition of the woman and unborn baby every hour, more frequently if there are concerns. Update the labour ward coordinator (LWC) of progress and escalate concerns sooner if necessary. Discuss the results of each hourly assessment with the woman and base recommendations about care on her preferences. Include birthing companions in these discussions if appropriate.\\n\\nHomebirth\\nIt is recommended that Homebirth Midwives update the LWC every 4 hours on the red phone when confirmed in established labour or staying at a homebirth. This is to ensure the safety and support of the MW at the homebirth.\\n\\nDocumentation for IA\\nDocument the fetal heart rate, woman's pulse, any abnormalities heard, any transfer from IA to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and hourly assessments on women and unborn baby.\\n\\nContinuous Cardiotocography (CTG) in Labour\\nIt is recommended that women with any high-risk features have their baby monitored continuously throughout their labour once it is established.\\n\\nGestational Age for CTG\\nDecisions around fetal monitoring should be made in conjunction with pregnant women and the multidisciplinary team.\\n\\nTelemetry\\nEnsure wireless transducers are ready to use and switch from wireless to wired transducers if there is signal loss.\\n\\nManagement of Continuous Fetal Monitoring\\nOffer one-to-one care when being continuously monitored.\\n\\nCTG Reviews\\nSystematically assess the CTG trace every 30 minutes and document the review in the woman's record.\\n\\nFresh Eyes\\nOn an hourly basis, another Midwife or Obstetrician should review all continuous CTGs alongside the midwife providing care.\\n\\nInterpretation of the INTRAPARTUM CTG\\nAssess and document contractions, baseline fetal heart rate, variability, decelerations, and accelerations.

Take into account antenatal and intrapartum risk factors, and discuss this with the women or birthing person\\n\\nConservative Measures\\nIf there are concerns about the baby's wellbeing, be aware of the possible underlying causes and start 1 or more of the following conservative measures based on an assessment of the most likely cause(s):\\n• Maternal position (this can affect uterine blood flow and cord compression): Encourage the woman to mobilise, adopt an alternative position, and avoid being supine\\n• Hypotension. Do not offer intravenous fluids to treat fetal heart rate abnormalities unless the woman is hypotensive or has signs of sepsis. If the woman is hypotensive secondary to an epidural top-up, start intravenous fluids, move her to a left lateral position and call an anaesthetist to review\\n• If there is excessive contraction frequency, consider reducing or turning oxytocin off\\n\\nDo not review numeric data for cCTG classified as normal. Continue recording until criteria are met. Urgent review required for visually abnormal assessment. STV cannot be interpreted before 60 minutes. Auscultate if CTG not indicated. Criteria not met after 60 minutes requires urgent review. STV should be considered for fetus at risk. Continuous CTG advised for various risk factors.\",\n    \"Disengaging a Deeply Impacted Fetal Head at LSCS and Use of Fetal Pillow\\n\\nThis guideline applies to pregnant individuals requiring a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) at or beyond 37 weeks gestation with a cephalic presentation. It outlines the use of a Fetal Pillow as a first-line action to disengage a deeply impacted fetal head during LSCS. If the fetal head remains impacted, a reverse breech extraction technique can be used as a second-line action. The guideline also provides detailed instructions on how to insert the Fetal Pillow and emphasizes the importance of professional judgment in its application. The management of pre-term cases will depend on individual circumstances and obstetrician's decision-making. The guideline is based on current research and best practice standards.\\n\\nClinical Guideline: Fetal Pillow Insertion for Impacted Head at LSCS\\n\\n- Fetal pillow is a disposable soft silicone balloon inserted into the vagina before LSCS to elevate the fetal head in cephalic presentation.\\n- Studies suggest it elevates the head by 2-4cm.\\n- Indications for fetal pillow use include failed instrumental delivery, full dilatation cesarean with the fetal head at or below the ischial spines, and severe caput or molding.\\n- Operator training is required before using the pillow.\\n- Various assessments are needed before and during the procedure.\\n- Perceived difficulty of delivering the head, mode of delivery, Apgar score, injuries to the baby, cord gases, SCBU admission, uterine incision extensions, estimated blood loss, bladder injury, and ICU/HDU admission should all be documented during the procedure.\",\n    \"Hypertension and preeclampsia in pregnancy Maternity Protocol: MP019 Date agreed: April 2022\\n\\nKey Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action.

Management Team: To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations.\\n\\nDefinitions: Hypertension is systolic over 140mmHg on two separate occasions in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is raised BP on two occasions at >20/40 gestation with significant proteinuria.\\n\\nAntenatal Management: Assessing proteinuria in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is important. Referrals and management should be immediate for high-risk individuals. Antihypertensive drugs like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa can be considered.\\n\\nManagement of Chronic Hypertension: Pre-pregnancy advice includes weight management, exercise, and healthy eating. Antihypertensive drugs like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa can be considered based on individual factors. Regular antenatal appointments and timing of birth are crucial.\\n\\nDo not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women/people with chronic hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, with or without antihypertensive treatment, unless there are other medical indications or fetal growth restriction. For women/people with chronic hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment timing of birth should be agreed after 37 weeks between the woman and the senior obstetrician. If planned early birth is necessary offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate if indicated. Measure blood pressure daily for the first 2 days after birth and at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth. Aim to keep blood pressure lower than 140/90 mmHg and continue antihypertensive treatment if required. Consider labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa for treatment of gestational hypertension. Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women/people with gestational hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, unless there are other medical indications or fetal growth restriction. If planned early birth is necessary offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate if indicated. Measure blood pressure daily for the first 2 days after birth and at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth. Continue antihypertensive treatment if required. Offer labe talol to treat hypertension, nifedipine for women/people in whom labetalol is not suitable, or methyldopa if labetalol or nifedipine are not suitable. Women/people with severe hypertension should be managed in a high dependency unit environment. If a woman in a critical care setting has severe hypertension or severe pre-eclampsia, give intravenous magnesium sulphate. Consider prophylactic magnesium sulphate treatment if certain features of severe pre-eclampsia are present. Recurrent fits should be treated with a further dose of magnesium sulphate. Do not use diazepam, phenytoin, or other anticonvulsants as an alternative to magnesium sulphate in women/people with eclampsia. Treat women/people with blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg or MAP 125 or more during pregnancy or after birth.\\n\\nLabetalol infusion is the first-line treatment for hypertension in pregnant women due to its effectiveness and rapid onset of action. Initial dose is 200mg orally or 20mg intravenously, with a maximum cumulative dose of 300mg. Continuous IV infusion can also be used. If target blood pressure is not achieved, switch to another class of agent. Labetalol is contraindicated in patients with a history of oral steroid-dependent asthma. Oral nifedipine is the second-line treatment but may cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure. Intravenous hydralazine is the third-line treatment. Monitoring of blood pressure and fetal well-being is essential, and delivery should be considered as the only cure for pre-eclampsia. Postnatal care includes monitoring blood pressure and offering antihypertensive treatment if necessary. Haematological and biochemical monitoring should be conducted postpartum to assess kidney function. Fetal monitoring should also be performed in cases of chronic hypertension.\\n\\n15.6.2 In women/people with chronic hypertension, only carry out cardiotocography if clinically indicated. \\n\\n15.7 Fetal monitoring in gestational hypertension\\n15.7.1 In women/people with gestational hypertension, carry out an ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry at diagnosis and if normal repeat every 2 to 4 weeks, if clinically indicated. \\n15.7.2 In women/people with gestational hypertension, only carry out cardiotocography if clinically indicated. \\n\\n15.8 Fetal monitoring in pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension\\n15.8.1 Carry out cardiotocography at diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension.\\n15.8.2 If conservative management of pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension is planned, carry out all the following tests at diagnosis:\\n15.8.2.1 Ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment\\n15.8.2.2 Umbilical artery doppler velocimetry\\n15.8.3 If the results of all fetal monitoring are normal in women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, do not routinely repeat cardiotocography unless clinically indicated.\\n15.8.4 In women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, repeat cardiotocography if any of the following occur:\\n15.8.4.1 The woman reports a change in fetal movement\\n15.8.4.2 Vaginal bleeding\\n15.8.4.3 Abdominal pain\\n15.8.4.4 Deterioration in maternal condition\\n15.8.5 In women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, repeat ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment or umbilical artery doppler velocimetry every 2 weeks, with subsequent surveillance and monitoring determined by the findings of these scans.\\n15.8.6 For women/people with pre-eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, write a care plan that includes all of the following:\\n15.8.6.1 The timing and nature of future fetal monitoring\\n15.8.6.2 Fetal indications for birth and if and when antenatal corticosteroids should be given\\n15.8.6.3 Plans for discussion with neonatal paediatricians and obstetric anaesthetists\\n\\n16 Women/people who need additional fetal monitoring\\n16.1 Carry out an ultrasound for fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry starting at between 28 and 30 weeks (or at least 2 weeks before previous gestational age of onset if earlier than 28 weeks) and repeating 4 weeks later in women/people with previous:\\n16.1.1 Severe pre-eclampsia\\n16.1.2 Pre-eclampsia that resulted in birth before 34 weeks\\n16.1.3 Pre-eclampsia with a baby whose birth weight was less than the 10th centile\\n16.1.4 Intrauterine death\\n16.1.5 Placental abruption\\n16.2 In women/people who need additional fetal monitoring as above, carry out cardiotocography only if clinically indicated.\\n\\n17 Intrapartum care\\n17.1 Give advice and treatment to women/people in line with the NICE guideline on intrapartum care, unless there are recommendations in this guideline on the same topic.

Complementary therapies like moxibustion may be considered for breech presentation.\\n\\nAbsolute contraindications for ECV include conditions like placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers. ECV should be performed by trained obstetricians and monitored for complications.\\n\\nThose declining ECV or with persistent breech presentation should be informed of their birth options, including planned caesarean section or vaginal breech birth. Risks to both the baby and the mother should be discussed, and individualized care plans should be developed.\\n\\nPregnant individuals choosing elective LSCS for breech presentation should be informed about the timing and potential risks. Those opting for vaginal breech birth should undergo antenatal assessment and be referred to appropriate clinics for care.\\n\\n7.1.2 Thorough assessment for risk factors in planned vaginal breech birth is essential. Higher risk factors include hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise. \\n7.1.3 If any risk factor is identified, pregnant individuals should be counseled that planned vaginal birth is associated with increased perinatal risk and caesarean section is recommended. \\n7.1.4 All information, discussions, decisions, and referrals should be documented clearly in the notes by the clinician providing care.\\n7.2 A detailed birth plan should be made with the pregnant individual following discussion with a consultant midwife and consultant obstetrician. \\n7.3 Pregnant individuals should be recommended to have their labor and birth in an obstetric unit with access to theaters for immediate caesarean section and neonatal support. \\n7.4 Pregnant individuals should be advised to phone the maternity unit immediately if they have spontaneous rupture of membranes or are concerned about fetal movements. \\n7.5 Induction of labor is not recommended for babies in the breech position unless certain criteria are met. \\n8.1 It is recommended to have a multidisciplinary team approach to labor and birth care for planned vaginal breech birth. \\n8.2 Once labor is established, it is recommended to inform the necessary medical professionals and ensure plans of care are made with the mother, midwife, and obstetric team. \\n8.3 All birthing individuals should be offered continuous CTG monitoring in established labor. \\n8.4 Passage of fresh meconium during labor with a breech presentation may not require intervention if the CTG is normal. \\n8.5 Maternal observations should be performed regularly throughout labor. \\n8.6 An intravenous cannula is recommended on admission in labor for individuals with anticipated difficulty with IV access. \\n8.7 Birthing individuals should be encouraged to adopt an upright position and be mobile in labor. \\n8.8 All birthing individuals have the full range of pain relief options available to them. \\n8.9 Birthing individuals should feel calm, in control, and supported during labor and birth. \\n9 Management of undiagnosed breech presentation in labor should depend on various factors and informed consent. \\n10 Progress in labor should be monitored closely, and slow progress in breech labors may require a low threshold for advising LSCS. \\n11 General principles for care during the second stage of labor should include informing the full MDT, preparing for birth, and monitoring descent of the breech. \\n12 Progressive descent of the breech in the second stage of labor is crucial, and interventions may be required if there is poor progress. \\n13 Active second stage and assisted vaginal breech maneuvers may be necessary to expedite breech birth if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or delay in delivery.\\n\\nThe choice of manoeuvres used for delivery of the breech should depend on the experience and preference of the attending doctor or midwife. A semirecumbent or all-fours position may be adopted for delivery based on maternal preference and experience of the attendant. Involuntary pushing should not start until the breech is visible. Cord compression is common once the buttocks have passed the perineum. Traction should never be applied to the breech. Selective episiotomy is recommended. Signs of assistance during delivery include lack of tone or color. Delay with the body of the baby should be managed with gentle pressure on the legs. Delay with the arms may require Lovset's manoeuvre. Delay in delivery of the after-coming head may require the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre. Physiological breech birth is usually performed in the all-fours position. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation. Caesarean section is recommended for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech. Organizational support for vaginal breech delivery should include skills and drills training. All doctors and midwives should attend skills and drills training in vaginal breech birth at least once per year.\\n\\n- If opting for vaginal breech, please be aware that in some circumstances it will not be appropriate and you will be advised to have an emergency caesarean.\\n- Individual risk assessment must be quickly undertaken.\\n- We have discussed the risks of vaginal breech birth and caesarean section.\\n- Caesarean should be recommended for an unplanned vaginal breech presenting in the first stage of labor.\\n- Factors such as fetal hyperextended neck, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of fetal compromise may require a caesarean section.\\n- Maternal factors such as previous LSCS, raised BMI, maternal age >40 years, and other obstetric complications may also require a caesarean section.\",\n    \"Shoulder Dystocia  \\n \\nDefinition: Delivery requiring additional obstetric manoeuvres after gentle downward traction fails.  \\n \\nIdentification of risk factors: Previous shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal BMI > 30, induction of labor, prolonged labor, prolonged second stage, oxytocin augmentation, assisted vaginal delivery.  \\n \\nPrevention: No evidence for early induction or elective caesarean for suspected macrosomia in non-diabetic women.

Effective communication and responsibilities are crucial for management.\\n\\nClear communication between medical staff is vital in managing obstetric hemorrhage. The labor ward coordinator should ensure important information is communicated clearly. In cases of major hemorrhage, the Obstetric Registrar and Anaesthetic Registrar should be contacted for immediate management. For home births, midwives should initiate emergency management and call for urgent transfer if needed. In cases of primary hemorrhage, basic measures should be taken to facilitate resuscitation. For major and massive hemorrhage, specific protocols should be followed, including summoning the correct team and initiating emergency management. Communication with the hematology department and regular monitoring of blood components are essential. In cases of secondary hemorrhage, antibiotics may be indicated, and surgical measures may be necessary if bleeding persists. Postnatal care for women who have had a hemorrhage should include close monitoring and follow-up. Women who decline blood products should be informed of the risks and have a plan in place. Antenatal care should involve developing a care plan with medical staff and religious advisors if needed. Each woman's individual choices regarding interventions should be respected. Regular monitoring of blood levels and iron stores is important throughout pregnancy.\\n\\nAn ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site. There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s Witness, and if any complication is noted during the antenatal period, the Consultant Obstetrician must be informed. A clear individual management plan should be documented in the maternal notes where blood products will be declined. All women who wish not to receive blood products should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist. It is important for experienced staff to provide care during labor and birth. Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered, and an FBC should be performed before discharge home. Accurate documentation is essential, and thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is arrested and coagulopathy is corrected. Debriefing is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team, and a 6-week follow-up appointment should be offered to discuss the events in more detail.

Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.\\n\\nScope: This protocol applies to all seriously ill women and all women found collapsed in the peri-partum period.\\n\\nResponsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.\\n\\nMaternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium: Maternal collapse is a rare but life-threatening event, with a wide-ranging etiology. Prompt and effective resuscitation is crucial for the mother and fetus.\\n\\nImmediate Emergency Resuscitative Management: Call for help, check for signs of life, initiate basic life support, give oxygen, obtain venous access, start fluid resuscitation, and institute advanced life support as needed.\\n\\nProcess for the Use of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS): MEOWS chart should be used for antenatal patients, postnatal women with risk factors or complications, and those who have undergone surgical intervention. Regular observations and documentation are essential.\\n\\nRoles and Responsibilities of Staff Groups: Midwives should escalate to management, provide one-to-one care, and document observations. Obstetricians should be involved in care plans and attend all cases of maternal collapse. Anaesthetists should be notified for severely ill pregnant women and liaise with ITU if necessary. All team members should consider Critical Care Outreach team for support. Fast bleep the Obstetric Registrar for clinical deterioration or loss of consciousness.\\n\\nGuidance for staff on when to involve clinicians from outside the maternity service: Specialist clinicians should be involved for specific medical issues beyond common obstetric complications. Contact them via the hospital switchboard as needed.\\n\\nHaematologist and Microbiologists are key in managing blood disorders and sepsis/infection/antibiotic issues. \\n\\nITU admissions require collaboration between Obstetrician, Anaesthetic Consultant, and ITU Consultant. \\n\\nMajor obstetric haemorrhage is a common cause of maternal collapse, with causes including postpartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and ectopic pregnancy. \\n\\nCardiac disease is a leading cause of maternal death, with various causes including ischaemia and sudden arrhythmic cardiac death. \\n\\nThromboembolism is a common cause of direct maternal death, and appropriate thromboprophylaxis is crucial. \\n\\nAmniotic fluid embolism presents as collapse during labor or birth and requires supportive management. \\n\\nSepsis is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt and appropriate therapy. \\n\\nDrug toxicity should be considered in cases of collapse, with magnesium sulphate and local anaesthetic agents being common culprits. \\n\\nEclampsia and intracranial hemorrhage are important considerations in cases of maternal collapse. \\n\\nAnaphylaxis is a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction that can lead to collapse and requires immediate intervention.\\n\\nThe incidence of severe perioperative obstetric anaphylaxis is between 1 and 3.5 per 100,000, with a mortality rate of approximately 1%. Anaphylaxis is likely when sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms, life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems, and skin and/or mucosal changes are present. Exposure to a known allergen for the woman supports the diagnosis, but many cases occur with no previous history. Mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In cases of anaphylaxis, all potential causative agents should be removed, and the ABCDE approach to assessment and resuscitation followed. The treatment for anaphylaxis is 1:1000 adrenaline 500 micrograms intramuscularly, with adjuvant therapy consisting of chlorphenamine 10mg and hydrocortisone 200 mg. Other causes of collapse in pregnant women include hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. Aortocaval compression can occur from around 20 weeks of gestation onwards, reducing venous return in the supine position. Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the standard ABCDE approach, with some modifications for maternal physiology, in particular relief of aortocaval compression. If there is no response to correctly performed CPR within 4 minutes of maternal collapse, perimortem caesarean section should be considered to assist maternal resuscitation. Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age, and access to emergency care, with survival rates being poorer if the collapse occurs out of hospital. All cases of maternal collapse should generate a clinical incident form and be reviewed through the clinical governance process. All maternity staff should have annual formal multidisciplinary training in ABLS and the management of maternal collapse. Life support training improves resuscitation skills.\\n\\nDebriefing is recommended for the woman, the family, and the staff involved in the event. Maternal collapse can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, postnatal depression, and tocophobia. Debriefing is an important part of holistic maternity care and should be offered by a competent professional to support the ongoing mental health of all concerned. It is recommended to audit the management of maternal collapse and ensure compliance with incident reporting.

Aspirin is not recommended for thromboprophylaxis in obstetric patients, but can be used concurrently with LMWH if both are indicated for separate clinical reasons. Warfarin use in pregnancy is restricted to situations where heparin is unsuitable, such as in women with mechanical heart valves. Women receiving long-term anticoagulation with warfarin can be converted from LMWH postpartum. DOACS should be avoided in pregnant women and breastfeeding is not recommended. Anti-embolism stockings are recommended for hospitalized women with contraindications to LMWH. VTE is a leading cause of maternal death in the UK and should not be delayed in diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of DVT and PE should be promptly investigated and managed. LMWH is the preferred treatment for VTE in pregnancy.

During labor, glycemic targets should be 70 to 125 mg/dL. Factors affecting glycemic management include metabolic demands of labor, food restriction, and dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. Maternal hyperglycemia during labor is linked to fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Glucose monitoring and insulin management should be individualized based on the type of diabetes and glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitoring devices may be used, and protocols for intrapartum intravenous insulin are available. Neonatal hypoglycemia may result from maternal hyperglycemia and requires monitoring and management.\\n\\nPatients on insulin pumps can continue using them during labor and delivery hospitalization. Patients who prefer not to use their pumps should follow the same insulin infusion management as those on multiple daily injections. Hospitals should have policies for patients using their insulin pumps during labor, including moving the infusion site away from the lower abdomen. Before food is restricted, insulin pump users will need prandial insulin coverage. After food is restricted, a constant infusion of dextrose-containing fluids is started for patients with blood glucose ≤ 125 mg/dL. Intrapartum insulin requirements vary for patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients on metformin should hold the medication on admission for delivery.\\n\\nFor scheduled cesarean birth in patients receiving insulin, insulin pump users can continue using their pumps according to hospital policy. Subcutaneous correctional insulin can be used for patients with gestational diabetes during labor. Monitoring glucose levels every hour is recommended for patients on insulin due to the risk of hypoglycemia. Pre- and intraoperative hyperglycemia is treated with insulin. Patients using metformin should hold the medication on the morning of the cesarean. Patients with gestational diabetes managed with nutritional therapy alone are managed similarly to those without diabetes undergoing a scheduled cesarean birth. Induction of labor can be managed similarly to spontaneous labor. Insulin requirements drop immediately after birth for patients with type 1 diabetes, reaching a nadir at approximately 48 hours postpartum. Glycemic monitoring and targets are recommended postpartum. Insulin management is adjusted postpartum based on capillary blood glucose levels.\\n\\nInitial postpartum insulin dosing is typically 30 to 35 percent of antenatal doses. Insulin degludec may be held after delivery to prevent postpartum hypoglycemia. Basal, prandial, and correctional insulin is given via injections or pump. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin regimen is necessary postpartum. Breastfeeding mothers may have lower insulin requirements. Metformin is recommended for type 2 diabetes postpartum. Insulin and metformin are compatible with breastfeeding. Additional therapies for type 2 diabetes postpartum may be limited in breastfeeding patients. Gestational diabetes may not require diabetes medications postpartum. Breastfeeding may prevent type 2 diabetes in mothers with a history of gestational diabetes. Close monitoring of glucose levels postpartum is important. Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is recommended. Target blood glucose levels may vary during labor and postpartum. Insulin may be adjusted based on individual needs postpartum.\\n\\nDuring labor, patients with gestational diabetes can often be managed with subcutaneous correctional insulin. If blood glucose levels are persistently above the goal of 125 mg/dL despite subcutaneous insulin, an insulin infusion can be initiated. Close follow-up for the development of overt diabetes is required.\\n\\n19.4 mmol/L] 8 units\\n351 to 400 mg/dL [19.5 to 22.2 mmol/L] 10 units\\nPreexisting (pregestational) and gestational diabetes: Intrapartum and postpartum glucose management - UpToDate\",\n    \"Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term refers to the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of regular contractions. The key decision in managing term PROM is whether to induce labor or wait for spontaneous labor to begin. Inducing labor reduces the risk of maternal and newborn infection. Oxytocin induction is the preferred approach for patients with no contraindications to labor and vaginal birth. Expectant management may be considered for patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who prefer to wait for labor to begin. Hospitalization is recommended for patients with PROM to reduce the risk of complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used when indicated, but prophylactic antibiotics for PROM at term should be avoided unless certain criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not necessarily preclude expectant management.\\n\\nMajor organizations recommend induction for patients with term PROM. Induction with oxytocin reduces neonatal infection rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term PROM shows no significant reductions in complications. In patients with ruptured membranes and positive GBS culture, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Expectant management should include monitoring for signs of infection and fetal well-being. Indications for delivery in expectant management include specific clinical scenarios. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for patients with negative GBS culture. Patients with unknown GBS status should be managed based on standard risk assessment. Maternal and fetal monitoring should be performed in expectantly managed term PROM.

Treatment options include expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection for heavy menstrual bleeding, and medical therapy with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestin-releasing intrauterine devices. Second-tier treatments include GnRH agonists and antagonists, uterine artery embolization, and tranexamic acid. Patients not desiring fertility can choose from various treatment options based on symptom severity and patient preference.\\n\\nSustained reduction of menstrual bleeding was shown with the treatment for an additional 6 months, with modest side effects. Elagolix alone improved fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding. Relugolix combination therapy was approved for fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding. Linzagolix therapy also showed efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss. GnRH agonists are used for preoperative therapy or transitional therapy for patients in late perimenopause. Uterine artery embolization is a minimally invasive option for managing fibroid symptoms. Less invasive interventional therapies are available for patients who desire uterine preservation. Focused ultrasound surgery is a noninvasive technique for treating fibroids. Endometrial ablation has a limited role in patients with bleeding disorders. Traditional surgery options include hysterectomy and myomectomy.\\n\\nHysterectomy is a common surgical treatment for uterine fibroids, but it is associated with long-term risks. Myomectomy is advised as an alternative for patients who desire to preserve their uterus. Patients with bulk or pain symptoms can consider UAE or GnRH analogs. For patients desiring fertility, hysteroscopic myomectomy is recommended for submucosal fibroids, while myomectomy via laparoscopy or open abdominal incision is suggested for other types of fibroids. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred for patients with specific criteria such as smaller uterine size and fewer fibroids.\\n\\nIn a systematic review of six randomized trials, laparoscopic myomectomy had a longer operative duration but less blood loss compared to open abdominal myomectomy. The overall risk of complications was lower for laparoscopic myomectomy, with similar rates of major complications and recurrent myomas. Laparoscopic approach may result in less severe adhesive disease and higher surgical complication rates in certain populations. Surgical approach does not affect ovarian reserve. Further randomized trials are needed to compare these procedures. Open abdominal myomectomy is recommended for patients with numerous or larger fibroids. Expectant management can be employed for patients with uterine fibroids. Patients with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not desire future fertility can consider hysteroscopic myomectomy or medical therapy as initial treatment options. Second-tier medical treatments for fibroid-associated HMB include GnRH agonists and antagonists. Aromatase inhibitors and androgenic compounds are not recommended for fibroid treatment.\\n\\nInvasive treatment options for uterine fibroids include UAE and myomectomy. Patients who do not desire future fertility may consider hysterectomy. For patients with bulk or pain symptoms, GnRH analogs and UAE are options. Patients desiring pregnancy may opt for myomectomy or hysteroscopic myomectomy. Laparoscopic myomectomy is suggested for technically feasible cases. Myomectomy is preferred over UAE and focused ultrasound surgery for patients desiring pregnancy.\\n\\nAl-Hendy A, Venturella R, Arjona Ferreira JC, et al.

This term requires continued evaluation until a final diagnosis is obtained. Distinguishing between these entities is crucial to prevent severe maternal morbidity and mortality.\\n\\nThe natural history of PUL includes eventual IUP, ectopic pregnancy, or unresolved cases. Patients may present with symptoms of early pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy, or be asymptomatic. The differential diagnosis includes various conditions such as early IUP, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and rare entities.\\n\\nInitial evaluation involves history, physical examination, and transvaginal ultrasound. Further diagnostic workup is needed based on ultrasound findings. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements and TVUS assessment are done for selected patients. hCG rise and ratio are used to predict outcomes, but clinical judgment should always guide decision-making.\\n\\nPatients with Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) may require further evaluation to determine the final diagnosis, such as ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or spontaneous resolution. Management depends on the patient's hemodynamic stability and pregnancy desires. Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate surgical intervention, while stable patients may undergo expectant management with regular hCG and ultrasound assessments. For undesired pregnancies, proactive intervention may be preferred. Special considerations are needed for patients with persistent hCG elevations or nonpregnancy-related causes.\\n\\nCondensed text:\\n\\nGynecol 2025; 232:1.\\n\\n2.

PUL may be asymptomatic or present with vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain. This algorithm does not apply to hemodynamically unstable patients or those with uncommon or rare etiologies including, but not limited to, the following: malignancy (eg, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma), pituitary hCG production, heterophilic antibodies. Patients with PUL and a desired pregnancy are also managed differently.\",\n    \"Pregnancy loss, also known as miscarriage, is defined as a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 20 weeks of gestation. Early pregnancy loss, which occurs in the first trimester, is the most common type. The diagnosis is confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound evaluation. Ultrasound is performed in pregnant individuals with signs of pregnancy loss to confirm intrauterine gestation and exclude ectopic pregnancy. The timing of ultrasound varies, with a pelvic ultrasound recommended at seven weeks of gestation to identify embryonic cardiac activity. Pregnancy loss can be diagnosed with single or serial ultrasound studies, with criteria based on gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity. Different criteria exist for different levels of diagnostic certainty, with considerations for patient preferences and clinical context. The choice of ultrasound criteria depends on the expertise of the sonographer and quality of equipment.\\n\\n- A gestational sac 225 mm in mean diameter without a yolk sac or embryo.\\n- An embryo with a CRL 27 mm without cardiac activity.\\n- Absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 22 weeks from a prior ultrasound showing a gestational sac without a yolk sac.\\n- After a pelvic ultrasound showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac, absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 211 days.\\n- Initial criteria for nonviable early pregnancy include CRL of 5mm without cardiac activity and an empty gestational sac measuring 16 mm in mean diameter.\\n- Scenarios that can make the assessment of early pregnancy more challenging include discrepancy in gestational duration, multiple gestations, and pregnancy of unknown location.\\n- Additional ultrasound findings suggestive of non-viable pregnancy include expanded or empty amnion.\\n- Findings suggestive of poor outcome include irregularly shaped gestational sac, moderate or large subchorionic hematoma, and chorionic bump.\\n- Findings consistent with live pregnancy include a gestational sac with a yolk sac only and a normal pregnancy with amnion.\\n\\n- Guidelines for transvaginal ultrasonographic diagnosis of pregnancy failure in a woman with an intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability\\n- Diagnosis of early pregnancy loss with transvaginal ultrasound\\n- Comparison of ultrasound criteria used to diagnose pregnancy loss\\n\\nProspective study comparing ultrasound techniques for early pregnancy diagnosis.
