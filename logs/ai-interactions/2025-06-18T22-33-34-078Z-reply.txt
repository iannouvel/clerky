Late or unbooked women should be screened promptly. Declining is optional but requires follow-up discussion. - **Sample Handling**: Blood samples must be clearly labeled and documented. Reject inadequate samples and repeat within 10 working days. - **Timely Follow-Up**: Results available within 5 days; requestors must document actions within 10 days. Missing results should be addressed at the next appointment. - **Negative Results**: Do not confer immunity; repeat screening can be requested. - **Positive Results**: Require confirmatory testing, prompt penicillin treatment, and specialist referral (especially for penicillin allergy). Pediatric collaboration is needed for suspected congenital syphilis. - **Documentation & Governance**: Midwives must document delays, ensure results are available at scans, and adhere to auditable standards. Incidents must be reported. - **Training & Resources**: Midwives require training, and patient/NHS information should be accessible. **Goal**: Early detection and treatment to prevent congenital syphilis and adverse outcomes",
