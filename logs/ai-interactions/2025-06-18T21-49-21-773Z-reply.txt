Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact post-birth, and early milk expression if mother-baby separation occurs. Assess feeding within the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for colostrum or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes if supplementation is needed. Avoid teat use to prevent nipple confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, safe preparation instructions, and ready-made formula for medical indications. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleeping practices (cot beside bed, avoid sofa co-sleeping). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive mandatory training. Compliance is audited annually via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Track feeding frequency (8â€“12 times/24 hours), address feeding cues early, and refer complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). Supplement only when medically necessary. Emphasis on individualized care, maintaining breastmilk supply, and respecting parental choices while prioritizing infant health",
