She describes occasional **intermenstrual spotting** and **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, initially with slightly heavier periods.  \n- Over the past 3 months, bleeding has become unpredictable, with cycles ranging from 21 to 45 days.  \n- No recent hormonal contraceptive use.  \n- No recent trauma or significant stress.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Hypertension** (well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg OD)  \n- **Prediabetes** (diet-controlled)  \n- **Obesity (BMI 27.5)**  \n- No history of thromboembolism or liver disease.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Appendectomy** (age 22)  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- **Gravida 1, Para 1** (spontaneous vaginal delivery at age 31)  \n- **Menarche:** Age 12  \n- **Last menstrual period:** 2 weeks ago (prolonged bleeding episode)  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  \n- No cervical screening abnormalities (last smear 2 years ago, normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Lisinopril 10mg OD  \n- No hormonal medications  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic discomfort (no excessive use)  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- **Penicillin** (rash)  \n- No other known allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- **Occupation:** Office administrator (sedentary role)  \n- **Smoking:** Never  \n- **Alcohol:** Occasional (1-2 units/week)  \n- **Exercise:** Minimal due to work demands.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Mother: **Endometrial cancer (diagnosed age 58)**  \n- Father: Type 2 diabetes  \n- No known Lynch syndrome or other hereditary cancers.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried that her symptoms may be due to \"hormonal changes\" or \"something more serious\" given her family history.  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about the possibility of cancer due to her mother’s history.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants a clear explanation of her symptoms and reassurance or further investigations if needed.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or signs of chronic illness.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus slightly bulky, no adnexal tenderness or masses.  \n- **No abnormal vaginal discharge.**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven Ms. Doe’s **age (49), BMI (27.5), irregular heavy bleeding, and family history of endometrial cancer**, she meets criteria for **investigation of possible endometrial hyperplasia** (as per **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include:  \n- **Unopposed oestrogen exposure** (obesity → peripheral aromatisation of androgens)  \n- **Chronic anovulation** (irregular cycles)  \n- **Family history of endometrial cancer.**  \n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**  \n1. **Endometrial hyperplasia (with/without atypia)**  \n2. **Endometrial polyp**  \n3. **Early endometrial cancer** (lower likelihood but must exclude)  \n4. **Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (perimenopausal)**  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS):** To assess endometrial thickness.  \n   - If **≥4mm in a postmenopausal patient** (though she is perimenopausal), further investigation is warranted.  \n2. **Endometrial Biopsy (Pipelle or hysteroscopy-guided):** Gold standard for diagnosing hyperplasia/cancer.  \n3. **If hyperplasia confirmed:**  \n   - **Non-atypical:** Consider **progestogen therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUS or oral progestins).  \n   - **Atypical:** Refer to gynaecology oncology for possible hysterectomy (given age and family history).  \n4. **Lifestyle Advice:**  \n   - Weight loss (even 5-10% reduction can lower risk).  \n   - Encourage regular exercise to improve insulin sensitivity.  \n5. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Review biopsy results within 2 weeks.  \n   - Discuss long-term surveillance if hyperplasia confirmed.  \n\n**Patient Reassurance & Counselling:**  \n- Explained that while her symptoms are concerning, **most cases of endometrial hyperplasia are treatable**.  \n- Emphasised the importance of biopsy for accurate diagnosis.  \n- Addressed anxiety regarding cancer risk with a balanced discussion of next steps.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Scheduled for **TVUS and endometrial biopsy** next week.  \n- Advised to present to ED if any acute severe bleeding or pain.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n---  \n**Note:** This is a **fictional case** for testing purposes only.
