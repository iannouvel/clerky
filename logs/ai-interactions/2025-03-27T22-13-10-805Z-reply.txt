**Fictional Clinical Dictation – Obstetric/Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. X (fictional)  
- Age: 32 years  
- Weight: 115 kg  
- Height: 1.68 m  
- BMI: 41 (Class III obesity)  
- Occupation: Office administrator  
- Parity: G5 P3 (3 live births, 1 miscarriage, 1 termination of pregnancy)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. X presents with a 6-week history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding associated with pelvic pain. She also reports a 3-month history of worsening fatigue and occasional dizziness.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Menstrual bleeding: Previously regular cycles (28–30 days), now prolonged (10–14 days) with flooding and clots.  
- Pain: Dull, central pelvic pain, worse during menstruation, occasionally radiating to the lower back.  
- Fatigue: Persistent despite adequate sleep, impacting work performance.  
- No post-coital bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding.  
- No urinary or bowel symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 4 years ago, on metformin)  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril)  
- Iron deficiency anaemia (treated intermittently with oral iron)  
- Previous gestational diabetes (last pregnancy)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x2 (last in 2018)  
- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (2015, benign cyst)  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche: Age 12  
- LMP: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting)  
- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception due to previous side effects)  
- Last cervical smear: 2 years ago (normal)  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1g BD  
- Lisinopril 10mg OD  
- Ferrous sulfate PRN (non-compliant due to GI upset)  

**Allergies:**  
- Penicillin (rash)  

**Social History:**  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history)  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  
- No recreational drug use  
- Lives with partner and 3 children  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that bleeding may be due to "fibroids or something worse."  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery, given her weight and diabetes.  
- **Expectations:** Wants to explore medical and non-surgical options first.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Pale conjunctiva, obese (BMI 41), no signs of hyperandrogenism.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding.  
- Bimanual exam: Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. Full blood count (suspected anaemia)  
2. Transvaginal ultrasound (assess endometrial thickness, fibroids, polyps)  
3. HbA1c (diabetes control)  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Anaemia:**  
   - High-dose IV iron infusion (given poor oral tolerance and symptomatic anaemia).  
   - Monitor Hb post-infusion.  
2. **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding:**  
   - Trial of tranexamic acid during menses.  
   - Consider Mirena IUD if endometrial biopsy is normal.  
3. **Pelvic Pain/Ultrasound Findings:**  
   - If fibroids confirmed, discuss uterine artery embolisation vs. myomectomy.  
   - If endometrial pathology suspected, arrange hysteroscopy + biopsy.  
4. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Weight loss support (referral to dietitian, bariatric team).  
   - Smoking cessation counselling.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review in 2 weeks with investigation results.  
- Counsel on risks of future pregnancy (given obesity, diabetes, and previous CS).

**Second Scenario – Complex Obstetric Issue**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. Y (fictional)  
- Age: 32 years  
- Weight: 115 kg  
- BMI: 41  
- Parity: G5 P3 (3 live births, 1 ectopic pregnancy, 1 miscarriage)  
- Current pregnancy: 18 weeks, IVF conception (donor sperm)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Worsening lower abdominal pain and spotting for 2 days.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Pain: Constant, right-sided, sharp, rated 7/10.  
- Spotting: Dark red, minimal volume.  
- No fever, vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  
- Reduced fetal movements (subjectively, but no formal kick counts).  

**Past Obstetric History:**  
- Previous preterm birth at 32 weeks (2019, neonatal ICU admission).  
- Placenta praevia (resolved by delivery) in last pregnancy.  
- History of cervical incompetence (required cerclage in 2nd pregnancy).  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Abdomen: Fundal height 18 cm, tender right lower quadrant.  
- Speculum: Closed cervix, minimal old blood.  
- Transabdominal ultrasound: Viable fetus, low-lying placenta (no previa), right adnexal cyst (5 cm, likely corpus luteum).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Exclude Placental Abruption/Preterm Labour:**  
   - Monitor contractions, serial observations.  
   - Bedside fibronectin test if concerning for preterm labour.  
2. **Adnexal Mass:**  
   - MRI to characterise cyst (concern for torsion/haemorrhage).  
   - Surgical review if pain worsens.  
3. **Placental Surveillance:**  
   - Repeat growth scan at 28 weeks (high-risk for FGR).  
   - Low-dose aspirin continued (started at 12 weeks for preeclampsia prophylaxis).  
4. **Patient Advice:**  
   - Pelvic rest, avoid heavy lifting.  
   - Present immediately if bleeding increases or pain worsens.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Multidisciplinary team planning (obstetrics, anaesthetics, neonatology).  
- Growth scan in 4 weeks.
