      "newValue": "**Summary of Antenatal Care Guidelines:** - **Antenatal care** spans from conception to birth, provided locally by midwives, with individualized care plans. - **Booking appointment** includes risk assessment, health promotion, and consent for screenings (e.g., Chlamydia/Gonorrhea for â‰¤24-year-olds, blood/urine tests). Declined tests must be documented. - **Consultant review** is advised for pre-existing medical conditions. - **Screening and consent** for blood products, fetal screenings, and documentation of results are essential. - **Urinalysis** at each visit checks for proteinuria/UTIs; recurrent UTIs warrant obstetric review. - **Risk-based care**: Consultant-led care for high-risk pregnancies, with specialist referrals as needed. - **Safeguarding**: Address mental health, domestic abuse, FGM, and vulnerabilities appropriately. - **Lifestyle advice**: Smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and weight management (BMI <30). - **Fetal monitoring**: Growth scans for at-risk pregnancies to reduce stillbirth risk. - **Symptom management**: Address nausea, pelvic pain, bleeding (refer to EPAC if <16 weeks, labour ward if >16 weeks). - **Equity**: Additional support for ethnic minorities, deprived areas, and migrants, with language assistance as needed. - **Continuity of care**: Maintain consistent care providers and clear communication for complex cases. *References: MBRRACE-UK 2023, UK NSC guidelines.*",
