There are clinical and \neconomic benefits associated with this type of service. \n \n1.2 OPH is provided at the current set up on Horsted Keynes ward where the facility is \nequipped for OPH and Colposcopy. \n \n1.3 Currently, there are two consultants providing the service, Mr Greg Kalu and Mr \nEhab Kelada. There are at least two nurses trained to provide the service with the \ntwo consultants. \n \n1.4 Written patient information should be provided before the appointment and \nconsent for the procedure should be taken. \n \n2.0 Referral Criteria: \n \n2.1 Abnormal uterine bleeding lasting longer than three months in women over 40 years \nof age if a consultant gynaecologist feels that there will be a benefit from assessing \nthe endometrial cavity with a view to further treatment including insertion of Mirena \nor endometrial ablation. \n \n2.2 Endometrial pathology identified on USS (polyps <2cm, fibroids <2cm). \n \n2.3 Abnormal uterine bleeding on Tamoxifen. \n \n2.4 Irregular or heavy uterine bleeding at less than 40 years of age with failed medical \ntreatment for more than 3 months. \n \n2.5 Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) when there is a reason to assess the endometrial \ncavity using hysteroscopy rather than transvaginal scan (TVS) and Pipelle \nendometrial biopsy. \n \n2.6 Fertility patients if it is considered necessary to exclude a structural uterine \nabnormality including intrauterine synechiae. \n \n2.7 Patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. \n \n3.0 Suitable Patients: \n \n3.1 Potentially all women should be suitable for outpatient hysteroscopy provided the \nfollowing criteria are met: \n3.1.1 She accepts the concept of outpatient hysteroscopy. \n3.1.2 She is able to tolerate a speculum examination. \n\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \nPage 6 of 10 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \n3.1.3 The external cervical os is visible and the cervix is not flush with the vaginal \nvault. \n3.1.4 Patients for whom a general anaesthetic carries a substantial risk of adverse \nconsequences. \n4.0 Unsuitable Patients: \n \n4.1 Patients who are unsuitable for OPH are: \n4.1.1 Women who are not happy with the idea of having an outpatient procedure \nafter appropriate counselling. \n4.1.2 Women who cannot tolerate a speculum or pelvic examination. \n4.1.3 History of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). \n4.1.4 Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. \n4.1.5 Presence of other pelvic pathology when it would be more appropriate to \nundertake hysteroscopy at the time of laparoscopy under GA. \n5.0 GOPD Referrals: \n \nReferral from GOPD must be with consultant approval. \nThe usual TCI card should be completed and the option of OPH highlighted. Patients \nshould be informed that the procedure will be done at PRH, Haywards Heath. \n6.0 GP and BICS Referrals: \n \n Direct referrals from GPs or GPwSI at BICS will be accepted following triage \n by GK or EK. \n7.0 USS Protocol: \n \n7.1 USS results will be used when available to triage patients for DSU hysteroscopy, \nPipelle Biopsy or no further investigation. \n \n7.2 TV USS is associated with improved identification of endometrial disease compared \nwith hysteroscopy alone (1). Therefore all patients attending OPH should be \nconsidered for TV USS before booking them to clinic. \n \n8.0 Analgesia \nAdequate analgesia will be given to the woman throughout the procedure (see \nAppendix B) \n\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \nPage 7 of 10 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \n \n9.0 OPH Clinic Appointments and Follow-Up: \n \n9.1 Each diagnostic OPH is allocated 30 minute slot including insertion of Mirena coil if \n indicated. \n9.2 Each operative OPH for endometrial polypectomy or Novasure endometrial ablation \n is allocated a 45 minutes slot. \n9.3 Only 19% of OPH patients require follow-up (1). Most patients should be discharged \n and sent back to the GP with a clear further management plan documented in the \n letter sent to GP. \n9.4 GOPD follow-up should occur in a minority of patients and even fewer should return \n for OPH follow up. \n9.5 Any plan for follow-up at GOPD or OPH clinic should be documented in patient’s \n notes and letter sent to GP with the indication clearly stated. \n9.6 Indications for GOPD follow up: \n9.6.1 Suspicious findings at OPH. \n9.6.2 Complications occurring at OPH. \n9.6.3 When endometrial cancer is diagnosed, patients should be advised that \nthey may need an MRI scan and should be referred to a Gynaecological \noncologist who will liaise with the MDT. \n \n10.0 Communication and Results to the Referring Consultant and GP: \n \n10.1 A letter should be sent to the referring consultant and GP after every OPH. \n \n10.2 The histology report should be sent to the patient’s GP as soon as it is available. \n \n10.3 All histology reports showing cancer are usually automatically referred to the MDT \n by the pathologist. The hysteroscopist should confirm that this has been done and \n also inform the referring consultant as soon as is practicable. \n11.0 References: \n \n1 National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health.

There are clinical and \\neconomic benefits associated with this type of service. \\n \\n1.2 OPH is provided at the current set up on Horsted Keynes ward where the facility is \\nequipped for OPH and Colposcopy. \\n \\n1.3 Currently, there are two consultants providing the service, Mr Greg Kalu and Mr \\nEhab Kelada. There are at least two nurses trained to provide the service with the \\ntwo consultants. \\n \\n1.4 Written patient information should be provided before the appointment and \\nconsent for the procedure should be taken. \\n \\n2.0 Referral Criteria: \\n \\n2.1 Abnormal uterine bleeding lasting longer than three months in women over 40 years \\nof age if a consultant gynaecologist feels that there will be a benefit from assessing \\nthe endometrial cavity with a view to further treatment including insertion of Mirena \\nor endometrial ablation. \\n \\n2.2 Endometrial pathology identified on USS (polyps <2cm, fibroids <2cm). \\n \\n2.3 Abnormal uterine bleeding on Tamoxifen. \\n \\n2.4 Irregular or heavy uterine bleeding at less than 40 years of age with failed medical \\ntreatment for more than 3 months. \\n \\n2.5 Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) when there is a reason to assess the endometrial \\ncavity using hysteroscopy rather than transvaginal scan (TVS) and Pipelle \\nendometrial biopsy. \\n \\n2.6 Fertility patients if it is considered necessary to exclude a structural uterine \\nabnormality including intrauterine synechiae. \\n \\n2.7 Patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. \\n \\n3.0 Suitable Patients: \\n \\n3.1 Potentially all women should be suitable for outpatient hysteroscopy provided the \\nfollowing criteria are met: \\n3.1.1 She accepts the concept of outpatient hysteroscopy. \\n3.1.2 She is able to tolerate a speculum examination. \\n\\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \\nPage 6 of 10 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \\n3.1.3 The external cervical os is visible and the cervix is not flush with the vaginal \\nvault. \\n3.1.4 Patients for whom a general anaesthetic carries a substantial risk of adverse \\nconsequences. \\n4.0 Unsuitable Patients: \\n \\n4.1 Patients who are unsuitable for OPH are: \\n4.1.1 Women who are not happy with the idea of having an outpatient procedure \\nafter appropriate counselling. \\n4.1.2 Women who cannot tolerate a speculum or pelvic examination. \\n4.1.3 History of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). \\n4.1.4 Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. \\n4.1.5 Presence of other pelvic pathology when it would be more appropriate to \\nundertake hysteroscopy at the time of laparoscopy under GA. \\n5.0 GOPD Referrals: \\n \\nReferral from GOPD must be with consultant approval. \\nThe usual TCI card should be completed and the option of OPH highlighted. Patients \\nshould be informed that the procedure will be done at PRH, Haywards Heath. \\n6.0 GP and BICS Referrals: \\n \\n Direct referrals from GPs or GPwSI at BICS will be accepted following triage \\n by GK or EK. \\n7.0 USS Protocol: \\n \\n7.1 USS results will be used when available to triage patients for DSU hysteroscopy, \\nPipelle Biopsy or no further investigation. \\n \\n7.2 TV USS is associated with improved identification of endometrial disease compared \\nwith hysteroscopy alone (1). Therefore all patients attending OPH should be \\nconsidered for TV USS before booking them to clinic. \\n \\n8.0 Analgesia \\nAdequate analgesia will be given to the woman throughout the procedure (see \\nAppendix B) \\n\\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \\nPage 7 of 10 \\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \\n \\n9.0 OPH Clinic Appointments and Follow-Up: \\n \\n9.1 Each diagnostic OPH is allocated 30 minute slot including insertion of Mirena coil if \\n indicated. \\n9.2 Each operative OPH for endometrial polypectomy or Novasure endometrial ablation \\n is allocated a 45 minutes slot. \\n9.3 Only 19% of OPH patients require follow-up (1). Most patients should be discharged \\n and sent back to the GP with a clear further management plan documented in the \\n letter sent to GP. \\n9.4 GOPD follow-up should occur in a minority of patients and even fewer should return \\n for OPH follow up. \\n9.5 Any plan for follow-up at GOPD or OPH clinic should be documented in patient’s \\n notes and letter sent to GP with the indication clearly stated. \\n9.6 Indications for GOPD follow up: \\n9.6.1 Suspicious findings at OPH. \\n9.6.2 Complications occurring at OPH. \\n9.6.3 When endometrial cancer is diagnosed, patients should be advised that \\nthey may need an MRI scan and should be referred to a Gynaecological \\noncologist who will liaise with the MDT. \\n \\n10.0 Communication and Results to the Referring Consultant and GP: \\n \\n10.1 A letter should be sent to the referring consultant and GP after every OPH. \\n \\n10.2 The histology report should be sent to the patient’s GP as soon as it is available. \\n \\n10.3 All histology reports showing cancer are usually automatically referred to the MDT \\n by the pathologist. The hysteroscopist should confirm that this has been done and \\n also inform the referring consultant as soon as is practicable. \\n11.0 References: \\n \\n1 National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health.
