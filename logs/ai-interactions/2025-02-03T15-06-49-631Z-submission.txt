Please determine the significant issues within the attached text related to a clinical encounter.
The text is below
Please return the issues as a list:

Rules:
One line per issue
Merge similar issues into one single issue
Each issue should be essentially a subject-heading for an aspect of the clinical encounter, so if the patient's only issue is post-menopausal bleeding, the only issue listed should be 'post-menopausal bleeding', not 'vaginal bleeding', 'menopausal', 'need for transvaginal ultrasound', 'need for endometrial sampling'.
Maximum 50 characters per issue
Express each issue in medical vernacular ie use 'obesity' rather than 'overweight'
Avoid generic issues like 'Pregnancy Risks'
If one issue line is related to symptoms, and another line is related to testing or management, merge these issues into a single issue, ie 'symptoms of anaemia' and 'iron level testing' are essentially both related to anaemia, so the issue should be 'Anaemia'.
If necessary and appropriate, offer context, ie 'Morbid obesity: BMI 44'

Below is the text related to the encounter:

[The scene opens in a gynecologist's office, where Dr. Smith is sitting across from a patient, Sarah, who is visibly concerned.]

Dr. Smith: Good morning, Sarah. How are you feeling today?

Sarah: Hi, Dr. Smith. I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately, and I'm a bit worried.

Dr. Smith: I understand, Sarah. Let's start by discussing your symptoms. What have you been experiencing?

Sarah: Well, I've been having irregular vaginal bleeding, severe pelvic pain, and I've also noticed some itching in that area.

Dr. Smith: I see. Those are concerning symptoms. Let's start by checking your vital signs and performing a physical examination.

[Dr. Smith checks Sarah's vital signs and performs a pelvic examination, noting tenderness and abnormal discharge.]

Dr. Smith: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I suspect we may need to consider a few different possibilities. Given your symptoms of irregular bleeding and pelvic pain, we should investigate the possibility of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, as well as ectopic pregnancy and endometrial issues.

Sarah: What do those conditions entail, and how are they diagnosed and managed?

Dr. Smith: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver condition that can cause itching, elevated bile acids, and complications for both you and the baby. We would need to perform blood tests to check your bile acid levels and consider early delivery if necessary. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tube, and requires prompt diagnosis and management to prevent complications. Endometrial issues, such as thickening or hyperplasia, can also cause abnormal bleeding and may require further investigation.

Sarah: That sounds quite serious. What are the next steps in terms of testing and treatment?

Dr. Smith: We will need to perform a transvaginal ultrasound to assess the uterus and adnexa for any abnormalities, as well as blood tests to check your hormone levels and liver function. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further imaging or procedures to confirm a diagnosis and determine the best course of action.

Sarah: Thank you for explaining everything, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your thoroughness in investigating my symptoms.

Dr. Smith: Of course, Sarah. Your health and well-being are my top priorities. Let's proceed with the necessary tests and work together to address any issues that may arise. I will also consult the relevant guidelines to ensure we are following the best practices for your care.

[The consultation continues with further discussions on testing, treatment options, and follow-up plans, incorporating references to the guidelines on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and endometrial issues.]
