**Summary:**  
- 19-year-old female, BMI 25 kg/m².  
- Gravida 4, para 3 (all live births).  
- Presenting with menorrhagia (8–10 days/cycle, >6 pads/day) and recurrent pelvic pain (worsened over 3 months).  
- Associated dyspareunia and concerns about irregular cycles (25–40 days, LMP 5 weeks ago).  
- No intermenstrual/postcoital bleeding, fever, urinary, or bowel symptoms.  
- Mild cervical motion tenderness on exam; uterus slightly enlarged.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day.  

**Details:**  
- Heavy menstrual bleeding is prolonged (8–10 days) with significant pad use (>6/day), suggestive of menorrhagia.  
- Pelvic pain is cyclical (worse during menses) and associated with dyspareunia, raising concern for adenomyosis or endometriosis.  
- Cervical motion tenderness, though absent fever/discharge, prompts consideration of PID.  
- Irregular cycles (25–40 days) and recent LMP 5 weeks ago warrant pregnancy complication exclusion.  
- Advised pelvic ultrasound for structural evaluation (fibroids/adenomyosis), STI screen (chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR), and FBC for anaemia.  
- NSAIDs (mefenamic acid) recommended for pain; combined oral contraceptive pill considered post-STI screen for cycle regulation.  
- Smoking cessation counselling emphasised due to cardiovascular risks with hormonal contraception.  

**Plan:**  
1. Pelvic ultrasound to assess uterine structure (e.g., fibroids, adenomyosis).  
2. STI screen (chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR) and FBC.  
3. Regular NSAIDs (mefenamic acid) for menstrual pain.  
4. Consider combined oral contraceptive pill post-STI screen.  
5. Smoking cessation counselling.  
6. Review in 4 weeks with results; empirical antibiotics if PID confirmed.  
7. Urgent return if fever, severe pain, or worsening bleeding.  
8. Discuss LARC/preconception counselling per patient’s goals.
