High-risk groups include minority ethnic backgrounds and deprived areas. **Key Recommendations:** - **Diagnosis:** Maintain high suspicion; symptoms (e.g., fever, rigors, abdominal pain) may be non-specific. Use translator services for language barriers. - **Risk Factors:** Obesity, diabetes, prolonged SROM, cesarean delivery, retained products, or Group B streptococcal infection. - **Management:** - **High-risk sepsis:** Immediate oxygen, IV antibiotics/fluids, blood cultures, lactate monitoring, and critical care referral if hypotension or elevated lactate persists. - **Moderate-risk sepsis:** Hourly assessments, senior review within 3 hours, and antibiotics if criteria met. - **Influenza:** Pregnant individuals are high-risk; treat respiratory symptoms promptly with antivirals. - **Neonatal Care:** Refer babies with jaundice or feeding concerns. **Tools:** Use MEOWS for early warning scores and involve multidisciplinary teams. Ensure equitable care and timely expert consultation. *Sources: Sepsis-3 (2016), Surviving Sepsis Campaign (2012), UK Sepsis Trust, WHO.*",
