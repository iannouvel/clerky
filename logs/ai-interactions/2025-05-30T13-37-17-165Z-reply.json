She reports episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with associated fatigue. She denies intermenstrual spotting but admits to occasional cramping. No history of post-coital bleeding. She has not been sexually active in the past year.  Relevant Medical History:No known bleeding disorders or thyroid dysfunction.No prior gynecological procedures (e.g., hysteroscopy, D&amp;C).No history of fibroids or endometriosis.No chronic medical conditions.  Medications &amp; Allergies:Occasional ibuprofen for cramps (no regular medications).No known drug allergies.  Social History:Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units&#x2F;week).Works as a teacher; moderate stress levels reported.  Examination Findings:  \nGeneral appearance: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia).  \nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \nSpeculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \nBimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness.  Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):No documented assessment of iron studies or hemoglobin.No inquiry about family history of gynecological malignancies.No discussion of prior Pap smear history or HPV vaccination status.Pelvic ultrasound not yet performed.  Impression:Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  Management Plan:\n\n\nInvestigations:Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.(No endometrial biopsy arranged at this stage.)  2. Symptomatic Relief:Trial of tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding.Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  3. Follow-Up:Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.If bleeding worsens or anemia confirmed, escalate to gynecology referral.  Counseling Provided:Reassured that AUB is common but requires evaluation.Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and report syncope or severe fatigue.
