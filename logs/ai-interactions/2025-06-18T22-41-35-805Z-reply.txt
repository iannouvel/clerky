      "newValue": "**Summary of Preterm Labour Guidelines:** - **Definition:** Regular, painful uterine contractions with cervical change before 37 weeks indicate threatened preterm labour. Prompt referral for assessment is essential. - **Diagnostics:** Fetal fibronectin testing (22+0–34+6 weeks) and ultrasound for fetal growth assessment are recommended. Monitor MSU/HVS, blood tests, and sensitivities. - **Interventions:** - **Corticosteroids (23–34+6 weeks):** Reduce neonatal respiratory distress. - **Tocolytics:** May delay delivery in preterm rupture of membranes. - **Magnesium sulfate:** Consider for fetal neuroprotection in early preterm birth. - **Delivery:** Mode should be consultant-led; avoid routine caesarean for preterm breech. Neonatal support is critical; avoid opiates in labour. - **Additional Considerations:** Address preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, Group B Strep prevention, and extreme preterm birth (<27 weeks). Parental guidance for very premature births is provided. (Word count: 150)",
