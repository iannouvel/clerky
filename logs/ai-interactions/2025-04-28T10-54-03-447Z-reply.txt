A: ### Summary:  
- 18-year-old primigravida at 39 weeks gestation.  
- BMI: 18.7.  
- Presenting with spontaneous labor onset, contractions every 3 minutes, ruptured membranes 2 hours prior.  
- Reports decreased fetal movement in the last hour.  
- FHR tracing shows recurrent late decelerations with minimal variability.  

### Details:  
- Patient is a primigravida with no prior live births, presenting in active labor at 5 cm dilation.  
- FHR baseline is 150 bpm with recurrent late decelerations and minimal variability, raising concern for uteroplacental insufficiency or cord compression.  
- No documentation of prenatal care, amniotic fluid characteristics, or confirmation of fetal presentation via Leopold’s maneuvers.  
- Maternal vitals are stable (BP 120/78, HR 88, Temp 37.1°C).  
- Immediate interventions include maternal repositioning, IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, and discontinuation of oxytocin (if applicable).  
- Patient counseled on potential need for expedited delivery if FHR does not improve.  

### Plan:  
1. Maternal repositioning (left lateral tilt).  
2. IV fluid bolus (500 mL normal saline).  
3. Supplemental O2 via non-rebreather mask at 10 L/min.  
4. Discontinue oxytocin if infusing.  
5. Continuous FHR monitoring; consider fetal scalp electrode if tracing remains indeterminate.  
6. Repeat cervical exam in 1 hour.  
7. Notify obstetric team for potential expedited delivery if no improvement.  
8. Anesthesia consult for epidural or surgical prep.  
9. Reassess FHR tracing post-interventions.  
10. Document decision-to-delivery interval if intervention required.
