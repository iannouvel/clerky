A: **Clinical Dictation: Fictional Patient Encounter – Placental Insufficiency**  

**Date:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. A. Smith, OB/GYN  
**Patient:** Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  
**Age:** 32 years  
**Gestational Age:** 28 weeks  
**Weight:** 68 kg  
**Last Menstrual Period:** [Fictional Date]  
**Chief Complaint:** Decreased fetal movements over the past 48 hours  

### **History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Doe is a 32-year-old G2P1 at 28 weeks gestation who reports a noticeable reduction in fetal movements over the last two days. She describes her baby as typically active, with regular movements felt daily, but now perceives only 2-3 faint movements in a 12-hour period. No associated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage. She denies recent trauma, illness, or fever.  

**Past Obstetric History:**  
- Previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 39 weeks (male infant, 3.4 kg).  
- No history of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or prior fetal growth restriction.  

**Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Mild asthma (well-controlled, uses salbutamol PRN).  
- No known hypertension, diabetes, or thrombophilia.  
- No prior surgeries.  

**Medications:**  
- Prenatal vitamins  
- Occasional salbutamol inhaler  

**Allergies:** NKDA  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use.  
- Works as a teacher, moderate physical activity.  

*(Note: Incomplete history—did not inquire about family history of clotting disorders, prior stillbirth, or detailed dietary habits.)*  

### **Examination Findings:**  
**Vitals:**  
- BP: 118/72 mmHg  
- HR: 82 bpm  
- Temp: 36.8°C  
- RR: 16/min  

**Abdomen:**  
- Fundal height: 26 cm (slightly small for dates)  
- Leopold’s maneuvers: Fetus in cephalic presentation  
- Fetal heart rate: 142 bpm (Doppler)  
- No uterine tenderness or palpable contractions  

*(Note: Incomplete exam—no documentation of maternal weight trend, no urinalysis performed, no assessment for edema.)*  

### **Assessment:**  
**Concern for possible placental insufficiency** given:  
- Decreased fetal movements (potential marker of fetal compromise).  
- Fundal height lagging by 2 cm (possible early growth restriction).  
- No other clear etiology identified at this time.  

### **Plan:**  
1. **Immediate Fetal Monitoring:**  
   - Arrange for a **non-stress test (NST) and biophysical profile (BPP)** to assess fetal well-being.  
   - If abnormal, consider urgent ultrasound for Doppler studies (umbilical artery resistance).  

2. **Maternal Surveillance:**  
   - Monitor BP trends for signs of preeclampsia (though currently normotensive).  
   - Consider baseline labs (CBC, renal function, coagulation screen) if high suspicion.  

3. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Advised to perform **daily fetal kick counts** and present immediately if <6 movements in 2 hours.  
   - Low threshold for re-evaluation if symptoms worsen.  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Repeat growth scan in 2 weeks to assess interval fetal growth.  
   - If placental insufficiency confirmed, may need increased surveillance or early delivery depending on severity.  

*(Note: Incomplete guidance—did not discuss potential need for steroids if delivery before 34 weeks is considered, or aspirin prophylaxis if undiagnosed risk factors exist.)*  

**Next Steps:**  
- Patient to return in 1 week for repeat assessment or sooner if concerns arise.  
- Dictated by: Dr. A. Smith (for fictional testing purposes only).
