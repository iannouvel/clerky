It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing prevention, monitoring, and timely intervention. Key recommendations include: - **Prevention:** Anticipate hypothermia in at-risk infants, maintain a warm environment, and promote skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth to stabilize temperature and heart rate. - **Initial Care:** Dry the newborn, encourage skin-to-skin contact, and initiate feeding. - **Management of Hypothermia:** Use skin-to-skin contact, continuous monitoring, and a hot cot (pre-warmed, with gradual temperature reduction). - **Ongoing Care:** Discontinue monitoring once temperature stabilizes, prioritizing feeding. - **Parental Communication:** Explain procedures and monitoring to parents. - **Audit:** Compliance and outcomes are tracked via the Maternity Audit Document. Staff must follow these measures while applying professional judgment",
