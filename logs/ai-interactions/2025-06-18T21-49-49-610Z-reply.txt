      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Operators should select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum is linked to neonatal cephalohematoma and retinal hemorrhage but not cesarean birth or low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Ultrasound assessment is recommended if fetal head position is uncertain. - **Post-birth care**: Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document and discuss postnatal plans. - **Psychological support**: Offer referral to a midwife counselor for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events and adhere to duty of candour. - **Audit & reporting**: Complete incident reports as needed and monitor compliance with RCOG standards",
