    "prompt": "Please determine the significant clinical issues within this clinical scenario. Format each issue as a brief, clear statement followed by key relevant data.\n\nRules:\n- List 3-5 major issues\n- Each issue should be a single line\n- Format as 'Issue: Key Data'\n- Be extremely concise\n\nExamples:\n'Morbid Obesity: BMI 46'\n'Previous Caesarean: Emergency LSCS 2021'\n'Gestational Diabetes: On metformin'\n\nDo not include management plans or implications.\nDo not include multiple issues in one line.\nDo not write long explanatory text.\n\nClinical scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\nClinician: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately, and I'm a bit concerned.\n\nClinician: I understand. Let's start by discussing your symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been having persistent pelvic pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, and some discomfort during intercourse.\n\nClinician: I see. Those are indeed concerning symptoms. Let's delve deeper into each one. The pelvic pain you're experiencing could be related to various factors, including chronic pelvic pain as outlined in the guideline on the initial management of chronic pelvic pain. We may need to consider diagnostic criteria for conditions like endometriosis, which is covered in the NICE guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management.\n\nPatient: Endometriosis? Is that a serious condition?\n\nClinician: Endometriosis is a chronic condition that can cause pelvic pain and affect fertility. It's essential to diagnose and manage it appropriately. We'll also need to consider the possibility of an ovarian mass, as outlined in the joint RCOG and BSGE guideline on suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women.\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. What about the irregular vaginal bleeding and discomfort during intercourse?\n\nClinician: The irregular vaginal bleeding could be due to various causes, including endometrial thickening, which is discussed in the SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 451. We may need to investigate further to rule out any underlying issues. The discomfort during intercourse could also be related to these factors, and we'll need to address them comprehensively.\n\nPatient: I appreciate your thorough approach, doctor. What are the next steps?\n\nClinician: I recommend we start with a pelvic examination to assess for any abnormalities. We may also need to perform a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate your pelvic organs, as recommended in the guideline on the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy. Additionally, we'll consider blood tests to check for any hormonal imbalances or other relevant markers.\n\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I feel reassured that we're taking a comprehensive approach to investigate my symptoms.\n\nClinician: You're welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Your health and well-being are our top priorities, and we'll work together to address any concerns you may have. Let's proceed with the examinations and tests to gather more information for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
