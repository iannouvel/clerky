Reassess continuously. Increase oxygen if saturations remain low despite effective ventilation. - **Homebirths:** Midwives must be competent in first-line resuscitation; call 999 if the baby is in poor condition. - **Meconium-Stained Liquor:** No suction for vigorous babies. For non-vigorous babies, dry, assess, and avoid tracheal lavage. - **Preterm Babies (<32 weeks):** Use blended oxygen/air; <30 weeks should be wrapped in plastic immediately. - **Post-Resuscitation:** Document procedures, maintain warmth, label baby. Consider therapeutic hypothermia for moderate/severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (no passive cooling). - **Training:** Staff must attend annual updates/NLS courses; participation in skills drills is logged.
