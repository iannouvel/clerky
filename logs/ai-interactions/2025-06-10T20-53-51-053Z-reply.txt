  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\n**Fictional Clinical Dictation – Placenta Previa (For Testing Purposes Only)**  \n\n**Patient Name:** Jane Doe  \n**Age:** 32 years  \n**Gestational Age:** 28 weeks  \n**Weight:** 68 kg  \n**Date of Encounter:** [Fictional Date]  \n**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  \n\n### **History of Present Illness:**  \nMs. Doe presents today for a routine prenatal visit. She reports intermittent, painless vaginal bleeding over the past week, described as bright red and light in volume. She denies associated contractions, fever, or trauma. She has no history of bleeding earlier in this pregnancy. She reports normal fetal movements.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- G2P1 (previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term)  \n- No prior cesarean sections or uterine surgeries  \n- No known history of placenta previa or other placental abnormalities  \n\n**Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- No significant medical conditions  \n- No prior surgeries  \n- No known bleeding disorders  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- No anticoagulants or other medications  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Occasional alcohol use prior to pregnancy (none since conception)  \n- Works as a teacher; no heavy lifting or strenuous activity  \n\n*(Incomplete: Family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications not elicited. Sexual activity and recent intercourse not discussed.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/72 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- Temp: 98.4°F  \n- RR: 16  \n\n**Abdomen:**  \n- Soft, non-tender  \n- Fundal height consistent with dates  \n- No palpable contractions  \n\n**Speculum Exam (Deferred Today):**  \n- Patient declined speculum exam due to discomfort; no active bleeding noted externally  \n\n**Fetal Assessment:**  \n- FHR: 142 bpm (Doppler)  \n- Normal movement reported  \n\n*(Incomplete: No documentation of cervical exam or ultrasound confirmation of placental location at this visit.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \nSuspected **placenta previa** given history of painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. Differential includes marginal bleed, cervical irritation, or other causes.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Management:**  \n   - Advised pelvic rest (no intercourse, no heavy lifting, no strenuous activity)  \n   - Instructed to present to Labor & Delivery immediately if heavy bleeding (>1 pad/hour), contractions, or decreased fetal movement  \n\n2. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - Scheduled for **urgent ultrasound** (transvaginal preferred) to confirm placental location  \n   - CBC to assess for anemia (not yet ordered)  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat prenatal visit in 1 week  \n   - If placenta previa confirmed, will discuss potential need for cesarean delivery and closer monitoring  \n\n*(Incomplete: No discussion of RhoGAM status if Rh-negative, no iron supplementation if anemic, no detailed contingency planning for recurrent bleeding.)*  \n\n**Impression:**  \n32-year-old G2P1 at 28 weeks with painless vaginal bleeding, concerning for placenta previa. Further imaging required for definitive diagnosis. Patient counseled on warning signs and activity restrictions.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith  \n**For Testing Purposes Only – Not Real Medical Advice**  \n\n---  \n*Note: This fictional dictation intentionally includes gaps in history and management for educational/testing purposes. Always follow institutional protocols for real clinical documentation.*\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH.pdf), with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status and administer Anti-D Ig if the patient is RhD-negative.  \n   Reason: The guideline explicitly states that Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH (Section: \"Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Order a CBC immediately to assess for anemia rather than deferring it.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes maternal investigations, including blood tests, to assess the extent of APH (Section: \"Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH\").  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Perform or schedule a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm placental location definitively.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights the importance of ultrasound scans for diagnosis and fetal wellbeing (Section: \"Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed contingency planning for recurrent bleeding, including when to seek emergency care and potential hospitalization.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends hospitalization for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding (Section: \"Hospitalization is recommended for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding\").  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications.  \n   Reason: The guideline stresses the importance of a full history to identify potential causes of APH (Section: \"A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of APH, such as placental abruption or placenta praevia\").  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider antenatal corticosteroids if placenta previa is confirmed and preterm delivery is a risk.  \n   Reason: The guideline suggests antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth (Section: \"Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document sexual activity and recent intercourse history.  \n   Reason: While not critical, this information may help differentiate causes of bleeding (Section: \"A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of APH\").  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss the potential need for cesarean delivery in more detail if placenta previa is confirmed.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that delivery is usually by cesarean section in cases of maternal or fetal compromise (Section: \"Delivery is usually by caesarean section in cases of maternal or fetal compromise\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Include a more detailed social history (e.g., stress levels, support system).  \n   Reason: While useful for holistic care, this is not explicitly mentioned in the guideline as critical for APH management.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written patient information on placenta previa.  \n   Reason: While helpful, the guideline does not explicitly require written materials (though patient counseling is emphasized).  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps  \n- **Rh status and Anti-D administration** (Very Important)  \n- **Immediate CBC** (Very Important)  \n- **Ultrasound confirmation of placental location** (Very Important)  \n- **Contingency planning for recurrent bleeding** (Somewhat Important)  \n\nThese changes would align the note more closely with the guideline and improve patient safety and care quality.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 52 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
