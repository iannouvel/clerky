Key recommendations include: - **Risk Assessment & Prevention:** Identify high-risk women (limited mobility, diabetes, poor circulation, medical devices) and ensure proper nutrition. - **Intrapartum Care:** Change pads regularly, use cleansing foam/barrier cream, encourage mobilization, and monitor nutrition. - **Elective C-Section Care:** Assess skin pre/post-surgery, apply barrier cream, and ensure hydration during fasting. - **Post-delivery Care:** Cleanse skin, monitor blood glucose in diabetics, and advise on hygiene/pressure care. - **Diagnosis & Management:** Differentiate pressure ulcers from moisture lesions, categorize ulcers, and involve tissue viability teams for severe cases. - **Documentation & Audits:** Conduct annual audits (NICE CG179) with reports to governance boards. **Patient Advice:** Provide routine pressure care advice on admission and direct women to 'Family Assist' for support. **Audit Tool:** Tracks risk factors, compliance with care plans, skin assessments, repositioning, incontinence management, and nutrition/hydration status",
