The recommendation is clinically appropriate as it would provide direct visualization of the endometrial cavity.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Consider hysteroscopy if bleeding persists\" with \"If proceeding with hysteroscopy: (1) Use vaginoscopic approach (2) Consider NSAID premedication (3) Use smallest diameter hysteroscope (≤3.5mm) (4) Use saline distension at lowest effective pressure\" (Reason: The guideline provides specific technical recommendations: 'Vaginoscopy should be the standard technique' and 'Miniature hysteroscopes of 3.5mm or less should be used'. These modifications would optimize patient comfort and procedure success. This is appropriate as the patient has risk factors for procedure discomfort (nulliparous, anxious). 'A statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs' supports premedication.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Gap: no documentation of patient counseling about hysteroscopy\" with \"Document discussion of: (1) Procedure details/risks (2) Pain management options (3) Alternative settings (4) Right to stop procedure\" (Reason: The guideline mandates: 'Women should be made aware of other settings and modes of anesthesia' and 'should be advised to alert if procedure becomes too painful'. This counseling is particularly important for this patient given her anxiety about procedures. Proper documentation protects both patient and provider.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Gap: no safety checklist mentioned for potential hysteroscopy\" with \"Prior to any hysteroscopy: (1) Confirm negative pregnancy test (2) Review allergies (3) Assess cervical stenosis risk factors\" (Reason: The guideline recommends: 'A safety checklist should be considered before hysteroscopy, including exclusion of pregnancy'. This patient's history of LSCS increases cervical stenosis risk, making checklist particularly important. These checks are basic safety requirements that should be documented.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

### **SITUATION:**  
**Patient Demographics:**  
- **Name:** Ms. X (DOB: 15/05/1985, 39yo)  
- **Gestation:** N/A (G4P2, previous SVD x2, LSCS x1)  
- **Presenting Complaint:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) – heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) for 3/12, worsening over last 2/52.  
- **Key Clinical Issue:** Persistent AUB with associated fatigue (likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia). No hemodynamic instability at present.  

### **BACKGROUND:**  
**Relevant PMHx:**  
- **OBGYN Hx:**  
  - G4P2 (2x SVD, 1x LSCS for FTP, 1x TOP)  
  - Previous IUD (Mirena®) removed 6/12 ago due to expulsion  
  - No known fibroids or endometriosis  
- **Medical Hx:**  
  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD)  
  - Obesity (BMI 32)  
  - No known coagulopathy  
- **Surgical Hx:**  
  - LSCS (2018)  
  - Appendicectomy (2005)  
- **Medications:**  
  - Levothyroxine 75mcg OD  
  - NSAIDs PRN for dysmenorrhea (no recent use)  
- **Allergies:** NKDA  
- **Social Hx:**  
  - Non-smoker, occasional ETOH  
  - Works as a teacher, moderately active  

**Risk Factors for AUB:**  
- Obesity (↑ endometrial hyperplasia risk)  
- Hypothyroidism (may exacerbate HMB)  
- Previous IUD expulsion (possible structural cause)  

### **ASSESSMENT:**  
**Clinical Findings (0800 hours):**  
- **Vitals:**  
  - BP: 128/78 mmHg  
  - HR: 88 bpm (regular)  
  - Temp: 36.7°C  
  - SpO₂: 98% RA  
  - RR: 14/min  
- **General Exam:**  
  - Pale conjunctivae (clinical anemia)  
  - No signs of hemodynamic compromise  
- **Abdo Exam:**  
  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- **PV Exam (consented & chaperoned):**  
  - No active bleeding at time of exam  
  - Cervix appears normal, no cervical excitation  
  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size  
  - No adnexal masses  

**Investigations:**  
- **Bloods (FBC, LFTs, U&Es, CRP, TFTs, coagulation screen):**  
  - Hb: 98 g/L (↓ from 112 g/L 6/12 ago)  
  - MCV: 78 fL (microcytic)  
  - Ferritin: 12 μg/L (↓)  
  - TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (well-controlled)  
  - Platelets: 220 x10⁹/L  
  - INR/APTT: Normal  
- **Imaging:**  
  - **TV USS:**  
    - Endometrial thickness: 12mm (heterogeneous)  
    - No fibroids/polyps seen  
    - Normal adnexa  
  - **Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology)**  

**Differential Diagnosis (PALM-COEIN):**  
1. **Polyp/Adenomyosis** (USS inconclusive, biopsy pending)  
2. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (↑ risk due to obesity)  
3. **Coagulopathy** (unlikely given normal coagulation)  
4. **Ovulatory dysfunction** (secondary to hypothyroidism?)  
5. **Iatrogenic** (none identified)  

### **RECOMMENDATION:**  
**Immediate Management:**  
- **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulfate 200mg BD + vitamin C (monitor Hb in 4/52)  
- **Hormonal therapy:**  
  - Start norethisterone 5mg TDS for 21/7 (to regulate bleeding)  
  - Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion if biopsy normal  
- **Analgesia:** Mefenamic acid 500mg TDS PRN (if dysmenorrhea)  

**Monitoring & Follow-Up:**  
- **Repeat Hb in 4/52** (target >110 g/L)  
- **Await endometrial biopsy results** (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy)  
- **GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52**  
- Consider outpatient hysteroscopy if bleeding persists or biopsy results are inconclusive, with proper patient counseling about the procedure  

**If proceeding with hysteroscopy:**  
1. Use vaginoscopic approach  
2. Consider NSAID premedication  
3. Use smallest diameter hysteroscope (≤3.5mm)  
4. Use saline distension at lowest effective pressure  

**Document discussion of:**  
1. Procedure details/risks  
2. Pain management options  
3. Alternative settings  
4. Right to stop procedure  

**Prior to any hysteroscopy:**  
1. Confirm negative pregnancy test  
2. Review allergies  
3. Assess cervical stenosis risk factors  

**Contingencies:**  
- If hemodynamically unstable → admit for IV iron/transfusion  
- If biopsy shows hyperplasia → consider progestogens/hysterectomy (if completed family)
