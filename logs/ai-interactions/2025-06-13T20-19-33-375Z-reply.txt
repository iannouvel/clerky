  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\ncan you say that we're starting to record something that it goes into there so we're having a discussion about your pregnancy and your hemorrhoids and your beautiful baby that you expecting and give you some advice regarding the options regarding how you're going to give birth\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antenatal Care Guideline\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - The clinical note should include a structured assessment of risk factors (e.g., gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, venous thromboembolism, domestic abuse, FGM) as outlined in the guideline.  \n**Reason**: The guideline emphasizes comprehensive risk assessment at the first antenatal appointment and subsequent visits (e.g., 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4). Missing these assessments could lead to undetected high-risk conditions.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Provide clear, structured information on birth options, fetal movements, and sleep position after 28 weeks.  \n**Reason**: The guideline recommends discussing birth preferences before 28 weeks (1.3.14), fetal movements after 24 weeks (1.3.13), and avoiding supine sleep after 28 weeks (1.3.25). The current note lacks these critical discussions.  \n\n**Different management plan** - Document blood pressure measurement, urine dipstick testing, and symphysis fundal height at appropriate intervals.  \n**Reason**: Routine monitoring (e.g., blood pressure at every visit, fundal height after 24 weeks) is mandated (1.2.10, 1.2.11, 1.2.13). The note omits these essential checks.  \n\n---\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Assess and document the woman’s social context (e.g., ethnicity, deprivation, partner involvement, peer support options).  \n**Reason**: The guideline highlights disparities in outcomes for marginalized groups and recommends involving partners/peer support (1.3.23, 1.3.24). The note lacks this contextual awareness.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Discuss nutrition, alcohol, and pelvic floor health in a non-judgmental way.  \n**Reason**: The guideline stresses individualized discussions on lifestyle (1.3.9, 1.3.10, 1.3.12). The current note focuses narrowly on hemorrhoids/birth options.  \n\n---\n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Offer information on antenatal classes and postnatal preparation.  \n**Reason**: While recommended (1.3.15), these are less urgent than risk assessments or critical discussions (e.g., fetal movements).  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Document discussions about nausea/vomiting management if relevant.  \n**Reason**: The guideline provides detailed options (1.4.1–1.4.7), but this is only critical if the patient reports symptoms.  \n\n---\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Consider mentioning acupressure for severe nausea (if applicable).  \n**Reason**: This is a niche recommendation (1.4.6) and unlikely to apply universally.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nThe note fails to address **critical** guideline components (risk assessments, monitoring, structured advice). Prioritize adding these elements to ensure patient safety and compliance. Social context and lifestyle discussions are **somewhat important**, while class referrals and nausea management are lower priority.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 60 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antenatal Care Guideline\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
