When symptoms are related, combine them into one concise issue. Do not number the issues; simply list one per line.\n\nExample Output: \nPainful, irregular heavy periods\nSubfertility\nConsidering diagnostic laparoscopy for endometriosis\n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\nPatient: Hi, I'm here for my appointment today.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Hello, how are you feeling? Any specific concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles lately, and I'm a bit worried about it.\n\nHealthcare Professional: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the irregular periods, such as pain or changes in flow?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've been having more intense cramps than usual, and the flow seems heavier at times.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Okay, we'll need to investigate that further. Have you ever had any issues with ovarian cysts or endometriosis in the past?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't had any issues like that before.\n\nHealthcare Professional: It's essential for us to rule out any underlying conditions. We may need to perform a pelvic exam and possibly some imaging studies to get a better understanding of what's going on.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I just want to make sure everything is okay.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Absolutely, we'll work together to figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, let's also discuss your family planning goals and any contraceptive needs you may have.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I appreciate your help in addressing all these concerns.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Of course, that's what I'm here for. Let's take one step at a time and ensure we cover all aspects of your reproductive health."
