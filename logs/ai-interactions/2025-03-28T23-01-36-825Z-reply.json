She also reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) and concerns about possible early pregnancy complications due to irregular cycles.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Heavy bleeding lasting 8–10 days per cycle, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking &gt;6 pads&#x2F;day).  - Pelvic pain is dull and constant, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  - No history of intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding.  - Last menstrual period (LMP) was 5 weeks ago, but cycles have been irregular (25–40 days).  - Denies fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  Past Medical History:  - No chronic medical conditions.  - No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  Past Surgical History:  - Three previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (ages 16, 17, and 18).  - No history of caesarean sections or gynaecological surgeries.  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12.  - No history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  - No cervical screening (Pap smear) yet (due to age).  - Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently.  Drug History:  - Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular medications).  - No hormonal contraception in the past year.  Allergy History:  - No known drug allergies.  Social History:  - Works part-time in retail.  - Smokes 5 cigarettes&#x2F;day (since age 15).  - Occasional alcohol (1–2 units&#x2F;week).  - No recreational drug use.  - Lives with partner and three children.  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried about possible fibroids or endometriosis due to pain and heavy bleeding.  - Concerns: Fear of infertility or complications in future pregnancies.  - Expectations: Wants investigation and treatment to improve symptoms.  Examination Findings:  - General: Well-appearing, no pallor or distress.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  - Speculum Exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions or discharge.  - Bimanual Exam: Uterus slightly enlarged, non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild cervical motion tenderness noted.  Differential Diagnoses:  1. Adenomyosis (given multiparity, heavy bleeding, and dysmenorrhea).  2. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (due to cervical motion tenderness, though no fever or discharge).  3. Endometriosis (given dyspareunia and cyclical pain).  Investigations Advised:  - Pelvic ultrasound (to assess uterine structure, rule out fibroids&#x2F;adenomyosis).  - STI screen (chlamydia&#x2F;gonorrhoea PCR, given cervical tenderness).  - Full blood count (FBC) (to check for anaemia due to menorrhagia).  Management Plan:  1. Pain relief: Regular NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) during menstruation.  2. Hormonal options: Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (after STI screen) to regulate cycles.  3. Lifestyle advice: Smoking cessation counselling (due to increased cardiovascular risk with hormonal contraception).  4. Follow-up: Review in 4 weeks with investigation results. If PID suspected, treat empirically with antibiotics.  Patient Counselling:  - Reassured that symptoms are manageable but require further assessment.  - Advised to return urgently if fever, severe pain, or worsening bleeding occurs.  Plan for Future Pregnancy:  - Discussed long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) options if desired.  - Advised preconception counselling if planning another pregnancy.
