Key recommendations: - **Antenatal Care**: Close monitoring, thromboembolism risk assessment, and thromboprophylaxis. Induction of labor advised for BMI ≥30; ultrasound recommended for BMI >30. - **Labor & Delivery**: Active third-stage management; avoid birthing pools for BMI ≥35. Alert theater staff if weight >120 kg; use lateral transfer equipment (e.g., Pat Slide™). Fetal scalp monitoring for accurate assessment. - **Cesarean Section**: Suturing of subcutaneous tissue; PICO dressings for BMI ≥35. - **High-Risk Cases (BMI ≥40)**: Inform senior obstetrician and anesthetists; establish venous access and restrict oral intake. - **Postnatal Care**: Provide necessary equipment, encourage weight management programs (e.g., WBIP), and refer to Healthy Eating Services. Staff must be trained in manual handling and use appropriate equipment for patient safety",
