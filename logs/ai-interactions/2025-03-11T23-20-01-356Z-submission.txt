Clinical Summary:
Healthcare Professional: Good morning, how can I help you today?

Patient: Hi, I'm here for my prenatal check-up. I'm 32 years old, this is my first pregnancy, and my BMI is 26.

Healthcare Professional: Great, let's start by discussing any symptoms or concerns you have been experiencing.

Patient: I've been having some lower back pain and occasional headaches. Also, I'm worried about the risk of gestational diabetes.

Patient: Thank you for addressing my concerns. I want to ensure a safe delivery for me and the baby.

Healthcare Professional: Absolutely, we will work together to create a birth plan that aligns with your expectations and ensures the best outcome for both you and your baby.
