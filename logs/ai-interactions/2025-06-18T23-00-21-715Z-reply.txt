Consider induction/cesarean at 39+0 weeks. - **Recurrent RFM (≥2 episodes in 3 weeks):** CTG within 2 hours; discuss birth expediting at 38+6–39+0 weeks. Senior obstetrician to decide induction. - **Monitoring:** Continuous fetal monitoring in labor if induced for RFM. - **Documentation:** Record assessments on MIS. **Risk Factors:** Assess for stillbirth/SGA/FGR. Offer counseling on risks of early birth. **Audit:** Ensure compliance with guideline standards",
