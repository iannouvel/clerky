She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] gtg-2011-aph-pdf\nTitle: GTG 2011 - APH.pdf\nContent: Antepartum Haemorrhage\nAntepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. The most important causes of APH are placenta praevia and placental abruption. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Up to one-fifth of very preterm babies are born in association with APH, and the known association of APH with cerebral palsy can be explained by preterm delivery. Recurrent APH is the term used when there are episodes of APH on more than one occasion. It is important to assess for signs of clinical shock when estimating blood loss, as the amount of blood lost is often underestimated. Spotting, minor haemorrhage, major haemorrhage, and massive haemorrhage are defined based on the amount of blood loss. Antepartum haemorrhage is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pregnancies complicated by unexplained APH are also at increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Women with repeated presentations that may include APH should be asked about domestic violence. Women with APH should report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider and be managed in a hospital maternity unit with facilities for resuscitation and emergency operative delivery.\n\nClinical assessment in women presenting with APH is crucial to establish the need for urgent intervention to manage maternal or fetal compromise. Triage includes history-taking, assessment of vaginal bleeding, maternal cardiovascular condition, and fetal wellbeing. If major haemorrhage persists or the woman is unable to provide a history, immediate maternal stabilization is priority. A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of APH, such as placental abruption or placenta praevia. Abdominal palpation and speculum examination can aid in identifying the cause of bleeding. Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH. Fetal investigations, including fetal heart rate assessment and ultrasound scans, are important to monitor fetal wellbeing. Hospitalization is recommended for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding. Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth. Tocolytic therapy should not be used in cases of major APH or placental abruption. Antenatal care should be altered following APH, with increased fetal surveillance for high-risk pregnancies. Delivery should be determined based on maternal and fetal condition, with immediate delivery required for compromised cases.\n\nIn women with antepartum hemorrhage (APH) due to placenta praevia, management includes maternal resuscitation and delivery of the fetus to control bleeding. Delivery is usually by caesarean section in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. For women with APH before 37 weeks of gestation without compromise, elective premature delivery is not recommended. In cases after 37 weeks, induction of labor may be considered. Fetal monitoring during labor should be continuous for active bleeding or if there are concerns of placental insufficiency. Regional anesthesia is recommended for operative delivery in cases of APH, unless contraindicated. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated and active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH. Massive APH should be managed following multidisciplinary protocols, and blood products should be ordered as needed. Women with coagulopathy should receive appropriate transfusions. Neonates should be assessed by a senior pediatrician/neonatologist in cases of major APH. In cases of extremely preterm pregnancy with APH, maternal stabilization is the priority before considering delivery of the baby. Postnatal issues include thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, and clinical incident reporting. Obstetric skill drills should include management of major APH to improve patient safety.\n\nteamworking and ensure prompt and efficient management in such an emergency.\nSuggested audit topics:\n1.

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH.pdf) with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether domestic violence screening was performed given recurrent APH.  
   Reason: The guideline recommends asking women with repeated presentations of APH about domestic violence (Section: "Women with repeated presentations that may include APH should be asked about domestic violence").  

2. **Different management plan** - Consider adding thromboprophylaxis given hospitalization and bed rest.  
   Reason: The guideline highlights postnatal thromboprophylaxis as an important consideration (Section: "Postnatal issues include thromboprophylaxis").  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer counseling about the risks of preterm delivery and potential neonatal outcomes.  
   Reason: The guideline emphasizes the association of APH with preterm delivery and adverse perinatal outcomes (Section: "APH is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide").  

2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether anti-D immunoglobulin was considered (though the patient is Rh-positive, this should still be noted).  
   Reason: The guideline recommends anti-D Ig for RhD-negative women, but documentation of consideration is good practice (Section: "Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH").  

### Less Important Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Include more details about the speculum examination findings (e.g., cervical appearance, active bleeding).  
   Reason: The guideline suggests speculum examination can aid in identifying the cause of bleeding (Section: "Abdominal palpation and speculum examination can aid in identifying the cause of bleeding").  

2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss the possibility of earlier delivery if bleeding recurs, including potential risks/benefits.  
   Reason: The guideline states delivery timing should be based on maternal/fetal condition (Section: "Delivery should be determined based on maternal and fetal condition").  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a debriefing plan was discussed for after delivery.  
   Reason: The guideline mentions debriefing as a postnatal issue, but this is less urgent (Section: "Postnatal issues include...debriefing").  

The clinical note largely aligns well with the guideline, particularly in terms of admission, monitoring, and preparation for emergency delivery. The most critical gap is the lack of documented domestic violence screening.
