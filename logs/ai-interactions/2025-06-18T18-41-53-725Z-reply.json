Refer anaesthetic complications to an obstetric anaesthetist. - **Training/Audit:** Staff training should align with Maternity Training Needs Analysis. Audits should assess vital sign documentation and MEOWS chart completion. Care continues until handover to the midwife is complete\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
