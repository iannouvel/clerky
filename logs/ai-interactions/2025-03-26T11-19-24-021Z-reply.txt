### **Differential Diagnosis**  
1. **Threatened miscarriage** (given positive pregnancy test, bleeding, and pain).  
2. **Ectopic pregnancy** (risk factors: prior termination, irregular cycles, adnexal tenderness).  

---

### **Management Plan**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Quantitative β-hCG (today and 48-hour repeat).  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (formal) to confirm viability/location.  
   - STI screen (Chlamydia/Gonorrhoea NAAT).  

2. **Immediate Advice:**  
   - Counsel on ectopic pregnancy risks (e.g., rupture symptoms: severe pain/shoulder tip pain, collapse).  
   - Avoid intercourse/strenuous activity until cleared.  

3. **Contingency Planning:**  
   - If ectopic confirmed: Discuss methotrexate vs. surgical options.  
   - If intrauterine pregnancy non-viable: Offer medical/surgical management or expectant care.  

4. **Psychosocial Support:**  
   - Refer to adolescent sexual health counsellor.  
   - Confidentiality reinforced; explore safe disclosure strategies.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Review β-hCG/ultrasound results in 48 hours.  
- Emergency contact provided.
