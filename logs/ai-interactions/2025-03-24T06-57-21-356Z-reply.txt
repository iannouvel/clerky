**Management Plan:**  
1. **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding:**  
   - Given the thickened endometrium and her age, an endometrial biopsy will be arranged to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy.  
   - Consider starting a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) to manage heavy bleeding and provide contraception if she decides against further pregnancies.  
   - Iron studies to assess for anemia due to heavy bleeding.

   - Referral to a reproductive endocrinologist for further evaluation, including thrombophilia screening, thyroid function tests, and karyotyping for both Ms. Doe and her partner.  
   - Weight management advice: Referral to a dietitian and structured weight loss program to optimize BMI before attempting another pregnancy.  
   - Smoking cessation support: Referral to a smoking cessation clinic.  

3. **General Health:**  
   - Optimize control of diabetes and hypertension pre-conception.  
   - Review medications: Lisinopril should be switched to a pregnancy-safe alternative (e.g., labetalol) if she plans to conceive.  

4. **Psychological Support:**  
   - Offer counseling to address her concerns about recurrent miscarriages and the emotional impact of her symptoms.
