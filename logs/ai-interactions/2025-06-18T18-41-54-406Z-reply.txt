After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless new concerns arise (random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion). - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Glucose >11.0mmol/L or fasting ≥5.6mmol/L requires urgent referral. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Corticosteroid use may require hospitalization for glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment. - **Labor/delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Postpartum, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Monitoring**: Ultrasound and fetal heart exam at 20 weeks; self-monitor glucose. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidelines, prioritizing GDM patients. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure compliance and quality care",
