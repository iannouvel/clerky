It applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and recovery staff. **Key Recommendations:** - **Equipment:** Ensure availability of BP monitor, oxygen saturation monitor, thermometer, oxygen/breathing system, suction, and infusion devices. - **Monitoring:** Continuous vital sign monitoring until stable, with specific protocols for general/regional anaesthesia. - **Ongoing Care:** Maintain IV patency, administer prescribed medications, and avoid leaving women unattended. - **Discharge Criteria:** Consciousness, clear airway, stable cardiovascular status, adequate analgesia, and removed pressure dressings. - **Postnatal Care:** Monitor temperature, pulse, BP; support breastfeeding and baby care. Refer anaesthetic complications to an obstetric anaesthetist. - **Training/Audit:** Ensure staff training per Maternity Training Needs Analysis. Audit vital signs and MEOWS chart documentation. Care continues until handover to the midwife is complete",
