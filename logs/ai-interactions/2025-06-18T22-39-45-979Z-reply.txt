Key points: - **Initial Assessment**: Midwives must assess patients within 15-30 minutes using the **Birmingham Symptom-specific Obstetric Triage System (BSOTS)** for prioritization. Obstetric staff should respond promptly. - **Referral Criteria**: Clear criteria for urgent obstetric assessment; non-obstetric issues are excluded. - **Patient Assessment**: Includes MEOWS, CTG, blood/urine tests, and holistic evaluation. - **Roles**: Midwives lead triage; Maternity Care Assistants (MCAs) support but do not perform initial observations. - **Ongoing Care**: Timely treatment based on BSOTS category, effective handover, and communication. - **Discharge/Follow-up**: Patients may be admitted, transferred, or discharged with follow-up as needed. - **Escalation**: Delays in assessment must be escalated and documented. - **Communication**: Clear explanations, reassurance, and translation services for non-English speakers. - **Staffing**: Local staffing varies, but initial triage must occur within 15-30 minutes. Aims to reduce unnecessary tests, standardize care, and ensure prompt treatment",
