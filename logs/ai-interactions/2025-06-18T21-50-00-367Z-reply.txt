      "newValue": "**Summary:** This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assisted vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum extraction), focusing on instrument selection, indications, contraindications, and procedural timing. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Factors increasing failure risk include mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, and large fetal head circumference. Pre-procedure ultrasound is advised if fetal head position is uncertain. Post-birth care includes antibiotics, monitoring for complications, bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Psychological support should be offered for traumatic births, avoiding single-session trauma-focused interventions. Units must ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports. Auditable standards should be monitored per RCOG guidelines",
