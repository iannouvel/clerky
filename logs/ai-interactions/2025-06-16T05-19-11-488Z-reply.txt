  "transcript": "SITUATION: 27-year-old G3P0+2 at 22+3 weeks gestation presenting with painless cervical dilatation and possible cervical insufficiency\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Davis has a significant obstetric history of two previous second-trimester losses. First pregnancy ended at 19 weeks with sudden painless dilatation and delivery following spontaneous rupture of membranes. Second pregnancy was similar at 21 weeks despite attempted cervical cerclage at 14 weeks, which was unsuccessful. Both losses were attributed to cervical insufficiency. Current pregnancy was planned with preconception counselling. She was commenced on vaginal progesterone from 16 weeks and had prophylactic cervical cerclage inserted at 13 weeks. Serial cervical length monitoring has shown gradual shortening from 35mm at 16 weeks to 18mm at 20 weeks. She presented today after noticing increased clear vaginal discharge and pelvic pressure for 2 days. No bleeding, no contractions, no urinary symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well but anxious. Vital signs stable. Speculum examination reveals cervix 2-3cm dilated with visible membranes bulging through cervical os. Cerclage suture remains in situ but appears loose. No bleeding, clear amniotic fluid visible. Transvaginal ultrasound confirms cervical length of 8mm with funneling. Fetal biometry appropriate for dates, amniotic fluid volume normal, fetal heart rate 148 bpm. No evidence of chorioamnionitis - maternal temperature 36.8°C, WCC 8.2 x10⁹/L, CRP <5 mg/L.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Emergency rescue cerclage considered but challenging given advanced dilatation and bulging membranes. Admitted for strict bed rest and close monitoring. Tocolytics (nifedipine) commenced to reduce uterine activity. Antibiotics (erythromycin) started prophylactically. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) given for fetal lung maturity. Daily monitoring for signs of infection or labor. Neonatal team consulted regarding extremely preterm delivery risks. Difficult discussion with parents regarding poor prognosis at current gestation but potential for prolongation of pregnancy.",
