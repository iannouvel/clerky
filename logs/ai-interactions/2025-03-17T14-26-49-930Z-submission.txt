Create a fictional dialogue between a healthcare professional and a patient. 
This dialogue is for testing purposes only and should include various topics that might be discussed in a healthcare setting. 
Please ensure the conversation is entirely fictional and does not provide any real medical advice or information. 
The transcript should cover 2-3 complex obstetric and gynecological issues.

IMPORTANT: For each new transcript, you MUST randomly select (using a random number generator):
- Age: Pick a random number between 18 and 48
- Previous pregnancies: Pick a random number between 1 and 5
- Previous deliveries: Pick a random number between 0 and the number of pregnancies selected
- BMI: Pick a random number between 18 and 40

The clinician should provide detailed, specific advice and guidance, including:
- Specific management plans with timeframes
- Detailed explanations of any recommended tests or procedures
- Specific medications with doses if relevant
- Clear follow-up plans with timing
- Specific warning signs to watch for
- Concrete thresholds for seeking urgent care
