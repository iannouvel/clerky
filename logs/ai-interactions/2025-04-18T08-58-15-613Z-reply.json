No real medical advice is provided.*  \n\n**Patient Details:**  \n- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  \n- Age: 43 years  \n- Weight: 102 kg  \n- BMI: 37.4 (obese class II)  \n- Prior pregnancies: 3 (all vaginal deliveries, no complications reported)  \n\n**Presenting Complaint:**  \nMs. Doe reports a 6-month history of **heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding**, with episodes lasting up to 10 days and associated with large clots. She describes **intermenstrual bleeding** over the past 2 months and occasional **pelvic discomfort**. She denies fever, weight loss, or dyspareunia.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began insidiously; initially attributed to perimenopause.  \n- Bleeding has worsened, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking >1 pad every 2 hours on heavy days).  \n- No recent hormonal contraceptive use.  \n- No prior investigations for abnormal uterine bleeding.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago, on metformin).  \n- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril).  \n- Obesity (BMI 37.4, no prior weight management interventions).  \n\n**Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 20).  \n- No prior gynecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12.  \n- Regular cycles until 6 months ago (previously 28-day cycles).  \n- Parity: 3 (all term deliveries).  \n- No history of cervical dysplasia or STIs.  \n- Last Pap smear 2 years ago (normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 500 mg BD.  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  \n- No NSAID or hormonal therapy use.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as a school administrator (sedentary role).  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  \n- Alcohol: occasional (1–2 units/week).  \n- Lives with husband and children; reports moderate stress due to work.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried this could be \"cancer\" due to family history (maternal aunt with endometrial cancer).  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery or fertility implications (though not planning more children).  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"answers quickly\" and prefers \"non-surgical options if possible.\"  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of hyperandrogenism.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Pelvic:**  \n  - Speculum: Cervix appears normal; no visible lesions.  \n  - Bimanual: Uterus slightly enlarged (~10-week size), mobile, non-tender. Adnexae clear.  \n- **PV bleeding:** Minimal active bleeding at time of exam.  \n\n**Investigations Requested:**  \n1. **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness and morphology.  \n2. **Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle)**: Given high-risk features (obesity, diabetes, abnormal bleeding).  \n3. **HbA1c and lipids:** Given metabolic risk factors.  \n\n**Provisional Diagnosis:**  \n**Endometrial hyperplasia (likely complex atypical, given risk factors)**.  \n*Differential:*  \n- Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (perimenopausal).  \n- Endometrial polyp/carcinoma (less likely but must exclude).  \n\n**Management Plan (aligned with GTG 2014 Endometrial Hyperplasia guidelines):**  \n1. **Urgent referral to gynaecology** for hysteroscopy +/- biopsy given abnormal bleeding and risk factors.  \n2. **Weight management:** Referral to dietitian and structured lifestyle program (weight loss reduces hyperplasia risk).  \n3. **Diabetes optimization:** Reinforce adherence to metformin; consider endocrinology review.  \n4. **Smoking cessation:** Offered support services.  \n5. **Hormonal therapy discussion:**  \n   - If biopsy confirms **non-atypical hyperplasia**, trial of **progestogens (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral medroxyprogesterone)**.  \n   - If **atypical hyperplasia**, discuss definitive surgery (hysterectomy) due to malignancy risk.  \n6. **Safety-netting:** Advised to return if bleeding worsens (e.g., syncope, severe anemia).  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review biopsy results in 2 weeks.  \n- GP to coordinate multidisciplinary care (diabetes, weight, gynaecology).  \n\n**Patient Reassurance:**  \n- Acknowledged her concerns about cancer; explained that while hyperplasia is not cancer, it requires prompt treatment to prevent progression.  \n- Emphasized that most cases respond well to hormonal therapy or surgery if needed.  \n\n---  \n*End of dictation.
