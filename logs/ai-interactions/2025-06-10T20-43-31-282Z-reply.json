She reports intermittent, painless vaginal bleeding over the past week, described as bright red and light in volume. She denies associated contractions, fever, or trauma. She has no history of bleeding earlier in this pregnancy. She reports normal fetal movements.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- G2P1 (previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term)  \n- No prior cesarean sections or uterine surgeries  \n- No known history of placenta previa or other placental abnormalities  \n\n**Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- No significant medical conditions  \n- No prior surgeries  \n- No known bleeding disorders  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- No anticoagulants or other medications  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Occasional alcohol use prior to pregnancy (none since conception)  \n- Works as a teacher; no heavy lifting or strenuous activity  \n\n*(Incomplete: Family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications not elicited. Sexual activity and recent intercourse not discussed.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/72 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- Temp: 98.4°F  \n- RR: 16  \n\n**Abdomen:**  \n- Soft, non-tender  \n- Fundal height consistent with dates  \n- No palpable contractions  \n\n**Speculum Exam (Deferred Today):**  \n- Patient declined speculum exam due to discomfort; no active bleeding noted externally  \n\n**Fetal Assessment:**  \n- FHR: 142 bpm (Doppler)  \n- Normal movement reported  \n\n*(Incomplete: No documentation of cervical exam or ultrasound confirmation of placental location at this visit.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \nSuspected **placenta previa** given history of painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. Differential includes marginal bleed, cervical irritation, or other causes.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Management:**  \n   - Advised pelvic rest (no intercourse, no heavy lifting, no strenuous activity)  \n   - Instructed to present to Labor & Delivery immediately if heavy bleeding (>1 pad/hour), contractions, or decreased fetal movement  \n\n2. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - Scheduled for **urgent ultrasound** (transvaginal preferred) to confirm placental location  \n   - CBC to assess for anemia (not yet ordered)  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat prenatal visit in 1 week  \n   - If placenta previa confirmed, will discuss potential need for cesarean delivery and closer monitoring  \n\n*(Incomplete: No discussion of RhoGAM status if Rh-negative, no iron supplementation if anemic, no detailed contingency planning for recurrent bleeding.)*  \n\n**Impression:**  \n32-year-old G2P1 at 28 weeks with painless vaginal bleeding, concerning for placenta previa. Further imaging required for definitive diagnosis. Patient counseled on warning signs and activity restrictions.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith  \n**For Testing Purposes Only – Not Real Medical Advice**  \n\n---  \n*Note: This fictional dictation intentionally includes gaps in history and management for educational/testing purposes. Always follow institutional protocols for real clinical documentation.*\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (GTG 2011 - APH.pdf) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status and administer Anti-D Ig if the patient is RhD-negative.  \n   Reason: The guideline explicitly states that Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH (Section: \"Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH\").  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Order a CBC immediately to assess for anemia rather than deferring it.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes maternal investigations (e.g., blood tests) to assess the extent of APH (Section: \"Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed to assess the extent of APH\").  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Perform a transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) urgently to confirm placental location, not just schedule it.  \n   Reason: Placenta previa must be confirmed via imaging (preferably TVS) for definitive diagnosis (Section: \"Ultrasound scans should be performed to assess the extent of APH\").  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel the patient on the risks of recurrent bleeding and when to seek immediate care (e.g., contractions, heavy bleeding).  \n   Reason: The guideline stresses that women with APH should report all bleeding and be managed in a hospital setting (Section: \"Women with APH should report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider and be managed in a hospital maternity unit\").  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Assess for domestic violence given recurrent bleeding presentations.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends screening for domestic violence in women with repeated APH episodes (Section: \"Women with repeated presentations that may include APH should be asked about domestic violence\").  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider hospitalization given the bleeding episode (even if minor).  \n   Reason: Hospitalization is recommended for APH heavier than spotting (Section: \"Hospitalization is recommended for women with APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding\").  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a detailed family history of bleeding disorders or placental complications.  \n   Reason: While not critical, this helps assess risk factors (implied in guideline’s emphasis on full history-taking).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Discuss contingency planning for recurrent bleeding (e.g., blood transfusion consent, emergency contacts).  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights anticipatory management (Section: \"Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated\").  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document sexual activity history.  \n   Reason: While potentially relevant, it is less critical than other missing elements in APH management.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on placenta previa.  \n   Reason: Helpful but not essential for immediate management.  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:\n- **Missing Rh status & Anti-D Ig administration** (Very Important)  \n- **Delayed CBC & ultrasound confirmation** (Very Important)  \n- **Inadequate counseling on recurrent bleeding risks** (Somewhat Important)  \n- **No hospitalization considered** (Somewhat Important)  \n\nThese changes would align the note with the GTG 2011 APH guideline and improve patient safety.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 59 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antepartum Haemorrhage\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
