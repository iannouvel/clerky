  "transcript": "Here’s a medical clerking in SBAR format for a patient with suspected Müllerian anomalies, using British medical terminology and abbreviations:  \n\n---  \n\n**SITUATION:**  \n*23-year-old nulliparous (G0P0) female referred to Gynaecology Clinic with primary amenorrhoea and cyclical pelvic pain. USS suggestive of obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA syndrome).*  \n\n**BACKGROUND:**  \n- PMHx: Nil significant. No prior surgeries.  \n- SHx: Non-smoker, no alcohol/drug use.  \n- FHx: No known congenital anomalies.  \n- No regular medications.  \n- Menstrual Hx: Never menstruated (primary amenorrhoea) but reports monthly cyclical lower abdominal pain (L>R) for 2 years.  \n- Previous investigations:  \n  - Pelvic USS (external): Suspected uterine didelphys with right-sided hematocolpos.  \n  - Renal USS: Absent right kidney (ipsilateral renal agenesis).  \n  - FBC: Normal Hb (124 g/L), WCC 6.2, Plt 280.  \n  - Hormonal profile (LH/FSH/oestradiol): Normal, ruling out hypogonadism.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Observations: HR 76, BP 112/68, afebrile, BMI 22.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, mild suprapubic tenderness (L>R), no guarding/rigidity.  \n- PV exam (deferred until MRI/specialist review due to pain).  \n- Likely diagnosis: **Obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA)**, a Müllerian anomaly (Class III).  \n- Differential:  \n  - Isolated hematometrocolpos (non-Müllerian obstruction).  \n  - Endometriosis (secondary to obstruction).  \n  - Imperforate hymen (unlikely given USS findings).  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Imaging:**  \n   - Urgent pelvic MRI to confirm anatomy (septate vs. didelphys uterus, hematocolpos extent).  \n   - Repeat renal USS if prior imaging incomplete.  \n2. **Surgical planning:**  \n   - Discuss with tertiary centre for possible excision of vaginal septum ± drainage of hematocolpos.  \n   - Consider laparoscopy if endometriosis suspected.  \n3. **Monitoring:**  \n   - Analgesia (paracetamol/NSAIDs PRN) for cyclical pain.  \n   - Counsel on fertility implications (uterus may be functional if unobstructed side).  \n4. **Follow-up:**  \n   - MDT discussion with Paediatric & Adolescent Gynaecology (PAG) team.  \n   - Genetic counselling if syndromic features (e.g., VACTERL association).  \n\n---  \n\n**Notes:**  \n- OHVIRA is a classic triad: uterine didelphys, obstructed hemivagina, ipsilateral renal agenesis.  \n- MRI is gold standard for Müllerian anomaly classification (ESHRE/ESGE system).  \n- British spellings/terms used (e.g., \"haematocolpos\" vs. \"hematocolpos\" in US English).  \n\nLet me know if you'd like adjustments for specificity (e.g., paediatric vs. adult presentation).",
