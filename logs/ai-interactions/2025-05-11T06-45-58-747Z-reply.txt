A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  
*For Testing Purposes Only*  

**Patient Demographics:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 49  
- BMI: 38.4 (weight: 105 kg, height: 165 cm)  
- Gravida: 2, Para: 2  
- Last Menstrual Period (LMP): 2 weeks ago (reported as "heavy and prolonged")  

**History of Presenting Illness:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), characterized by irregular cycles, intermenstrual spotting, and episodes of heavy bleeding requiring frequent pad changes (soaking >1 pad every 2 hours). She reports occasional cramping but denies dizziness, syncope, or symptoms suggestive of anemia. No history of postcoital bleeding. She has not tracked her bleeding patterns.  

**Relevant Medical/Surgical History:**  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril).  
- Type 2 diabetes (poorly controlled, HbA1c last recorded at 8.5%).  
- No prior gynecologic surgeries.  
- Prior pregnancies: 2 uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  
- Contraception: None currently; used oral contraceptives in the past.  
- Family history: Mother with endometrial cancer (diagnosed at age 60).  

*Incomplete aspects:*  
- No detailed menstrual history (e.g., cycle length, duration of bleeding).  
- Sexual activity status not asked.  
- Medications (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants) not reviewed.  
- Thyroid symptoms/screening not addressed.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Obese, no pallor.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Pelvic exam (limited): Vulva normal. Speculum exam reveals minimal old blood in vault. Cervix appears nulliparous, no lesions. Bimanual exam: Uterus bulky, non-tender; adnexa not palpated due to body habitus.  

*Incomplete aspects:*  
- No documentation of cervical screening history.  
- Breast exam not performed.  
- No assessment for hirsutism/acne (PCOS not explored).  

**Assessment:**  
1. Abnormal uterine bleeding (likely secondary to perimenopausal hormonal changes or endometrial hyperplasia; malignancy less likely but must be ruled out).  
2. Obesity and uncontrolled diabetes increase risk for endometrial pathology.  

**Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and uterine structure.  
   - CBC to evaluate for anemia.  
   - HbA1c recheck given poorly controlled diabetes.  
   - *Missing:* Thyroid function tests, coagulation screen.  

2. **Management:**  
   - If TVUS shows thickened endometrium (>4 mm), recommend endometrial biopsy.  
   - Consider trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progestin-only pill) if biopsy benign, but risks/benefits not yet discussed with patient.  
   - Lifestyle counseling re: weight loss and diabetes control (not detailed in discussion).  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review results in 2 weeks.  
   - Urgent re-referral if bleeding worsens or signs of anemia develop.  

*Omissions:*  
- No discussion of fertility desires (though likely low given age).  
- No exploration of patient’s preferences for hormonal vs. non-hormonal management.
