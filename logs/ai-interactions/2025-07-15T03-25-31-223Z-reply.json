intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nTriage of Maternity Patients Guideline \n \n1.0 Aim \n \nThe aims of this guideline are: \n \n This operational policy will facilitate service for women/people requiring an urgent non-\nscheduled obstetric assessment, usually when attending Maternity Triage. \n Assessment by using BSOTS\n©\n (Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage System) \nwill standardise and clinically prioritise care, reduce time to initial assessment and reduce \nneed for inappropriate tests and treatments such as antibiotics. \n The use BSOTS\n©\n system enables an overview of the workload in Maternity Triage and \nensures appropriate escalation should that be required. It also ensures those who require \nmedical attention receive it in a timely way and that those women/people, for whom it is \nappropriate, are discharged by the midwife. \n\n2.0 Scope \n \nThis guideline is for use by: \n \n Midwives \n Obstetricians \n Maternity and Health Care Assistants \n\n3.0 Responsibilities \n \nIt is the responsibility of all midwifery and medical staff to: \n \n Access, read, understand, and apply this guidance. \n Attend any mandatory training pertaining to this guidance. \n \nIt is the responsibility of the division to: \n \n Ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations. \n Ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. \n\n4.0 Abbreviations used within this guideline \n \nBSOTS\n \n- Birmingham Symptom specific \nObstetric Triage System \nMEOWS – Modified Early Obstetric \nWarning Score \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 5 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nTAC - Triage Assessment Card MIS – Maternity Information System \nADAU - Antenatal Day Assessment Unit APH – Antepartum Haemorrhage \nSROM – Spontaneous Rupture of \nMembranes \nANC – Antenatal Clinic \nIOL – Induction of Labour CMW – Community Midwife \n\n5.0 Introduction and key points \n \nMaternity Triage systems are designed to ensure the woman receives the level and quality of care \nappropriate to their clinical needs and the resources available are used most effectively. \nIt involves a process of prioritising the order in which women/people receive obstetric and/or \nmidwifery attention on arrival to the Maternity Services, guiding treatment according to clinical need. \n \nThe Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage system (BSOTs) is based on the established \ntriage systems used in Emergency medicine and uses a uniform assessment and clinical \nprioritisation of the common conditions that women/people present with in maternity triage. \n \nBSOTS bundle includes: \n \n Completion of a standard clinical triage assessment by a midwife within 15 minutes of the \nwoman/person’s attendance. This includes taking a brief maternal/birthing parent history, \ncompletion of baseline maternal/birthing parent observations (temperature, pulse, \nrespirations and blood pressure), assessment of pain levels, abdominal palpation and \nauscultation of the fetal heart rate (if the woman/person is antenatal) and should take \nabout 5-10 minutes to undertake. \n This assessment is used to define a category of clinical urgency using symptom specific \nalgorithms, which guides timing of subsequent assessment and immediate care (by an \nObstetrician if required). \n Standardised symptom-specific algorithms are used for allocation of clinical priority and \nthe immediate care and further investigations of the eight commonest reasons for \nattendance (Abdominal pain, antenatal bleeding, hypertension, ruptured membranes, \nreduced fetal movements, suspected labour, unwell/other and postnatal) The BSOTs \ndocumentation supports and standardised the completion of the clinical tasks required \nand aids decision making. \n\n6.0 Telephone Triage (Maternity Helpline) \n \nMost attendances are preceded with either a self-referring phone call to the Maternity Helpline or \nreferral from another healthcare worker such as a Community Midwife or GP. \n \nWomen/people are then advised to attend Triage, ideally with a recommended timeframe. \nIf a woman/person phones the department, prior to arrival at Triage, a telephone assessment \nshould be undertaken using the BSOTs standardised Telephone Triage Assessment proforma (see \nAppendix 3). \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 6 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nThis directs the documentation of necessary information and the advice given to the woman/person, \nit does not attempt to prioritise the woman/person’s clinical urgency over the telephone. \n \nDetails of the phone call, advice given and plans made must be recorded on MIS. The phone book \nis only to be used only in the event where MIS is offline or otherwise inaccessible. \n \nWomen/people and babies should be referred to the appropriate area, according to the history \ngiven; using the ‘Referral Criteria for Maternity Calls’ (see Appendix 1). The Triage Midwife is \nresponsible for liaising with the appropriate clinical area prior to the admission. \n\n6.1 Pathway for managing Covid-19 positive tests on telephone triage \n \nFor women and people who are calling following a positive covid test – the ‘Covid Positive Calls \nPathway’ should be followed (see Appendix 7). \n\n6.2 Pathway for managing early pregnancy suspected miscarriage on telephone triage \n \nFor women/people with early pregnancy vaginal bleeding please see appendix 10 for referral \npathway. \n\n6.3 Pathway for managing concerns with care raised by women/people \n \nFor women/people who express a concern with their care, the Triage Midwife should follow the \nflowchart in appendix 8. \n\n7.0 BSOTS Process \n \n Once the woman/person has presented to the department, the triage process is started. \nAnd the time of attendance noted (see Appendix 4). \n Define appropriate symptom specific Triage Assessment Card (TAC) to be used for the \nassessment (see Appendix 4). \n Undertake a standardised Initial Triage Assessment – within 15 minutes of arrival \n Define level of urgency using symptom specific algorithm (and complete immediate care \nas per algorithm) Red or Orange Yellow or Green. \no Red or Orange: Immediate/urgent care to be seen in Triage main area (Labour \nWard) for on-going care. \no Yellow or Green: Await further assessment in the Triage room \n Each symptom specific algorithm has a definition of maximum treatment thresholds: \ntimeframes within which women and people were to be seen based on their level of \nurgency. These timeframes determine the recommended interval between initial triage \nand ongoing assessment and care. \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 7 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n7.1 Recommended BSOTs category and maximum time to treatment/next assessment \n\nAlongside the time-limited thresholds are the performance indicators setting the bench mark of \nachievement to maximise safety. These defined time frames are also be used for local audit and \nlocal assessment and allocation of midwifery and medical staff within the triage department (Labour \nWard). \n\n7.2 BSOTs Process Flowchart \n\nBSOTS category \nMaximum time until \ntreatment \nRed Immediate \nOrange 15 minutes \nYellow 1 hour \nGreen 4 hours \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 8 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n7.3 The Initial Triage Assessment \n \nThe initial triage assessment to determine the urgency with which women/ people will need to be \nseen will be carried out in the Labour Ward Triage Room which is the dedicated initial triage \nassessment area. \n \nAll women/people attending will be seen and assessed quickly on entering the department; the \ninitial triage assessment should be undertaken by a dedicated initial assessor midwife (“the BSOTs \nMidwife”) in the designated room. \n \nThe BSOTs midwife will assess the woman/person’s condition using a standardised assessment. \nThis should take approximately 5-10 minutes. \n \nFollowing their initial triage assessment, women/people will be seen in the order of their clinical \nneed (not on arrival time) and should be informed when they are likely to be seen. \n \nStandardised bespoke documentation is available for each of the 6 presenting symptoms and \ncontains initial assessment and immediate care and investigations. \n \nAbdominal Pain Antenatal Bleeding \nHypertension Postnatal \nUnwell/Other Ruptured Membranes \n \nThe initial assessment will allocate a level of urgency using the appropriate symptom specific \nalgorithm and this will define which further assessment and investigations should take place. \n \nThis initial triage assessment will include: \n \n Discussion of reasons for attending (and selection of appropriate documentation). \n Observing the woman/person’s general appearance. \n MEOWS assessment (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respirations, oxygen \nsaturation (if applicable), urine output, neurological response, amniotic fluid loss (if \napplicable), lochia (if applicable). \n Abdominal palpation and auscultation of the fetal heart. \n Woman/person’s perception of her pain. \n Level of urgency to prioritise care. \n Plan of immediate care. \n \nThe standard follow-on care and investigations (depending on primary reason for attending and will \nbe symptom specific) will be done in a timely manner by a midwife from the Labour Ward. \n \nWomen/ people assigned a category of urgency requiring emergency or urgent care (red or orange) \nshould be kept in the Labour Ward clinical area. \n \nWomen/ people assigned a less urgent category (yellow or green) can return to the Triage room \n(assessment room) to await further assessment as defined by their category. \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 9 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nIt is important that clinical staff can exercise their clinical judgement when deciding on the \nwomen/people’s category of urgency, but this should only be used to increase the category of \nurgency. Clinical indicators (such as maternal/birthing parent BP or pulse/MEOWS) should never be \noverridden. \n\n7.4 Antenatal Triage Assessment Card \n \nThe Antenatal Triage Assessment Card (TAC card) provides a concise summary of the triage \nassessment and should include (see Appendix 4): \n \n Maternal/Birthing Parent name, DOB and Hospital number. \n The date and time arrival and initial assessment in triage, together with the midwife’s \nname and PIN and/or stamp. \n The women/people’s gestation, gravity/ parity and blood group. \n A summary of symptoms on arrival, relevant medical, obstetric, social and lifestyle history, \ntogether with current pregnancy, medications and allergies. \n Assessment, including temperature, pulse, respirations and blood pressure (MEOWS), \nurinalysis and pain levels. \n Assessment of the fetus, including lie and presentation pattern of fetal movements and \nfetal heart rate, including if necessary, a Reduced Fetal Movement checklist. \n Using the symptom specific algorithms and information from the initial triage, leads to \nassessment of category of urgency (red, orange, yellow, green). The category can be \nraised as a result of clinical judgement but may not be lowered. \n The immediate plan of care is then summarised. \n\n7.5 BSOTs Algorithms \n \nBased on the presenting symptoms, maternal/birthing parent and fetal observations, each algorithm \nwhen followed gives the category of urgency to be determined for each of the reasons for \nattendance (red/orange/yellow/green) (see Appendix 4). \n \nIt is important that clinical staff can exercise their clinical judgement when deciding on the \nwomen/people’s category of urgency, but this should only be used to increase the category of \nurgency. Clinical indicators such as maternal/birthing parent blood pressure or pulse should not be \noverridden. \n \nThe BSOTS algorithm also details the immediate subsequent care required, which is dependent on \nthe category of urgency and the presenting problem. \n\n7.5 Subsequent immediate care (in main Triage area / Labour Ward) \n \nThis details the immediate subsequent care required, which is dependent on the category of \nurgency and the presenting reason and has been individualised for each reason for attendance and \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 10 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \ncategory of urgency. It also gives an opportunity for the midwife to request medical assessment, \nshould that be required. \n\n7.6 Communication, Handover and Escalation \n \nHandover and transfer of care should be from one health care professional (midwife or medical \nstaff) to another directly, ideally in person, but if this is not possible, by telephone. \n \nEffective communication is central to promoting maternity safety. A structured and consistent \nhandover, handover of information and/or transfer of care between staff should be based on the \nSBAR tool that covers details on the woman/person’s Situation, Background, Assessment, and \nRecommendations. \n\nAny delays or breaches to BSOTs initial assessments or waiting times must be escalated to the \nLabour Ward Co-ordinator and a DATIX completed. \n\n7.7 Communication with the woman \n \nThe BSOTs midwife should: \n \n Communicate what is happening next, and who will see them next. \n Re-assure that their information will be passed on to the next care provider. \n \nThe Assessment midwife should: \n \n Re-assure that their information has been passed on from their previous provider. \n Consider re-capping the history to reassure the woman/person that you have the \nappropriate information. Ensure a holistic assessment of the woman/person’s condition is \nundertaken. \n Provide appropriate advice on discharge and arrange follow up appointments if \nnecessary. \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 11 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nThe Obstetrician should: \n \n Re-assure that their information has been passed on from their previous provider. \n Consider re-capping the history to reassure the woman/person that you have the \nappropriate information. \n \nAn appropriate translation service should be used for non-English speaking patients \n\n7.8 BSOTs Staffing requirements \n \nLocal midwifery and medical staffing numbers and skill mix will depend on how busy the maternity \ntriage department is and may vary with different shift times throughout the day. The priority must be \nto undertake the initial triage within 15 minutes of arrival, and numbers of staff will therefore depend \non the numbers of women/people that attend. \n\n8.0 Antenatal Day Assessment Unit (ADAU) \n \n The assessment of women and people requiring review in ADAU should be documented \nwithin the free text pages of the handheld Antenatal record and on MIS. \n A medical obstetric review should be requested following the assessment if indicated. \n If admission is indicated, the ADAU midwife is responsible for liaising with the relevant \nclinicians. The Labour ward Co-ordinator should be informed of all admissions. \n\n9.0 Neonatal referrals from community \n \nBabies who require hospital review / admission should be advised to come to the most appropriate \narea using the ‘Referral pathway from community’ (see Appendix 6). \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 12 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n8.0 Audit \n \nMonitoring Method Frequency \nNumber of women and people seen within 30 minutes Audit Annual \nNumber of women and people seen within timeframe for red, \norange, yellow and green \nAudit Annual \nNumber of red flags – women and people not triaged within \n30 minutes from time of arrival – due to midwifery staffing \nAudit Annual \n\nReferences \n \nBSOTs Training Manual \n \nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London (2012) Triage in Maternity (Maternity Guideline) \n \nEast Lancashire NHS Trust (2011) Antenatal Triage Guidelines \n\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 13 of 25 \n \nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nAppendix 1: Referral criteria for telephone triage calls \n\nA & E \n \n Less than 16 weeks with: severe pain +/- bleeding -

This operational policy will facilitate service for women/people requiring an urgent non-\\nscheduled obstetric assessment, usually when attending Maternity Triage. \\n Assessment by using BSOTS\\n©\\n (Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage System) \\nwill standardise and clinically prioritise care, reduce time to initial assessment and reduce \\nneed for inappropriate tests and treatments such as antibiotics. \\n The use BSOTS\\n©\\n system enables an overview of the workload in Maternity Triage and \\nensures appropriate escalation should that be required. It also ensures those who require \\nmedical attention receive it in a timely way and that those women/people, for whom it is \\nappropriate, are discharged by the midwife. \\n\\n2.0 Scope \\n \\nThis guideline is for use by: \\n \\n Midwives \\n Obstetricians \\n Maternity and Health Care Assistants \\n\\n3.0 Responsibilities \\n \\nIt is the responsibility of all midwifery and medical staff to: \\n \\n Access, read, understand, and apply this guidance. \\n Attend any mandatory training pertaining to this guidance. \\n \\nIt is the responsibility of the division to: \\n \\n Ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \\nrecommendations. \\n Ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. \\n\\n4.0 Abbreviations used within this guideline \\n \\nBSOTS\\n \\n- Birmingham Symptom specific \\nObstetric Triage System \\nMEOWS – Modified Early Obstetric \\nWarning Score \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 5 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nTAC - Triage Assessment Card MIS – Maternity Information System \\nADAU - Antenatal Day Assessment Unit APH – Antepartum Haemorrhage \\nSROM – Spontaneous Rupture of \\nMembranes \\nANC – Antenatal Clinic \\nIOL – Induction of Labour CMW – Community Midwife \\n\\n5.0 Introduction and key points \\n \\nMaternity Triage systems are designed to ensure the woman receives the level and quality of care \\nappropriate to their clinical needs and the resources available are used most effectively. \\nIt involves a process of prioritising the order in which women/people receive obstetric and/or \\nmidwifery attention on arrival to the Maternity Services, guiding treatment according to clinical need. \\n \\nThe Birmingham Symptom specific Obstetric Triage system (BSOTs) is based on the established \\ntriage systems used in Emergency medicine and uses a uniform assessment and clinical \\nprioritisation of the common conditions that women/people present with in maternity triage. \\n \\nBSOTS bundle includes: \\n \\n Completion of a standard clinical triage assessment by a midwife within 15 minutes of the \\nwoman/person’s attendance. This includes taking a brief maternal/birthing parent history, \\ncompletion of baseline maternal/birthing parent observations (temperature, pulse, \\nrespirations and blood pressure), assessment of pain levels, abdominal palpation and \\nauscultation of the fetal heart rate (if the woman/person is antenatal) and should take \\nabout 5-10 minutes to undertake. \\n This assessment is used to define a category of clinical urgency using symptom specific \\nalgorithms, which guides timing of subsequent assessment and immediate care (by an \\nObstetrician if required). \\n Standardised symptom-specific algorithms are used for allocation of clinical priority and \\nthe immediate care and further investigations of the eight commonest reasons for \\nattendance (Abdominal pain, antenatal bleeding, hypertension, ruptured membranes, \\nreduced fetal movements, suspected labour, unwell/other and postnatal) The BSOTs \\ndocumentation supports and standardised the completion of the clinical tasks required \\nand aids decision making. \\n\\n6.0 Telephone Triage (Maternity Helpline) \\n \\nMost attendances are preceded with either a self-referring phone call to the Maternity Helpline or \\nreferral from another healthcare worker such as a Community Midwife or GP. \\n \\nWomen/people are then advised to attend Triage, ideally with a recommended timeframe. \\nIf a woman/person phones the department, prior to arrival at Triage, a telephone assessment \\nshould be undertaken using the BSOTs standardised Telephone Triage Assessment proforma (see \\nAppendix 3). \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 6 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nThis directs the documentation of necessary information and the advice given to the woman/person, \\nit does not attempt to prioritise the woman/person’s clinical urgency over the telephone. \\n \\nDetails of the phone call, advice given and plans made must be recorded on MIS. The phone book \\nis only to be used only in the event where MIS is offline or otherwise inaccessible. \\n \\nWomen/people and babies should be referred to the appropriate area, according to the history \\ngiven; using the ‘Referral Criteria for Maternity Calls’ (see Appendix 1). The Triage Midwife is \\nresponsible for liaising with the appropriate clinical area prior to the admission. \\n\\n6.1 Pathway for managing Covid-19 positive tests on telephone triage \\n \\nFor women and people who are calling following a positive covid test – the ‘Covid Positive Calls \\nPathway’ should be followed (see Appendix 7). \\n\\n6.2 Pathway for managing early pregnancy suspected miscarriage on telephone triage \\n \\nFor women/people with early pregnancy vaginal bleeding please see appendix 10 for referral \\npathway. \\n\\n6.3 Pathway for managing concerns with care raised by women/people \\n \\nFor women/people who express a concern with their care, the Triage Midwife should follow the \\nflowchart in appendix 8. \\n\\n7.0 BSOTS Process \\n \\n Once the woman/person has presented to the department, the triage process is started. \\nAnd the time of attendance noted (see Appendix 4). \\n Define appropriate symptom specific Triage Assessment Card (TAC) to be used for the \\nassessment (see Appendix 4). \\n Undertake a standardised Initial Triage Assessment – within 15 minutes of arrival \\n Define level of urgency using symptom specific algorithm (and complete immediate care \\nas per algorithm) Red or Orange Yellow or Green. \\no Red or Orange: Immediate/urgent care to be seen in Triage main area (Labour \\nWard) for on-going care. \\no Yellow or Green: Await further assessment in the Triage room \\n Each symptom specific algorithm has a definition of maximum treatment thresholds: \\ntimeframes within which women and people were to be seen based on their level of \\nurgency. These timeframes determine the recommended interval between initial triage \\nand ongoing assessment and care. \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 7 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n7.1 Recommended BSOTs category and maximum time to treatment/next assessment \\n\\nAlongside the time-limited thresholds are the performance indicators setting the bench mark of \\nachievement to maximise safety. These defined time frames are also be used for local audit and \\nlocal assessment and allocation of midwifery and medical staff within the triage department (Labour \\nWard). \\n\\n7.2 BSOTs Process Flowchart \\n\\nBSOTS category \\nMaximum time until \\ntreatment \\nRed Immediate \\nOrange 15 minutes \\nYellow 1 hour \\nGreen 4 hours \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 8 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n7.3 The Initial Triage Assessment \\n \\nThe initial triage assessment to determine the urgency with which women/ people will need to be \\nseen will be carried out in the Labour Ward Triage Room which is the dedicated initial triage \\nassessment area. \\n \\nAll women/people attending will be seen and assessed quickly on entering the department; the \\ninitial triage assessment should be undertaken by a dedicated initial assessor midwife (“the BSOTs \\nMidwife”) in the designated room. \\n \\nThe BSOTs midwife will assess the woman/person’s condition using a standardised assessment. \\nThis should take approximately 5-10 minutes. \\n \\nFollowing their initial triage assessment, women/people will be seen in the order of their clinical \\nneed (not on arrival time) and should be informed when they are likely to be seen. \\n \\nStandardised bespoke documentation is available for each of the 6 presenting symptoms and \\ncontains initial assessment and immediate care and investigations. \\n \\nAbdominal Pain Antenatal Bleeding \\nHypertension Postnatal \\nUnwell/Other Ruptured Membranes \\n \\nThe initial assessment will allocate a level of urgency using the appropriate symptom specific \\nalgorithm and this will define which further assessment and investigations should take place. \\n \\nThis initial triage assessment will include: \\n \\n Discussion of reasons for attending (and selection of appropriate documentation). \\n Observing the woman/person’s general appearance. \\n MEOWS assessment (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respirations, oxygen \\nsaturation (if applicable), urine output, neurological response, amniotic fluid loss (if \\napplicable), lochia (if applicable). \\n Abdominal palpation and auscultation of the fetal heart. \\n Woman/person’s perception of her pain. \\n Level of urgency to prioritise care. \\n Plan of immediate care. \\n \\nThe standard follow-on care and investigations (depending on primary reason for attending and will \\nbe symptom specific) will be done in a timely manner by a midwife from the Labour Ward. \\n \\nWomen/ people assigned a category of urgency requiring emergency or urgent care (red or orange) \\nshould be kept in the Labour Ward clinical area. \\n \\nWomen/ people assigned a less urgent category (yellow or green) can return to the Triage room \\n(assessment room) to await further assessment as defined by their category. \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 9 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nIt is important that clinical staff can exercise their clinical judgement when deciding on the \\nwomen/people’s category of urgency, but this should only be used to increase the category of \\nurgency. Clinical indicators (such as maternal/birthing parent BP or pulse/MEOWS) should never be \\noverridden. \\n\\n7.4 Antenatal Triage Assessment Card \\n \\nThe Antenatal Triage Assessment Card (TAC card) provides a concise summary of the triage \\nassessment and should include (see Appendix 4): \\n \\n Maternal/Birthing Parent name, DOB and Hospital number. \\n The date and time arrival and initial assessment in triage, together with the midwife’s \\nname and PIN and/or stamp. \\n The women/people’s gestation, gravity/ parity and blood group. \\n A summary of symptoms on arrival, relevant medical, obstetric, social and lifestyle history, \\ntogether with current pregnancy, medications and allergies. \\n Assessment, including temperature, pulse, respirations and blood pressure (MEOWS), \\nurinalysis and pain levels. \\n Assessment of the fetus, including lie and presentation pattern of fetal movements and \\nfetal heart rate, including if necessary, a Reduced Fetal Movement checklist. \\n Using the symptom specific algorithms and information from the initial triage, leads to \\nassessment of category of urgency (red, orange, yellow, green). The category can be \\nraised as a result of clinical judgement but may not be lowered. \\n The immediate plan of care is then summarised. \\n\\n7.5 BSOTs Algorithms \\n \\nBased on the presenting symptoms, maternal/birthing parent and fetal observations, each algorithm \\nwhen followed gives the category of urgency to be determined for each of the reasons for \\nattendance (red/orange/yellow/green) (see Appendix 4). \\n \\nIt is important that clinical staff can exercise their clinical judgement when deciding on the \\nwomen/people’s category of urgency, but this should only be used to increase the category of \\nurgency. Clinical indicators such as maternal/birthing parent blood pressure or pulse should not be \\noverridden. \\n \\nThe BSOTS algorithm also details the immediate subsequent care required, which is dependent on \\nthe category of urgency and the presenting problem. \\n\\n7.5 Subsequent immediate care (in main Triage area / Labour Ward) \\n \\nThis details the immediate subsequent care required, which is dependent on the category of \\nurgency and the presenting reason and has been individualised for each reason for attendance and \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 10 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\ncategory of urgency. It also gives an opportunity for the midwife to request medical assessment, \\nshould that be required. \\n\\n7.6 Communication, Handover and Escalation \\n \\nHandover and transfer of care should be from one health care professional (midwife or medical \\nstaff) to another directly, ideally in person, but if this is not possible, by telephone. \\n \\nEffective communication is central to promoting maternity safety. A structured and consistent \\nhandover, handover of information and/or transfer of care between staff should be based on the \\nSBAR tool that covers details on the woman/person’s Situation, Background, Assessment, and \\nRecommendations. \\n\\nAny delays or breaches to BSOTs initial assessments or waiting times must be escalated to the \\nLabour Ward Co-ordinator and a DATIX completed. \\n\\n7.7 Communication with the woman \\n \\nThe BSOTs midwife should: \\n \\n Communicate what is happening next, and who will see them next. \\n Re-assure that their information will be passed on to the next care provider. \\n \\nThe Assessment midwife should: \\n \\n Re-assure that their information has been passed on from their previous provider. \\n Consider re-capping the history to reassure the woman/person that you have the \\nappropriate information. Ensure a holistic assessment of the woman/person’s condition is \\nundertaken. \\n Provide appropriate advice on discharge and arrange follow up appointments if \\nnecessary. \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 11 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nThe Obstetrician should: \\n \\n Re-assure that their information has been passed on from their previous provider. \\n Consider re-capping the history to reassure the woman/person that you have the \\nappropriate information. \\n \\nAn appropriate translation service should be used for non-English speaking patients \\n\\n7.8 BSOTs Staffing requirements \\n \\nLocal midwifery and medical staffing numbers and skill mix will depend on how busy the maternity \\ntriage department is and may vary with different shift times throughout the day. The priority must be \\nto undertake the initial triage within 15 minutes of arrival, and numbers of staff will therefore depend \\non the numbers of women/people that attend. \\n\\n8.0 Antenatal Day Assessment Unit (ADAU) \\n \\n The assessment of women and people requiring review in ADAU should be documented \\nwithin the free text pages of the handheld Antenatal record and on MIS. \\n A medical obstetric review should be requested following the assessment if indicated. \\n If admission is indicated, the ADAU midwife is responsible for liaising with the relevant \\nclinicians. The Labour ward Co-ordinator should be informed of all admissions. \\n\\n9.0 Neonatal referrals from community \\n \\nBabies who require hospital review / admission should be advised to come to the most appropriate \\narea using the ‘Referral pathway from community’ (see Appendix 6). \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 12 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n8.0 Audit \\n \\nMonitoring Method Frequency \\nNumber of women and people seen within 30 minutes Audit Annual \\nNumber of women and people seen within timeframe for red, \\norange, yellow and green \\nAudit Annual \\nNumber of red flags – women and people not triaged within \\n30 minutes from time of arrival – due to midwifery staffing \\nAudit Annual \\n\\nReferences \\n \\nBSOTs Training Manual \\n \\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London (2012) Triage in Maternity (Maternity Guideline) \\n \\nEast Lancashire NHS Trust (2011) Antenatal Triage Guidelines \\n\\nCG13019 Triage of maternity patients guideline v5.1 July 2023 Page 13 of 25 \\n \\nPlease check against the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nAppendix 1: Referral criteria for telephone triage calls \\n\\nA & E \\n \\n Less than 16 weeks with: severe pain +/- bleeding -
