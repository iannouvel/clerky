Key points: - **Pregnancy Dating & Combined Test**: Measure crown-rump length (CRL) and NT to one decimal point. Use the larger CRL in twin pregnancies for risk calculation. - **NT Measurement**: Follow standardized criteria for placement of calipers. If NT cannot be obtained, document reasons. - **Increased NT**: Requires further assessment and counseling. - **Twin Pregnancies**: - Offer combined test (preferred); measure NT for each fetus. - Dichorionic twins: Individual risk results. Monochorionic twins: Shared risk result. - If combined test is missed, offer second-trimester quadruple test (less sensitive, Downâ€™s syndrome only). - Use larger head circumference (HC) if CRL >84mm in quadruple test. - **Vanished Twin**: Document non-viable fetus or empty sac; adjust screening approach accordingly. Emphasis is on accurate measurement, standardized reporting, and patient counseling for informed decision-making",
