Healthcare Professional: Great, let's start with some basic information. How old are you?

Patient: I'm 32 years old.

Healthcare Professional: Have you been pregnant before?

Patient: Yes, this is my second pregnancy.

Healthcare Professional: How was your previous delivery experience?

Healthcare Professional: I see. What are your concerns or expectations for this pregnancy?

Patient: I'm worried about the possibility of another C-section and I hope for a smoother delivery this time.
