This is particularly important for this patient with suspected Asherman's syndrome as she needs clear expectations about the diagnostic and potential therapeutic nature of the procedure.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Antibiotic prophylaxis: Single-dose doxycycline 100 mg PO pre-hysteroscopy\" with \"Reconsider routine antibiotic prophylaxis as not recommended unless infection suspected\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, but antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected.' In this case with no signs of infection (no fever, no malodorous discharge), routine antibiotics may not be necessary. This change would align with evidence-based practice.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Diagnostic hysteroscopy + adhesiolysis (planned under GA)\" with \"Consider outpatient hysteroscopy with vaginoscopic approach as first-line diagnostic method\" (Reason: The guideline recommends: 'Vaginoscopy should be the standard technique for outpatient hysteroscopy unless a vaginal speculum is required' and 'All gynaecology departments should provide a dedicated outpatient hysteroscopy service.' For this diagnostic case without severe adhesions suspected, outpatient approach may be appropriate first-line. GA should be reserved for complex cases or failed outpatient attempts.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: discussion of pain management options for hysteroscopy\" with \"Discuss pain management options including NSAIDs pre-procedure and consider warmed saline distension\" (Reason: Guideline states: 'A statistically significant reduction in pain was demonstrated with NSAIDs' and 'Warming saline to body temperature can be considered for outpatient hysteroscopy.' Given this patient's history of multiple uterine procedures which may increase pain sensitivity, proactive pain management should be discussed.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: documentation of informed consent process specific to hysteroscopy\" with \"Document specific informed consent process including discussion of potential pain/distress and alternative settings/modes of anesthesia\" (Reason: Guideline requires: 'Women should be given verbal and/or written informed consent prior to hysteroscopy, and should be informed of the potential pain and distress during the procedure' and 'Women should be made aware of other settings and modes of anaesthesia for hysteroscopy.' This is particularly important for this infertility patient who may have heightened anxiety about the procedure.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Consider IU balloon stent post-adhesiolysis\" with \"If adhesiolysis performed, consider mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems over bipolar electrodes if needed\" (Reason: Guideline recommends: 'Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems should be preferred over miniature bipolar electrodes.' While the IU balloon may still be appropriate for adhesion prevention, any tissue removal should use preferred mechanical systems to reduce pain and improve outcomes in this fertility patient.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",
