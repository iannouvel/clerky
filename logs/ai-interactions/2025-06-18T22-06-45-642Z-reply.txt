Avoid umbilical cord bilirubin, ETCOc, or DAT for hyperbilirubinaemia prediction. - **Treatment**: - **Phototherapy**: Start if bilirubin exceeds threshold; stop once below threshold. Provide parental education. - **Exchange transfusion**: Required for severe hyperbilirubinaemia or acute bilirubin encephalopathy; perform in tertiary units with parental counseling. - **IVIG**: Adjunct to phototherapy in select cases. - **Prolonged jaundice (term ≥14 days, preterm ≥21 days)**: Assess for pale stools/dark urine, measure conjugated bilirubin, perform FBC, blood group/DAT, urine culture, and metabolic screening. Refer if conjugated bilirubin >25 µmol/L. - **Monitoring**: Continuous phototherapy during/after exchange transfusion",
