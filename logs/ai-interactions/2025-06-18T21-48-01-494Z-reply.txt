Document birth plans (place, timing, mode, analgesia) by 28 weeks. - **Monitoring**: Screen for complications (e.g., TTTS, growth restriction). Refer to tertiary care for TTTS (stages II-V) or complex cases. Fetoscopic laser ablation is preferred for TTTS before 26 weeks. - **Preterm Birth**: Offer aspirin prophylaxis for hypertension. Monitor for preterm labor but avoid routine interventions. - **Birth Planning**: - Uncomplicated twins: Vaginal birth or caesarean section (CS) after 32 weeks. - Monoamniotic twins/triplets: Consider CS. - Continuous CTG monitoring in labor (>26 weeks), with senior review for abnormal traces. - **Intrapartum Management**: - Active management for second twin birth. - Double clamp cords for blood gas sampling. - Fetal scalp electrode or CS if CTG pathological. - **Postpartum**: Monitor for hypoglycemia, manage hemorrhage risk, and follow bereavement care if needed. - **Documentation**: Label fetuses via ultrasound, schedule multidisciplinary reviews, and record care plans.
