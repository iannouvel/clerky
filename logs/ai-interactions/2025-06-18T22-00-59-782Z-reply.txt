Key risk factors include prior cesarean birth, high parity, and pregnancy complications. **Clinical Signs:** - Prolonged, intense contractions with poor labor progress (<0.5 cm/hr). - Severe, constant abdominal/scar pain, maternal tachycardia, vomiting, or shock. - Sudden \"giving way\" sensation with cessation of contractions. - Fetal distress (abnormal CTG) or severe compromise. **Management:** 1. **Emergency response:** Call for help, alert theater, notify pediatric team, stabilize ABCs. 2. **Surgery:** Immediate laparotomy to deliver fetus, repair uterus, or perform hysterectomy if needed. 3. **Postoperative care:** Monitor in Recovery/Critical Care, check FBC, involve neonatal/chaplaincy support. **Future Pregnancies:** Advise elective cesarean for women with prior uterine rupture. **Quality Improvement:** Audit cases to improve outcomes. Vigilance, continuous fetal monitoring, and prompt intervention are critical",
