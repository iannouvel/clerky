This is particularly important for assessing deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) which is suspected in this case. The current recommendation should specify specialist interpretation to ensure accurate assessment of potential bowel/ureteric involvement.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Laparoscopic excision + adhesiolysis (if MRI confirms DIE)\" with \"Laparoscopic excision (not ablation) + adhesiolysis by a specialist endometriosis surgeon (if MRI confirms DIE)\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'Perform surgery for endometriosis laparoscopically unless there are contraindications' and 'Consider excision rather than ablation to treat endometriomas.' Given this patient's history of endometrioma and suspected DIE, excision is preferred over ablation. The surgeon should have specialist training in endometriosis surgery.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Hormonal suppression post-op (e.g., Mirena/IUS or GnRH analogues)\" with \"Discuss hormonal suppression options post-op (e.g., Mirena/IUS or GnRH analogues) based on patient's symptoms and fertility plans\" (Reason: The guideline recommends: 'Offer endometriosis treatment according to the woman's symptoms, preferences, and priorities rather than the stage of the endometriosis.' Since this patient is TTC, hormonal options should be carefully discussed considering their impact on fertility plans.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: discussion of non-pharmacological pain management options\" with \"Consider adding discussion of non-pharmacological pain management options (e.g., physiotherapy, TENS, psychological support)\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'For women with endometriosis-related pain, discuss the benefits and risks of analgesics' and has a section on non-pharmacological management. Given this patient's chronic pain refractory to NSAIDs, alternative approaches should be discussed.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Fertility counselling (consider IVF if persistent subfertility)\" with \"Urgent fertility counselling with reproductive specialist (consider IVF given 18 months subfertility with known endometriosis)\" (Reason: The guideline recommends: 'Discuss the benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery as a treatment option for women with deep endometriosis trying to conceive.' Given this patient's prolonged subfertility and known endometriosis, more urgent fertility evaluation is warranted rather than waiting for persistent subfertility.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

    - **CA-125** **85 IU/mL** (↑).  
  - **Awaiting:** MRI pelvis (requested for **DIE assessment**).
