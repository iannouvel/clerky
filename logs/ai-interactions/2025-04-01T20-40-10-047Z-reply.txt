### **Guideline Text (ESHRE Guideline - 2022 - Endometriosis)**  
**Key Recommendations:**  
1. **Diagnosis of Endometriosis:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first-line imaging modality for suspected endometriosis, particularly for deep endometriosis and ovarian endometriomas.  
   - MRI may be considered if TVUS is inconclusive or for preoperative mapping.  
   - Laparoscopy with histologic confirmation remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.  

2. **Management of Endometriosis-Related Pain:**  
   - NSAIDs are first-line for pain management.  
   - Hormonal therapies (e.g., combined oral contraceptives, progestins, GnRH agonists) should be considered for long-term suppression.  
   - Surgical excision should be offered if medical therapy fails or for large endometriomas (>4 cm).  

3. **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB) in Endometriosis:**  
   - Hormonal IUDs (e.g., Mirena) are effective for HMB and pain.  
   - Tranexamic acid may be used adjunctively but does not treat underlying endometriosis.  

4. **Fertility Considerations:**  
   - Women with endometriosis and fertility concerns should be referred for early reproductive counseling.  

5. **Multidisciplinary Care:**  
   - Psychological support should be integrated into care for patients with chronic pelvic pain.

<p>
### Summary <br>
- 26-year-old female with BMI 52 (obese). <br>
- G2P1 (1 term vaginal delivery, 1 first-trimester miscarriage). <br>
- Presenting complaints: <br>
- Recurrent left lower quadrant pelvic pain (non-cyclical, post-coital bleeding, exacerbated by standing). <br>
- Irregular heavy menstrual bleeding (cycles 21–45 days, flooding/clotting, fatigue/dizziness suggestive of anemia). <br>
- PMH: PCOS, insulin resistance, depression, recurrent bacterial vaginosis. <br>
- PSH: Appendectomy, cesarean section. <br>
- Social: Smokes 5 cigarettes/day, inconsistent condom use. <br><br>

### Detailed Assessment <br>
- <b>Recurrent Pelvic Pain</b>: Intermittent sharp left lower quadrant pain for 3 months, non-cyclical, worsened by standing, and associated with post-coital bleeding. <br>
- No fever or urinary symptoms. <br>
- Exam reveals left adnexal fullness, possibly a complex cyst (endometrioma vs. hemorrhagic cyst). <br>
- Differential includes endometriosis or PCOS-related cyst. <br>
- <b>Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB)</b>: Irregular cycles (21–45 days) with prolonged bleeding (7–10 days) and clotting. <br>
- Fatigue and dizziness suggest anemia. <br>
- Likely AUB-O due to PCOS/obesity. <br>
- <b>Other Concerns</b>: Anxiety regarding fertility and ovarian cancer risk (family history). <br>
- Exam findings: obese, acanthosis nigricans, pale conjunctiva, bulky uterus. <br><br>

### Plan <br>
1. <b>Investigations</b>: <br>
   - <i>Transvaginal pelvic USS (preferred over abdominal USS) to assess adnexal mass and endometrial thickness</i> (ESHRE Guideline - Endometriosis). <br>
   - Bloods: FBC (anemia), HbA1c (diabetes screening), <i>CA-125 (not routinely recommended for endometriosis diagnosis; consider only if malignancy suspected)</i> (ESHRE Guideline - Endometriosis). <br>
2. <b>Symptomatic Management</b>: <br>
   - Tranexamic acid for HMB; iron supplementation if anemic. <br>
   - NSAIDs for pain (avoid opioids due to depression). <br>
3. <b>Long-Term Management</b>: <br>
   - Weight loss support (bariatric referral if interested). <br>
   - <i>Hormonal options (Mirena IUD first-line for HMB/endometriosis; progestins as alternative)</i> (ESHRE Guideline - Endometriosis). <br>
4. <b>Follow-Up</b>: <br>
   - Review USS in 2 weeks; <i>consider laparoscopy if cyst >4 cm/persistent pain</i> (ESHRE Guideline - Endometriosis). <br>
   - Screen for depression exacerbation (counselor referral). <br>
5. <b>Counseling</b>: Reassured no immediate malignancy concerns; advised smoking cessation. <br>
   - <i>Offer fertility counseling due to endometriosis/PCOS concerns</i> (ESHRE Guideline - Endometriosis). <br>
</p>
```

### **Key Adjustments and Rationale**  
1. **Imaging**: TVUS is preferred over abdominal USS for endometriosis evaluation (guideline recommendation).  
2. **CA-125**: Not routinely indicated for endometriosis (guideline cautions against overuse).  
3. **Hormonal Therapy**: Mirena IUD is first-line for HMB/endometriosis per guidelines.  
4. **Surgical Threshold**: Laparoscopy suggested for cysts >4 cm (guideline cutoff).  
5. **Fertility Counseling**: Added based on guideline emphasis for endometriosis patients.  

The note now aligns more closely with evidence-based practices for endometriosis management.
