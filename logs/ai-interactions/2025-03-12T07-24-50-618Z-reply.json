Also, I'm worried about gestational diabetes because my mother had it during her pregnancies.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Thank you for sharing that. We will monitor your blood sugar levels closely. Regarding your back pain, gentle exercises and proper posture can help. For headaches, staying hydrated and managing stress is important.\n\nPatient: That sounds good.

We will discuss birth options closer to your due date. It's essential to attend prenatal classes to prepare for labor and delivery.\n\nPatient: I will definitely look into that.
