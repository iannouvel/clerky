**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Last menstrual period (LMP): 6 weeks ago (now 2 weeks late).

- No known chronic illnesses.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Emergency Caesarean section 2 years ago (indication: fetal distress).  
- No other surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche: 12 years.  
- Cycle: Previously regular (28-day cycle), now irregular post-miscarriages.  
- Contraception: Previously used COCP, stopped 4 months ago. Now relies on condoms.

  - 2nd pregnancy (age 17): Miscarriage at 8 weeks (spontaneous, no intervention).  
  - 3rd pregnancy (age 17): Miscarriage at 10 weeks (medically managed with misoprostol).

**Social History:**  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- No recreational drug use.  
- Lives with parents; moderate social support.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about another miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.  
- **Concerns:** Fear of fertility issues due to recurrent losses.  
- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on diagnosis and reassurance about future pregnancies.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Mild pallor, alert, no distress.  
- Abdomen: Soft, tender in left iliac fossa with mild guarding. No rebound tenderness.  
- Speculum exam: Small amount of dark blood in vault, cervix appears closed.  
- Bimanual exam: Cervical motion tenderness present. Left adnexal tenderness, no palpable mass.  
- Observations: BP 100/65, HR 88, afebrile.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Suspected ectopic pregnancy** (given history of amenorrhoea, bleeding, unilateral pain, and risk factors: prior pelvic surgery, smoking).  
2. **Rule out incomplete miscarriage** (given prior losses and irregular bleeding).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Urgent investigations:**  
   - Serum β-hCG (quantitative) + repeat in 48h to assess trend.  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess for intrauterine vs. extrauterine pregnancy.  
   - FBC (anaemia screen), group and save (if surgical intervention needed).  
2. **Immediate advice:**  
   - Attend ED if severe pain/bleeding or syncope.  
   - Avoid intercourse until cleared.  
3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review in 48h with results.  
   - If ectopic confirmed, discuss methotrexate vs. surgical management.  
4. **Long-term:**  
   - Contraception counselling (e.g., progesterone-only options if breastfeeding).  
   - Smoking cessation referral.  
   - Psychological support for pregnancy anxiety.  

**Prognosis:**  
- Guarded until imaging confirms location of pregnancy.  
- Recurrent miscarriage risk warrants future preconception counselling.
