### Summary:  
- Age: 36 years  
- BMI: 44 (obesity class III)  
- Gravida: 1, Para: 1 (prior uncomplicated vaginal delivery)  
- Presenting complaints:  
  - Irregular heavy menstrual bleeding for 6 months, with clots and fatigue.  
  - Secondary subfertility (18 months of unsuccessful conception).  
- PMH: PCOS, obesity, gestational diabetes (diet-controlled), depression (on sertraline).  

### Detailed Issues & Advice:  
1. **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB):**  
   - Reports irregular cycles (21–45 days), prolonged bleeding (7–10 days), and heavy flow (6–8 pads/day) with clots.  
   - Fatigue and dizziness suggest possible anaemia.  
   - Uterus slightly bulky on exam; no palpable masses or adnexal pathology.  
   - Plan: Tranexamic acid + cyclical norethisterone; consider endometrial ablation/Mirena IUS if medical therapy fails.  

2. **Subfertility:**  
   - Prior spontaneous conception; no pelvic pain/dyspareunia.  
   - Obesity (BMI 44) likely contributing; anovulation suspected due to PCOS.  
   - Plan: Weight management (dietitian/bariatric referral), ovulation induction (clomiphene citrate if tubal patency confirmed), and further tests (Day 21 progesterone, HSG).  

3. **Anaemia:**  
   - Fatigue/dizziness concerning for iron deficiency.  
   - Plan: Iron supplementation if Hb confirms anaemia.  

### Plan:  
1. Investigations:  
   - Bloods (FBC, HbA1c, TSH, prolactin, testosterone).  
   - Pelvic ultrasound (endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, fibroids/polyps).  
   - Hysteroscopy if ultrasound abnormal.  
2. Heavy bleeding:  
   - Start tranexamic acid + cyclical norethisterone.  
   - Surgical options (ablation/Mirena) if medical therapy fails.  
3. Subfertility:  
   - Refer to dietitian/bariatric team for weight management.  
   - Ovulation induction (clomiphene) post-tubal patency confirmation.  
   - Arrange Day 21 progesterone and HSG.  
4. Anaemia: Iron supplementation if Hb low.  
5. Follow-up in 2 weeks for results and fertility discussion.  
6. Advise cycle tracking with ovulation kits.
