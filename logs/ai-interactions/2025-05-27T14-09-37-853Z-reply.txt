A: **Dictation: Clinical Interaction – Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**  
*Date: [Fictional Date] | Clinician: Dr. [Fictional Name] | Patient: [Fictional Name], Age 37*  

**Subjective:**  
The patient is a 37-year-old female (BMI 20.9, G3P3) presenting with a 4-month history of abnormal uterine bleeding. She reports irregular cycles with episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, accompanied by clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but admits to occasional pelvic discomfort. She has no history of dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding. Her last Pap smear was 2 years ago (reported as normal). She uses condoms for contraception and has no known medical conditions. She takes no regular medications and has no allergies. Family history is notable for a mother with hypothyroidism.  

*Incomplete history:*  
- No documented menstrual cycle frequency prior to symptoms.  
- No inquiry about symptoms of anemia (e.g., fatigue, dizziness).  
- Sexual activity frequency and impact on bleeding not explored.  
- Diet/exercise habits and recent weight changes not assessed.  

**Objective:**  
- Vital signs: BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile.  
- General appearance: No pallor or distress.  
- Abdominal exam: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- Pelvic exam deferred today due to patient discomfort.  
- No speculum or bimanual exam performed.  

*Incomplete examination:*  
- No documentation of uterine size or adnexal tenderness.  
- No assessment for signs of hirsutism/acne (possible PCOS).  

**Assessment:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient. Differential includes:  
1. Hormonal imbalance (e.g., anovulatory cycles).  
2. Structural causes (e.g., fibroids, polyps—though not confirmed without imaging).  
3. Less likely: Coagulopathy or thyroid dysfunction (no testing yet).  

**Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - CBC to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH to rule out thyroid dysfunction.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for structural abnormalities.  
   - *Omitted:* Coagulation studies (despite heavy bleeding), endometrial biopsy (given age >35 and prolonged symptoms).  

2. **Management:**  
   - Start tranexamic acid 1g TID during heavy bleeding days.  
   - Consider trial of combined oral contraceptive pill for cycle regulation if no contraindications found.  
   - *Omitted:* Discussion of progesterone-only options or referral to gynecology if symptoms persist.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Return in 4 weeks to review lab/imaging results and symptom progression.  
   - *Omitted:* Clear instructions for urgent review if worsening anemia or severe pain.  

**Patient Counseling:**  
Discussed likely benign causes but emphasized need for further evaluation. Advised to track bleeding patterns using a diary. No questions asked about patient’s reproductive goals or desire for future contraception.  

*Note: This dictation is fictional for testing purposes only. No real medical advice is implied.*  

---  
**Testing Notes:**  
- Intentional gaps include incomplete menstrual history, lack of pelvic exam details, and omitted differentials (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia).  
- Management includes initial steps but lacks contingency planning for abnormal results.  
- Patient counseling is minimal to simulate a time-constrained encounter.
