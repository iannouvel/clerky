She describes episodes of heavy menstrual bleeding lasting 8–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with occasional passage of clots. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports mild pelvic discomfort. She has no history of dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding.  \n\n**Relevant History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12, previously regular cycles until the onset of symptoms.  \n- One prior uncomplicated vaginal delivery. No history of miscarriage or gynecologic surgery.  \n- No personal or family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies.  \n- Current medications: None. Allergies: NKDA.  \n- Social history: Nonsmoker, occasional alcohol use.  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects of History (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- No documented review of systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, dizziness to assess for anemia).  \n- Contraceptive history not explored (e.g., prior use of hormonal methods).  \n- Sexual activity status not clarified.  \n- No discussion of weight changes, hirsutism, or other signs of endocrine dysfunction.  \n\n---\n\n### **Objective:**  \n**Vitals:** BP 122/78, HR 72, afebrile.  \n**General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  \n**Abdominal Exam:** Soft, nontender, no masses.  \n**Pelvic Exam (Limited Documentation):**  \n- External genitalia: Normal.  \n- Speculum: Cervix appears normal; scant blood in vault.  \n- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, normal size; no adnexal tenderness or masses.  \n\n**Incomplete Aspects of Examination (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- No documentation of cervical motion tenderness.  \n- No assessment for uterine irregularities (e.g., fibroids).  \n- No breast exam or evaluation for galactorrhea.  \n\n**No Labs or Imaging Ordered at This Visit.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Assessment:**  \n53-year-old female with abnormal uterine bleeding, likely secondary to perimenopausal hormonal changes. Differential includes:  \n1. **Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory cycles).**  \n2. **Endometrial hyperplasia (risk factors: age >45, but BMI not elevated).**  \n3. **Leiomyoma (not palpated but not ruled out).**  \n\n**Unaddressed Concerns (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- Endometrial cancer risk not quantified (e.g., no discussion of Tamoxifen use or Lynch syndrome).  \n- Thyroid dysfunction or coagulopathy not considered.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Diagnostics:**  \n   - Order CBC to evaluate for anemia.  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness and uterine structure.  \n   - Consider endometrial biopsy if ultrasound is inconclusive (not yet discussed with patient).  \n\n2. **Symptomatic Management:**  \n   - Trial of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for heavy bleeding.  \n   - Offer low-dose combined oral contraceptive pill (after BP assessment) or progestin therapy if no contraindications (not yet explored).  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Return in 4 weeks for review of results and further management.  \n   - Counseled to seek urgent care if hemorrhage or severe anemia symptoms develop.  \n\n**Incomplete Counseling (Per Testing Instructions):**  \n- No discussion of lifestyle modifications or iron supplementation.  \n- No exploration of patient’s fertility intentions (though unlikely relevant at age 53).  \n\n---  \n**Dictation Ends.**  \n\n**Note for Testing:** This fictional dictation intentionally omits key elements to simulate an incomplete clinical note for educational/QA purposes.
