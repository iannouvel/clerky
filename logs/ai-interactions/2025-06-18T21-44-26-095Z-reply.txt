It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing prevention, monitoring, and timely intervention. **Key Recommendations:** - **Prevention:** Anticipate hypothermia in at-risk neonates; maintain a warm environment and encourage skin-to-skin contact. - **At Birth:** Dry the baby immediately, promote skin-to-skin contact, and initiate feeding. - **Low Temperature Management:** Use skin-to-skin contact, continuous monitoring, and a hot cot if needed. - **Hot Cot Use:** Keep it pre-warmed, monitor temperature closely, and gradually reduce heat once stabilized. - **Ongoing Care:** Discontinue monitoring if temperature stabilizes; prioritize feeding. - **Parental Communication:** Explain procedures and management to parents. - **Audit:** Follow outlined processes in the Maternity Audit Document for compliance. Staff must use professional judgment while adhering to these guidelines",
