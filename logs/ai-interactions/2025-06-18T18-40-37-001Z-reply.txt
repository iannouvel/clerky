Document declined tests. - **Individualized Care:** Tailor care to patient needs with structured appointments, informed choice discussions, and partner involvement if desired. - **Screening & Tests:** Offer blood/urine tests, discuss blood product consent, and provide antenatal screening information. Monitor for proteinuria/UTIs; refer recurrent UTIs. - **High-Risk Pregnancies:** Refer to obstetric consultants for existing medical conditions. Identify safeguarding concerns, mental health needs, domestic abuse, and FGM risks. - **Lifestyle Advice:** Provide smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and weight management guidance (BMI <30). - **Fetal Monitoring:** Track growth and wellbeing to reduce stillbirth risk. Refer for growth scans if needed. - **Symptom Management:** Address common issues (nausea, pelvic pain, bleeding). Refer unexplained bleeding (<16 weeks to EPAC; ≥16 weeks to labour ward). - **Equity & Access:** Ensure additional support for minority ethnic, deprived, or migrant populations. Provide language assistance and unbiased information. - **Continuity of Care:** Maintain consistent care providers, update records, and ensure clear communication for complex cases. **References:** MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria",
