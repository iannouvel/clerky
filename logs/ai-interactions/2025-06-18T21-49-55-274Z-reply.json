Document thoroughly and provide postnatal follow-up discussions. - **Psychological support**: Offer referral to midwife counselors for traumatic births but avoid single-session, high-intensity trauma-focused interventions. - **Safety & reporting**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports for serious events, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
