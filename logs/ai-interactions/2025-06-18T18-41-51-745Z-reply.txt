Random glucose ≥7mmol/L requires discussion. - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or any glucose >11.0mmol/L warrants urgent referral. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Insulin adjustment needed for those on corticosteroids or during labor. - **Monitoring**: Regular blood glucose checks, especially post-corticosteroids, during hyperemesis, labor, and postpartum. - **Post-birth care**: Adjust insulin, monitor glucose, support breastfeeding with frequent glucose checks. - **Fetal surveillance**: Include 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccine per JCVI guidelines; prioritize GDM patients. - **Diabetic emergencies**: Require immediate intervention. - **Audit**: Ensure regular review of care quality for pregnant individuals with diabetes",
