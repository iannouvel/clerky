She also reports fatigue and lightheadedness, which she attributes to blood loss.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Bleeding is described as prolonged (lasting 10–14 days per cycle) and heavy (soaking through pads every 2 hours).  - Pelvic pain is dull and constant, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  - No fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  - Last menstrual period (LMP) was 3 weeks ago, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  - No recent trauma or foreign body insertion.  Past Medical History:  - Iron-deficiency anemia (diagnosed 2 years ago, on intermittent iron supplements).  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily).  - No history of diabetes, hypertension, or clotting disorders.  Past Surgical History:  - Cesarean section x2 (last one 4 years ago).  - Dilation & curettage (D&C) for incomplete miscarriage (5 years ago).  - Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (3 years ago).  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12, cycles previously regular (28–30 days).  - Dysmenorrhea since teenage years, worsening in recent months.  - History of endometriosis (diagnosed laparoscopically 3 years ago).  - Previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (treated with antibiotics 6 years ago).  - Cervical smear history: Last Pap smear 2 years ago (normal).  Drug History:  - Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  - Ferrous sulfate PRN (takes intermittently).  - No hormonal contraception (stopped combined pill 6 months ago due to migraines).  Allergy History:  - Penicillin (rash).  - No other known drug allergies.  Social History:  - Occupation: School teacher (moderate stress levels).  - Smoking: Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago).  - Alcohol: Occasional (1–2 units/week).  - Exercise: Sedentary lifestyle due to fatigue.  - Relationship status: Married, sexually active with one partner.  Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried that bleeding may be due to fibroids or cancer.  - Concerns: Anxious about impact on fertility (desires future pregnancy).  - Expectations: Wants diagnosis, treatment to stop bleeding, and reassurance.  Examination Findings:  - General: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia), no lymphadenopathy.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-distended, mild suprapubic tenderness. No palpable masses.  - Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no lesions. Active bleeding noted.  - Bimanual exam: Uterus enlarged (12-week size), irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids).  - Adnexa: Mild right-sided tenderness, no palpable masses.  - No cervical motion tenderness (unlikely acute PID).  Investigations Ordered:  1. Full blood count (FBC) – assess anemia.  2. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) – ensure optimal levothyroxine dosing.  3. Pelvic ultrasound – evaluate fibroids, endometrial thickness, ovarian pathology.  4. Endometrial biopsy (if ultrasound suggests hyperplasia).  Management Plan:  1. Symptomatic relief:     - Tranexamic acid (1g TDS during heavy bleeding).     - NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid for pain/dysmenorrhea).  2. Hormonal options:     - Progestin-only pill (to regulate cycles).     - Consider Mirena IUD (if endometrial biopsy normal).  3. Surgical options (if fibroids confirmed):     - Myomectomy (if future fertility desired).     - Hysteroscopic resection (if submucosal fibroids).  4. Follow-up:     - Review in 2 weeks with investigation results.     - Discuss endometriosis management if pain persists.  Patient Counselling:  - Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  - Advised on iron-rich diet and regular iron supplements.  - Encouraged gradual exercise to improve fatigue.  - Provided contraception counselling (Mirena may reduce bleeding and protect fertility).  Next Steps:  - Await ultrasound and biopsy results.  - Consider gynaecology referral if medical management fails.
