Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact post-birth, and early milk expression for separated mothers. Assess feeding in the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes to avoid teat confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, ready-made formula, and clear bottles. Limit supplementation to medical needs. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleeping (cot by bed, avoid sofa co-sleeping). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments; refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). Report re-admissions for feeding problems. Supplementation is discouraged unless medically indicated, with efforts to preserve breastmilk supply. Parents receive tailored support for their feeding choices",
