      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Indication for Induction:** Recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce stillbirth risk, particularly in Black/Asian women and deprived areas. - **Membrane Sweep:** Offer at 38 weeks and from 39 weeks for those aiming for vaginal birth. - **High-Risk Groups:** Women with BMI â‰¥30 should discuss induction at 36-38 weeks and be offered it by 40 weeks. - **Methods:** Include membrane sweep, cervical balloon catheter, dinoprostone, ARM, and oxytocin infusion. Avoid routine induction in precipitate labor, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Check maternal/fetal wellbeing, gestation, and Bishop Score. - **Cervical Ripening:** Balloon catheter (outpatient/inpatient) or dinoprostone gel (individualized). Monitor for complications. - **Oxytocin Use:** Start after obstetric review; titrate to achieve adequate contractions. Monitor maternal/fetal observations closely. - **Special Circumstances:** Preterm labor, IUFD, previous C-section, diabetes, obesity, PROM. For PROM at term, offer induction or expectant management with close monitoring. - **Complications:** Manage uterine hyperstimulation with fetal assessment, tocolysis, or emergency delivery if rupture suspected. - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24-48 hours; options include further attempts or C-section. - **Monitoring:** Regular CTG, temperature checks (if PROM), and documentation of all procedures. **Key Points:** - Individualize counseling on risks/benefits. - Adhere to protocols for dinoprostone/oxytocin administration. - Prioritize fetal wellbeing and maternal choice. - Audit outcomes to improve practice.
