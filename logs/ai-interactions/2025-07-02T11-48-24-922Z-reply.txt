This analysis focuses on identifying areas where the clinical documentation can be improved according to the specific guideline requirements.\n\nGuideline: Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Neonatal Outcomes in Preterm Birth\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nAntenatal corticosteroids given within seven days prior to preterm birth reduce perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids. Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth, and benefits are still seen if given within 24 hours of birth.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation. Steroids have short-term respiratory benefits for the neonate but may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons. Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended. Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage, corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth is likely. Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. There is limited evidence to recommend repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after administration. The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS in pregnancies that birth between 24 hours and 7 days of administration of the second dose.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids have shown significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage among infants born within specific time frames after administration. There is a reduction in fetal and neonatal death for births within 24 hours to seven days after administration. However, caution is advised in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Population-based cohort studies support the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with the largest effect seen 24 hours to seven days after the first injection. Concerns about potential risks to both women and babies include effects on maternal blood glucose levels, fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, long-term metabolic and neurological consequences, and potential impacts on brain development. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of maternal and neonatal hospital services are available.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids should not be delayed in serious maternal or fetal conditions. In the presence of systemic infection, the use of corticosteroids should be carefully balanced due to the risk of exacerbating the infection. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies. The maximum number of corticosteroid courses in pregnancy should not exceed three. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions and to investigate potential off-target effects. Recommendations for future research include determining the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing neonatal morbidity in elective caesarean births at term and investigating the safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancies and women with diabetes. Auditable topics include discussions about corticosteroids in planned caesarean births and the proportion of women offered corticosteroids for preterm birth. Support groups and useful links are provided for further information.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroids for reducing adverse maternal and child outcomes in special populations of women at risk of imminent preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
