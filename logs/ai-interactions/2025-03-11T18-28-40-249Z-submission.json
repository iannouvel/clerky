When symptoms are related, combine them into one concise issue. Do not number the issues; simply list one per line.\n\nExample Output: \nPainful, irregular heavy periods\nSubfertility\nConsidering diagnostic laparoscopy for endometriosis\n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\nPatient: Hi, I've been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles lately and have been having trouble getting pregnant.\n\nHealthcare Professional: I see, irregular periods can sometimes indicate hormonal imbalances or other underlying issues. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the irregular cycles?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've also been having some pelvic pain and discomfort during intercourse.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Pelvic pain and pain during intercourse can be concerning. It's important to rule out conditions like endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Have you had any previous surgeries or infections in the pelvic area?\n\nPatient: I had a laparoscopic surgery a few years ago for ovarian cyst removal.\n\nHealthcare Professional: That's important information. The previous surgery could be relevant to your current symptoms. We may need to consider the possibility of adhesions or scar tissue causing your symptoms. I recommend further evaluation with imaging studies and possibly a referral to a gynecologist for a more detailed assessment.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I'm also worried about my fertility. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of getting pregnant?\n\nHealthcare Professional: Improving fertility can involve various factors, including lifestyle modifications, tracking ovulation, and sometimes fertility treatments. We can discuss these options further once we have a clearer understanding of the underlying cause of your difficulties conceiving. Let's focus on investigating and addressing your current symptoms first.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your help and guidance. I appreciate your thorough approach to addressing my concerns.\n\nHealthcare Professional: You're welcome. It's important to address each issue systematically to provide you with the best possible care. We will work together to find the most appropriate solutions for your health needs."
