Avoid harmful medications. - **Gestational hypertension:** Monitor BP; treat pharmacologically if needed. Avoid delivery <37 weeks unless severe. - **Pre-eclampsia:** First-line Labetalol; monitor BP/fetal wellbeing. Plan delivery based on severity/gestational age. **Postnatal Care:** - Continue BP monitoring; review with GP/obstetrician. Recurrence risk: ~20% in future pregnancies. **Key Symptoms:** Severe headache, vision changes, rib pain, vomiting, sudden swelling—prompt BP/urinalysis check",
