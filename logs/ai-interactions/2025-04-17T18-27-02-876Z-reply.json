She reports no radiation of pain but notes occasional bloating. No associated nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \nThe pain began insidiously and is not clearly related to meals, exertion, or menstruation. She denies dysuria, hematuria, or vaginal discharge. No recent travel or dietary changes. She has tried over-the-counter paracetamol with mild relief.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Irritable bowel syndrome (diagnosed age 25, managed with dietary modifications)  \n- Seasonal allergic rhinitis  \n- No known chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 18, uncomplicated)  \n- No other surgeries  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12, regular 28-day cycles, moderate flow  \n- No history of dysmenorrhea or intermenstrual bleeding  \n- Nulliparous, no prior miscarriages or terminations  \n- Currently using combined oral contraceptive pill (for 5 years)  \n- Last cervical smear: 1 year ago (normal)  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Combined oral contraceptive pill (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel)  \n- Loratadine PRN for allergies  \n- No recent antibiotics or new medications  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- Penicillin (rash)  \n- No known food allergies  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker  \n- Alcohol: 5–7 units/week (socially)  \n- No recreational drug use  \n- Lives with partner, works full-time in a high-stress role  \n- Moderate exercise (yoga 2x/week, occasional running)  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Concerned about possible ovarian cyst or bowel-related issue.  \n- **Concerns:** Worried about fertility implications if pathology is found.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants reassurance and clarity on next steps.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Well-appearing, no pallor or distress  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa, no guarding or rebound. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds present.  \n- Pelvic exam (with consent): No adnexal tenderness, cervix appears normal, no discharge.  \n- Vitals: BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven the history and examination findings, the most likely differentials include:  \n1. **Functional bowel discomfort** (exacerbation of IBS)  \n2. **Ovarian pathology** (e.g., benign cyst, though no palpable mass)  \n3. **Musculoskeletal strain** (less likely given lack of positional triggers)  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess ovaries/pelvic structures.  \n   - Stool calprotectin if symptoms persist (to exclude low-grade inflammation).  \n   - Consider trial of probiotics/IBS dietary adjustments if functional cause suspected.  \n2. **Lifestyle Advice:**  \n   - Stress management techniques (given occupational stress).  \n   - Reassurance about low likelihood of serious pathology.  \n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Review in 4 weeks with ultrasound results.  \n   - Return sooner if pain worsens or new symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe patient was counseled on the likely benign nature of her symptoms but agreed to further investigations for reassurance. She was advised to monitor symptoms and maintain a symptom diary.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [Redacted]  \n\n---  \n*Note: This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only.
