**Impression:**  
1. **Possible Endometriosis:** Given the history of chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and difficulty conceiving, endometriosis is a likely differential diagnosis.  
2. **Unexplained Infertility:** The patient meets the criteria for infertility (trying to conceive for >12 months without success), and further investigations are warranted.

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess for endometriomas, ovarian cysts, or other pelvic pathology.  
   - Hysterosalpingography (HSG) to evaluate tubal patency.  
   - Day 3 serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and AMH levels to assess ovarian reserve.  
   - Semen analysis for her partner.  

2. **Pain Management:**  
   - Trial of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain relief during episodes of pelvic pain.  
   - Consideration of hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill) if endometriosis is confirmed.  

3. **Fertility Support:**  
   - Referral to a fertility specialist for further evaluation and potential interventions, such as ovulation induction or assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
