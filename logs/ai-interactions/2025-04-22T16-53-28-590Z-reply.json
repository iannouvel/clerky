Denies leakage of fluid, vaginal bleeding, or contractions. No recent illness or trauma. Diet and hydration status not assessed.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Anxious, no acute distress  \n- Vitals: BP 128/82, HR 88, RR 16, Temp 37.0°C  \n- Abdomen: Fundal height 36 cm, uterus nontender, fetal lie longitudinal  \n- Fetal Heart Rate: Intermittently auscultated via Doppler—baseline 150 bpm with variable decelerations noted (no tocometry performed)  \n- Cervical Exam: Not performed  \n- Contraction Monitoring: Not documented  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nPossible fetal distress given reported decreased movements and variable decelerations on auscultation. Incomplete evaluation due to lack of tocometry, formal NST/CTG, or ultrasound.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent Fetal Monitoring:** Admit for continuous cardiotocography (CTG) to assess for recurrent decelerations or non-reassuring patterns.  \n2. **Ultrasound:** Request biophysical profile (BPP) to evaluate fetal well-being if CTG inconclusive.  \n3. **Counseling:** Discuss potential need for expedited delivery (e.g., induction or C-section) if distress confirmed. Risks/benefits not yet reviewed in detail.  \n4. **Labs:** STAT CBC, type and screen (no baseline labs on file).  \n5. **Reassess:** Repeat vitals hourly; document fluid intake/output (not yet initiated).  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Consult obstetrics team for further evaluation.  \n- Patient instructed to report any further reduction in movement or new symptoms.  \n\n**Limitations:**  \n- Incomplete history (e.g., prior ultrasounds, growth scans, or infection screening not verified).  \n- No documentation of fluid status, recent weight trends, or social history (e.g., smoking, substance use).  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional), OB-GYN resident  \n**Date/Time:** [Fictional timestamp]  \n\n---  \n**Note:** This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
