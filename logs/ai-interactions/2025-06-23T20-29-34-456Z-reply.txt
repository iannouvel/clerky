She reports vomiting 15-20 times daily, unable to keep down solid food for 2 weeks, and has lost 6kg since pregnancy confirmation. She also noticed vaginal spotting for 3 days, initially light pink but now brown discharge. Her symptoms seem disproportionately severe for gestational age. Last menstrual period was 13 weeks ago, home pregnancy tests have been consistently strongly positive. No previous pregnancies, conceived naturally after 4 months of trying. Family history includes thyroid disease (maternal). She appears significantly dehydrated and has been unable to work for 1 week due to severity of symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell, with obvious weight loss. Vital signs: BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Weight 52kg (down from 58kg at GP booking). Thyrotoxic signs present: mild tremor, warm skin, tachycardia. Abdominal examination reveals uterine size larger than expected for dates (approximately 16-week size). Speculum shows brown discharge from cervical os, no active bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance with multiple cystic spaces throughout uterine cavity, no fetal pole visible. Quantitative β-hCG markedly elevated at 186,000 mIU/mL (much higher than expected for gestational age). Thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH <0.1 mU/L, elevated free T4 28 pmol/L indicating gestational thyrotoxicosis. Chest X-ray clear, no evidence of pulmonary metastases.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole requiring urgent evacuation. Pre-operative investigations including FBC, coagulation screen, cross-match for 2 units blood. Surgical evacuation arranged urgently via suction curettage under general anesthetic. IV fluid resuscitation commenced. Antiemetics for symptom control. Propranolol considered for thyrotoxicosis symptoms. Post-evacuation histology confirmation and registration with regional trophoblastic screening center mandatory. Serial β-hCG monitoring weekly until negative then monthly for 6 months. Reliable contraception essential during follow-up period. Patient counseled regarding excellent prognosis with appropriate follow-up and monitoring.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] cg21009-maternity-fluid-management-as-an-in-patient-or-in-labour-pdf\nTitle: CG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as an In-patient or in Labour\nContent: CG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 1 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \n \nMaternity Fluid Management as an In-Patient or During Labour \nSummary statement: How does the document \nsupport patient care? \nThe purpose of this guideline is to reduce the risk of \nhyponatraemia through increased awareness; accurate fluid \nbalance management and monitoring; earlier detection. \nStaff/stakeholders involved in development: \nJob titles only \nLabour Ward Leads (Obstetric and Midwifery), Consultant \nObstetricians, Consultant Anaesthetists, Senior midwives, \nJoint Obstetric Guidelines Group. \nDivision: \nWomen and Children’s \nDepartment: \nMaternity \nResponsible Person: \nChief of Service \nAuthor: \nSenior Midwifery Manager \nFor use by: \nAll obstetric and midwifery staff \nPurpose: \nTo provide evidence based guidance for fluid balance \nmanagement of maternity in-patients and pregnant \nwomen/people in labour. \nThis document supports: \nStandards and legislation \nNG121 Intrapartum care for women with existing medical \nconditions or obstetric complications (2019) \nCG190 Intrapartum care for healthy women and babies \n(2017) GAIN (2017) \nKey related documents: UH Sussex (SRH & WH) Maternity Guidelines: CG21008 \nManagement of High Risk Maternal Medicine conditions. \nCG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage.

The elements within this guideline are therefore aimed \nat achieving this through the accurate measurement of fluid balance in conjunction with the \nTrusts Fluid Balance Policy (2021). The need for accurate fluid balance is also a key \ncomponent of the Acutely Ill competencies produced by NICE guideline 50 (2020). \n \nWomen/people in labour are at greater risk of developing hyponatraemia than non-pregnant \nwomen/people because of lower baseline plasma sodium\n1\n, an impaired ability to excrete \nwater in the third trimester\n2\n and exposure to the anti-diuretic effect of oxytocin \n3\n. An acute fall \nin the sodium level can result in cerebral oedema and life threatening symptoms. It can also \nlead to neonatal hyponatraemia, as water freely diffuses across the placenta, causing fetal \nblood sodium concentration and osmolality to reflect that of the mother \n4,5,6,7. \n \nAdditional risk factors are the total volume of fluid intake during labour, both intravenous and \noral, and exogenous oxytocin. This risk is significantly increased in women/people with \nprolonged labour \n8\n. The association between hyponatraemia and the use of large volumes of \nhypotonic intravenous fluids and oxytocin for induction and augmentation of labour has long \nbeen recognised \n9,10,11\n. However, in recent cases, hyponatraemia occurred as a result of \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 5 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \nexcessive oral fluid intake in a setting where little or no oxytocin or intravenous fluids had \nbeen given \n12,13,14,15. \n \nA repetitive theme in these cases is the absence of accurate fluid balance monitoring and \nrecording. \n \nThe purpose of this guideline is to reduce the risk of hyponatraemia through: \n \n Increased awareness. \n Accurate fluid balance management and monitoring. \n Earlier detection. \n \nIndications for commencement of fluid balance monitoring \n Actual or potential acute illness: AKI, Hyperemesis, known Hyponatraemia, \nEclampsia, PET, APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage, PPH, Sepsis. \n Commencing or prescribed IV fluids / IV oxytocin. \n Induction of Labour. \n Post-Operative management: elective or emergency caesarean section, operative \nbirth. \n Urinary catheter in situ. \n Labour. \n \n5.0 Signs and symptoms of hyponatraemia \n \nSigns and symptoms of hyponatraemia are primarily related to dysfunction of the central \nnervous system. Cerebral oedema may develop and early manifestations of hyponatraemia \ninclude: \n \n Anorexia \n Nausea \n Lethargy \n Apathy \n Headache \n \nEarly symptoms are non-specific and may be attributed to pregnancy, labour and common \nconditions such as pre-eclampsia. More advanced signs and symptoms include: \n \n Disorientation \n Agitation \n Seizures \n Depressed reflexes \n Focal neurological deficits \n Cheyne-Stokes respiration \n Coma \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 6 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \nSymptoms correlate with the severity of hyponatraemia and the speed of change in sodium \nconcentration. Rapid changes can cause fluid shifts between extracellular and intracellular \ncompartments with no opportunity for physiological compensation, leading to acute \nsymptoms. \n \n6.0 Fluid and electrolyte balance in pregnancy \n \nBlood sodium concentration and osmolality are lower in pregnancy with 130 - 140 mmol/l \nbeing considered the normal range, compared to 135 - 145 mmol/l in non-pregnant adults. \nBlood osmolality is also lower at around 280mOsm/kg. In this guideline hyponatraemia in \npregnancy is defined as a blood sodium concentration less than 130 mmol/l. \n \n7.0 Prevention and diagnosis of hyponatraemia in labour \n \nMaternal dilutional hyponatraemia during labour can be prevented by keeping a neutral fluid \nbalance and can be recognised by fluid balance monitoring and clear documentation with \nblood sodium testing when necessary. \n \n Pregnant women/people should not be encouraged to drink excessively beyond \ntheir body’s own thirst impulse, and should be encouraged to drink isotonic/sports \ndrinks instead of water. \n Women/people should be made aware of the potential dangers of drinking in \nexcess, especially if not passing urine. \n Ketones in the urine should not be treated with fluid alone, but with sugary food \nand drinks. \n \nHealthy women/people in labour who are in a neutral fluid balance are at low risk of \ndeveloping hyponatraemia. As fluid intake in labour increases, so does the risk of \nhyponatraemia. \n\n8.0 Peripartum fluid balance \n \n8.1 Pregnant women/people having midwife led care \n \n The importance of accurate fluid balance monitoring during labour should be \nexplained to all women/people. \n In normal spontaneous labour, fluid balance observations should be commenced \nand recorded on the chart. A cumulative fluid balance of any oral intake should be \ndocumented every 4 hours in mls. \n Women/people should be encouraged to void 4 hourly and to have urine output \nvolume measured and recorded. \n All other fluid losses should also be measured and recorded e.g. vomit, blood. \nWomen/people who have a fluid balance of up to 1 litre positive in labour will \nhave a 1% incidence of hyponatraemia at delivery, between 1 to 2.5 litres \nincreases this to 5% and above 2.5 litres 26% will be hyponatraemic\n16 \n. \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 7 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \n If a low risk woman/person has less than 1500mls positive balance they would be \nunlikely to have hyponatraemia. \n A 1500mls positive balance or over, should be discussed with the senior \nobstetrician first and the whole clinical picture should be taken into consideration \ne.g. partogram, history, before taking a blood test to check her sodium levels. \nNormal blood sodium (equal to or greater than 130 mmol/l) requires no action and \nfluids do not require restriction, however continue to closely monitor and record the \nfluid balance. \n A sodium level less than 130 mmol/l or if sodium testing is not readily available, the \non call obstetric registrar should be contacted and clinical judgement used, \nparticularly with regard to parity and progress in labour, to decide whether transfer \nto obstetric care is required. \n If intrapartum transfer of care to another clinical area is required, a cumulative fluid \nbalance total should be handed over. \n In the low risk woman/person the Fluid Balance Chart should be an aide memoire \nto think about fluids. It is important that this information is shared with the midwife \nwhen transferring between clinical areas and the balance is checked and aim for a \nneutral balance. \n \n8.1.2 Fluid management in homebirth setting \n \n In a homebirth setting, if the pregnant person has not birthed or birth is not \nimminent within two hours of the community midwives attendance then a fluid \nbalance should be monitored, taking into consideration the whole clinical picture \n(e.g. progress in labour, maternal and fetal well-being). Should the pregnant \nperson be in positive fluid balance (more than 1500mls) consider transfer into the \nlabour ward. \n \n8.2 Pregnant women/people undergoing induction of labour (IOL) and high risk \nlabour \n \n The importance of accurate fluid balance monitoring during labour should be \nexplained to all pregnant women/people. \n Fluid balance observations should be commenced and recorded on the fluid \nbalance chart. This should include all fluid losses measured and recorded e.g. \nvomit, blood loss, urine output. \n \nLow risk IOL: \n \n Pregnant women/people, without intravenous (IV) fluids, indwelling catheters or a \nmedical history requiring close fluid balance should be encouraged to record their \nown oral fluid intake four hourly on a fluid balance chart. \n Women/people should be encouraged to void 4 hourly and record their own urine \noutput. \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 8 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \nHigh risk IOL and high risk labour: \n \n For PET follow guidance in CG1112 Management of severe pre-eclampsia & \neclampsia. \n All women/people with IV fluids, indwelling catheters or a medical history requiring \nclose fluid balance should have their fluid balance observations recorded on the \nhourly fluid balance chart by a clinician. \n If an in-dwelling catheter in situ output volume recorded when emptied or 4 hourly. \n IV fluids must have a prescribed reason documented on the fluid balance chart \n(Refer to EPMA). \n IV fluids must be prescribed in millilitres (ml) per hour. \n IV fluids should be administered via volumetric pumps (with the exception of \ncircumstances such as fluid resuscitation during haemorrhage or hypotension). \n \nFluid balance totals: \n \n If a woman/person’s fluid balance exceeds 1500mls positive, a blood sodium \nlevel should be checked and the patient commenced on the Peripartum Sodium \nMonitoring Pathway. (See Appendix 1) \n Before transfer following the induction area to the ward, a cumulative fluid balance \ntotal should be recorded on the fluid balance chart. \n \nFor women/people with epidural analgesia: \n \n All women/pregnant people having an epidural must have a cannula sited. \n The cannula must be flushed to ensure patency and connected to the IV line. \n But the fluid can be switched off as not routinely required unless the anaesthetist \nrequests it to be given based on clinical indication, such as to treat sudden \nhypotension, or other epidural related emergencies. \n \nTo ‘improve the CTG’ in normotensive women/people with no signs of dehydration, \nrefer to the treatment of ketosis in non-diabetic women/people. (See Section 11.0) \n \n9.0 Sodium Monitoring \n \n9.1 Peripartum Sodium Monitoring \n \nWomen/people require sodium monitoring (Peripartum Sodium Monitoring Pathway - \nAppendix 2) if they are: \n \n In labour and require IV insulin and dextrose. \n Baseline sodium to be taken if commencing oxytocinon IV in labour or after birth. \n Noted to have a blood sodium below 130 mmol/l for any reason. \n Greater than 1500 mls positive on their fluid balance. \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 9 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \nA blood sodium level can be checked using a venous sample in the labour ward blood gas \nmachine or sent to the lab. It is essential that blood samples are not taken from a limb \nattached to an intravenous infusion as this may lead to inaccurate results. \n \nResults should be referenced against the Peripartum Sodium Monitoring Pathway (see \nAppendix 1) to guide frequency of repeat testing and further management. \n \nAll women/people requiring intravenous insulin and dextrose infusions during labour should \nhave a blood sodium level checked 6 - 8 hourly depending on stage of labour. \n \nOxytocin should be stopped in cases where the maternal sodium is below 125mmol/l and \nsenior clinical advice sought. The decision regarding further oxytocin administration should \nbe made following assessment of the woman/person’s clinical condition and circumstances \nafter discussion with a consultant obstetrician. \n \n9.2 Postpartum Sodium Monitoring \n \n The paediatric team should be made aware of babies born to hyponatremia \nmothers/parents\n17,18 \n. \n Once a woman/person has a blood sodium level equal to or greater than 130 \nmmol/l no further sodium checks are necessary unless clinically indicated. \n If a woman/person has a sodium level below 130 mmol/l, they should be reviewed \nby the obstetric team and consideration given to alternative causes, the patient’s \nclinical condition and the severity of the hyponatraemia, and a decision made as to \nwhether they are suitable for discharge. \n \n10.0 Management of symptomatic hyponatraemia\n19\n\nAn experienced clinician should be involved to guide further treatment. Severe \nhyponatraemia is a medical emergency. Senior members of obstetric, anaesthetic and \nmedical teams should be involved and the patient transferred to HDU/ICU for ongoing \nmanagement. If sodium is less than 120mmol/L, team to inform ITU even if \nasymptomatic. If no improvement in sodium despite treatment, inform ITU. \n \n Commence fluid restriction (30ml/hour) and 2 hourly sodium monitoring until \nasymptomatic. \n If sodium less than 125mmol/L & symptoms of severe hyponatraemia – \n(headache, confusion, reduced GCS, seizures, give 150-200 mls of 2.7% saline \nimmediately through a large bore cannula or central line over 30 minutes. \n Check sodium concentration. \n If no improvement in symptoms or deterioration, consider further 150ml 2.7% \nsodium chloride (rarely needed as patients self-correct rapidly after delivery). \n Rapid increases in blood sodium concentration can cause serious harm including \ncentral pontine myelinolysis. Sodium level should rise by no more than 10 mmol/l \nin a 24 hour period. \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 10 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \n Consider co-administration of 20 mg IV furosemide if there is any evidence of fluid \noverload. This will raise serum sodium by approximately 2 – 4 mmol/l and will \nreduce cerebral oedema. \n \n11.0 Management of ketonuria in labour in non-diabetic pregnant \nwomen/people \n \nIn labour, ketosis (the elevation of ketone bodies in the blood) is a common occurrence, due \nto increased physical stress, which is often compounded by reduced oral intake. \n \nThe effect of ketosis on the pregnant woman/person and baby during labour is not clear, \ntherefore, there is uncertainty as to whether ketosis is a normal physiological response or \nwhether women/people with ketosis in labour require intervention (such as intravenous fluids \nor increased oral intake) for maternal and infant wellbeing. This uncertainty has resulted in \ndifferences in opinion and practice by those providing care for women/people in labour. \n20\n\nKetonuria can be mild (>/=1+), moderate (>/=2+) or severe (>/=3+). \n \nWomen/people with a positive urine dipstick for ketones should have a clinical assessment \nfor signs of dehydration. Signs of dehydration: \n \n Thirst \n Tachycardia \n Hypotension \n Dry mucous membranes \n Reduced skin turgor / elasticity of skin \n Reduced urine output \n \nKetonuria in early labour: \n \n Women/people with mild to moderate ketonuria in early labour should be encouraged \nto have food as tolerated, specifically carbohydrates, and encouraged to drink to thirst. \n Intravenous fluid should only be prescribed after a clinical assessment and/or if \nvomiting and unable to tolerate food. \n The volume of fluid given, whether oral or intravenous, should be recorded and a \ncumulative fluid balance sheet should be completed. \n \nKetonuria in those fasting for caesarean section or in established labour: \n \nNutricia Pre-op (200mls) a high carbohydrate drink or equivalent eg sports drink, may be \ngiven to women up to 2 hours prior to regional anaesthesia. Nutricia Preop may be given to \nreduce ketones and hypoglycaemia in: \n \n Women/people in established labour if operative delivery is not anticipated within \n2 hours. \n Women/people who are fasting for over 12hrs for elective and semi elective \ncaesarean section. \n\nCG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as In-Patient or During Labour v1 Sept 2021 Page 11 of 15 \n \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent issue of this document. \n12.0 Audit \n \nSuggested auditable points: \n \nA cumulative fluid balance total should be recorded on the fluid balance chart before transfer \nbetween clinical areas. \n \nWomen/people having midwifery led care: \n Have a cumulative fluid balance of any oral intake documented every 4 hours in \nmls. \n Documented that they have been encouraged to void 4 hourly and to have urine \noutput volume measured and recorded. \n Any 1500 positive fluid balance should have a documented review by senior \nobstetrician. \n \nWomen/people undergoing high risk IOL/labour: \n Hourly fluid balance observations recorded on the fluid balance chart for those with \nIV fluids, indwelling catheters or a medical history requiring close fluid balance \nmonitoring. \n If an in-dwelling catheter in situ output volume recorded when emptied or 4 hourly. \n If a woman/person’s fluid balance exceeds 1500mls positive, a blood sodium \nlevel should be checked and the patient commenced on the Peripartum Sodium \nMonitoring Pathway. \n Peripartum Sodium Pathway is commenced for any women/people in labour and \nrequire IV insulin and dextrose, noted to have a blood sodium below 130 mmol/l for \nany reason, or greater than 1500 mls positive on their fluid balance. \n All women/people requiring intravenous insulin and dextrose infusions during \nlabour should have a blood sodium level checked 6 - 8 hourly depending on stage \nof labour. \n If a woman/person has a sodium level below 130 mmol/l, they should be reviewed \nby the obstetric team and consideration given to alternative causes, the patient’s \nclinical condition and the severity of the hyponatraemia, and a decision made as to \nwhether they are suitable for discharge. \n\nReferences \n \n1.

A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the CG21009 Maternity Fluid Management guideline, with recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document current serum sodium level and trends
Reason: Guideline requires sodium monitoring for patients with >1500ml positive fluid balance or suspected hyponatremia (Section 9.1). This patient has significant fluid losses/dehydration and is at high risk for electrolyte imbalance.

2. **Different management plan** - Implement formal fluid balance monitoring with hourly intake/output recording
Reason: Guideline states fluid balance monitoring is mandatory for hyperemesis patients (Section 4.0 Indications). Current note doesn't document specific fluid intake/output volumes.

3. **Different management plan** - Consider sodium monitoring pathway given severe dehydration/hyperemesis
Reason: Guideline recommends Peripartum Sodium Monitoring Pathway for patients at risk of hyponatremia (Appendix 2). This patient has multiple risk factors including hyperemesis and significant fluid imbalance.

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Counsel patient about appropriate fluid intake (isotonic drinks rather than water)
Reason: Guideline recommends against excessive water intake and suggests isotonic drinks (Section 7.0). Important for post-op recovery and prevention of recurrent hyponatremia.

2. **Additional information needed** - Document urine output volume and characteristics
Reason: Guideline requires measurement and recording of all fluid losses (Section 8.2). Important for assessing degree of dehydration and renal function.

3. **Different management plan** - Consider specific IV fluid regimen with electrolyte monitoring
Reason: Guideline emphasizes careful IV fluid management to prevent hyponatremia (Section 8.2). Current plan mentions IV fluids but doesn't specify type/rate.

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline weight for fluid balance calculations
Reason: Guideline recommends accurate weight documentation for fluid management (implied in Section 4.0). Helps assess degree of dehydration.

2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about fluid balance importance
Reason: Guideline states importance of explaining fluid balance to patients (Section 8.1). Would improve patient understanding during recovery.

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting fluid balance totals on transfer
Reason: Guideline recommends recording cumulative balance before transfers (Section 12.0). Minor point for continuity of care during this urgent case.

The most critical gaps are the lack of documented sodium levels and formal fluid balance monitoring, which are essential for patient safety given the severe hyperemesis and surgical intervention planned. The guideline emphasizes these elements to prevent hyponatremia complications.
