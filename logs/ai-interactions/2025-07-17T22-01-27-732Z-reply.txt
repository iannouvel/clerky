  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nHere’s the updated medical clerking in SBAR format with the accepted changes applied:\n\n---  \n\n### **SITUATION:**  \n**Patient:** 45F, para 2 (G2P2), presents with a 3-month history of **post-coital bleeding (PCB)**, intermenstrual bleeding (IMB), and recent onset left-sided pelvic pain. No significant weight loss or constitutional symptoms. Last menstrual period (LMP) 2 weeks ago. Smoker (10/day).  \n\n**Key clinical issue:** ?Cervical malignancy – requires urgent gynae-oncology assessment.  \n\n---  \n\n### **BACKGROUND:**  \n- **PMHx:**  \n  - HPV status unknown, no prior cervical screening (last smear >5 years ago).  \n  - Previous LLETZ (large loop excision of transformation zone) 8 years ago for CIN2.  \n  - No other significant gynae history.  \n- **Obstetric Hx:** 2 SVDs (spontaneous vaginal deliveries), no complications.  \n- **Medications:** NSAIDs PRN for pain, no regular medications.  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA.  \n- **Social:** Smoker (10/day), occasional alcohol, works as a teaching assistant.  \n\n---  \n\n### **ASSESSMENT:**  \n**Clinical findings:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 128/82, HR 78, SpO₂ 98% RA, afebrile (36.8°C).  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-distended, mild left iliac fossa tenderness, no palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum exam:** Friable, irregular lesion at 3 o’clock on cervix (~3cm), contact bleeding noted. No active bleeding.  \n- **Bimanual exam:** Cervix feels firm and irregular. Uterus anteverted, non-tender. No adnexal masses.  \n\n**Investigations pending/required:**  \n- **Urgent colposcopy + biopsy (consider vaginoscopic approach if hysteroscopy needed).**  \n- **Bloods:** FBC (anaemia?), U&Es, LFTs, coagulation.  \n- **Imaging:**  \n  - Pelvic USS (assess local spread).  \n  - MRI pelvis (if malignancy confirmed, for staging).  \n  - CXR (if advanced disease suspected).  \n- **HPV testing** (likely high-risk subtype).  \n- **Consider outpatient hysteroscopy as an alternative diagnostic approach if colposcopy/biopsy is delayed, given the guideline recommendation: 'All gynaecology departments should provide a dedicated outpatient hysteroscopy service for women with abnormal uterine bleeding'.**  \n\n**Differential diagnoses:**  \n1. **Squamous cell carcinoma of cervix** (most likely).  \n2. Cervical polyp/ectropion (less likely given lesion appearance).  \n3. Advanced CIN/recurrence post-LLETZ.  \n\n---  \n\n### **RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Urgent gynae-oncology referral** (2-week wait pathway).  \n2. **Expedite colposcopy + biopsy** (confirm diagnosis).  \n3. **Baseline bloods + imaging** (as above).  \n4. **MDT discussion** post-biopsy for staging & definitive management (likely radical hysterectomy + lymphadenectomy if early-stage, or chemoradiotherapy if locally advanced).  \n5. **Counselling:**  \n   - Smoking cessation referral (strongly advised).  \n   - Fertility implications if considering surgery.  \n   - Psychological support (Macmillan referral if confirmed malignancy).  \n   - **Document provision of written information about any planned procedures including benefits/risks, as per guideline: 'Women should be given verbal and/or written informed consent prior to hysteroscopy'.**  \n\n**Monitoring:**  \n- Serial observations (watch for acute bleeding).  \n- **Pre-procedural NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac 50-100mg) 1 hour before any planned hysteroscopic procedure.**  \n- Follow-up post-biopsy for definitive plan.  \n- **If hysteroscopy required, specify use of miniature hysteroscope (≤3.5mm) as per guideline recommendation to reduce pain.**  \n\n---  \n\n**Documented by:** [Name]  \n**Role:** FY2 / SHO in Obstetrics & Gynaecology  \n**Date/Time:** [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM]  \n\n---\n\nGuideline Analysis:\nClinical transcript analysis for guideline compliance check against: GP011 Referral criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy.

There are clinical and \neconomic benefits associated with this type of service. \n \n1.2 OPH is provided at the current set up on Horsted Keynes ward where the facility is \nequipped for OPH and Colposcopy. \n \n1.3 Currently, there are two consultants providing the service, Mr Greg Kalu and Mr \nEhab Kelada. There are at least two nurses trained to provide the service with the \ntwo consultants. \n \n1.4 Written patient information should be provided before the appointment and \nconsent for the procedure should be taken. \n \n2.0 Referral Criteria: \n \n2.1 Abnormal uterine bleeding lasting longer than three months in women over 40 years \nof age if a consultant gynaecologist feels that there will be a benefit from assessing \nthe endometrial cavity with a view to further treatment including insertion of Mirena \nor endometrial ablation. \n \n2.2 Endometrial pathology identified on USS (polyps <2cm, fibroids <2cm). \n \n2.3 Abnormal uterine bleeding on Tamoxifen. \n \n2.4 Irregular or heavy uterine bleeding at less than 40 years of age with failed medical \ntreatment for more than 3 months. \n \n2.5 Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) when there is a reason to assess the endometrial \ncavity using hysteroscopy rather than transvaginal scan (TVS) and Pipelle \nendometrial biopsy. \n \n2.6 Fertility patients if it is considered necessary to exclude a structural uterine \nabnormality including intrauterine synechiae. \n \n2.7 Patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. \n \n3.0 Suitable Patients: \n \n3.1 Potentially all women should be suitable for outpatient hysteroscopy provided the \nfollowing criteria are met: \n3.1.1 She accepts the concept of outpatient hysteroscopy. \n3.1.2 She is able to tolerate a speculum examination. \n\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \nPage 6 of 10 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \n3.1.3 The external cervical os is visible and the cervix is not flush with the vaginal \nvault. \n3.1.4 Patients for whom a general anaesthetic carries a substantial risk of adverse \nconsequences. \n4.0 Unsuitable Patients: \n \n4.1 Patients who are unsuitable for OPH are: \n4.1.1 Women who are not happy with the idea of having an outpatient procedure \nafter appropriate counselling. \n4.1.2 Women who cannot tolerate a speculum or pelvic examination. \n4.1.3 History of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). \n4.1.4 Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. \n4.1.5 Presence of other pelvic pathology when it would be more appropriate to \nundertake hysteroscopy at the time of laparoscopy under GA. \n5.0 GOPD Referrals: \n \nReferral from GOPD must be with consultant approval. \nThe usual TCI card should be completed and the option of OPH highlighted. Patients \nshould be informed that the procedure will be done at PRH, Haywards Heath. \n6.0 GP and BICS Referrals: \n \n Direct referrals from GPs or GPwSI at BICS will be accepted following triage \n by GK or EK. \n7.0 USS Protocol: \n \n7.1 USS results will be used when available to triage patients for DSU hysteroscopy, \nPipelle Biopsy or no further investigation. \n \n7.2 TV USS is associated with improved identification of endometrial disease compared \nwith hysteroscopy alone (1). Therefore all patients attending OPH should be \nconsidered for TV USS before booking them to clinic. \n \n8.0 Analgesia \nAdequate analgesia will be given to the woman throughout the procedure (see \nAppendix B) \n\nReferral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011 \nPage 7 of 10 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals \n \n9.0 OPH Clinic Appointments and Follow-Up: \n \n9.1 Each diagnostic OPH is allocated 30 minute slot including insertion of Mirena coil if \n indicated. \n9.2 Each operative OPH for endometrial polypectomy or Novasure endometrial ablation \n is allocated a 45 minutes slot. \n9.3 Only 19% of OPH patients require follow-up (1). Most patients should be discharged \n and sent back to the GP with a clear further management plan documented in the \n letter sent to GP. \n9.4 GOPD follow-up should occur in a minority of patients and even fewer should return \n for OPH follow up. \n9.5 Any plan for follow-up at GOPD or OPH clinic should be documented in patient’s \n notes and letter sent to GP with the indication clearly stated. \n9.6 Indications for GOPD follow up: \n9.6.1 Suspicious findings at OPH. \n9.6.2 Complications occurring at OPH. \n9.6.3 When endometrial cancer is diagnosed, patients should be advised that \nthey may need an MRI scan and should be referred to a Gynaecological \noncologist who will liaise with the MDT. \n \n10.0 Communication and Results to the Referring Consultant and GP: \n \n10.1 A letter should be sent to the referring consultant and GP after every OPH. \n \n10.2 The histology report should be sent to the patient’s GP as soon as it is available. \n \n10.3 All histology reports showing cancer are usually automatically referred to the MDT \n by the pathologist. The hysteroscopist should confirm that this has been done and \n also inform the referring consultant as soon as is practicable. \n11.0 References: \n \n1 National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health.
