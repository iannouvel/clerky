She reports no significant pain or contractions but expresses concern about the implications of the breech position for delivery.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- First noted at 34-week routine scan.  \n- No prior attempts at external cephalic version (ECV).  \n- No fetal movements reported as reduced or abnormal.  \n- Denies any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (well-controlled on medication).  \n- Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine).  \n- No known history of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia in this pregnancy.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 25).  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Amlodipine 5 mg OD.  \n- Levothyroxine 75 mcg OD.  \n- No current anticoagulants.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  \n- Works as a schoolteacher.  \n- Lives with partner, no children.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Concerned about risks of vaginal breech delivery vs. planned caesarean.  \n- Wishes to explore ECV but anxious about discomfort.  \n- Expects clear guidance on safest delivery options.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Well-appearing, no signs of distress.  \n- Abdominal: Fundal height consistent with dates. Breech palpable in lower uterus, cephalic pole not engaged.  \n- Fetal heart rate: Normal (140 bpm), no decelerations.  \n- (Incomplete – Speculum/Pelvic exam not yet performed to assess cervix.)  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Counsel on ECV:**  \n   - Offer ECV at 37 weeks after confirming fetal wellbeing (CTG, ultrasound).  \n   - Explain success rates (~50%) and risks (transient fetal bradycardia, placental abruption).  \n   - Advise that ECV is contraindicated if any signs of fetal compromise or ruptured membranes.  \n\n2. **Delivery Options:**  \n   - If ECV successful, plan for vaginal delivery with continuous monitoring.  \n   - If ECV unsuccessful or declined, discuss elective caesarean section (recommended given nulliparity and maternal age).  \n\n3. **Next Steps:**  \n   - Arrange urgent obstetric review for ECV consent and planning.  \n   - Schedule follow-up scan to reassess presentation.  \n   - Provide patient information leaflet on breech management.  \n\n**Outstanding Information Required:**  \n- Cervical status (favorability for ECV).  \n- Detailed anomaly scan to exclude contraindications (e.g., placenta praevia).  \n- Patient’s final decision on ECV after counseling.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [REDACTED]  \n\n*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
