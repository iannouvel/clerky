She is concerned about possible pregnancy but also reports a history of irregular cycles.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Miss X has had five prior pregnancies: three live births (all delivered vaginally at term), one spontaneous miscarriage at 10 weeks, and one termination of pregnancy at 8 weeks gestation.  \n- She reports inconsistent contraceptive use (primarily condoms) and no long-acting reversible contraception.  \n- She denies current breast tenderness, nausea, or urinary symptoms but reports fatigue and mild dyspnoea on exertion.  \n- No recent unprotected intercourse confirmed, but admits to occasional lapses in barrier use.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Obesity (BMI 54)  \n- Gestational diabetes in last pregnancy  \n- Iron-deficiency anaemia (on intermittent oral iron)  \n- No known cardiac or respiratory conditions  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- No major surgeries  \n- All vaginal deliveries without significant perineal trauma  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12  \n- Cycles previously irregular (every 35-60 days)  \n- No history of pelvic inflammatory disease or abnormal smears  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Oral iron (ferrous sulfate) PRN  \n- No regular medications  \n- Denies illicit drug use  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Lives with extended family  \n- Currently not in education or employment  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 14)  \n- Occasional alcohol (denies binge drinking)  \n- No recreational drug use  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Believes she may be pregnant again but is unsure due to irregular cycles.  \n- **Concerns:** Worried about impact on health given her weight and prior gestational diabetes. Also anxious about judgement from family.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on pregnancy status and advice on contraception.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese (BMI 54), no pallor or jaundice.  \n- **Cardiovascular:** HS dual, no murmurs.  \n- **Respiratory:** Mild tachypnoea, no wheeze or crepitations.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, difficult to palpate uterus due to adiposity. No palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic Examination (deferred initially due to patient discomfort, offered ultrasound first):**  \n  - Speculum exam not performed (patient declined).  \n  - Bimanual not attempted due to body habitus and distress.  \n\n**Investigations:**  \n1. **Urine hCG:** Positive.  \n2. **Transabdominal Ultrasound:** Challenging due to adiposity, but fetal pole visualised (~14 weeks gestation).  \n3. **Bloods:** Hb 98 g/L (anaemic), random glucose 8.2 mmol/L (elevated).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Pregnancy Counselling:**  \n   - Discussed options (continuation vs termination) given risks (maternal obesity, gestational diabetes recurrence, thromboembolism risk).  \n   - Referred to specialist obstetric team for high-risk antenatal care.  \n   - Advised early OGTT and thromboprophylaxis assessment.  \n\n2. **Contraception:**  \n   - Long-term contraception strongly advised post-pregnancy (e.g., implant/IUD).  \n   - Risks of rapid repeat pregnancy discussed.  \n\n3. **Lifestyle & Comorbidities:**  \n   - Smoking cessation referral given.  \n   - Dietetic input for weight optimisation.  \n   - Commenced on folic acid 5mg and prophylactic LMWH pending review.  \n\n4. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Urgent obstetric clinic appointment.  \n   - Repeat Hb and glucose monitoring.  \n\n**Patient reassured and encouraged to involve family/support network.
