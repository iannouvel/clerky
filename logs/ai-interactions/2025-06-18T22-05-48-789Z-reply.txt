      "newValue": "**Summary of Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) Management Guidelines:** - **Prevention:** Identify risk factors; offer prophylactic uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin/carbetocin for cesarean delivery). Tranexamic acid reduces PPH >1000mL in cesarean but not vaginal births. - **Early Intervention:** Act promptly with a multidisciplinary team approach. Communicate clearly with patients and birthing partners. - **Assessment/Resuscitation:** Monitor for shock (a late sign); measure lactate, base deficit, Hb, and hematocrit. Early blood transfusion service communication is critical. - **Management:** Use combined pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical methods based on cause (4 T’s: **Tone**, **Tissue**, **Trauma**, **Thrombin**). - **Pharmacological:** Oxytocin, ergometrine, TXA (for active bleeding). - **Mechanical/Surgical:** Uterine massage, balloon tamponade, brace sutures, devascularization, hysterectomy if needed. - **Blood Products:** FFP for ongoing bleeding; maintain fibrinogen >2g/L; platelet transfusion if <75x10⁹/L; avoid Factor VIIa. Cell salvage recommended for anticipated major blood loss. - **Aftercare:** Document accurately, schedule follow-up, and provide emotional support. - **Staff Training:** Mandatory obstetric emergency training, including PPH protocols. Regular audits to improve care quality. *Appendix: 4 T’s of PPH Causes* - **Tone** (uterine atony, overdistension). - **Tissue** (retained placenta/clots). - **Trauma** (lacerations, uterine rupture). - **Thrombin** (coagulopathies)",
