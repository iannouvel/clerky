Key recommendations include: - **Referral:** Urgent cases require immediate referral; less urgent cases can be assessed during daytime. - **Assessment:** Conduct a thorough history and examination to determine the foreign bodyâ€™s nature and duration. Investigations may be needed for infection or complications. - **Treatment:** Prioritize urgent removal for sharp objects or severe bleeding. Tailor treatment to symptom severity. - **After Care:** Discharge same-day if appropriate; provide mental health support for habitual insertion cases. - **Causes:** Foreign bodies may result from accidents, self-insertion, sexual abuse, or mental health issues. - **Compliance:** Regular audits will ensure adherence to the protocol. Nurses and gynaecologists must follow this guidance, and management must ensure accessibility and regular reviews. Professional judgement applies in protocol implementation",
