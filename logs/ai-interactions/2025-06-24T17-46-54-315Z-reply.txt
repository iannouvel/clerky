Introduction\nCTG monitoring should never be regarded as a substitute for good clinical observation and judgement, or as an excuse for leaving the mother unattended during labor.\n2. Indications\nContinuous CTG monitoring should be considered in all situations where there is a high risk of fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG is also recommended when abnormalities are detected during intermittent fetal auscultation. The routine use of admission CTG for low-risk women on entrance to the labor ward has been associated with an increase in cesarean delivery rates and no improvement in perinatal outcomes.\n3. Tracing acquisition\nMaternal supine recumbent position should be avoided for prolonged monitoring. CTG acquisition can be performed by portable sensors that transmit signals wirelessly to a remote fetal monitor. External FHR monitoring is the recommended initial method for routine intrapartum monitoring. Simultaneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate can be useful in specific maternal health conditions.\n4. Analysis of tracings\nCTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions) followed by overall CTG classification.\n\nAcute fetal hypoxemia can result in tachycardia. Bradycardia is defined as a baseline value below 110 bpm lasting more than 10 minutes. Variability in fetal heart rate signal is important, with reduced variability indicating potential issues. Accelerations in fetal heart rate above the baseline are a sign of a neurologically responsive fetus. Decelerations below the baseline can indicate fetal hypoxia. Sinusoidal patterns may indicate severe fetal anemia. Clinical decisions should integrate CTG analysis with other clinical information. Action in cases of suspected fetal hypoxia may involve identifying and reversing underlying causes.\n\nManagement of fetal hypoxia/acidosis during labor requires careful assessment and intervention. Oxygen administration and intravenous fluids may not be effective in improving fetal oxygenation. Clinical judgment is needed to diagnose and address underlying causes of abnormal CTG patterns. Prompt action should be taken to avoid prolonged fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Limitations of cardiotocography include observer disagreement and the inability to accurately predict hypoxia/acidosis. Continuous CTG monitoring may not significantly improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary interventions. Clinical guidelines should be simple and objective for proper use of technology. Regular training of labor ward staff is essential for safe monitoring.\n\net Gynaecol Res 2007;33(3):266 –73.\nAbnormal uterine action during labour.

A: ### Very Important Recommendations  
**Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient was counseled about macrosomia risks (shoulder dystocia, birth injury) and whether this counseling included discussion of elective cesarean section as an option.  
Reason: The note states the patient "hasn't been counselled re macrosomia," which is critical given the increased risks associated with fetal macrosomia (guideline emphasizes integrating clinical context with CTG findings).  

**Different management plan** - Stronger recommendation for admission and continuous CTG monitoring given the combination of reduced fetal movements (RFM) + non-reassuring CTG (failure to meet Dawes-Redman criteria) + macrosomia.  
Reason: FIGO guidelines recommend continuous CTG for high-risk situations (Section 2), and this case has multiple risk factors (RFM, borderline CTG, macrosomia). The current plan (discharge with repeat CTG in 4 hours) may delay intervention if fetal compromise develops.  

---  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - Explicitly document the quantified risks of adverse outcomes with expectant management (e.g., "The risk of stillbirth with RFM at term is approximately X% based on [citation], and macrosomia increases the risk of shoulder dystocia by Y%").  
Reason: FIGO guidelines stress integrating clinical judgment with objective data (Section 4). Providing statistics aligns with shared decision-making.  

**Additional information needed** - Clarify why the CTG did not meet Dawes-Redman criteria (e.g., quantify "long-term variation during episodes of high variation below acceptable level" with specific values).  
Reason: FIGO guidelines emphasize precise interpretation of variability (Section 4). Specific data would support the decision to repeat CTG vs. escalate care.  

---  

### Less Important Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - Suggest alternative positions for CTG monitoring (e.g., lateral recumbent) if repeated.  
Reason: FIGO guidelines recommend avoiding supine positioning (Section 3), though this is less critical in this context.  

**Additional information needed** - Document maternal heart rate during CTG to rule out signal confusion.  
Reason: FIGO notes simultaneous maternal heart rate monitoring can be useful (Section 3), though fetal macrosomia makes this less likely here.  

---  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - Mention wireless CTG options if the patient prefers mobility.  
Reason: FIGO mentions wireless sensors (Section 3), but this is a minor logistical point.  

---  

### Key Omissions in Guideline Alignment:  
1. **No clear escalation pathway** for persistent non-reassuring CTG (e.g., when to consider delivery). FIGO stresses prompt action for hypoxia (Section 4).  
2. **No documentation of contractions** (frequency/duration) despite "irregular tightenings." FIGO requires contraction assessment for CTG interpretation (Section 4).  

**Suggested Additions to Note:**  
- "Macrosomia counseling completed: discussed risks of shoulder dystocia (X%), birth injury (Y%), and option of elective CS."  
- "Plan: Admit for continuous CTG due to RFM + borderline CTG + macrosomia. If CTG remains non-reassuring after 1 hour, recommend delivery (IOL/CS)."  
- "Contractions: irregular, 1-2/10 mins, lasting <30 sec."  

*Rationale: FIGO prioritizes integrating CTG with clinical risks (Section 4), and this case warrants a higher level of vigilance.*
