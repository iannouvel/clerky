Avoid routine induction in precipitate labor, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without risk factors. - **Pre-Induction Assessment:** Check maternal/fetal wellbeing, gestation, and Bishop Score. - **Cervical Ripening:** Balloon catheter (outpatient/inpatient) or dinoprostone gel (individualized). Monitor for complications. - **Oxytocin Use:** Start after obstetric review; titrate to achieve adequate contractions. Monitor maternal/fetal observations closely. - **Special Circumstances:** Preterm labor, IUFD, previous C-section, diabetes, obesity, PROM. For PROM at term, offer induction or expectant management with close monitoring. - **Complications:** Manage uterine hyperstimulation with fetal assessment, tocolysis, or emergency delivery if rupture suspected. - **Failed Induction:** Reassess within 24-48 hours; options include further attempts or C-section. - **Monitoring:** Regular CTG, temperature checks (if PROM), and documentation of all procedures. **Key Points:** - Individualize counseling on risks/benefits. - Adhere to protocols for dinoprostone/oxytocin administration. - Prioritize fetal wellbeing and maternal choice. - Audit outcomes to improve practice.
