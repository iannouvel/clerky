Monitor for hyperstimulation, contraindications, and dose adjustments. - **Oxytocin Regime**: Start low, increase gradually; review every 30 minutes. Document doses and CTG findings. - **Duration**: Discontinue after 6 hours without progress unless Consultant approves continuation. Monitor for water intoxication. - **Second Stage**: Consider interventions based on timeframes; avoid oxytocin if contraindicated. Augmentation aims for 4-5 contractions/10 mins. - **Third Stage**: Active management recommended; stop oxytocin post-delivery. - **Documentation**: Record all assessments, doses, and fetal monitoring. - **Key Contraindications**: Assess before use; avoid if risks outweigh benefits. - **Professional Judgment**: Individualize care plans while adhering to protocol",
