      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice:** Select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum does not increase cesarean rates or neonatal complications like low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure:** Mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure:** Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care:** Monitor for complications, provide analgesia, bladder care, and thromboprophylaxis. Document and discuss the birth with the patient. - **Psychological support:** Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure a supportive environment for patients and staff after adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance:** Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports when required, and follow RCOG auditable standards",
