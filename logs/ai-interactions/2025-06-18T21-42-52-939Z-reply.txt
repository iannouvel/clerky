      "newValue": "**Summary of Fetal Heart Monitoring Guidelines:** - **Monitoring Methods:** Use intermittent auscultation (Pinard’s stethoscope) for low-risk pregnancies and continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) for high-risk cases (e.g., hypertension, breech presentation). - **Antenatal Monitoring:** Apply Dawes-Redman Criteria from 26 weeks; discontinue after 10 minutes if met; seek obstetric review if not met by 60 minutes. - **Intrapartum Monitoring:** Regular CTG review, with TREND analysis for classification. Escalate concerns promptly. - **Poor CTG Quality:** Address transducer issues, reposition, or use fetal scalp electrode (FSE). For telemetry problems, check battery/antenna or switch to wired monitoring. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders, prematurity <34 weeks). Avoid if expedited birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Perform if fetal concerns arise during labor, especially for SGA/FGR cases. Paired samples (artery/vein) should be analyzed promptly; document results. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; ensure 10 minutes of quality data. Results update every 2 minutes (max 60 mins). Not diagnostic—requires clinical correlation. - **Documentation:** Store CTG traces for 25 years; record clinical context and interventions. *Key: Prioritize maternal preferences, clinical context, and team communication.* (199 words)",
