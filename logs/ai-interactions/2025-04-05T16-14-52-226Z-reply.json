Routine cerclage is not recommended without cervical length assessment. In women with prior second-trimester loss, cervical length surveillance should begin at 16 weeks in subsequent pregnancies.\"\n\n### HTML-Formatted Clinical Note with Adjustments:  \n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Clinical Note - Patient Encounter</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Clinical Note</h1>\n    \n    <h2>Summary:</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Age: 35 years.</li>\n        <li>BMI: 25 kg/m².</li>\n        <li>Gravida 5, Para 3 (live births), 1 (miscarriage), 1 (termination).</li>\n        <li>Presenting complaints:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss (most recent at 18 weeks).</li>\n                <li>Chronic pelvic pain (worsening over 6 months, cyclical, with deep dyspareunia).</li>\n                <li>No history of cervical insufficiency, thrombophilia, or autoimmune disorders.</li>\n                <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding, no intermenstrual bleeding.</li>\n                <li>Desires future pregnancy.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <h2>Detailed Assessment:</h2>\n    <ol>\n        <li><strong>Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss</strong>:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Three prior uncomplicated term deliveries, one first-trimester miscarriage, and one second-trimester loss at 18 weeks (no identified cause).</li>\n                <li>No prior cervical length assessments or thrombophilia workup.</li>\n                <li>Plan includes pelvic ultrasound for uterine anatomy, thrombophilia screen, and preconception counselling.</li>\n                <li><i>Cervical cerclage may be considered in future pregnancy if cervical insufficiency is confirmed, but only after cervical length assessment at 16 weeks in subsequent pregnancies.</i> (BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage)</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        \n        <li><strong>Chronic pelvic pain</strong>:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Cyclical worsening during menses and deep dyspareunia, suggestive of endometriosis or adenomyosis.</li>\n                <li>No urinary/bowel symptoms or systemic signs.</li>\n                <li>Trial of hormonal therapy (progesterone-only pill or GnRH analogue) proposed.</li>\n                <li>Diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist despite medical management.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        \n        <li><strong>Patient concerns</strong>:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Anxiety regarding undiagnosed cause of recurrent losses and pelvic pain.</li>\n                <li>Reassurance provided, with emphasis on structured investigations and follow-up.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ol>\n    \n    <h2>Plan:</h2>\n    <ol>\n        <li>Recurrent loss workup:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Pelvic ultrasound to assess uterine anatomy.</li>\n                <li>Thrombophilia screen (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies).</li>\n                <li>Preconception counselling; <i>consider cervical length surveillance starting at 16 weeks in future pregnancy before deciding on cerclage.</i> (BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage)</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        \n        <li>Pelvic pain management:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Trial of hormonal therapy (progesterone-only pill or GnRH analogue).</li>\n                <li>Diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        \n        <li>Patient education:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Lifestyle modifications (e.g., pelvic floor exercises).</li>\n                <li>Scheduled follow-up in 4 weeks for review of investigations and further planning.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments Based on Guidelines:  \n1. The note originally suggested considering cerclage if cervical insufficiency is confirmed, but the guideline emphasizes that cervical length assessment should come first. The adjusted text now specifies the need for cervical length surveillance starting at 16 weeks in future pregnancies before considering cerclage.  \n2. The plan section was updated to reflect that cerclage should not be considered without prior cervical length assessment, in line with the guideline's recommendation against routine cerclage without this evaluation.  \n\nBoth adjustments reference the **BJOG - 2022 - Shennan - Cervical Cerclage** guideline to maintain clarity about the evidence-based recommendations driving these changes.",
