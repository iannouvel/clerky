She describes her baby as typically active, with regular movements felt daily, but now perceives only 2-3 faint movements in a 12-hour period. No associated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage. She denies recent trauma, illness, or fever.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- Previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 39 weeks (male infant, 3.4 kg).  \n- No history of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or prior fetal growth restriction.  \n\n**Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Mild asthma (well-controlled, uses salbutamol PRN).  \n- No known hypertension, diabetes, or thrombophilia.  \n- No prior surgeries.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- Occasional salbutamol inhaler  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use.  \n- Works as a teacher, moderate physical activity.  \n\n*(Note: Incomplete history—did not inquire about family history of clotting disorders, prior stillbirth, or detailed dietary habits.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/72 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- Temp: 36.8°C  \n- RR: 16/min  \n\n**Abdomen:**  \n- Fundal height: 26 cm (slightly small for dates)  \n- Leopold’s maneuvers: Fetus in cephalic presentation  \n- Fetal heart rate: 142 bpm (Doppler)  \n- No uterine tenderness or palpable contractions  \n\n*(Note: Incomplete exam—no documentation of maternal weight trend, no urinalysis performed, no assessment for edema.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \n**Concern for possible placental insufficiency** given:  \n- Decreased fetal movements (potential marker of fetal compromise).  \n- Fundal height lagging by 2 cm (possible early growth restriction).  \n- No other clear etiology identified at this time.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Fetal Monitoring:**  \n   - Arrange for a **non-stress test (NST) and biophysical profile (BPP)** to assess fetal well-being.  \n   - If abnormal, consider urgent ultrasound for Doppler studies (umbilical artery resistance).  \n\n2. **Maternal Surveillance:**  \n   - Monitor BP trends for signs of preeclampsia (though currently normotensive).  \n   - Consider baseline labs (CBC, renal function, coagulation screen) if high suspicion.  \n\n3. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Advised to perform **daily fetal kick counts** and present immediately if <6 movements in 2 hours.  \n   - Low threshold for re-evaluation if symptoms worsen.  \n\n4. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat growth scan in 2 weeks to assess interval fetal growth.  \n   - If placental insufficiency confirmed, may need increased surveillance or early delivery depending on severity.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Patient to return in 1 week for repeat assessment or sooner if concerns arise.  \n- Dictated by: Dr. A.
