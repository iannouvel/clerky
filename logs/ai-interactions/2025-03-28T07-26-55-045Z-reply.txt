**Clinical Dictation – Fictional Patient Encounter**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe (pseudonym for documentation)  
- **Age:** 36 years  
- **Weight:** 148 kg  
- **Height:** 1.62 m  
- **BMI:** 56.4 kg/m²  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator  
- **Parity:** G3P2 (2 prior vaginal deliveries, 1 early miscarriage)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of heavy, irregular vaginal bleeding and worsening pelvic pain. She also reports a 4-month history of secondary amenorrhea prior to the onset of bleeding.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- The bleeding is described as "flooding," requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1–2 pads hourly on heavy days).  
- Associated with passage of large clots and intermittent cramping pain, rated 7/10 in severity.  
- No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was approximately 6 months ago, followed by amenorrhea until recent bleeding.  
- Denies unprotected intercourse in the last year.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin)  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril)  
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – diagnosed age 28  
- Depression (on sertraline)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 20)  
- Dilation and curettage (D&C) for incomplete miscarriage (age 32)  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 13, cycles historically irregular (every 35–90 days).  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  
- Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  
- Contraception: Condoms intermittently, no hormonal contraception in the last 5 years.  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 1g BD  
- Lisinopril 10mg OD  
- Sertraline 50mg OD  
- No recent NSAID use  

**Allergies:**  
- Penicillin (rash)  

**Social History:**  
- Smokes 10 cigarettes/day (15 pack-year history)  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  
- Lives with partner and two children  
- Sedentary occupation, reports difficulty with physical activity due to weight and joint pain  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried that bleeding may be "something serious like cancer" due to family history (mother had endometrial cancer at 55).  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery, given her weight and diabetes.  
- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on the cause and treatment options, including "whether hormones or an operation is needed."  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Speculum:** Active bleeding noted, cervix appears nulliparous with no visible lesions.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Complex Gynaecological Issue 1: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) secondary to likely endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.**  
   - Risk factors: obesity, PCOS, anovulation, diabetes.  
2. **Complex Gynaecological Issue 2: Chronic pelvic pain with possible adenomyosis** (given bulky uterus and history of D&C).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and adnexae.  
   - Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle) to exclude hyperplasia/malignancy.  
   - HbA1c and full blood count (FBC) to assess anemia and diabetic control.  
2. **Immediate:**  
   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS for heavy bleeding.  
   - Counsel on weight loss impact on symptoms and surgical risks.  
3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Urgent gynaecology clinic review with results.  
   - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD) if hyperplasia benign.  
   - Smoking cessation referral.  

**Patient Counseled:**  
- Risks of untreated AUB (anemia, cancer progression).  
- Importance of biopsy despite discomfort.  
- Weight loss as a long-term priority to reduce recurrence risk.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Expedited TVUS and biopsy arranged.  
- GP to monitor blood pressure and HbA1c.
