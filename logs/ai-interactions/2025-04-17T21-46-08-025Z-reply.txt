A: **Clinical Dictation – Fictional for Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** [Redacted]  
- **Age:** 61 years  
- **Weight:** 68 kg  
- **BMI:** 23.4  
- **Prior Pregnancies:** 1 (G1P1)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient reports a 4-month history of intermittent postmenopausal bleeding, described as light spotting occurring approximately once every 2–3 weeks. She denies associated pain but reports mild fatigue.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- First episode of bleeding occurred 4 months ago, initially dismissed as insignificant.  
- Bleeding is unpredictable, scant, and not associated with trauma or exertion.  
- No recent hormonal therapy or new medications.  
- No weight loss, fever, or night sweats.  
- No dyspareunia or urinary symptoms.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (controlled on amlodipine 5 mg OD).  
- Osteopenia (no fractures).  
- No history of diabetes or hyperlipidemia.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 24).  
- No prior gynecological surgeries.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, regular cycles prior to menopause at age 53.  
- No history of abnormal cervical screening.  
- One full-term vaginal delivery (age 28), no complications.  
- No history of endometriosis or fibroids.  

**Drug History:**  
- Amlodipine 5 mg OD.  
- Calcium/vitamin D supplement.  
- No HRT or anticoagulants.  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Retired schoolteacher.  
- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Lives with husband, independent with ADLs.  
- Moderate physical activity (walking 3x/week).  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried this could be "something serious like cancer."  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about invasive tests.  
- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on cause and reassurance.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  
- **Pelvic (speculum):** Minimal atrophic vaginitis, no visible cervical lesions.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus normal size, no adnexal masses.  

**Assessment:**  
Postmenopausal bleeding in a 61-year-old with BMI 23.4 raises concern for **endometrial hyperplasia** (per **GTG 2014 guidelines**). Risk factors include age >60 and nulliparity (though parity is protective, her single pregnancy may still confer some risk). Differential includes atrophic endometritis, polyps, or malignancy.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Transvaginal ultrasound:** To assess endometrial thickness (if >4 mm, biopsy indicated).  
   - **Endometrial biopsy (pipelle):** Gold standard for histology.  
   - Bloods: FBC (rule out anemia), HbA1c (assess metabolic risk).  

2. **Patient Counseling:**  
   - Reassure that most causes are benign but emphasize need for exclusion of malignancy.  
   - Discuss biopsy procedure and expected discomfort.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Urgent referral to gynecology for biopsy given PMB.  
   - If hyperplasia confirmed, discuss options per GTG 2014 (progestogens vs. hysterectomy based on atypia).  

**Prognosis:**  
Favorable if hyperplasia without atypia; close surveillance if conservative management chosen.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await biopsy results.  
- Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks.
