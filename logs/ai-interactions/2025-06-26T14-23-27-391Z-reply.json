    "transcript": "SITUATION: 32-year-old G2P1 at 36+4 weeks gestation presenting with severe preeclampsia requiring urgent delivery planning\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Jones has had an uncomplicated pregnancy until 34 weeks when routine antenatal bloods showed mild proteinuria. She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.",
