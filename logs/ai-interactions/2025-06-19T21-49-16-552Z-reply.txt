  "transcript": "Patient attended my gynae clinic today following internal referral by my colleague with scan finding of 5 cm complex right ovarian cyst suspicious of\ndermoid. This referral I note was made in early 2024. She is a 56 years of age and\nnulliparous. She does not report any abdominal pain but I note that the scan was\nundertaken as part of a regular surveillance for BRCA gene mutation. She is\nmenopausal and reports no abnormal bleeding but has Mirena coil in situ for 5 years for\nmanagement of heavy periods. Her cervical smear is in date and negative.\nShe has a history of the chronic immune thrombocytopenia and a previous laparotomy\nand removal of one ovary years' ago for large cyst suspicious of dermoid. She is not on\nany medication and has no history of drug allergy. She is in a stable relationship and\ndoes not smoke.\nHer last imaging report I can see on the system was a scan undertaken in\nSeptember 2020 that confirmed a 5 cm complex right ovarian cyst suspicious of dermoid.\nThere is no up-to-date tumour markers. In view of her history, I have put in a request for\na pelvic MRI and also requested serum CA 125. I will review her with the investigation\nresults. If necessary, her case will be reviewed at the gynae-oncology MDT meeting",
