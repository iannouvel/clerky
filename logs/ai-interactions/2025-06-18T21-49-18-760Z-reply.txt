Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. - **Support for mothers** includes early milk expression if separated, responsive feeding assessments, and addressing positioning/attachment. - **Supplementation** should be limited, medically justified, and administered via cup, syringe, or tube to avoid nipple confusion. - **Formula feeding guidance** covers safe preparation, responsive feeding, and recognizing cues. Ready-made formula is recommended for hospital use. - **Parent-infant bonding** is promoted through rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleep practices (e.g., cot by the bed). - **Staff responsibilities** include mandatory breastfeeding training, annual updates, and adherence to Baby Friendly Initiative standards. - **Monitoring & referrals** include weight checks (birth, day 5, day 10), feeding assessments, and escalation for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Audits & compliance** are conducted annually via UNICEF BFI standards, with outcomes reported to relevant committees.
