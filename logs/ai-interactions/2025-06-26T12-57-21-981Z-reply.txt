First pregnancy ended at 19 weeks with sudden painless dilatation and delivery following spontaneous rupture of membranes. Second pregnancy was similar at 21 weeks despite attempted cervical cerclage at 14 weeks, which was unsuccessful. Both losses were attributed to cervical insufficiency. Current pregnancy was planned with preconception counselling. She was commenced on vaginal progesterone from 16 weeks and had prophylactic cervical cerclage inserted at 13 weeks. Serial cervical length monitoring has shown gradual shortening from 35mm at 16 weeks to 18mm at 20 weeks. She presented today after noticing increased clear vaginal discharge and pelvic pressure for 2 days. No bleeding, no contractions, no urinary symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well but anxious. Vital signs stable. Speculum examination reveals cervix 2-3cm dilated with visible membranes bulging through cervical os. Cerclage suture remains in situ but appears loose. No bleeding, clear amniotic fluid visible. Transvaginal ultrasound confirms cervical length of 8mm with funneling. Fetal biometry appropriate for dates, amniotic fluid volume normal, fetal heart rate 148 bpm. No evidence of chorioamnionitis - maternal temperature 36.8°C, WCC 8.2 x10⁹/L, CRP <5 mg/L.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Emergency rescue cerclage considered but challenging given advanced dilatation and bulging membranes. Admitted for strict bed rest and close monitoring. Tocolytics (nifedipine) commenced to reduce uterine activity. Antibiotics (erythromycin) started prophylactically. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) given for fetal lung maturity. Daily monitoring for signs of infection or labor. Neonatal team consulted regarding extremely preterm delivery risks. Difficult discussion with parents regarding poor prognosis at current gestation but potential for prolongation of pregnancy.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] mp001-provision-and-schedules-of-antenatal-care-pdf\nTitle: MP001 Provision and Schedules of Antenatal Care\nContent: Provision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 2 of 33 \n\nProvision and \nSchedules of \nAntenatal Care \n\nMaternity Protocol: MP001 \n Date agreed: April 2022 \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 3 of 33 \n\nGuideline Reviewer: Kate Morgan, Maria Stafford, Rebecca Elms \nVersion: 4.4 \nApproval Committee: Service users’s Services Safety and Quality Committee \nDate agreed: \nAmended Date: \nApril 2022 \nFebruary 2019, July 2019, December 2019, May 2020, August 2020, \nNovember 2020, March 2022 \nReview date: April 2025 \nCross reference: CO16 Domestic Abuse Policy \nMP011 Obesity \nMP010 Anti D and Rhesus Negative \nMP013 Safeguarding Children and Child Protection \nMP014 with Mental Health Problems \nMP017 DNA Appointments \nMP033 Induction of Labour \nMP046 Breech & ECV \nAntenatal Screening Protocols: \nMP002 Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme \nMP003 Sickle Cell & Thalassaemia \nMP004 Infections in Pregnancy -

The guidance is not rigid and should be \ntailored to the individual circumstances of each pregnant person. If the guidance is \nnot being followed, documentation of the reasoning and/or justification is essential, \nwith clear documentation of alternative plans and discussions \n \nManagement Team: \n• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National \nrecommendations \n• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff \n• To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 6 of 33 \n\n1 Booking and Antenatal: \nThe process for ensuring that service users have their first full booking visit and \nBadger Net record completed by 10 completed weeks of pregnancy. \nThe following points need to be reviewed and discussed at each point of contact in \nthe antenatal period: \n• Risk assessment \n• Place of Birth \n• Personalised care plans \n\n2 Process and responsibilities of staff groups for initial contact and \nbooking: \n \n2.1 Newly pregnant women and people will self-refer via the e-referral system \non the UH Sussex website. The GP surgeries sign post them to this process. \nThe Maternity Office will generate a scan appointment and apply the \nnamed community midwife who is linked to their GP surgery. \n2.2 Pregnant women and people will be informed prior to their booking \nappointment that they need to download the Badgernet app and to \ncomplete the pre booking questionnaire prior to attending their booking \nappointment. The midwife should ensure women and people have access to \nthe app at their first contact with the woman and pregnant person. \n2.3 At the booking appointment a booking questionnaire is completed on \nBadgerNet by the midwife with the woman and person (demographics, \nmedical, social, psychological, obstetric history). The midwife then needs \nto refer all women and people to the Antenatal Clinic Lead Midwife via \nBadgerNet. \n2.4 The booking visit and the completion of the BadgerNet records should \nbe completed by the midwife by the 10\nth\n completed week of pregnancy. \n \n3 Late bookers: \nA late booking is defined as presenting for maternity services after 20 weeks of \npregnancy. \n3.1 Pregnant women and people over >12 weeks and un-booked: Midwife to \ncomplete a late booking form when online e-referral received and ensure a \nwoman and person has been booked within 2 weeks of initial referral. The \nprocess is followed as above with the community midwife responsible for \nensuring referrals are actioned urgently. A pre-booking appointment is not \nrequired. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 7 of 33 \n\n3.2 Scans: \nIf <20 weeks maternity office at PRH will do a scan referral to scan department, \nif >20 weeks it is the booking midwife’s responsibility to refer for scan. \n \nIn relation to fetal anomaly screening please refer to Maternity Protocol: \nMP002 Antenatal screening: Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 8 of 33 \n\n3.3 Women and people who have received A/N care during this pregnancy, but \nfrom another Trust should be seen by a community midwife within 2 weeks \nbut will not usually require a scan unless clinically indicated. \n3.4 Where a midwife appointment is not available in the midwives own clinic the \nmidwife will make arrangements for the woman and person to be seen for \nbooking at another available clinic as soon as possible. \n3.5 The community midwife should undertake a booking appointment and \ncomplete the BadgerNet smart booking form. The reason for late \nbooking should be documented on BadgerNet and on the antenatal \nlead midwife referral. \n3.6 Where women and people have booked at another trust and are transferring \ncare to UH SUSSEX, the booking midwife should recommend that all booking \nbloods [to include blood tests for screening: Infectious diseases and sickle cell \nand thalassaemia] are repeated. This ensures a result is held within this NHS \ntrust. Where women and people decline to have bloods repeated the \nbooking midwife should ensure the following: \n \n• Advise the woman and person to have FBC and blood group \nrepeated as a minimum \n• Scan and upload hard copies of blood results from the previous trust \nto BadgerNet \n• Hand written results from another trust are not acceptable. Where \nthere are no hard copies of previous results attempts should be made \nto access the results from the previous trust. Where no hard copies \nare available and the pregnant person continues to decline screening \nbloods, a \nblood decline form should be sent to the Service users’s Health \nAdvisor [See Antenatal Screening policies for HIV, Hep B and \nSyphilis and sickle cell and thalassaemia for more information]. \n• The service users’s decision to decline repeat screening should be \nclearly documented on BadgerNet \n3.7 If booking is late due to a transfer from another area, the midwife transfers \nprevious antenatal information from service users’s hand held notes to this \nTrust’s maternity notes. Where risk factors are identified midwife to consider \n(following discussion with the obstetric team) requesting copies of any \nprevious notes from the relevant Trust. If a pregnant person has had a 20/40 \nscan in the UK she does not need a repeat, but booking bloods need repeating. \n3.8 If the booking falls on or after 20 weeks and there is no history of antenatal \ncare, the pregnant person should be advised to see a Consultant \nObstetrician. The referral by the midwife can be made for the next \navailable Consultant appointment in ANC via BadgerNet or by phone/email \nto the Maternity Office. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 9 of 33 \n\n3.9 If there are concerns for the pregnant person and her unborn baby’s welfare, \na referral to be sent to children’s services electronically via the PANDA Portal, \ncopying in community team leaders and safe guarding team. See Maternity \nProtocol: MP013 Safeguarding Children and Child Protection for further \ninformation. \n\n4 Concealed Pregnancy: \n \nA concealed pregnancy is when a pregnant person knows she is pregnant but \ndoes not tell anyone; or a pregnant person appears genuinely not to be aware \nshe is pregnant. \n \nConcealment may be an active act or a form of denial where support from \nappropriate carers and health professionals is not sought. This can become apparent \nat any stage of the pregnancy. Concealment of pregnancy may be revealed late in \npregnancy; in labour; or following delivery. The birth may be unassisted and may \ncarry additional risks to the child and mother's welfare. \n \nIn all cases where a young person/pregnant person arrives at the hospital in labour \nor following an unassisted delivery, which has been the result of a concealed \npregnancy, an immediate referral must be made to Children's Social Care. Please see \nMaternity Protocol: MP013 Safeguarding Children and Child Protection for further \ninformation. \n \nThe baby should not be discharged until a Strategy Meeting has been held and \nrelevant assessments undertaken. This Strategy Meeting must consider the initiation \nof a psychiatric assessment. \n \nWhere the referral is received out of hours in relation to a baby born as the result of \na concealed pregnancy, the Emergency Out of Hours Service will take steps to \nprevent the baby being discharged from hospital until Children's Social Care have \nbeen informed and given their approval for discharge, in most instances this would \nbe after a Child and Family Assessment has been undertaken. The baby should not \nbe discharged out of hours. \n\n5 For Service users coming in from Outside the UK (Migrant Service users): \n \nIf a pregnant person has had no previous full medical examination in the UK the \nmidwife should make an urgent referral for a full medical examination with the GP \nin order that a full medical history can be undertaken and clinical assessment \nmade of their overall health using an interpreter if necessary. The referral date and \nGP appointment date and time must be documented on the pregnant person’s \nBadgerNet record. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 10 of 33 \n\n6 Communication and Language Support: \n6.1 Service users for whom English is not their first language \n6.1.1 The Midwife should assess the need for an interpreter at the first \nbooking appointment and if required make arrangements with the \ninterpreting service for the booking appointment. \n6.1.2 It is not acceptable for a family member to act as the interpreter \nbecause there can be confusion about medical terminology or the \npotential for misrepresentation of information. \n6.1.3 The use of an interpreter needs to be documented on BadgerNet \nand a plan made for future antenatal visits, labour and birth and the \npostnatal period. If referral to the hospital is necessary the \ninterpreting service should be arranged for the time of the \nappointment. \n6.1.4 The interpreting service can be arranged by midwives and doctors or \ndelegated to support staff. Reception staff should also be made aware \nof the importance of the need to plan for future visits. \n6.1.5 48 hours ‘notice is required to arrange the attendance of an \ninterpreter. \n6.1.6 Contact the service either on line at www.sussexinterpreting.org.uk or \nthrough the relevant community midwives office stating the language \nyou require. Please give as much detail of the specific language or \ndialect as possible. \n6.1.7 If there needs to be more than one session booked please complete \nthe booking form (available on the UHSUSSEX Intranet). \n \nRSCH & PRH Sussex Interpreter service \nOffice hours Out of office hours & Sat/Sun \n01273 702 005 07811 459 315 \n01273 380013 \n \nFax 01273 234 787 \n\n6.2 Service users with other communication difficulties \nBSL: British Sign Language \nNon Emergency: 08445 938443 \nEmergency: 07947 714040 \nOnline booking: www.actiondeafness.org.uk \n6.3 For service users with mental health difficulties please see Maternity \nProtocol MP014: Service users with Mental Health Problems. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 11 of 33 \n\n7 Identification of Service users with Risk Factors and Reviewing \nPrevious Notes: \n7.1 Timing of risk assessments: Risk assessment should be undertaken at booking \nby the midwife. At each point of contact with a health professional this initial \nrisk assessment should be reviewed and risk status altered accordingly with \nappropriate referrals and individual plan of care as required. This should be \nclearly documented on BadgerNet. \n \n7.2 Following booking the community midwife should complete an Antenatal \nClinic Lead Midwife referral on BadgerNet. This referral has details of medical, \nsocial, psychiatric and previous and current obstetric history that will have \nbeen gathered from communication between the midwife and pregnant \nperson at the booking appointment. A risk assessment will be made based on \nthe information given. A list of the medical conditions to be considered \n(including anesthetic and psychiatric history), factors from previous \npregnancies, lifestyle history as part of the risk assessment are in Appendix D. \n\n7.3 The referral will be reviewed by the A/N lead midwife who will identify risk \nfactors (see Appendix D for list) and offer service users appointments in \nantenatal clinic to meet with the obstetric team, or specialist midwife as \nappropriate (see Appendix D for list of types of referrals). An appointment will \nbe generated by the ward clerks, put on the maternity computer system and \nsent to service users by post with an appointment time, date and location. \n \n7.4 The process for arranging the availability of health notes from previous \npregnancies that are required for review by clinicians: all service users notes \nfrom previous pregnancies are requested from the main medical library and \nsent to the maternity unit storage for easy access. \n7.4.1 At RSCH the ward clerks input the booking data and request the \nprevious obstetric notes to be sent to L13 RSCH \n7.4.2 At PRH the midwife or ward clerk inputs the booking data and request \nthe previous obstetric notes to be sent to the maternity office 2\nnd\n \nFloor PRH \n7.5 Identification which service users’s health notes from previous pregnancies \nare required for review by clinicians: If service users are referred to ANC (i.e. \nservice users that have been referred to the obstetric antenatal clinic for an \nobstetric or anaesthetic review due to identified risk factors during the \nbooking process) the previous obstetric notes will be pulled by the ward clerks \nready for their clinical appointment where they will be reviewed by the \nclinician. Should risk factors occur during pregnancy the notes can be accessed \nby clinicians or ward clerks internally within the maternity unit. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 12 of 33 \n\n7.6 If service users have identified neonatal risk factors e.g. family history or \ninherited metabolic disorders such as MCADD, a referral to a Neonatal \nConsultant should be generated for care planning and discussion regarding \nthe implications of this risk factor (in line with NPSA - rapid response alert \nNPSA/2011/RRR002) \n7.7 If service users have identified Child Protection issues the previous obstetric \nnotes will be reviewed by the Child Protection Lead during the antenatal \nperiod (see MP013: Safeguarding Children and Child protection for more \ndetail on process). \n7.8 If service users arrive on labour ward or DAU with complications clinicians \ncan access and review the previous obstetric notes by asking the ward \nclerk to identify and pull the notes for review (daytime) or by accessing \nthe notes themselves (night-time). \n7.9 If previous pregnancy/birth has occurred in another maternity unit (and there \nis an indication to review them during the current pregnancy) clinicians should \nattempt to request a copy of them from the unit where they are held. This \nattempt should be documented on BadgerNet. \n7.10 Risk assessment for pre-eclampsia: \nA risk assessment relating to pre-eclampsia should be undertaken by \nmidwives at booking. (NICE 2013). Service users will be deemed to be high, \nmoderate or low risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Community midwives will \nadvise the service users on their risk assessment outcome. This will be \ndocumented on BadgerNet. \n \nRisk assessment in relation to prevention of developing pre- eclampsia: \n \nService users at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia \nRisk Factors (any of the following) Plan of care \n \nHypertensive disease during a previous \npregnancy \nIf any of these risk factors \npresent: \n1. Advise to take 150mg \naspirin daily in the evening \nfrom 12 weeks gestation \nuntil 36 weeks of \npregnancy. \n2. Advise consultant review in \nANC at 16 weeks \n \nChronic hypertension \n \nChronic kidney disease \n \nAutoimmune disease \n(e.g. systemic lupus erythematosis or \nantiphospholipid syndrome) \n \nType 1 or 2 Diabetes \n\nService users at moderate risk of developing pre-eclampsia \nRisk Factors (any 2 of the following) Plan of care \n \nFirst pregnancy \nIf any 2 of these risk factors \npresent \n1. Advise to take 150mg \n \nAged 40 or over \n \nPregnancy interval of more than 10 years \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 13 of 33 \n\nBMI of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit \n(offer referral to Consultant ANC at 34/40 as \nper protocol) \naspirin daily in the evening \nfrom 12 weeks gestation \nuntil 36 weeks of pregnancy. \n2. Continue usual care \npathways (refer to ANC \nshould signs / symptoms of \npre-eclampsia become \napparent) \n \nFamily history of pre-eclampsia \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n(offer referral to Consultant ANC at 16/40 as \nper protocol) \n\nService users who are deemed high risk or with 2 moderate risk factors \nCommunity midwives will provide both verbal and written information \nrecommending service users to take 150mg aspirin daily in the evening \nfrom 12 weeks gestation until 36 weeks of pregnancy. \n7.10.1 Service users will be given 2 choices that will be clearly outlined \nin the leaflet: \n• To buy the aspirin themselves and self-medicate appropriately as \ninstructed (packet of Aspirin costs about 25p) \n• Use tear off slip in Aspirin leaflet to be collected from any pharmacy, \nneeds to be signed by community Midwife \n7.10.2 Service users at high risk of developing pre eclampsia will also be \noffered a referral to a consultant ANC by 16 weeks for a review and \nplan of care. \n7.10.3 Service users at moderate risk can continue with the usual care \npathway unless there is a deviation from the norm and a referral is \nindicated. \n7.10.4 A plan of care outlining the above will be clearly documented on \nBadgerNet. \n \n8 Missed Appointments: \nPlease refer to Maternity protocol MP017: DNA appointments \n \n9 The notes and antenatal booking visit: \n \n9.1 The first antenatal contact or 'booking' visit is the most important and detailed \nof all visits and gives an opportunity to assess general health and to start \nmaking forward-looking plans for pregnancy, birth and parenthood. It is \nconsidered to be part of the clinical risk assessment process. The following \nshould be considered and documented as part of the risk assessment: \n \n9.1.1 Medical conditions - see Appendix D for conditions to be considered / \nreferred \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 14 of 33 \n\n9.1.2 Anaesthetic risks - see Appendix D for conditions to be considered / \nreferred \n9.1.3 Psychiatric history - see Appendix D for conditions to be considered / \nreferred \n9.1.4 Factors from previous pregnancies - see Appendix D for conditions to \nbe considered / referred \n9.1.5 Lifestyle factors - see Appendix D for conditions to be considered / \nreferred \n9.1.6 Identification of service users who will decline blood / blood \nproducts ref MP053: Obstetric Haemorrhage) \n9.1.7 Appropriateness of place of birth (based on risk assessment) \n9.1.8 Following the risk assessment there should be the development of an \nindividual management plan for service users in whom risks are \nidentified. The Midwife should document the risk assessment and \nindividual management plan and make the appropriate referrals, \nrecording dates / times of appointments on the pregnant person’s \nBadgerNet record. \n \n9.2 All maternity care will be documented on the BadgerNet system. All service \nusers will have access to their own maternity record via the badgernotes \napp. Service users can access their maternity notes via the app on their \nphones or on a computer via the internet. \n9.3 The Maternity BadgerNet records are designed to be multi-disciplinary. All \nprofessionals who provide maternity care should document this within the \nBadgerNet records. \n9.4 For service users who do not have access to the internet or a mobile \nphone, all information entered onto BadgerNet should be printed and \ngiven to the pregnant person to carry as a handheld record. \n9.5 The BadgerNet maternity records include: \n9.4.1 booking data and pre conception details as appropriate \n9.4.2 clinical test results including ultrasonic scans, antenatal screening \ntests \n9.4.3 subsequent antenatal visits and examination \n9.4.4 antenatal in-patient summaries, blood test report \n9.4.5 Documented individualised antenatal risk assessment that is regularly \nreviewed throughout pregnancy \n9.4.6 Development of an individualised management plan for service \nusers in whom risks are identified during the clinical risk \nassessment. \n\n10 Calculating the EDD (Estimated Delivery Date) \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 15 of 33 \n\nRefer to Appendix B \n\n11 Responsibilities of relevant staff groups at booking: \n \n11.1 It is the responsibility of the midwife undertaking the booking assessment to \nensure that:- \n11.1.1 The midwife completes antenatal booking form on BadgerNet. If a \npregnant person has completed some of the data on the form prior \nto the appointment, the midwife must check all details on the form \nwith the pregnant person to ensure full and accurate completion. \n11.1.2 An accurate history is taken and documented using the \nBadgerNet system. \n11.1.3 A full risk assessment must be recorded and referrals made \nappropriately. The risk factors will be reviewed at subsequent \nantenatal appointments and at the onset of labour. \n11.1.4 Give the pregnant person an overview of the antenatal schedule \n(Appendix A) and how the information & notes are intended to be \nused. \n11.1.5 Ensure the pregnant person knows who their named midwife is and \nthat this is documented on BadgerNet, how to contact a midwife and \nis aware of the correct urgent/non urgent contact numbers. \n11.1.6 Give the leaflets (or information about accessing leaflets) and discuss \nthe information contained therein in line with the schedule of care \n(below). All discussions should be documented fully on BadgerNet. \n11.1.7 Encourage the pregnant person to read the information and guidance \ninformation within their BadgerNet records and to consider and \ndocument their preferences for labour and birth and to document any \nquestions she wishes to discuss. This should be reviewed and actioned \nat every subsequent point of contact. \n11.1.8 Ensure service users are signposted to Trust website and social \nmedia pages for further information. \n\n12 Responsibilities of all Health Professionals: \n12.1 Give the leaflets (or information about accessing leaflets) and discuss the \ninformation contained therein in line with the schedule of care (below). All \ndiscussions should be documented fully in the handheld notes. \n12.2 Health professionals who take blood/specimen tests are responsible for full \ndocumentation, the follow up of results within 10 days and subsequent \naction/referrals are made where appropriate.

It should be stressed that these are the minimum and if \nservice users require additional consultations they should be encouraged to make the \nappointments. (See Appendix A for detail) \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 17 of 33 \n\n14.1 Leaflets, information and discussion \nLeaflets can be accessed via the badgernotes app or service users can be advised to \naccess them via the trust Website where they can be downloaded. Service users \nwho do not have access to the internet should be given paper copies of the leaflets. \nThis should be documented on BadgerNet \n14.2 Leaflets (or information about accessing leaflets) should be given routinely at \nthe times identified (see Appendix A) and documented in the maternal notes. \n14.2.1 The following leaflets (or information about accessing leaflets) should \nbe given as follows (where clinically indicated) alongside a verbal \ndiscussion. This should be documented in the maternal notes: Vaginal \nBirth After Caesarean (VBAC) Leaflet – to be given post-natally to \nservice users who have has a first LSCS when discharged home. To be \ngiven to all service users who have had a previous LSCS when booking \nfor subsequent pregnancies at booking. \n14.2.2 Aspirin In Pregnancy leaflet \n14.2.3 Fetal Movements leaflet / Information \n14.2.4 Homebirth leaflet \n14.2.5 Caesarean Section leaflet – to be given to service users at time of \nbooking a planned LSCS \n14.2.6 External Cephalic Version (ECV) leaflet – to be given to service users \nwhen a breech presentation is discovered any time after 34 weeks of \npregnancy: With a discussion of options \n14.2.7 Declining Blood and Blood products leaflet – at the time this issue is \nidentified \n14.2.8 General Anaesthetic leaflet: \nAll service users having a planned LSCS when this is \ndecided and booked \nAll service users with known Placenta Praevia as soon as identified \nAll service users with known factors that will make them at \nhigh risk of requiring a general anaesthetic \n14.2.9 Care of the Perineum leaflet (perineal repair)– given to all service \nusers who suffer a 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n degree tear during the initial postnatal \nperiod prior to discharge home \n \n14.3 Responsibility of staff groups about information giving and leaflets: \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 18 of 33 \n\n14.3.1 Midwife providing care should ensure that all leaflets and information \nthat is required has been given (or directed to via the website) at the \nappropriate time and format. If this has not occurred the midwife is \nresponsible for providing the information when possible. Any leaflets \n/ information given should be documented by the midwife in the \nBadgerNet notes. \n14.3.2 Other health professionals such as obstetricians, phlebotomists and \nphysiotherapists are responsible for giving leaflets relevant to the \nspecific care they are providing at the time. Any leaflets / information \ngiven should be documented by the health professional in the \nBadgerNet notes. \n \n14.4 Process for providing information to service users who have \ncommunication or language support needs: \n \n14.4.1 Leaflets in other languages are available viaTrust website ”. \n14.4.2 Leaflet can also be explained using an interpreter at an appointment. \n14.4.3 Service users with other communication difficulties: midwives should \nmake an individual assessment of their requirements and \nprovideinformation in a format that is acceptable for the pregnant \nperson. A Team leader can provide support and advice for midwives \nand service users about information giving and care planning. \n14.4.4 Health professionals should document fully all discussions and \ninformation given, including any leaflets, in the BadgerNet notes. \n\n15 Named Midwife, choice of care and continuity of care: \n15.1 It is the midwife’s responsibility, at initial contact, to inform the pregnant \nperson of the name of the midwife who will have overall responsibility for her \ncommunity based care. The name of the midwife and the community team \nshould be documented on BadgerNet at this first contact. The service users \nwill be able to view this on the badgernotes app. \n15.2 Midwives in GP surgeries can only see service users registered to that practice. \n15.3 If a pregnant person requests to be transferred to another named midwife she \ncan contact the community manager via the community midwives office (each \nsite) for discussion. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 19 of 33 \n\n15.4 Continuity of care is what we ideally want to provide at UHSUSSEX NHS Trust. \nIn order to achieve this each community midwife is attached to a GP surgery \nand will be the named midwife there. This midwife will, with the exception of \nannual leave, sickness or mandatory training, provide regular antenatal care \nfor the service users linked to that GP surgery. Cover will be provided by \nanother community midwife in the same team when required. Where service \nusers request more flexibility with antenatal appointments in the community, \ncontinuity of the named midwife will be affected, and service users may be \nseen by a number of different midwives in that community team. \n \n16 Notes: \nThe schedule is a guide for the minimum standard of care in an uncomplicated \npregnancy. The recommended number of appointments is between 6 and 11 and \nmultiparous service users are likely to need less than primiparous service users. A \nfunction for each appointment should be identified. \n\n17 Symphysis Fundal Height (SFH) measurement: \nFrom 24 weeks gestation the Symphysis Fundal Height (SFH) measurement (See \nAppendix E) should be used to assess fetal growth. The SFH measurement should be \nentered into BadgerNet during documentation of the antenatal assessment. The \nmeasurement will be automatically plotted on the intergrowth chart which is \navailable to view on BadgerNet. \n17.1 Service users with a single SFH which plots BELOW the 10th centile or serial \nmeasurements which demonstrate slow or static growth by crossing lower \ncentiles (a distance of approx. 3cms) should be referred ultrasound (USS) \nmeasurement of fetal growth via the PANDA Portal (RCOG, 2013). \n17.2 Service users with a SFH measurement of ≥ 3cm MORE than gestation in \nweeks should NOT be referred for an USS providing there are no other risk \nfactors (NICE, 2008). The midwife is to check for glycosuria: If positive refer for \nGTT. If negative continue with normal A/N care pathway. \n17.3 Service users in whom measurement of SFH is inaccurate (for example: BMI \n> 35, large fibroids, hydramnios) should be referred for serial assessment of \nfetal size using ultrasound (RCOG, 2013). \n17.4 If polyhydramnios is suspected from clinical review and abdominal palpation \nservice users should be referred in to DAU for an urgent obstetric review and \nultrasound scan (ideally the scan should be performed within 48hours of \nreferral being received). \n17.5 Routine listening in or auscultation is unlikely to have any predictive value and \nis not recommended. However, it is acknowledged that many service users \nwill \nrequest FH auscultation and this should be discussed and service users’s \ninformed choice supported and documented. \n \n18 Referral of service users for additional care \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 20 of 33 \n\n18.1 Service users should have the opportunity to discuss any screening tests and \ntheir consent must be documented. All service users should be offered a \ndating scan before 13 weeks. See Maternity Protocol: MP002 Antenatal \nscreening: Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme \n \n18.2 If service users have identified neonatal risk factors e.g. family history or \ninherited metabolic disorders such as MCADD, a referral to a Neonatal \nConsultant should be generated by the midwife providing care for care \nplanning and discussion regarding the implications of this risk factor (in line \nwith NPSA - rapid response alert NPSA/2011/RRR002). \n18.3 Service users who have had previous gastric band surgery should be referred in \nto see a Consultant Obstetrician in Antenatal Clinic to discuss the implications \nand plan pregnancy and delivery care. \n18.4 Service users who have IVF pregnancies should be offered a referral to be \nseen at a Consultant led antenatal clinic by 16 weeks gestation. The referral \nshould be made by the midwife with the pregnant person’s consent. \n18.5 All service users to be weighed again, using calibrated scales, at 34-36/40 \ngestation to enable correct weight for drug calculation around the time of \nbirth should it be thought necessary. This should be documented in the \nmaternity notes. \n18.6 CO monitoring should be offered at booking and at 36/40 for non smokers and \nat every appointment for smokers (appendix G). \n18.7 Mental health issues should be discussed using the recognised guidelines. See \nMaternity Protocol: MP014 Service users with Mental Health problems. \n \n18.8 Domestic violence should be sensitively discussed with all service users \nduring an unaccompanied visit. See Domestic Abuse UHSUSSEX Trust policy. \n \n18.9 From 42 weeks, service users who decline IOL should be offered increased \nantenatal monitoring consisting of at least twice weekly CTGs and ultrasound \nexamination of maximum amniotic pool depth. See Maternity Protocol: MP033 \nInduction of Labour. \n \n18.10 All service users who have an uncomplicated singleton breech pregnancy at \n36 weeks in primigravida and 37 weeks in a multiparous should be offered \nECV. See Maternity Protocol: MP046 Breech & ECV. \n \n18.11 If service users with risk factors make informed choice to plan labour and \nbirth at home the community midwife should inform the Maternity Care \nChoices Midwife maternity.care.choices@UHSussex.nhs.net who will make \ncontact with the service users and offer a meeting/discussion to plan care. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 21 of 33 \n\n19 Process of referral of service users in whom risks are identified \nduring the clinical risk assessment: \n19.1 A referral should be made for an obstetric review if risk factors (Appendix D) \nare identified at booking or at any point during pregnancy. The reason for the \nreferral and the appointment time/date should be documented clearly in the \nmaternal notes. \n19.2 This can be done via the BadgerNet Antenatal Clinic Lead Midwife referral \non completion of the booking assessment. If referral is urgent telephone ANC \ndirectly and ask to speak to the AN lead midwife to prioritise \nappointment. \n19.3 The Antenatal Clinic lead midwife referral should be reviewed by the A/N \nlead midwife who will arrange for an appropriate appointment to be made \nfor the service users in an obstetric clinic. A letter will be sent with the ANC \nappointment details to the pregnant person at her home address in the \npost. \n19.4 During antenatal period (after booking) \nThis can be done by the midwife or GP telephoning the Antenatal clinic to \nmake an appointment at the next available appropriate consultant led clinic. \nThe reason for the referral and the appointment time/date should be \ndocumented clearly on BadgerNet. \n\n20 Reasons for Referral: \n \n20.1 If a risk factor is detected during completion of the risk assessment or at any \nreview of that assessment, a referral should be offered if appropriate; the risk \nfactor should also be discussed in relation to her antenatal care, intrapartum \ncare planning (including place of birth) and potentially postnatal care planning \nto produce an individualised care plan. \n20.2 All referrals, risk assessment and individualised management plans should be \nclearly documented on BadgerNet by the health professional making the \nplan with the pregnant person. \n20.3 Please ensure these service users are booked prior to their hospital \nappointment. Some of the reasons for referral are listed in the Appendix D. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care (RSCH PRH only) \nMP001 \nUniversity Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Page 22 of 33 \n\n21 Process for referral back to Midwifery Led Care: \n21.1 Service users who are reviewed by the obstetric team and then deemed to \nbe low risk should be referred back to MLC. \n21.2 The obstetric review should be documented on BadgerNet with an \nindividualised plan of care in to include written instructions that the \npregnant person should receive midwifery led care. \n21.3 Service users should be asked to make an appointment with her \ncommunity midwife within a specified period of time and documented in \nthe maternal notes. \n\n22 References: \n \nNursing and midwifery council (2004) Midwives rules and standards.

EDD should be calculated by USS performed at UHSUSSEX (CRL is the gold standard \n[up to 14+1 weeks]) rather than LMP\n1,6\n. This is for all pregnancies including IVF / ICSI \npregnancies. \n \n2. However where service users conceived by IVF/ICSI and there is a discrepancy \nbetween the scan date and IVF date, the pregnant person should be referred to a \nconsultant obstetrician for a final decision about EDD. The agreed EDD should be \nclearly documented in the pregnant person’s notes by the consultant. \n \n3. Service users who decline all scans should have the EDD calculated by LMP. In these \ncases the potential problems of using an EDD calculated by LMP should be discussed. \nUsing an EDD calculated by LMP increases the likelihood of induction for post \nmaturity. In addition it creates difficulties when advising on management / prognosis \nwhere labour occurs prematurely, especially around the limits of viability \n \n4. The optimal time for calculating EDD by scan is between 10+0 and 14+1 weeks. EDD \ncalculated by scan between these gestational limits supersedes EDD calculated from \nLMP and scans before 10+0 weeks. In practice the dating scan is usually performed \nbetween 11+2 and 14+1 weeks [i.e. at the time of the NT scan] \n \n5. If a pregnant person has two scans between 10 and 14 weeks, the scan at the time \nof the NT should be used \n \n6. If a pregnant person has a scan before 10+0 weeks, an EDD is given but this is \nrecalculated at the NT/dating scan [11+2 to 14+1 weeks] \n \n7. If a pregnant person declines combined screening, a dating scan is offered ideally at \n12 weeks, although a scan at any gestation between 10+0 and 14+1 will provide an \naccurate EDD \n \n8. Service users booking later than 14 weeks or who are found to be over 14 weeks \nat the time of the first scan will have their EDD calculated by head circumference \n[HC] at their first scan \n \n9. NB In expected peri-viable deliveries EDD should be agreed between obstetric, \nmidwifery and neonatal teams. This discussion and plan should be clearly \ndocumented in the maternity notes and signed by the lead professionals present for \nthe discussion \n\nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 29 of 33 \n\nUse EDD from NT scan \nOffer \nscan \nYES Offer accepted? \nNO \nUse EDD generated by \nearliest scan \n(Using head \ncircumference) \nUse EDD from USS between 10 & 14 \nweeks \nIf a pregnant person has had 2 scans \nin this time frame then use the EDD \ngenerated at the NT scan \nUse EDD \nby LMP \nGestation >14 weeks \nGestation between 10–14 weeks \nNB If delivery is likely around 22-25 weeks \n• Discussion may be indicated between maternity / neonatal services and family \nregarding action plan and agreed EDD \n• This discussion must be clearly documented in the records and signed by the \nlead professional \nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care \n\nAppendix C - Calculating the EDD flow chart \n\nUSS performed between 10 & 14 weeks? \nYES \n \nNO \n\nHas had scan in pregnancy? \nNO \n \nYES \n \nNT scan performed? \n\nYES \n \nNO \n\nMP001 \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care MP001 \nBrighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 30 of 33 \n\nReferences \n• Loughna P, Chitty L, Evans T, Chudleigh T (2009) Fetal Size and Dating: charts \nrecommended for clinical obstetric practice.

This measurement is taken along the longitudinal axis of the \nuterus without any correction of the tape measure to the midline of the abdomen, using a \nnon-stretch tape measure which remains in continuous contact with the skin surface of the \nabdomen. \n \nProcess for SFH measurement: \n \n1. Ensure pregnant person has an empty bladder \n2. Ensure that the pregnant person has given her consent, is comfortable and lying \nin a semi- recumbent position \n3. Prior to SFH measurement, the midwife should palpate the pregnant person’s pregnant \nabdomen to check the baby’s size, its position and presentation, the volume of amniotic \nfluid around the fetus, and to identify the uterine fundus \n4. The (metric) measurement scale on the tape measure should always be placed face \ndownwards against the pregnant person’s abdomen to prevent the practitioner from \nmaking a subjective or biased assessment. \n\nProvision and Schedules of Antenatal Care MP001 \n\nAppendix F – Criteria for Booking Growth Scans \n \nGeneral growth scans at 30 and 34 weeks.

A: After reviewing the clinical note against the MP001 Antenatal Care guideline, here are the recommendations for improvement:

### Very Important Recommendations
1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient received preconception counseling regarding her high-risk status and if a detailed care plan was established at booking.
   *Reason: MP001 Section 9.1 requires comprehensive risk assessment and individualized care plans at booking for high-risk patients.*

2. **Different management plan** - Consider urgent referral to a fetal medicine specialist given the history of cervical insufficiency and current cervical changes.
   *Reason: MP001 Appendix D lists recurrent second-trimester losses as an indication for specialist referral.*

3. **Additional information needed** - Document whether domestic violence screening was performed during an unaccompanied visit.
   *Reason: MP001 Section 18.8 mandates domestic violence screening for all patients.*

### Somewhat Important Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information about preterm birth risks and neonatal outcomes at 22-24 weeks gestation.
   *Reason: MP001 Section 14 emphasizes comprehensive information sharing about pregnancy risks.*

2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether mental health screening was performed given the patient's anxiety and pregnancy loss history.
   *Reason: MP001 Section 7 includes psychiatric history in risk assessment.*

3. **Different management plan** - Consider weekly cervical length monitoring from 16 weeks given the history, rather than waiting until significant shortening occurred.
   *Reason: MP001 recommends individualized surveillance for high-risk patients.*

### Less Important Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide information about pelvic rest and activity modification earlier in pregnancy.
   *Reason: MP001 emphasizes preventive counseling for high-risk patients.*

2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the patient was weighed at admission to calculate accurate medication doses.
   *Reason: MP001 Section 18.5 recommends weight documentation at key timepoints.*

### Unimportant Recommendations
1. **Improved patient advice** - Consider providing information about online support groups for pregnancy after loss.
   *Reason: While not specifically mentioned in MP001, this could enhance patient support.*

The clinical note demonstrates good adherence to many aspects of the guideline, particularly in monitoring and acute management. The most critical gaps relate to documentation of comprehensive risk assessment components and consideration of earlier specialist involvement given the patient's high-risk status. The management plan is generally appropriate but could be strengthened with more proactive elements given the patient's history.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these recommendations or suggest specific wording for documentation improvements?
