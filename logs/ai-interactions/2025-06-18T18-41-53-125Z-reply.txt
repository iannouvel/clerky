Random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion. - **GDM diagnosis without GTT**: Fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or any glucose >11.0mmol/L requires urgent referral. - **Management**: For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Insulin adjustment is needed for those on corticosteroids or during hyperemesis. - **Labor & delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Post-delivery, adjust insulin and monitor glucose closely. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Monitoring**: Ultrasound and fetal heart exam at 20 weeks; self-monitor glucose levels. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidance; prioritize GDM patients. - **Diabetic emergencies**: Require immediate medical attention. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure guideline adherence and optimal care",
