Ready-made formula is preferred in hospitals. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and recognizing feeding cues are emphasized. Safe sleeping practices (e.g., cot by bed) are discussed. - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive mandatory training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative standards. - **Monitoring & Support:** Newborns are weighed at birth, day 5, and day 10. Complex feeding issues (e.g., tongue-tie) warrant referrals. Expressed breastmilk is encouraged for separated mothers. - **Supplementation:** Only for medical indications; small volumes via cup/tube to protect breastfeeding. Mothers supplementing are supported to maintain milk supply. (Word count: 200)\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
