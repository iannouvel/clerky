 obvious results from placentalistology
 admitted due to the control blood pressure and raised alt which has been a case for a few weeks
 which meets the thresholder diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in his history Kaylee has also had
 gallstones and it&#x27;s been considered for a cystectomy however given that her symptoms resolved subsequent to her last pregnancy entirely and she&#x27;s currently asymptomatic
 it may not be that the gallstones are provoking this race
 she&#x27;s also got hypothyroidism and thyroxine
 just got to raise BMI and a new diagnosed preeclampsia
 and material age of 36 so qualifies for
 antenna go from a prophylaxis from 28 weeks
 it&#x27;s good diagnosis of gestational diabetes
tight controlled
 she just had a
 fetal cardiac ultrasound at the evalina due to difficulty at the anomaly scan obtaining adequate views they were also defining a difficult at the evilina and so they&#x27;re unable to exclude small ventricular settle defects partial hue of intriculation to defects or minor valve or arterial abnormalities and as such I have suggested that maybe safer local delivery although they&#x27;ve specified Brighton where there is a
 new native care unit this may have been due to confusion the Evelina as to where she was due to deliver and they&#x27;ve advised cardiovascular examination including thermal checks for Limp and pre-imposed doctors saturations
 and a cardiology and Echo review within the first week either locally or the Evelina
 last sound was at 32 weeks and five days showing
 a normal heter abdominal circumference and a femala length on the 10th Centre and feet away on a 35th with normal fluid and the baby&#x27;s Catholic
blood pressure readings today have been quite raised with the systolic up to 175 the diastolic around 100 she&#x27;s asymptomatic of
 great clips
the remaining clinical issues are that she needs to have for blood pressure maintain in the normal range aiming for less than 1490
 that she&#x27;s waiting every girl scan and clinic appointment
 Monday
 at the time of birth she were to have preeclampsia would be from 37 weeks she&#x27;s also got diabetes 37 plus 0 seems to reasonable and she&#x27;s keen to get this done sooner rather than later
 so we&#x27;ve asked for her to be booked for that day
 and I&#x27;ll clarify with my pediatric colleagues to whether or not she suitable for delivery of the Princess Royal Hospital
 and we suggested that she would begin on a postpartum mirin coil insertion which some of our doctors and consultants can do post nicely and they&#x27;ve talked for about the wrists and benefits including expulsion and long threads should that be feasible that&#x27;d be great otherwise follow up either with your Primary Care physician or sexual health clinic
 I&#x27;ll prescribe for an expert here while admitted and to continue until the either has reduction of labor or goes into spontaneously
her last third function test I can see was on the fourth February where her DSH was 11.2 and her son was 9.5
 I can&#x27;t see that we upwardly titrated her thyroxine but she we should do this
 it was may have been lost
 amongst the confusion regarding other things
