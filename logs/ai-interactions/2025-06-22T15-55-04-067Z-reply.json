  "response": "Since the guideline content (CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth) is not provided, I cannot make specific recommendations based on it. However, I can provide general recommendations based on standard obstetric guidelines for twin pregnancies with obstetric cholestasis.  \n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods (if available) and ensure fetal growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers are performed within the last 2 weeks.  \n   Reason: Baseline bile acids are crucial for comparison, and serial growth scans are essential in twin pregnancies to monitor for discordance or growth restriction (standard twin pregnancy and obstetric cholestasis guidelines).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure a clear escalation plan if bile acids rise above 100 µmol/L, including consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.  \n   Reason: Severe cholestasis (bile acids ≥100 µmol/L) significantly increases stillbirth risk, particularly in twins, warranting earlier delivery and multidisciplinary input (standard obstetric cholestasis guidelines).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed counseling on the risks of preterm birth, neonatal unit admission, and potential complications of early delivery (e.g., respiratory distress syndrome).  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies already carry higher risks of preterm birth, and early delivery for cholestasis further increases neonatal risks (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Consider screening for gestational diabetes (if not already done), as twin pregnancies and cholestasis may increase insulin resistance.  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies have a higher incidence of gestational diabetes, which can further complicate fetal growth and neonatal outcomes (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Offer psychological support resources, as twin pregnancies with complications can increase maternal anxiety.  \n   Reason: Mental health support improves coping and adherence to monitoring plans (general obstetric care principles).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document a clear contingency plan for delivery (e.g., mode of delivery if one twin is non-cephalic).  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies require detailed delivery planning, especially if early induction is needed (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest moisturizers or oatmeal baths for pruritus relief in addition to antihistamines.  \n   Reason: Non-pharmacological measures may improve comfort but are not critical to management (general obstetric cholestasis symptom management).  \n\nWithout the specific guideline (CG1126), these recommendations are based on general best practices.
