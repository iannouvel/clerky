She also reports a 3-month history of worsening fatigue and occasional dizziness.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Menstrual bleeding: Previously regular cycles (28–30 days), now prolonged (10–14 days) with flooding and clots.  \n- Pain: Dull, central pelvic pain, worse during menstruation, occasionally radiating to the lower back.  \n- Fatigue: Persistent despite adequate sleep, impacting work performance.  \n- No post-coital bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding.  \n- No urinary or bowel symptoms.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 4 years ago, on metformin)  \n- Hypertension (on lisinopril)  \n- Iron deficiency anaemia (treated intermittently with oral iron)  \n- Previous gestational diabetes (last pregnancy)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Caesarean section x2 (last in 2018)  \n- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (2015, benign cyst)  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche: Age 12  \n- LMP: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting)  \n- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception due to previous side effects)  \n- Last cervical smear: 2 years ago (normal)  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 1g BD  \n- Lisinopril 10mg OD  \n- Ferrous sulfate PRN (non-compliant due to GI upset)  \n\n**Allergies:**  \n- Penicillin (rash)  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history)  \n- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  \n- No recreational drug use  \n- Lives with partner and 3 children  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried that bleeding may be due to \"fibroids or something worse.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery, given her weight and diabetes.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants to explore medical and non-surgical options first.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Pale conjunctiva, obese (BMI 41), no signs of hyperandrogenism.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no active bleeding.  \n- Bimanual exam: Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Investigations Ordered:**  \n1. Full blood count (suspected anaemia)  \n2. Transvaginal ultrasound (assess endometrial thickness, fibroids, polyps)  \n3.
