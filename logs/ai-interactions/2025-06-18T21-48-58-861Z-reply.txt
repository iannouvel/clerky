Regularly check the resuscitaire (heater, oxygen, suction, masks, etc.). - **Drug Dosing**: Weight-based dosing for adrenaline (0.2 ml/kg IV/IO), bicarbonate (2–4 ml/kg of 4.2%), glucose 10% (2.5 ml/kg), and 0.9% sodium chloride (10 ml/kg). ETT sizes/lengths specified by weight/gestation. - **Preterm Infants (<26 weeks)**: Individualized decision-making with parental involvement; options include resuscitation, comfort care, or survival-focused care based on gestational age and viability. - **Flowchart**: Follow Resuscitation Council UK’s Newborn Life Support (NLS 2021) algorithm. - **Documentation**: Includes equipment checklists, gestational age outcomes (22–26 weeks), and perinatal network guidelines for extreme prematurity. *Key Focus*: Preparedness, standardized drug dosing, and tailored management for preterm neonates",
