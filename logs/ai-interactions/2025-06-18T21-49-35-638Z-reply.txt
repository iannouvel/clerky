Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. - **Alternative feeding methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) or cup feeding for supplementation; avoid teats to prevent nipple confusion. - **Formula feeding guidance:** Responsive feeding practices, safe preparation, and medical supplementation only when indicated. - **Parent-infant bonding:** Rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and parental involvement in care are prioritized. - **Monitoring & support:** Regular weight checks (birth, day 5, day 10), feeding assessments, and referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff responsibilities:** Mandatory breastfeeding training, adherence to Baby Friendly Initiative standards, and annual audits. - **Safety:** Safe sleeping practices (cot by bed) and risk mitigation during skin-to-skin contact. - **Mothers separated from newborns:** Early milk expression advised; neonatal units support breastmilk provision. - **Supplementation:** Limited, medically justified, with measures to protect breastfeeding (small volumes, cup/tube feeding). *Compliance monitored via UNICEF BFI audits, with outcomes reported to relevant committees.*",
