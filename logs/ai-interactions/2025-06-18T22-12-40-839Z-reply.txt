Eligible infants are tracked via NHS numbers or GP registration, with daily checks required for transfers, discharges, and screenings. **Key Failsafe Procedures:** - **NIPE Referral Export:** Run preset S4N searches twice weekly for referrals and update the follow-up spreadsheet. - **Red (Breached) Baby Spreadsheet:** Track NICU babies to ensure timely screening. - **S4H NICU Failsafe:** Investigate missed screens for well/community and NICU babies. - **NHSP Systmone Report:** Verify all babies have screening results; follow up if missing. **Documentation & Follow-Up:** - Record neonatal/child deaths and NICU transfers in databases. - Merge duplicate records and ensure all births are fully documented. - Verify screenings at day 1, 5, and 10 visits; follow up on incomplete tests. - Copy discharge emails to screening administrators and document home births. - Forward repeat bloodspot notifications to Community Team Leads. **Consent:** Parents are offered three screenings (NIPE, NBS, NHSP) with confidential data handling. Consent or declination must be documented. **QA & Contacts:** Perform QA checks and use provided contact details for discrepancies. Updates to guidelines are noted",
