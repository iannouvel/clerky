A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Identifier:** Ms. Jane Doe  
**Age:** 54 years  
**Weight:** 98 kg  
**BMI:** 36.4  
**Prior Pregnancies:** 4 (G4P4)  
**Date of Encounter:** [Fictional Date]  
**Clinician:** Dr. Smith  

### **History of Presenting Complaint**  
Ms. Doe presents for follow-up regarding her preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which was diagnosed 12 years ago. She reports recent episodes of postprandial hyperglycemia (self-monitored readings between 180–220 mg/dL) despite adherence to her current regimen. She denies symptoms of hypoglycemia but describes occasional fatigue and blurred vision. No recent infections or hospitalizations.  

*[Incomplete: Duration of current symptoms? Any changes in diet/exercise? Any new stressors?]*  

### **Past Medical History**  
- **Preexisting T2DM** (12 years) – last HbA1c 8.2% (3 months ago)  
- **Hypertension** (10 years) – on lisinopril  
- **Hyperlipidemia** – on atorvastatin  
- **Gestational diabetes** during all four pregnancies (last pregnancy 20 years ago)  
- **Obesity** (BMI 36.4)  

*[Incomplete: Any prior diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy)? Any prior DKA/HHS?]*  

### **Surgical History**  
- **Cesarean section x2** (for macrosomia in prior pregnancies)  
- **Cholecystectomy** (8 years ago)  

*[Incomplete: Any other surgeries?]*  

### **Gynecological History**  
- Menopause at age 51  
- No abnormal Pap smears  
- No history of PCOS  

### **Drug History**  
- Metformin 1000 mg BID  
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg nightly  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily (primary prevention)  

*[Incomplete: Any OTC/supplements? Adherence concerns?]*  

### **Allergy History**  
- NKDA  

### **Social History**  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator (sedentary)  
- **Alcohol:** Occasional glass of wine (1–2/week)  
- **Tobacco:** Never  
- **Diet:** Carbohydrate-heavy, admits difficulty with portion control  
- **Exercise:** Minimal (walks 1–2x/week)  

*[Incomplete: Any family support? Stressors? Sleep habits?]*  

### **Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations**  
- **Ideas:** Believes her diabetes is "getting worse" due to aging.  
- **Concerns:** Worried about needing insulin.  
- **Expectations:** Hopes to avoid injections and "get back on track" with oral meds.  

### **Examination Findings**  
- **Vitals:** BP 138/86, HR 78, RR 16, SpO2 98% RA  
- **General:** Obese, no acute distress  
- **CV:** Regular rate, no murmurs  
- **Resp:** Clear to auscultation  
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, obese habitus  
- **Extremities:** No edema, intact peripheral pulses  
- **Neurological:** Intact sensation to monofilament (limited assessment)  

*[Incomplete: Fundoscopy findings? Foot exam for ulcers? Full neuropathy screen?]*  

### **Assessment & Management Plan**  
1. **Glycemic Control:**  
   - Current regimen insufficient. Consider:  
     - **SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., empagliflozin)** – benefits for weight/CV risk but caution if eGFR <45.  
     - **GLP-1 RA (e.g., semaglutide)** – weight loss benefits, but assess cost/tolerance.  
     - **Basal insulin (if oral agents fail)** – address patient’s concerns with education.  
   - **Labs:** Repeat HbA1c, renal function, fasting lipid panel.  

2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**  
   - Referral to diabetes educator + dietitian for carb counting.  
   - Encourage structured exercise (150 min/week).  

3. **Monitoring:**  
   - Continue home glucose logs (fasting + 2-hr postprandial).  
   - Annual diabetic eye/foot exams pending.  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Re-evaluate in 4 weeks for medication adjustment.  

*[Incomplete: Further counseling on weight loss options? Screen for depression?]*  

**Impression:** Poorly controlled T2DM with likely need for intensification. Patient requires further education and shared decision-making regarding next steps.
