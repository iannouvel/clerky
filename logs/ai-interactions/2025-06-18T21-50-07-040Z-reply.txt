      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks. Vacuum does not increase cesarean rates or neonatal complications like low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, or large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, provide bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document thoroughly and plan postnatal follow-up. - **Psychological support**: Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births but avoid single-session, high-intensity trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive care for families and staff after adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports when required, and follow RCOG auditable standards",
