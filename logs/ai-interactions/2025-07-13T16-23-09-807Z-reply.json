Now referred by GP for gynae review due to persistent symptoms.  \n\n**BACKGROUND:**  \n- **PMHx:**  \n  - Previous LSCS (2020) – complicated by post-op wound infection (treated with co-amoxiclav).  \n  - Recurrent PID (2 episodes, last 2021) – managed with IV ceftriaxone + doxycycline.  \n  - No known endometriosis.  \n- **Drugs:** PRN cocodamol for pain, no regular medications.  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA  \n- **SHx:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol. Works as a teacher.  \n- **FHx:** No relevant gynae malignancies.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **Examination:**  \n  - **Abdomen:** Soft, non-distended. Mild suprapubic tenderness, no guarding/rigidity.  \n  - **PV:** Cervix appears normal, no discharge. Uterus anteverted, mildly tender on mobilisation. Left adnexal tenderness, no palpable mass.  \n- **Observations:**  \n  - BP 118/76, HR 72, afebrile (36.8°C).  \n- **Investigations:**  \n  - **Recent GP workup:** FBC (Hb 128, WCC 6.2), CRP 4, negative chlamydia/gonorrhoea NAAT.  \n  - **TV USS (today):** Normal endometrial thickness, no hydrosalpinx. Subtle left adnexal tethering noted.  \n- **Differential diagnoses:**  \n  1. **Pelvic adhesions** (post-surgical/PID-related – most likely).  \n  2. **Endometriosis** (though no cyclical pain/dysmenorrhoea).  \n  3. **Chronic PID** (low likelihood given normal inflammatory markers).  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \n1. **Diagnostic laparoscopy + adhesiolysis** (consider as second-line investigation after failed conservative management). Counsel re risks (bowel/bladder injury, recurrence).  \n2. **Pre-op:**  \n   - FBC, U&E, G&S.  \n   - Omit CA-125 testing as it has low diagnostic utility for endometriosis in this context.  \n3. **Post-op:**  \n   - Consider Mirena/IUS if endometriosis found (for symptom control).  \n   - Fertility referral if adhesiolysis confirms tubal patency but conception delayed.  \n4. **Follow-up:** Gynae clinic 2/52 post-op to discuss findings and plan.  \n5. **Additional measures:**  \n   - Recommend initiating a daily pain diary to identify provoking factors or associations.  \n   - Document baseline functional assessment to monitor treatment progress.  \n   - Include assessment of psychological factors and social impact of chronic pain.  \n\n**CLINICIAN:** Dr. A. Smith (ST5 Obs & Gynae)  \n**DATE:** 15/05/2024  \n\n*(For educational purposes only – fictional case)*  \n\n---  \n**Notes:**  \n- Abbreviations: LSCS (lower segment Caesarean section), PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), TTC (trying to conceive), TV USS (transvaginal ultrasound), NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test), IUS (intrauterine system).  \n- Realistic workflow: GP referral → gynae OPD → TV USS → decision for laparoscopy.  \n- Adhesions often post-surgical/PID-related; laparoscopy is diagnostic/therapeutic.\n\nApply these changes:\nACCEPT: Replace \"Omit CA-125 testing as it has low diagnostic utility for endometriosis in this context.\" with \"Omit CA-125 testing as it has low diagnostic utility for endometriosis in this context (consistent with ESHRE guideline recommendations against biomarker testing).\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline states: 'Biomarkers are not reliable for diagnosing endometriosis.' This patient's presentation (chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, subfertility) with likely adhesions from previous LSCS/PID makes endometriosis less probable, and CA-125 would not change management. The recommendation to omit CA-125 is appropriate given established diagnostic limitations.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Consider Mirena/IUS if endometriosis found (for symptom control).\" with \"Consider levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) if endometriosis found, as first-line hormonal therapy for symptom control (per ESHRE guidelines).\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline recommends: 'The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system...is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain.' This is particularly appropriate given the patient's chronic pain symptoms and desire for future fertility (LNG-IUS is reversible). The suggestion aligns with evidence-based first-line hormonal therapy options.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: discussion of empirical hormonal therapy trial prior to surgery\" with \"Consider trial of combined hormonal contraceptive or progestogen therapy for 3-6 months as first-line medical management before proceeding to laparoscopy.\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline states: 'In symptomatic women, attempts should be made to relieve symptoms, either by empirical treatment or after a diagnosis.' Given the uncertain endometriosis diagnosis and patient's pain symptoms, a trial of hormonal therapy (COCP or progestogens) would be appropriate before invasive procedures. This aligns with the stepped-care approach recommended by ESHRE.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Fertility referral if adhesiolysis confirms tubal patency but conception delayed.\" with \"Fertility referral with Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) assessment if adhesiolysis confirms tubal patency but conception delayed beyond 6 months post-op.\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline recommends: 'The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) can be used to predict non-ART pregnancy rates after surgery.' This patient has subfertility (TTC 18 months) and possible adhesions - EFI assessment would provide prognostic information to guide fertility management decisions post-surgery, making this a valuable addition to the plan.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Recommend initiating a daily pain diary to identify provoking factors or associations.\" with \"Recommend initiating a daily pain diary documenting: 1) pain severity (VAS), 2) cyclical patterns, 3) bowel/bladder symptoms, and 4) impact on daily activities.\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline emphasizes comprehensive pain assessment: 'Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain...should be considered for endometriosis diagnosis.' A structured pain diary would better characterize potential endometriosis-related symptoms (cyclical pain, dyschezia) versus adhesion-related pain (constant, position-dependent). This enhanced documentation would inform diagnostic certainty and treatment response.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: discussion of deep infiltrating endometriosis evaluation\" with \"If laparoscopy performed, systematically evaluate for deep infiltrating endometriosis (particularly uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum) given chronic pain and dyspareunia symptoms.\" (Reason: The ESHRE guideline states: 'Deep endometriosis may present with...deep dyspareunia.' This patient's worsening dyspareunia and chronic pain raise suspicion for possible deep disease despite negative imaging. A thorough laparoscopic evaluation is indicated given these symptoms, as it would significantly alter surgical planning and postoperative management if found.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",
