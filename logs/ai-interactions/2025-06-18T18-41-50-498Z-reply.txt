Random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion. - **Diagnosis without GTT**: Fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or any glucose >11.0mmol/L requires urgent referral. - **Management**: If fasting glucose <7mmol/L at diagnosis, trial diet/exercise changes first. - **Corticosteroid use**: Monitor glucose closely; may require hospitalization for insulin adjustment. - **Labor & delivery**: Continue insulin; consider VRIII if needed. Postpartum, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. - **Breastfeeding**: Frequent glucose monitoring advised. - **Diabetic emergencies**: Require immediate medical attention. - **Fetal monitoring**: 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam recommended. - **Vaccination**: Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidance; prioritize GDM patients. - **Audit**: Regular audits to ensure quality care",
