Reports soaking through super-absorbent pads every 2 hours, associated with fatigue and lightheadedness. No post-coital bleeding.  \n- **Pelvic pain:** Dull, intermittent, radiates to lower back. Worse during menses and after prolonged standing. No urinary/bowel symptoms.  \n- **Obstetric concern:** Interested in future pregnancy but worried about fertility due to age and symptoms.  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:**  \n- **Medical:** Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine), iron-deficiency anemia (non-compliant with supplements).  \n- **Surgical:** Appendectomy (age 20), no prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n- **Gynaecological:** Regular cycles until 6 months ago. No history of STIs. Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  \n\n### **Drug History:**  \n- Levothyroxine 50 mcg OD.  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular analgesia).  \n- No contraception (condoms used intermittently).  \n\n### **Allergies:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n### **Social History:**  \n- Works as a teacher; stress levels high due to workload.  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-years).  \n- Alcohol: 4–5 units/week.  \n- Lives with partner; moderate physical activity.  \n\n### **Ideas, Concerns, Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about fibroids or \"early menopause.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Fertility, impact of weight on symptoms, and cancer risk.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"a scan\" and hormonal treatment options.  \n\n---\n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Pale conjunctiva (possible anemia), BMI 34.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic (speculum/bimanual):**  \n  - Cervix: Nulliparous os, no lesions.  \n  - Uterus: 10–12 weeks size, irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids).  \n  - Adnexa: No masses, mild tenderness on uterine motion.  \n\n### **Investigations Ordered:**  \n1. **Bloods:** FBC (to assess anemia), TSH, ferritin.  \n2. **Imaging:** Pelvic ultrasound (to evaluate fibroids/endometrial thickness).  \n3. **Endometrial biopsy:** Given age and HMB to exclude hyperplasia.  \n\n---\n\n### **Management Plan:**  \n1. **Symptomatic relief:**  \n   - Tranexamic acid 1 g TDS during heavy days.  \n   - Consider progesterone-only pill (POP) or Mirena IUD for HMB (counselled on pros/cons).  \n2. **Anemia:** Iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate 200 mg BD) + dietary advice.  \n3. **Fertility counselling:** Referral to reproductive medicine given age and fibroids.  \n4. **Lifestyle:** Smoking cessation support, weight management referral.  \n5. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review ultrasound/biopsy results.  \n   - Discuss surgical options (e.g., hysteroscopic myomectomy) if fibroids confirmed.  \n\n**Patient reassured and consented to next steps.
