She describes associated fatigue but denies dizziness or syncope.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Bleeding pattern: Irregular cycles (21–45 days), with prolonged heavy bleeding (soaking 8–10 pads/day).  \n- No intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding.  \n- No dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain.  \n- No recent weight changes, hirsutism, or galactorrhoea.  \n- No symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed at 18.  \n- Gestational diabetes (last pregnancy).  \n- No history of thromboembolism or hypertension.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- No prior gynaecological surgeries.  \n- Caesarean section x1 (last delivery).  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche: 12 years.  \n- Previous pregnancies: 4 (3 vaginal deliveries, 1 Caesarean).  \n- Last menstrual period: 3 weeks ago (ongoing bleeding).  \n- Contraception: None currently; previously used combined oral contraceptive pill (discontinued due to weight gain).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 500 mg BD (for PCOS).  \n- No anticoagulants or hormonal therapies.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day.  \n- Alcohol: Occasional (1–2 units/week).  \n- No recreational drug use.  \n- Lives with partner and children; limited physical activity due to work demands.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- Concerned about cancer risk due to family history (aunt with endometrial cancer).  \n- Wants to regulate cycles and reduce bleeding.  \n- Hoping to avoid surgery.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Obese, no pallor or signs of hyperandrogenism.  \n- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- Speculum: Cervix appears normal; minimal bleeding noted.  \n- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size; no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Likely **complex endometrial hyperplasia (without atypia)** secondary to chronic anovulation (PCOS) and obesity.  \n- High BMI and persistent bleeding warrant further investigation to exclude malignancy.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness.  \n   - Endometrial biopsy (pipelle) for histology.  \n   - FBC (to exclude anaemia), HbA1c (diabetes monitoring), lipid profile.  \n\n2. **Medical Management:**  \n   - First-line: **Progestogen therapy** (e.g., oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10–20 mg/day for 14 days/cycle or LNG-IUS if biopsy confirms hyperplasia without atypia).  \n   - Weight loss support: Referral to dietetics and bariatric services.  \n\n3. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Repeat endometrial biopsy in 3–6 months if hyperplasia confirmed.  \n   - Discuss contraception (LNG-IUS preferred for endometrial protection).  \n\n4. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Counsel on cancer risk reduction via weight loss and smoking cessation.  \n   - Advise urgent review if bleeding worsens or new symptoms arise.  \n\n**Prognosis:**  \n- Good with compliance to progestogen therapy and weight management.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [REDACTED]  \n\n---  \n*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
