      "newValue": "**Summary of Antenatal Care Guidelines:** - **Antenatal care** spans from conception to birth, provided locally by midwives, with individualized care plans. - **Booking appointments** involve risk assessments, health promotion, and consent for screening (e.g., Chlamydia/Gonorrhea for those â‰¤24). Declined tests must be documented. - **Consultant review** is advised for pre-existing medical conditions. - **Screening and tests:** Offer blood/urine tests, document consent, and notify the Screening Team if declined. Discuss blood product consent. - **Documentation:** Maintain records of tests, risk assessments, and antenatal information (e.g., fetal development, screening programs). Involve partners if desired. - **Urinalysis** at each appointment; culture samples for high-risk preterm cases. Refer recurrent UTIs to obstetrics. - **Risk-based care:** Provide consultant-led care for high-risk pregnancies. Address safeguarding, mental health, domestic abuse, and FGM. - **Lifestyle advice:** Offer smoking cessation, alcohol guidance, and weight management (BMI <30). - **Symptom management:** Address nausea, heartburn, pelvic pain, and bleeding (refer to EPAC if <16 weeks; labor ward if >16 weeks). - **Equity:** Monitor high-risk groups (ethnic minorities, deprived areas, migrants) closely. Provide language support and unbiased information. - **Fetal monitoring:** Track growth, refer for scans if needed, and review prior pregnancy records. Ensure continuity of care and clear communication for complex cases. *References:* MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC guidelines",
