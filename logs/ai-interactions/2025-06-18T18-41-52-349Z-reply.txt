After 34 weeks, GTT is rarely useful unless new concerns arise (random glucose ≥7mmol/L warrants discussion). - **Diagnosis without GTT:** Urgent referral if glucose >11.0mmol/L (any time) or fasting ≥5.6mmol/L. - **Management:** For GDM with fasting glucose <7mmol/L, trial diet/exercise first. Insulin adjustment and close monitoring are needed for those on corticosteroids or with hyperemesis. - **Labor/delivery:** Continue insulin; consider VRIII. Postpartum, adjust insulin and monitor glucose. Breastfeeding requires frequent glucose checks. - **Monitoring:** 20-week ultrasound and fetal heart exam; self-monitor blood glucose. - **Emergencies:** Immediate medical attention for diabetic emergencies. - **Vaccination:** Offer COVID-19 vaccination per JCVI guidelines, prioritizing GDM patients. - **Audit:** Regular audits to ensure guideline adherence",
