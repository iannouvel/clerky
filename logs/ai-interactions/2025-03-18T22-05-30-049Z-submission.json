She has had two prior pregnancies, both resulting in cesarean sections. The patient reports a past medical history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a surgical history of appendectomy. She denies any drug allergies and is not currently taking any medications. The patient works as a nurse and is concerned about the impact of her symptoms on her daily activities. Clinician: Good morning, I understand you&#x27;ve been experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. Given your history of PCOS and prior cesarean sections, it&#x27;s important for us to address these symptoms. I will perform a pelvic examination to assess for any abnormalities. Examination Findings: On examination, there are no palpable masses or tenderness noted. The cervix appears normal, and there is no evidence of cervical motion tenderness. The uterus is enlarged, consistent with a possible diagnosis of fibroids. Management Advice: Based on your history and examination findings, I recommend further evaluation with an ultrasound to confirm the presence of fibroids. Treatment options may include medication to control bleeding, or in more severe cases, surgical intervention such as a myomectomy. It&#x27;s also important to address your PCOS to help regulate your menstrual cycles. I will refer you to a gynecologist for further management. Patient: Thank you for your guidance, I appreciate your help in addressing these issues. Clinician: You&#x27;re welcome. It&#x27;s important to address these concerns to improve your quality of life. Please follow up with the gynecologist for further evaluation and management. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, feel free to reach out. End of dictation.",
