Quitting improves outcomes. Key recommendations: - **Treatment:** Combine behavioral support and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). - **Messaging:** Advise complete cessation; cutting down still poses risks. - **Referrals:** Use an \"opt-out\" approach for current smokers, high CO levels, or recent quitters. - **CO Monitoring:** Offer at every antenatal visit; explain results and refer smokers to cessation services. - **Household Smoking:** Encourage partners/household members to quit. - **NRT & E-Cigarettes:** NRT is safe; e-cigarettes are a safer alternative (long-term effects unknown). - **Inpatient Care:** Provide NRT and cessation support during hospital stays. - **Staff Training:** Annual training on CO screening, smoking cessation, and local guidelines. **Key Actions:** Document smoking status, refer promptly, and ensure continuous monitoring for high-risk cases",
