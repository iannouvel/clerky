She also reports **fatigue** and **lightheadedness**, which she attributes to blood loss.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Bleeding is described as **prolonged (lasting 10–14 days per cycle)** and **heavy (soaking through pads every 2 hours)**.  \n- Pelvic pain is **dull and constant**, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  \n- No fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP) was **3 weeks ago**, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  \n- No recent trauma or foreign body insertion.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Iron-deficiency anemia** (diagnosed 2 years ago, on intermittent iron supplements).  \n- **Hypothyroidism** (on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily).  \n- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or clotting disorders.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Cesarean section x2** (last one 4 years ago).  \n- **Dilation & curettage (D&C)** for incomplete miscarriage (5 years ago).  \n- **Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy** (3 years ago).  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12, cycles previously regular (28–30 days).  \n- **Dysmenorrhea** since teenage years, worsening in recent months.  \n- **History of endometriosis** (diagnosed laparoscopically 3 years ago).  \n- **Previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** (treated with antibiotics 6 years ago).  \n- **Cervical smear history**: Last Pap smear **2 years ago** (normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  \n- Ferrous sulfate PRN (takes intermittently).  \n- No hormonal contraception (stopped combined pill 6 months ago due to migraines).  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- **Penicillin** (rash).  \n- No other known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- **Occupation**: School teacher (moderate stress levels).  \n- **Smoking**: Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago).  \n- **Alcohol**: Occasional (1–2 units/week).  \n- **Exercise**: Sedentary lifestyle due to fatigue.  \n- **Relationship status**: Married, sexually active with one partner.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas**: Worried that bleeding may be due to **fibroids or cancer**.  \n- **Concerns**: Anxious about impact on fertility (desires future pregnancy).  \n- **Expectations**: Wants **diagnosis, treatment to stop bleeding, and reassurance**.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General**: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia), no lymphadenopathy.  \n- **Abdominal**: Soft, non-distended, mild suprapubic tenderness. No palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum exam**: Cervix appears normal, no lesions. Active bleeding noted.  \n- **Bimanual exam**: Uterus **enlarged (12-week size), irregular contour** (suggestive of fibroids).  \n- **Adnexa**: Mild right-sided tenderness, no palpable masses.  \n- **No cervical motion tenderness** (unlikely acute PID).  \n\n**Investigations Ordered:**  \n1. **Full blood count (FBC)** – assess anemia.  \n2. **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)** – ensure optimal levothyroxine dosing.  \n3. **Pelvic ultrasound** – evaluate fibroids, endometrial thickness, ovarian pathology.  \n4. **Endometrial biopsy** (if ultrasound suggests hyperplasia).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Symptomatic relief**:  \n   - **Tranexamic acid** (1g TDS during heavy bleeding).  \n   - **NSAIDs** (e.g., mefenamic acid for pain/dysmenorrhea).  \n2. **Hormonal options**:  \n   - **Progestin-only pill** (to regulate cycles).  \n   - Consider **Mirena IUD** (if endometrial biopsy normal).  \n3. **Surgical options** (if fibroids confirmed):  \n   - **Myomectomy** (if future fertility desired).  \n   - **Hysteroscopic resection** (if submucosal fibroids).  \n4. **Follow-up**:  \n   - Review in **2 weeks** with investigation results.  \n   - Discuss **endometriosis management** if pain persists.  \n\n**Patient Counselling:**  \n- Reassured that **cancer is unlikely** but requires exclusion.  \n- Advised on **iron-rich diet** and **regular iron supplements**.  \n- Encouraged **gradual exercise** to improve fatigue.  \n- Provided **contraception counselling** (Mirena may reduce bleeding and protect fertility).  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await ultrasound and biopsy results.  \n- Consider **gynaecology referral** if medical management fails.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n---  \n*This is a fictional case for educational/testing purposes only.
