Alternatively, you can provide additional text that includes the date, and I can extract it for you. For now, I cannot return a 4-digit year since the information is missing in the given excerpt.

Key clinical actions include: - **Prevention:** Anticipate hypothermia in at-risk infants, maintain a warm environment, and encourage skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth. - **Initial Care:** Dry the baby, promote skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding to stabilize temperature and heart rate. - **Management of Hypothermia:** Use skin-to-skin contact, continuous monitoring, and a hot cot (pre-warmed, with gradual temperature reduction). - **Ongoing Care:** Discontinue monitoring once temperature stabilizes and focus on feeding. - **Staff Roles:** Midwives and healthcare assistants must recognize risk factors, monitor neonates, and take prompt action. - **Parent Communication:** Explain monitoring and management to parents. - **Audit:** Compliance and outcomes are tracked via the Maternity Audit Document. The guideline emphasizes proactive prevention, prompt intervention, and multidisciplinary adherence",
