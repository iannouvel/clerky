She has tried over-the-counter antifungal creams without relief. <br><br><strong>Relevant History:</strong> <br>- No prior pregnancies. <br>- No history of sexually transmitted infections. <br>- No chronic medical conditions. <br>- No known allergies. <br>- No prior vulvar biopsies or procedures. <br><br><em>Incomplete aspects:</em> <br>- Family history of autoimmune or dermatologic conditions not explored. <br>- Sexual history (e.g., recent partners, contraception) not fully assessed. <br>- Impact on daily activities or emotional well-being not discussed. <br><br>### <strong>Objective:</strong> <br><strong>Physical Examination:</strong> <br>- <strong>General:</strong> Well-appearing, no acute distress. <br>- <strong>Vulvar Inspection:</strong> Thin, pale, parchment-like skin with areas of whitish plaques noted on labia minora and perineum. Fissuring present near the posterior fourchette. No active bleeding or ulcerations. <br>- <strong>Speculum Exam:</strong> Vaginal mucosa appears normal; cervix without lesions. <br>- <strong>Bimanual Exam:</strong> Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa without masses. <br><br><em>Incomplete aspects:</em> <br>- No documentation of lymph node assessment. <br>- No mention of anal involvement (common in lichen sclerosus). <br><br>### <strong>Assessment:</strong> <br><strong>Working Diagnosis:</strong> Likely lichen sclerosus given classic appearance of vulvar skin changes and symptoms. Differential includes lichen planus or vulvar dysplasia, though less likely. <br><br>### <strong>Plan:</strong> <br>1. <strong>Topical Therapy:</strong> Prescribe high-potency corticosteroid ointment (e.g., clobetasol 0.05%) applied thinly to affected areas once daily for 4 weeks, then taper. <br>2. <strong>Symptom Management:</strong> Recommend emollients (e.g., plain petroleum jelly) to reduce friction and soothe skin. <br>3. <strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Re-evaluate in 6 weeks to assess response. If no improvement, consider biopsy to confirm diagnosis. <br>4. <strong>Counseling:</strong> Advised to avoid irritants (e.g., scented soaps, tight clothing).
