The note mentions \"CTG normal\" but lacks specific details required for proper interpretation.\n\n2. **Different management plan** - Avoid prolonged maternal supine position during CTG monitoring.  \n   Reason: The guideline specifically recommends avoiding maternal supine recumbent position for prolonged monitoring (Section 3). The note doesn't mention maternal position during monitoring.\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer information about the risks/benefits of waiting vs. augmentation, including specific statistics.  \n   Reason: While risks are mentioned (infection risk doubling), the guideline stresses integrating CTG with clinical information (Section 4). More precise risk quantification would improve shared decision-making.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document frequency of intermittent auscultation if not using continuous CTG.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends continuous CTG when abnormalities are detected during intermittent auscultation (Section 2). The monitoring protocol should be clearly stated.\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Note whether simultaneous maternal heart rate monitoring was performed.  \n   Reason: The guideline mentions this can be useful in specific conditions (Section 3), though not strictly required in low-risk cases.\n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include more details about what would prompt intervention during the waiting period.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes prompt action for suspected hypoxia (Section 4). Clearer criteria for intervention would be helpful.\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the specific wireless monitoring equipment used.  \n   Reason: While the guideline mentions wireless options (Section 3), the specific brand/model is not clinically essential.\n\nThe note generally follows guideline principles but would benefit from more detailed CTG documentation and clearer monitoring protocols. The most critical missing elements are specific CTG parameters and maternal positioning during monitoring.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 49 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: FIGO Consensus Guidelines on Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring: Cardiotocography\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
