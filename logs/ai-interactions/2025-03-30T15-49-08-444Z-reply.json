2022 - Endometriosis)**  \n**Key Recommendations:**  \n1. **Diagnosis:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and MRI are first-line imaging modalities for endometriosis.  \n   - Laparoscopy with histology remains the gold standard for diagnosis, particularly for deep endometriosis.  \n   - Clinical suspicion alone (symptoms + examination findings) may justify empirical treatment in some cases.  \n\n2. **Medical Management:**  \n   - Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are first-line for pain management.  \n   - Progestins (oral, injectable, or LNG-IUS) are alternatives if CHCs are contraindicated.  \n   - GnRH agonists with add-back therapy (e.g., tibolone or low-dose estrogen-progestin) should be considered for severe symptoms.  \n\n3. **Surgical Considerations:**  \n   - Surgery (laparoscopy) should be considered if symptoms persist despite medical therapy or if fertility is a concern.  \n   - Endometrioma excision may improve pain but should be balanced against ovarian reserve risks.  \n\n4. **Fertility & Counselling:**  \n   - Early referral to a fertility specialist is recommended for patients desiring conception.  \n   - Endometriosis-associated infertility may require ART (assisted reproductive technology).  \n\n5. **Multidisciplinary Approach:**  \n   - Psychological support and patient education should be integrated into care.  \n\n---\n\n### **HTML-Formatted Clinical Note with Adjustments**  \n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Clinical Note -
