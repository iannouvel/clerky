      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice**: Operators should select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum extraction does not increase cesarean rates or neonatal complications like low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Ultrasound is recommended if fetal head position is uncertain. - **Post-birth care**: Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document and discuss postnatal plans. - **Psychological support**: Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. Ensure supportive care for families and staff after adverse events. - **Reporting & compliance**: Adhere to duty of candour, complete incident reports, and monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
