Healthcare Professional: Good morning, how can I help you today?

Patient: Hi, I'm here for my prenatal check-up. I'm 32 years old, this is my first pregnancy, and my BMI is 26.

Healthcare Professional: Great, let's start by discussing any symptoms or concerns you have been experiencing.

Patient: I've been having some lower back pain and occasional headaches. Also, I'm worried about gestational diabetes because my mother had it during her pregnancies.
