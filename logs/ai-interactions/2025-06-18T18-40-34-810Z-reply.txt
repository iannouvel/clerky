Blood/urine tests should be offered; refusals documented. - **Consent** for blood products and antenatal screening must be obtained and recorded. - **Monitoring** includes urinalysis (proteinuria/UTIs), with recurrent UTIs referred to obstetrics. - **Risk-based care:** High-risk pregnancies require consultant-led care, specialist referrals, and safeguarding interventions (e.g., mental health, domestic abuse, FGM). - **Lifestyle advice:** Smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and weight management (BMI <30) should be addressed. - **Fetal wellbeing:** Monitor growth, refer for scans if needed, and manage pregnancy-related symptoms (e.g., nausea, bleeding). - **Equity:** Additional support for minority ethnic, deprived, or migrant populations, with language services as needed. - **Continuity of care:** Maintain clear communication, access to records, and a welcoming environment. - **Documentation:** Ensure thorough record-keeping, including risk assessments and test results. *References: MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC guidelines.*",
