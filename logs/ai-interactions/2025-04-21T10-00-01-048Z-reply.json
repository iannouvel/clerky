She reports passing clots and soaking through multiple pads per day.  \n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \n- Bleeding pattern: Continuous for 6 weeks, heavier than usual menses.  \n- Associated symptoms: Fatigue, mild lightheadedness, no syncope.  \n- Pain: Mild cramping, no severe pelvic pain.  \n- Sexual activity: Sexually active, inconsistent condom use.  \n- Contraception: None currently.  \n- Prior pregnancies: 5 (3 live births, 2 first-trimester losses).  \n- No history of gynecologic procedures (e.g., D&C, hysteroscopy).  \n- No known bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use.  \n\n*(Missing pertinent questions: Family history of bleeding disorders, medication history including OTC/herbal supplements, prior STI screening, detailed menstrual history before this episode.)*  \n\n**Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Obesity (BMI 38.1)  \n- No chronic medical conditions reported.  \n- No prior surgeries.  \n\n**Medications/Allergies:**  \n- No regular medications.  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smokes ½ pack cigarettes/day.  \n- Occasional alcohol use.  \n- No illicit drug use.  \n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- Constitutional: Fatigue, no fever/chills.  \n- Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations.  \n- Respiratory: No dyspnea.  \n- GI: No nausea/vomiting, normal bowel habits.  \n- GU: No dysuria, hematuria.  \n\n*(Missing pertinent exam: No speculum/bimanual exam documented, no assessment for pallor/signs of anemia.)*  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)** – Likely ovulatory dysfunction given obesity and irregular cycles, though structural causes (e.g., polyps, fibroids) or pregnancy-related complications (e.g., incomplete miscarriage) cannot be excluded without further workup.  \n2. **Risk for anemia** – Given prolonged bleeding and fatigue.  \n3. **Obesity** – Contributing factor to hormonal dysregulation.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. **Labs:**  \n   - CBC (assess for anemia).  \n   - TSH (rule out thyroid dysfunction).  \n   - Pregnancy test (despite no reported missed period, given sexual activity).  \n   - Consider coagulation studies if personal/family history suggests bleeding disorder *(not yet elicited)*.  \n\n2. **Imaging:**  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal/transvaginal) to evaluate for structural abnormalities.  \n\n3. **Management:**  \n   - **Acute bleeding control:**  \n     - Start oral progestin (e.g., norethindrone) for short-term bleeding control.  \n     - NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain and bleeding reduction.  \n   - **Long-term:**  \n     - Discuss hormonal contraception (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill or progestin-only options) for cycle regulation after ruling out contraindications.  \n     - Weight loss counseling – Referral to nutritionist if interested.  \n   - **Follow-up:**  \n     - Return in 1 week for lab results and symptom reassessment.  \n     - Emergency instructions if bleeding worsens (e.g., soaking >1 pad/hour, syncope).  \n\n*(Missing elements: No discussion of endometrial biopsy despite risk factors [obesity, prolonged anovulation], no STI screening offered.)*  \n\n**Counseling Points:**  \n- Advised on iron-rich diet due to risk of anemia.  \n- Encouraged smoking cessation.  \n- Discussed importance of consistent contraception given high parity and irregular cycles.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Await lab/imaging results.  \n- Consider referral to gynecology if bleeding persists or structural abnormality found.  \n\n**End of Dictation** *(For testing purposes only – fictional case.)*",
