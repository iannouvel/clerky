Ensure voiding before discharge; monitor for retention. - **PVR/TWOC Management:** Check post-void residual within 4 hours post-op; catheterize if high residuals. - **Post-Operative Care:** Resume eating/drinking when conscious. Discharge after voiding and if well. Arrange urogynecology follow-up. **Note:** Professional judgement applies in all cases",
