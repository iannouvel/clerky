Confirm labour via vaginal exam. - **2nd stage (passive/active):** Monitor maternal/fetal wellbeing (partogram), support positioning/pushing, and intervene if delayed (e.g., amniotomy, obstetric referral). - **3rd stage:** Delayed cord clamping recommended; physiological management (no routine uterotonics) or active management if bleeding occurs. **Admission/Initial Assessment:** - For SROM >37 weeks, assess promptly. In established labour, provide one-to-one care, monitor vitals, fetal heart rate, and pain relief options. **Post-Birth Care:** - Newborn: Record Apgar, promote skin-to-skin contact, and initiate breastfeeding. - Maternal: Monitor vitals, uterine tone, and emotional state; inspect placenta for completeness. **Emergencies:** - Escalate risks/emergencies immediately, document actions, and arrange urgent transfer if needed (call 999 for community settings). *Focus: Evidence-based, individualized care with timely intervention for optimal outcomes.* (Word count: 200)\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
