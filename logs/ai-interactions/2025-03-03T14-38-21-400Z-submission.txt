Please determine the significant clinical issues within this clinical scenario. 
Format each issue as a brief, clear statement.

Rules:
Each issue should be a single line
Maximum number of characters per issue is 60.
If two issues are associated, include them as a single line to avoid repetition - for example, if the patient has multiple symptoms associated with one issue (like painful, irregular heavy periods), the have that as one issue: 'Painful, irregular heavy periods' instead of 3 diferent issues
Do not list the issues with numbers, just simple text

Use the following as an exampled of the type of list I'd like to have returned:

Painful, irregular heavy periods
Subfertility
Considering diagnostic laparoscopy ?endometriosis

Clinical scenario:
{{text}}

Please identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:
1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., "Anaemia" and "Iron level monitoring" should merge into "Anaemia")
2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., "Previous C-section" and "Potential need for C-section" should merge)
3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise
4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate
5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line

Clinical Summary:
Healthcare Professional: Good morning! How are you feeling today?

Patient: I've been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles lately.

Healthcare Professional: Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?

Patient: Yes, I've been having severe pelvic pain during my periods.

Healthcare Professional: That sounds concerning. Have you ever been diagnosed with endometriosis?

Patient: No, I haven't. What is endometriosis?

Healthcare Professional: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, causing pain and sometimes fertility issues.

Patient: Oh, I see. Is it treatable?

Healthcare Professional: Yes, there are various treatment options available, including medication, hormone therapy, and sometimes surgery.

Patient: That's good to know. I also wanted to ask about my family planning options.

Healthcare Professional: Of course. Have you considered any specific contraceptive methods?

Patient: I'm interested in exploring long-acting reversible contraceptives like an intrauterine device (IUD).

Healthcare Professional: IUDs are a highly effective form of contraception and can be easily inserted during a quick office visit.

Patient: That sounds like a good option for me. Thank you for the information.

Healthcare Professional: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
