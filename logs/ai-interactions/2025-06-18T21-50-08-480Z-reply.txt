      "newValue": "**Summary:** This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assisted vaginal births using forceps or vacuum extraction. Operators should select the most appropriate instrument for the first attempt, considering that vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Factors increasing failure risk include mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. Ultrasound is recommended if fetal head position is uncertain. Post-birth care includes antibiotics, monitoring for complications, bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Psychological support should be offered for traumatic births, avoiding single high-intensity \"reliving\" sessions. Maternity units must ensure a supportive environment, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports when necessary. Auditable standards should be monitored per RCOG guidelines",
