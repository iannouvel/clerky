**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Jane Doe (fictional)  
- Age: 32 years  
- Weight: 70 kg  
- Height: 164 cm  
- BMI: 26 (calculated as 70 kg / (1.64 m)²)  
- Gravida: 5 (prior pregnancies)  
- Para: 3 (live births), 1 (miscarriage), 1 (termination)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a 3-week history of **heavy, irregular vaginal bleeding** associated with **pelvic pain** and **dyspareunia** (pain during intercourse). She also reports **fatigue** and **lightheadedness**, which she attributes to blood loss.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Bleeding is described as **prolonged (lasting 10–14 days per cycle)** and **heavy (soaking through pads every 2 hours)**.  
- Pelvic pain is **dull and constant**, worse during menstruation and intercourse.  
- No fever, urinary symptoms, or bowel changes.  
- Last menstrual period (LMP) was **3 weeks ago**, but bleeding has been intermittent since.  
- No recent trauma or foreign body insertion.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Iron-deficiency anemia** (diagnosed 2 years ago, on intermittent iron supplements).  
- **Hypothyroidism** (on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily).  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or clotting disorders.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- **Cesarean section x2** (last one 4 years ago).  
- **Dilation & curettage (D&C)** for incomplete miscarriage (5 years ago).  
- **Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy** (3 years ago).  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 12, cycles previously regular (28–30 days).  
- **Dysmenorrhea** since teenage years, worsening in recent months.  
- **History of endometriosis** (diagnosed laparoscopically 3 years ago).  
- **Previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** (treated with antibiotics 6 years ago).  
- **Cervical smear history**: Last Pap smear **2 years ago** (normal).  

**Drug History:**  
- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.  
- Ferrous sulfate PRN (takes intermittently).  
- No hormonal contraception (stopped combined pill 6 months ago due to migraines).  

**Allergy History:**  
- **Penicillin** (rash).  
- No other known drug allergies.  

**Social History:**  
- **Occupation**: School teacher (moderate stress levels).  
- **Smoking**: Ex-smoker (quit 5 years ago).  
- **Alcohol**: Occasional (1–2 units/week).  
- **Exercise**: Sedentary lifestyle due to fatigue.  
- **Relationship status**: Married, sexually active with one partner.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas**: Worried that bleeding may be due to **fibroids or cancer**.  
- **Concerns**: Anxious about impact on fertility (desires future pregnancy).  
- **Expectations**: Wants **diagnosis, treatment to stop bleeding, and reassurance**.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General**: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia), no lymphadenopathy.  
- **Abdominal**: Soft, non-distended, mild suprapubic tenderness. No palpable masses.  
- **Speculum exam**: Cervix appears normal, no lesions. Active bleeding noted.  
- **Bimanual exam**: Uterus **enlarged (12-week size), irregular contour** (suggestive of fibroids).  
- **Adnexa**: Mild right-sided tenderness, no palpable masses.  
- **No cervical motion tenderness** (unlikely acute PID).  

**Investigations Ordered:**  
1. **Full blood count (FBC)** – assess anemia.  
2. **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)** – ensure optimal levothyroxine dosing.  
3. **Pelvic ultrasound** – evaluate fibroids, endometrial thickness, ovarian pathology.  
4. **Endometrial biopsy** (if ultrasound suggests hyperplasia).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Symptomatic relief**:  
   - **Tranexamic acid** (1g TDS during heavy bleeding).  
   - **NSAIDs** (e.g., mefenamic acid for pain/dysmenorrhea).  
2. **Hormonal options**:  
   - **Progestin-only pill** (to regulate cycles).  
   - Consider **Mirena IUD** (if endometrial biopsy normal).  
3. **Surgical options** (if fibroids confirmed):  
   - **Myomectomy** (if future fertility desired).  
   - **Hysteroscopic resection** (if submucosal fibroids).  
4. **Follow-up**:  
   - Review in **2 weeks** with investigation results.  
   - Discuss **endometriosis management** if pain persists.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that **cancer is unlikely** but requires exclusion.  
- Advised on **iron-rich diet** and **regular iron supplements**.  
- Encouraged **gradual exercise** to improve fatigue.  
- Provided **contraception counselling** (Mirena may reduce bleeding and protect fertility).  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await ultrasound and biopsy results.  
- Consider **gynaecology referral** if medical management fails.
