      "newValue": "**Summary of Shoulder Dystocia Guidelines** Shoulder dystocia (SD) is a vaginal birth complication requiring additional maneuvers after failed gentle traction, occurring in ~0.6% of births. It carries high risks of perinatal mortality/morbidity (e.g., brachial plexus injury) and maternal complications (e.g., hemorrhage, trauma). Key risk factors include fetal macrosomia, maternal diabetes, and obesity. **Management:** - **Antenatal:** Assess recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies after prior SD. - **Intrapartum:** Prompt recognition and systematic maneuvers (e.g., McRoberts, suprapubic pressure) to reduce hypoxia and trauma. Involve experienced obstetricians. - **Post-birth:** Monitor for maternal hemorrhage/perineal tears and neonatal injuries. Pediatric review if brachial plexus injury suspected. **Follow-up:** Offer counseling and document incidents for audit. Training in SD management is recommended for all birth attendants. *(Appendices include PROMPT algorithm, proforma, and implementation tools.)*",
