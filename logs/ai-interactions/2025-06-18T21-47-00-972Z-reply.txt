      "newValue": "**Summary of Guideline on Labor Induction and Augmentation:** - **Stillbirth risks** are higher in Black and Asian babies and increase with maternal deprivation. Induction is recommended between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to reduce risks. - **Counseling**: Women should be informed about induction methods (membrane sweep, balloon catheter, dinoprostone, oxytocin), risks/benefits, and alternatives. - **Membrane sweeps** should be offered from 38 weeks and routinely at 39 weeks to promote spontaneous labor. - **Induction contraindications**: Precipitate labor history, suspected macrosomia, or maternal request without medical indication. - **Cervical assessment**: Use Bishop Score; balloon catheter or dinoprostone for ripening. Monitor fetal wellbeing (CTG) and maternal observations. - **Oxytocin use**: Start after counseling, titrate for adequate contractions, and monitor for hyperstimulation (terbutaline if needed). - **Special cases**: Preterm labor, fetal demise, previous cesarean, diabetes, obesity, or maternal request require individualized plans. - **PROM management**: Offer induction after 24 hours of expectant management; monitor for infection (avoid routine swabs/CRP). - **Failed induction**: Reassess within 24â€“48 hours; consider cesarean if no progress. - **Complications**: Suspected uterine rupture warrants immediate cesarean; hyperstimulation requires fetal assessment and tocolysis. - **Documentation**: Record all procedures (balloon placement, ARM, oxytocin dosing) and outcomes. **Monitoring**: Regular CTG, maternal vitals, and contraction patterns during induction/augmentation",
