**Body:**
Mrs. Smith, a 39-year-old female with a BMI of 61, presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and worsening pelvic pain, impacting her daily life. She has a history of fibroids, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, with surgical history significant for appendectomy. The clinician recommends a pelvic ultrasound to assess the fibroids' size and location, considering a myomectomy or endometrial ablation due to the severity of symptoms and previous cesarean sections. A physical examination will be performed to rule out other gynecological issues.

**Plan:**
1. Schedule pelvic ultrasound to evaluate fibroids.
2. Consider myomectomy or endometrial ablation based on ultrasound findings.
3. Refer to a nutritionist for weight management.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and address any questions or concerns.
