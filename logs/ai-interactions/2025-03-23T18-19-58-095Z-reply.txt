She has a history of 5 prior pregnancies, with 3 live births and 2 miscarriages. Past medical history includes hypertension and asthma. Surgical history is significant for a cesarean section. Gynecological history includes a history of ovarian cysts. She is currently taking medications for her hypertension and asthma. No known drug allergies. Socially, she is a stay-at-home mom.

Clinician: Good morning, Mrs. Smith. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me more about your irregular menstrual cycles and pelvic pain? How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: The irregular cycles have been going on for about 6 months now, and the pelvic pain started about 3 months ago. It's a sharp pain that comes and goes.

Clinician: I see. Based on your history and examination findings, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms related to your ovarian cysts. I would recommend further evaluation with an ultrasound to assess the size and characteristics of the cysts. In the meantime, I would also suggest managing your pain with over-the-counter pain medications and applying heat to the affected area.

Patient: Will I need surgery to remove the cysts?

Clinician: It's possible, depending on the size and location of the cysts. We will need to wait for the ultrasound results before making any decisions about surgical intervention. In the meantime, it's important to monitor your symptoms and follow up with me regularly.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I will follow your recommendations.

Clinician: You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. We will work together to ensure the best possible outcome for your health.
