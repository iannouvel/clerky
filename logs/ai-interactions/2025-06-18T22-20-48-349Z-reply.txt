Ultrasound aids pre-evacuation diagnosis, but histology confirms it. - **Types**: Complete moles (diploid, no fetal tissue) and partial moles (triploid, mixed paternal/maternal genes). - **Histology**: Recommended for failed pregnancies to exclude GTD. Persistent trophoblastic neoplasia may occur post-pregnancy. - **Evacuation**: Suction curettage is preferred. Anti-D prophylaxis may be needed for partial moles. - **Follow-up**: Referral to Charing Cross Hospital for monitoring. Avoid pregnancy until hCG normalizes; use barrier contraception. - **GTN**: Persistent Î²hCG elevation indicates GTN; offer urine pregnancy tests for persistent bleeding. - **Twin Pregnancy**: Consult Fetal Medicine Centre for molar/viable twin pregnancies; consider fetal karyotype testing. - **Future Pregnancies**: Low recurrence risk; contact treatment center for follow-up.
