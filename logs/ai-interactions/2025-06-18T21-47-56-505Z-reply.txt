Caesarean recommended for monoamniotic twins/triplets. - **Intrapartum Care:** Continuous CTG monitoring for twins >26 weeks. Classify CTG as 'abnormal' or 'non-reassuring.' Senior obstetrician involvement for pathological traces. Active management for second twin birth. - **Postpartum Care:** Monitor for hemorrhage, hypoglycemia. Follow bereavement pathway if fetal demise occurs. - **Preterm Labor:** Screen but avoid routine interventions.
