No hemodynamic instability at present.  \n\n### **BACKGROUND:**  \n**Relevant PMHx:**  \n- **OBGYN Hx:**  \n  - G4P2 (2x SVD, 1x LSCS for FTP, 1x TOP)  \n  - Previous IUD (Mirena®) removed 6/12 ago due to expulsion  \n  - No known fibroids or endometriosis  \n- **Medical Hx:**  \n  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD)  \n  - Obesity (BMI 32)  \n  - No known coagulopathy  \n- **Surgical Hx:**  \n  - LSCS (2018)  \n  - Appendicectomy (2005)  \n- **Medications:**  \n  - Levothyroxine 75mcg OD  \n  - NSAIDs PRN for dysmenorrhea (no recent use)  \n- **Allergies:** NKDA  \n- **Social Hx:**  \n  - Non-smoker, occasional ETOH  \n  - Works as a teacher, moderately active  \n\n**Risk Factors for AUB:**  \n- Obesity (↑ endometrial hyperplasia risk)  \n- Hypothyroidism (may exacerbate HMB)  \n- Previous IUD expulsion (possible structural cause)  \n\n### **ASSESSMENT:**  \n**Clinical Findings (0800 hours):**  \n- **Vitals:**  \n  - BP: 128/78 mmHg  \n  - HR: 88 bpm (regular)  \n  - Temp: 36.7°C  \n  - SpO₂: 98% RA  \n  - RR: 14/min  \n- **General Exam:**  \n  - Pale conjunctivae (clinical anemia)  \n  - No signs of hemodynamic compromise  \n- **Abdo Exam:**  \n  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  \n- **PV Exam (consented & chaperoned):**  \n  - No active bleeding at time of exam  \n  - Cervix appears normal, no cervical excitation  \n  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size  \n  - No adnexal masses  \n  - **Document confirmation of patient's ability to tolerate speculum examination (required for OPH suitability per section 3.1.2)**  \n\n**Investigations:**  \n- **Bloods (FBC, LFTs, U&Es, CRP, TFTs, coagulation screen):**  \n  - Hb: 98 g/L (↓ from 112 g/L 6/12 ago)  \n  - MCV: 78 fL (microcytic)  \n  - Ferritin: 12 μg/L (↓)  \n  - TSH: 2.1 mIU/L (well-controlled)  \n  - Platelets: 220 x10⁹/L  \n  - INR/APTT: Normal  \n- **Imaging:**  \n  - **TV USS:**  \n    - Endometrial thickness: 12mm (heterogeneous)  \n    - No fibroids/polyps seen  \n    - Normal adnexa  \n  - **Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology)**  \n\n**Differential Diagnosis (PALM-COEIN):**  \n1. **Polyp/Adenomyosis** (USS inconclusive, biopsy pending)  \n2. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (↑ risk due to obesity)  \n3. **Coagulopathy** (unlikely given normal coagulation)  \n4. **Ovulatory dysfunction** (secondary to hypothyroidism?)  \n5. **Iatrogenic** (none identified)  \n\n### **RECOMMENDATION:**  \n**Immediate Management:**  \n- **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulfate 200mg BD + vitamin C (monitor Hb in 4/52)  \n- **Hormonal therapy:**  \n  - Start norethisterone 5mg TDS for 21/7 (to regulate bleeding)  \n  - **Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion during outpatient hysteroscopy if biopsy normal**  \n- **Analgesia:** Mefenamic acid 500mg TDS PRN (if dysmenorrhea)  \n\n**Monitoring & Follow-Up:**  \n- **Repeat Hb in 4/52** (target >110 g/L)  \n- **Await endometrial biopsy results** (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy)  \n- **GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52 with outpatient hysteroscopy planning including: written patient information provision, confirmation of speculum tolerance, safety checklist (pregnancy exclusion), consent discussion about potential pain, and arrangement of dedicated recovery area**  \n\n**Further Investigations if Needed:**  \n- **If outpatient hysteroscopy is performed, document: scope size (≤3.5mm), vaginoscopic approach, saline distension medium, pressure used, and any interventions**  \n- **Thyroid antibody testing** if TFTs fluctuate  \n\n**Contingencies:**  \n- If hemodynamically unstable → admit for IV iron/transfusion  \n- If biopsy shows hyperplasia → consider progestogens/hysterectomy (if completed family)  \n\n**Additional Considerations:**  \n- **Provide standardized written information about outpatient hysteroscopy prior to appointment, including procedure details, benefits/risks, pre-procedure analgesia advice, and unit contact details**  \n- **If outpatient hysteroscopy is planned, implement pre-procedure analgesic regimen: paracetamol 1g PO, codeine 30mg PO, and diclofenac 100mg PR 1 hour prior (per Appendix B)**  \n- **Ensure standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings if procedure is performed, including: scope size, approach (vaginoscopic), distension medium (saline), pressure, and any interventions**  \n\n---  \n**Documented by:** [Your Name] (FY2)  \n**Reviewed by:** [Consultant Name] (Obstetrics & Gynaecology)  \n**Time/Date:** 0800 hours, 05/06/2024  \n\n*(This is a fictional case for educational purposes only.)*\n\n--- Token Usage Report ---\nPrompt tokens: 2343\nCompletion tokens: 1394\nTotal tokens: 3737\nEstimated cost: $0.001868",
