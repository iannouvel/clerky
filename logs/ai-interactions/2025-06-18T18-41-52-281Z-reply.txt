It applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and recovery staff. **Key Recommendations:** - **Equipment:** Blood pressure monitor, oxygen saturation monitor, thermometer, oxygen/breathing system, suction, and infusion devices must be available. - **Monitoring:** Continuous vital sign monitoring until the woman is stable and conscious, with specific protocols for general/regional anaesthesia. - **Ongoing Care:** Ensure IV cannulas are patent, administer prescribed medications, and avoid leaving the woman unattended. - **Discharge Criteria:** Consciousness, clear airway, stable cardiovascular status, adequate analgesia, and removed pressure dressings. - **Postnatal Care:** Monitor temperature, pulse, and blood pressure; support breastfeeding and baby care. - **Complications:** Refer to an obstetric anaesthetist if needed. - **Training/Audit:** Ensure staff training (per Maternity Training Needs Analysis) and audit vital signs/MEOWS chart documentation. Care continues until handover to the midwife is complete",
