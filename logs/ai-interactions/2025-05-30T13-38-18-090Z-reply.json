She reports episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with associated fatigue. She denies intermenstrual spotting but admits to occasional cramping. No history of post-coital bleeding. She has not been sexually active in the past year.  Relevant Medical History:No known bleeding disorders or thyroid dysfunction.No prior gynecological procedures (e.g., hysteroscopy, D&amp;C).No history of fibroids or endometriosis.No chronic medical conditions.  Medications &amp; Allergies:Occasional ibuprofen for cramps (no regular medications).No known drug allergies.

Examination Findings:  \nGeneral appearance: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia).  \nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \nSpeculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \nBimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness.  Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):No documented assessment of iron studies or hemoglobin.No inquiry about family history of gynecological malignancies.No discussion of prior Pap smear history or HPV vaccination status.Pelvic ultrasound not yet performed.  Impression:Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  Management Plan:\n\n\nInvestigations:Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.(No endometrial biopsy arranged at this stage.)  2.

Follow-Up:Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.If bleeding worsens or anemia confirmed, escalate to gynecology referral.  Counseling Provided:Reassured that AUB is common but requires evaluation.Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and report syncope or severe fatigue.

She reports episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with associated fatigue. She denies intermenstrual spotting but admits to occasional cramping. No history of post-coital bleeding. She has not been sexually active in the past year.  Relevant Medical History:No known bleeding disorders or thyroid dysfunction.No prior gynecological procedures (e.g., hysteroscopy, D&amp;C).No history of fibroids or endometriosis.No chronic medical conditions.  Medications &amp; Allergies:Occasional ibuprofen for cramps (no regular medications).No known drug allergies.  Social History:Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units&#x2F;week).Works as a teacher; moderate stress levels reported.  Examination Findings:  \\nGeneral appearance: Pale conjunctivae (possible anemia).  \\nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \\nSpeculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \\nBimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness.  Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):No documented assessment of iron studies or hemoglobin.No inquiry about family history of gynecological malignancies.No discussion of prior Pap smear history or HPV vaccination status.Pelvic ultrasound not yet performed.  Impression:Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  Management Plan:\\n\\n\\nInvestigations:Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.(No endometrial biopsy arranged at this stage.)  2. Symptomatic Relief:Trial of tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding.Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  3. Follow-Up:Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.If bleeding worsens or anemia confirmed, escalate to gynecology referral.  Counseling Provided:Reassured that AUB is common but requires evaluation.Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and report syncope or severe fatigue.

Endometriosis** - Likely (endometriosis is a potential cause of AUB, though less likely given history)  \n4. **BJOG - 2024 - De Silva - Outpatient Hysteroscopy** - Likely (potential future investigation if ultrasound is inconclusive)  \n\n### Potentially Relevant Guidelines  \n1. **GTG 2012 - Initial Mx of Chronic Pelvic Pain** - Likely (if cramping becomes a dominant symptom)  \n2. **ESHRE Guideline - 2022 - Endometriosis** - Likely (secondary consideration)  \n3. **Uptodate - 2025 - Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) Treatment overview** - Likely (though no evidence of fibroids, still a differential)  \n4. **Guideline No. 451 Asymptomatic Endometrial Thickening in Postmenopausal Women** - Unlikely (patient is premenopausal)  \n\n### Less Relevant Guidelines  \n1. **BJOG - 2016 - Management of Bladder Pain Syndrome** - Unlikely (not relevant to AUB)  \n2. **BJOG - 2017 - Management of Inherited Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy** - Unlikely (no history of bleeding disorders)  \n3. **GTG 2011 - APH** - Unlikely (not pregnant)  \n4. **GTG 2015 - Blood transfusion in Obstetrics** - Unlikely (no acute hemorrhage)  \n5. **NICE - 2021 - Antenatal Care** - Unlikely (not pregnant)  \n\n### Not Relevant Guidelines  \n1. **BASHH -
