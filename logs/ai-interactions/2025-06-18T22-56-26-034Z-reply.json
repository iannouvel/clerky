Not routinely recommended for multiple pregnancies or uterine anomalies. Individualize for prior trachelectomy. - **Rescue Cerclage:** For premature dilatation with exposed membranes (16+0–27+6 weeks), excluding cases with infection, bleeding, or contractions. May prolong pregnancy by 4–5 weeks, with delivery often around 24 weeks. Immediate insertion is advised, though delayed insertion (after 48 hours) may improve outcomes. - **Contraindications:** Active infection, labor, or bleeding. - **Documentation & Consent:** Detailed pre- and post-operative care, suture removal, and PPROM management are outlined.
