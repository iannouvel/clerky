**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 4-month history of irregular menstrual bleeding. She reports episodes of heavy bleeding lasting 7–10 days, occurring every 2–3 weeks, with associated fatigue. She denies intermenstrual spotting but admits to occasional cramping. No history of post-coital bleeding. She has not been sexually active in the past year.  

**Relevant Medical History:**  
- No known bleeding disorders or thyroid dysfunction.  
- No prior gynecological procedures (e.g., hysteroscopy, D&C).  
- No history of fibroids or endometriosis.  
- No chronic medical conditions.  

**Medications & Allergies:**  
- Occasional ibuprofen for cramps (no regular medications).  
- No known drug allergies.

- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- Speculum exam: Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  
- Bimanual exam: Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness.  

**Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):**  
- No documented assessment of iron studies or hemoglobin.  
- No inquiry about family history of gynecological malignancies.  
- No discussion of prior Pap smear history or HPV vaccination status.  
- Pelvic ultrasound not yet performed.  

**Impression:**  
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in a premenopausal patient—differential includes ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or early perimenopausal changes.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH and prolactin to evaluate endocrine causes.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural pathology.  
   - (No endometrial biopsy arranged at this stage.)  

2. **Symptomatic Relief:**  
   - Trial of tranexamic acid during heavy bleeding.  
   - Consider combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for cycle regulation if no contraindications.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 6 weeks with investigation results.  
   - If bleeding worsens or anemia confirmed, escalate to gynecology referral.  

**Counseling Provided:**  
- Reassured that AUB is common but requires evaluation.  
- Advised to monitor bleeding patterns and report syncope or severe fatigue.
