A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – For Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** [Redacted]  
- **Age:** 17 years  
- **Weight:** 160 kg  
- **BMI:** 61 (severely obese)  
- **Ethnicity:** [Redacted]  
- **Occupation:** Student (currently not attending school due to health concerns)  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with:  
1. **Irregular, heavy vaginal bleeding** for the past 3 months, associated with clots and fatigue.  
2. **Recurrent pelvic pain**, worsening over the last 6 weeks, particularly on the right side.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- The patient reports menarche at age 12, with previously irregular but manageable cycles.  
- Over the past 3 months, bleeding has become prolonged (lasting 10–14 days) with flooding and clots.  
- She denies fever, dizziness, or syncope but reports increasing fatigue.  
- The pelvic pain is intermittent, sharp, and radiates to the lower back. No dysuria or bowel symptoms.  
- She has had **two prior pregnancies**:  
  - First pregnancy at age 15 – **spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks**, birth weight 3.2 kg.  
  - Second pregnancy at age 16 – **missed miscarriage at 10 weeks**, managed medically.  
- No contraception currently in use.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** – diagnosed age 14 (based on oligomenorrhea and ultrasound findings).  
- **Iron-deficiency anaemia** – previously treated with oral iron.  
- **Depression** – on fluoxetine 20 mg daily.  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- None.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- **Sexually active** since age 14, multiple partners, inconsistent condom use.  
- **Last menstrual period (LMP):** 2 weeks ago (heavy, prolonged).  
- **Last cervical screening:** Never performed (under age for routine screening).  

**Drug History:**  
- Fluoxetine 20 mg OD (depression).  
- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular analgesia).  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA.  

**Social History:**  
- Lives with mother; estranged from father.  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day since age 15.  
- Denies alcohol or recreational drug use.  
- Limited physical activity due to mobility issues related to obesity.  

**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Believes her symptoms are due to "hormone imbalance" and is worried about cancer.  
- **Concerns:** Anxious about weight affecting fertility and future pregnancies.  
- **Expectations:** Wants help regulating periods and pain relief.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Obese, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Pelvic Examination (consent obtained):**  
  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions.  
  - **Bimanual:** Uterus bulky, right adnexal tenderness (no palpable mass).  
- **BP:** 128/82 mmHg, HR 88 bpm.  

**Assessment:**  
1. **Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) secondary to PCOS** – Likely exacerbated by obesity and anovulation.  
2. **Chronic Pelvic Pain** – Possible causes:  
   - **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** – Given sexual history, though no fever/cervical motion tenderness.  
   - **Ovarian pathology** (e.g., cyst, residual tissue from prior miscarriage).  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - **Bloods:** FBC (anaemia), CRP (inflammation), HbA1c (insulin resistance), hormonal profile (LH/FSH, testosterone).  
   - **Pelvic USS:** Assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, exclude retained products.  
   - **STI screen:** Chlamydia/gonorrhoea NAAT, HIV/syphilis serology.  
2. **Immediate Treatment:**  
   - **Progestogen therapy (e.g., norethisterone)** to regulate bleeding.  
   - **Iron supplementation** (ferrous sulfate) for anaemia.  
   - **Analgesia:** Paracetamol PRN (avoid NSAIDs if PID suspected).  
3. **Long-term:**  
   - **Contraception counselling:** Consider progesterone-only pill or implant (avoid oestrogen due to BMI/DVT risk).  
   - **Weight management referral:** Dietitian + bariatric specialist input.  
   - **Psychological support:** Reinforce mental health follow-up.  
4. **Follow-up:**  
   - Review in 2 weeks with investigation results.  
   - If PID confirmed: Treat with doxycycline + metronidazole.  

**Patient Advice:**  
- Encouraged smoking cessation (referral to youth support service).  
- Safe sex counselling provided.  
- Emergency contact details given if bleeding worsens.  

**Prognosis:**  
- Symptoms likely manageable with hormonal therapy and lifestyle changes.  
- Requires close monitoring due to high-risk factors (obesity, prior pregnancies, PCOS).
