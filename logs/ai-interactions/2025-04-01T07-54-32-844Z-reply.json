She also reports a 3-month history of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Menstrual cycles previously regular (28-day cycle) but now prolonged (7–14 days) with flooding and clots.  - Pelvic pain is dull, intermittent, and radiates to the lower back. No dyspareunia.  - Fatigue is significant, impacting work. Denies syncope but reports light-headedness.  - No post-coital bleeding or discharge.  - LMP: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting).  Obstetric History:  - G2 P2 (2 prior vaginal deliveries, no complications).  - Last delivery: 5 years ago.  - No history of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia.  Past Medical History:  - Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago, on metformin).  - Hypertension (on lisinopril).  - Depression (on sertraline, stable).  Past Surgical History:  - Appendectomy (age 20).  - No prior gynaecological surgery.  Gynaecological History:  - Regular cervical screening (last smear 1 year ago, normal).  - No history of STIs.  - No use of hormonal contraception (condoms only).  Drug History:  - Metformin 500mg BD.  - Lisinopril 10mg OD.  - Sertraline 50mg OD.  - No NSAIDs or anticoagulants.  Allergies:  - Penicillin (rash).  Social History:  - Non-smoker.  - Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  - Lives with partner and two children.  - Sedentary job, minimal exercise due to fatigue/joint pain.  Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Worried about \"fibroids or cancer\" due to bleeding.  - Concerns: Anxiety about needing surgery.  - Expectations: Wants investigation and treatment to improve quality of life.  Examination Findings:  - General: Pale conjunctiva (possible anaemia), obese.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  - Speculum: Cervix appears normal, minimal fresh bleeding.  - Bimanual: Uterus enlarged (~12-week size), irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids), no adnexal tenderness.  Investigations Requested:  1. Bloods: FBC (anaemia likely), HbA1c, LFTs, clotting.  2. Pelvic USS: To assess fibroids/endometrial thickness.  3. Endometrial biopsy: If USS shows thickened endometrium.  Management Plan:  1. Anaemia: Start ferrous sulfate if Hb <100, consider transfusion if symptomatic.  2. Bleeding control: Tranexamic acid initially; if ineffective, discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena coil).  3. Fibroids: If confirmed, discuss surgical (myomectomy) vs. medical (GnRH analogues) options.  4. Weight/diabetes: Refer to dietitian and weight management service.  5. Follow-up: Review USS/blood results in 2 weeks.  Patient Counselling:  - Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  - Advised on iron-rich diet and gradual weight loss benefits.  - Safety-netting: Return if bleeding worsens or syncope occurs.  Next Steps:  - Await investigations, then discuss definitive management.  ---  Second Scenario (Complex Obstetric):  Patient Details:  - Name: Ms. Sarah Smith (pseudonym)  - Age: 34  - BMI: 48  - Obstetric History: G2 P1 (1 previous caesarean for breech, 1 early miscarriage).  Presenting Complaint:  - 10/40 pregnant, severe nausea/vomiting (hyperemesis) and epigastric pain.  Examination/Management:  - USS confirmed viable intrauterine pregnancy.  - Ketones +3, dehydrated. Admitted for IV fluids, antiemetics.  - High-risk antenatal pathway due to BMI/previous caesarean.  *(Dictation ends for testing purposes. No real medical advice intended.)*"
