### Summary:  
- Age: 44  
- BMI: 44 (obese)  
- Gravida: 4, Para: 3 (2 vaginal deliveries, 1 cesarean)  
- Presenting complaints:  
  - Recurrent left-sided pelvic pain, worsening during menstruation and intercourse.  
  - Secondary infertility for 2 years despite regular unprotected intercourse.  
- PMH: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ovarian cysts (resolved), heavy menstrual bleeding.  
- Surgical history: Cesarean section (2015), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (2018).  
- Medications: Metformin, lisinopril, tranexamic acid PRN.  
- Social: Sedentary occupation, non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  
- Concerns: Anxiety about fibroids/cysts affecting fertility, surgical risks due to BMI.  

### Detailed Assessment & Advice:  
- **Recurrent Pelvic Pain**:  
  - Suspected fibroids due to enlarged uterus with irregular contour on bimanual exam.  
  - Left adnexal tenderness noted, but no palpable mass.  
  - Advised transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to evaluate fibroids and adnexae.  
  - HbA1c check due to poorly controlled diabetes potentially exacerbating symptoms.  
  - If fibroids confirmed, discuss medical vs. surgical (myomectomy/hysterectomy) options.  
  - Weight loss counseling emphasized to reduce surgical risks (referral to dietitian).  

- **Secondary Infertility**:  
  - Advised Day 3 FSH/AMH to assess ovarian reserve.  
  - Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) recommended to evaluate tubal patency (given prior cesarean).  
  - Emphasized optimizing metabolic health (tight glycemic control, weight loss).  
  - Referral to reproductive endocrinology if tests indicate diminished ovarian reserve.  

- **Patient Counseling**:  
  - Discussed increased miscarriage risk due to age and BMI.  
  - Highlighted potential pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes).  
  - Scheduled TVUS and HSG with follow-up in 4 weeks to review results.  

### Plan:  
1. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess fibroids and adnexae.  
2. HbA1c to evaluate glycemic control.  
3. Day 3 FSH/AMH for ovarian reserve assessment.  
4. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to rule out tubal blockage.  
5. Weight loss counseling and referral to dietitian.  
6. Follow-up in 4 weeks to discuss investigation results and further management.  
7. Consider referral to reproductive endocrinology if indicated.
