### Summary:  
- **Ms. X (32 years, BMI 41, G5 P3)**:  
  - Presents with 6-week history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain.  
  - 3-month history of worsening fatigue and dizziness.  
  - Past medical history: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, iron deficiency anaemia, previous gestational diabetes.  
  - Gynaecological history: Previous ovarian cystectomy, 2 Caesarean sections.  
  - Social history: Smoker (10 pack-years), occasional alcohol.  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding**:  
  - Prolonged cycles (10â€“14 days) with flooding and clots, associated with dull central pelvic pain.  
  - No post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding.  
  - Advised trial of tranexamic acid; Mirena IUD considered if endometrial biopsy normal.  

- **Anaemia**:  
  - Persistent fatigue, pale conjunctiva, poor oral iron tolerance.  
  - Advised high-dose IV iron infusion with Hb monitoring.  

- **Pelvic Pain/Structural Concerns**:  
  - Uterus bulky (~12-week size), no adnexal masses.  
  - TVUS ordered to assess fibroids/polyps; hysteroscopy + biopsy if endometrial pathology suspected.  

- **Lifestyle/Comorbidities**:  
  - Referral to dietitian/bariatric team for weight loss.  
  - Smoking cessation counselling.  
  - Counselled on pregnancy risks (obesity, diabetes, previous CS).  

### Plan:  
1. **Investigations**:  
   - FBC (anaemia), TVUS (endometrial/fibroid assessment), HbA1c (diabetes control).  
2. **Anaemia Management**:  
   - High-dose IV iron infusion; monitor Hb post-infusion.  
3. **Bleeding Management**:  
   - Trial tranexamic acid; consider Mirena IUD if biopsy normal.  
4. **Structural Evaluation**:  
   - If fibroids: discuss uterine artery embolisation vs. myomectomy.  
   - If endometrial pathology: hysteroscopy + biopsy.  
5. **Lifestyle/Follow-Up**:  
   - Dietitian/bariatric referral, smoking cessation.  
   - Review in 2 weeks with results.

### Summary:  
- **Ms. Y (32 years, BMI 41, G5 P3, 18 weeks IVF pregnancy)**:  
  - Presents with 2-day history of worsening right-sided abdominal pain and dark red spotting.  
  - Reduced fetal movements (subjective).  
  - Past obstetric history: Preterm birth, placenta praevia, cervical incompetence.  

### Detailed Issues and Advice:  
- **Abdominal Pain/Spotting**:  
  - Constant sharp right-sided pain (7/10), minimal dark red spotting.  
  - Ultrasound: viable fetus, low-lying placenta, 5 cm right adnexal cyst (likely corpus luteum).  
  - Advised MRI to characterise cyst; surgical review if pain worsens.  

- **Placental/Fetal Monitoring**:  
  - Exclude abruption/preterm labour: monitor contractions, fibronectin test if indicated.  
  - Repeat growth scan at 28 weeks (high-risk for FGR).  
  - Continue low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis.  

- **Patient Advice**:  
  - Pelvic rest, avoid heavy lifting.  
  - Immediate review if bleeding/pain worsens.  

### Plan:  
1. **Acute Concerns**:  
   - Monitor for abruption/preterm labour (contractions, fibronectin test if needed).  
2. **Adnexal Cyst**:  
   - MRI for characterisation; surgical review if pain escalates.  
3. **Placental Surveillance**:  
   - Repeat growth scan at 28 weeks.  
4. **Multidisciplinary Care**:  
   - MDT planning (obstetrics, anaesthetics, neonatology).  
5. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Growth scan in 4 weeks.
