Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding Support:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact post-birth, and early milk expression if separated. Assess feeding within the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for colostrum or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes if supplementation is needed. Avoid teats to prevent nipple confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, safe preparation instructions, and ready-made formula for medical indications. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleeping practices (cot beside bed, avoid sofa co-sleeping). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments; refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). Supplementation should be medically justified and minimal to protect breastfeeding. Parents receive individualized support for feeding choices",
