Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum does not increase cesarean rates or neonatal complications like low Apgar scores. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, document details, provide thromboprophylaxis, analgesia, and bladder care. Offer postnatal counseling for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. - **Adverse events**: Ensure duty of candour, clinical incident reporting, and supportive frameworks for families and staff. Audit compliance with RCOG standards",
