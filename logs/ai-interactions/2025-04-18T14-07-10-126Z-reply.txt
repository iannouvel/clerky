A: **Fictional Clinical Dictation – Testing Purposes Only**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: [Redacted]  
- Age: 32 years  
- Weight: 98 kg  
- BMI: 35.2 (obese class II)  
- Gravida: 4, Para: [Incomplete – to be clarified]  
- Last Menstrual Period (LMP): [Incomplete – to be clarified]  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presents with fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath on exertion for the past two weeks. She reports occasional palpitations but denies chest pain or syncope.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Symptoms began insidiously, worsening over the past two weeks.  
- No recent febrile illness or overt bleeding reported.  
- Denies melaena or haematochezia.  
- Reports heavy menstrual bleeding over the last three cycles (further quantification needed).  
- No history of recent trauma or surgery.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Iron deficiency anaemia (previously treated with oral iron, adherence unclear).  
- [Incomplete – any other medical conditions?]  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x2 (dates and indications unclear).  
- [Incomplete – any other surgeries?]  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche age 12, cycles previously regular but now heavy/prolonged.  
- No history of intermenstrual bleeding or post-coital bleeding.  
- Contraception: Currently using condoms (previous methods unclear).  
- Last cervical smear: [Incomplete – to be clarified].  

**Drug History:**  
- Oral ferrous sulfate (adherence uncertain).  
- [Incomplete – any other medications?]  

**Allergy History:**  
- NKDA (no known drug allergies).  

**Social History:**  
- Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary role).  
- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  
- Alcohol: Occasional social drinking.  
- Lives with partner and two children.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- Concerned about persistent fatigue affecting work and childcare.  
- Worried about needing a blood transfusion.  
- Expects investigation and treatment for her symptoms.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- General: Pale conjunctivae, no jaundice or lymphadenopathy.  
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic (HR 102 bpm), BP 110/70 mmHg, no murmurs.  
- Respiratory: Clear lung fields, mild tachypnoea (RR 18/min).  
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
- [Incomplete – further examination required, e.g., signs of fluid overload, neurological assessment for anaemia-related symptoms].  

**Investigations (Pending/Required):**  
- Full blood count (FBC) – likely to show anaemia.  
- Ferritin, B12, folate.  
- Coagulation screen if heavy menstrual bleeding persists.  
- Group and save/crossmatch if transfusion likely.  
- Pelvic ultrasound if fibroids/suspected structural cause of menorrhagia.  

**Management Plan (Based on GTG 2015 – Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics):**  
1. **Immediate:**  
   - If Hb <70 g/L with symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, dyspnoea), consider transfusion per obstetric guidelines.  
   - If Hb 70-100 g/L, assess for functional impairment; oral iron +/- transfusion if symptomatic.  
2. **Long-term:**  
   - Optimise iron therapy (consider IV iron if poor absorption/non-adherence).  
   - Investigate cause of menorrhagia (e.g., fibroids, coagulopathy).  
   - Lifestyle advice: Smoking cessation, dietary iron optimisation.  
3. **Follow-up:**  
   - Repeat Hb in 2 weeks.  
   - Gynaecology referral if bleeding persists.  

**Outstanding Information Needed:**  
- Full obstetric history (parity, gestational ages of prior pregnancies).  
- Detailed menstrual history (cycle length, clot passage, flooding).  
- Confirmation of adherence to iron therapy.  
- Further examination findings (e.g., signs of chronic anaemia).  

**Impression:**  
Symptomatic anaemia, likely secondary to menorrhagia, with possible iron deficiency. Requires further workup to guide transfusion need and long-term management.
