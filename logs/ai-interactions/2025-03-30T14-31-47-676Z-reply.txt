**Summary:**

- Presenting complaint: 4-month amenorrhoea, intermittent lower abdominal pain, and vaginal spotting for 1 week  
- Irregular menstrual cycles (35â€“60 days)  
- Inconsistent contraceptive use (primarily condoms)  
- Fatigue and mild dyspnoea on exertion  
- No current breast tenderness, nausea, or urinary symptoms  
- Positive urine hCG, ultrasound confirms intrauterine pregnancy (~14 weeks)  
- Hb 98 g/L (iron-deficiency anaemia), random glucose 8.2 mmol/L (elevated)  

**Details:**  
- Miss X has a history of irregular cycles and inconsistent contraception, with five prior pregnancies (three live births, one miscarriage, one termination).  
- She reports no recent unprotected intercourse but admits to occasional lapses in barrier use.  
- Obesity (BMI 54) and prior gestational diabetes increase pregnancy risks, including thromboembolism and recurrent gestational diabetes.  
- Ultrasound confirmed intrauterine pregnancy at ~14 weeks, though imaging was challenging due to adiposity.  
- Elevated random glucose (8.2 mmol/L) and anaemia (Hb 98 g/L) noted, warranting further assessment.  
- Patient expressed concerns about health impacts and family judgement; desires clarity on pregnancy status and contraception advice.  
- Pelvic examination deferred due to patient discomfort and body habitus; transabdominal ultrasound performed instead.  

**Plan:**  
1. **Pregnancy counselling:** Discuss continuation vs termination, considering high-risk factors (obesity, gestational diabetes, thromboembolism).  
2. **Referral:** Urgent specialist obstetric team referral for high-risk antenatal care.  
3. **Investigations:** Arrange early OGTT and thromboprophylaxis assessment.  
4. **Contraception:** Advise long-acting reversible contraception (e.g., implant/IUD) post-pregnancy; discuss risks of rapid repeat pregnancy.  
5. **Lifestyle:** Smoking cessation referral, dietetic input for weight optimisation.  
6. **Medications:** Commence folic acid 5mg and prophylactic LMWH pending review.  
7. **Monitoring:** Repeat Hb and glucose levels; urgent obstetric clinic follow-up.  
8. **Support:** Encourage involvement of family/support network; safety netting advice provided for red flag symptoms (e.g., PV bleeding, severe pain).
