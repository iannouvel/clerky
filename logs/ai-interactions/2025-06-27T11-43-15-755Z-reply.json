Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nWhen women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).\n\nHistory should include details on the last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed, bleeding pattern before starting HRT, pelvic pain, discharge, vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, bleeding pattern on HRT, HRT use details, application, contraceptive usage, pregnancy risk, cervical screening history, sexual history, drug interactions, malabsorption syndromes, and endometrial cancer risk factors.\n\nExamination and initial investigations should include abdominal assessment, vulvo-vaginal assessment, cervical appearance assessment, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, pregnancy test, and BMI assessment.\n\nThe document outlines major and minor risk factors affecting endometrial cancer risk in women taking HRT, as well as risk factors independent of HRT use. It also discusses the effect of HRT preparation on endometrial cancer risk and provides recommendations for different HRT regimens.\n\nContinuous combined HRT with daily progestogen is recommended for endometrial protection. Sequential/cyclical HRT should be considered in women over 50 with no unscheduled bleeding. Tricycling progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.\n\nUnopposed estrogen use in people with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Different progestogen types can provide endometrial protection, with specific recommendations for each type. The use of a levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device is also discussed for endometrial protection.\n\nIt is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about the limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium if unscheduled bleeding occurs. A change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered if new unscheduled bleeding develops at 4 years of use. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. Normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT should be understood. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is important. Clinical pathways for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed based on risk factors and time-frames.\n\nConservative management strategies can be offered for unscheduled bleeding in women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer. Adjustments to HRT can be made if bleeding persists after changes in dose or preparation. Referral for ultrasound is recommended for certain criteria, and HRT can be continued during assessment. Recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options are provided based on ultrasound findings. Endometrial assessment is also recommended for asymptomatic women with a thickened endometrium on TVS. Blind outpatient endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling are options for further assessment.\n\nMenopausal women with unscheduled bleeding may benefit from adjustments in progestogen and hysteroscopic assessment. Recommendations include reassurance and progestogen adjustments after a normal biopsy, urgent hysteroscopy for thickened endometrial tissue, and referral to gynaecology oncology for hyperplasia or cancer. Adjustments in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and non-hormonal alternatives should be considered based on endometrial histology. Progestogen type and route of HRT can impact bleeding profiles, with options such as the Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD) and transdermal preparations showing potential benefits. Recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, considering low dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial in reducing unscheduled bleeding episodes.\n\nCounsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding in perimenopausal women with sequential preparations. Consider timing and offering desogestrel or combined oral contraceptives. Adjust progestogen dose or type as needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists.\n\nStute P, Neulen J, Wildt L.

  "response": "### Analysis of Clinical Note vs. BMS Guideline on Unscheduled Bleeding on HRT\n\nThe clinical note describes a **32-year-old AFAB patient with chronic pelvic pain (CPP)**, a history of endometriosis, and prior COCP use (discontinued due to migraine with aura). However, the **BMS guideline focuses on managing unscheduled bleeding in patients on HRT**, which does not directly apply to this case since:\n1. The patient is **not currently on HRT** (discontinued COCP in 2022).\n2. The primary complaint is **chronic pelvic pain**, not unscheduled bleeding.\n\nThus, **most recommendations in the BMS guideline are not directly relevant**. However, some general principles can be considered:\n\n---\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Clarify if the patient has any unscheduled bleeding episodes** (even if not on HRT)  \nReason: While the patient is not on HRT, the guideline emphasizes assessing bleeding patterns in women with pelvic pain to rule out endometrial pathology.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - **If considering future HRT (e.g., for endometriosis management), counsel on bleeding risks and progestogen options**  \nReason: The guideline highlights the importance of progestogen selection (e.g., LNG-IUD) for endometrial protection if HRT is reintroduced.  \n\n---\n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Different management plan** - **If HRT is restarted (e.g., POP/Mirena), document a plan for managing unscheduled bleeding**  \nReason: The guideline recommends monitoring and adjusting HRT if bleeding occurs.  \n\n---\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Document BMI and smoking status more prominently if HRT is reconsidered**  \nReason: The guideline lists these as minor risk factors for endometrial cancer with HRT use.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nThe **BMS guideline is not directly applicable** to this case, as the patient is not on HRT and the primary issue is CPP. However, if HRT is reintroduced (e.g., for endometriosis), the guideline’s recommendations on bleeding management and progestogen selection become relevant.  \n\n**Key Missing Element:** The note does not mention unscheduled bleeding, which is the focus of the BMS guideline. If such bleeding were present, further investigations (e.g., TVS, endometrial biopsy) per the guideline would be warranted.  \n\n**Final Note:** This clinical note aligns well with general gynecological practice for CPP but does not intersect significantly with the BMS HRT bleeding guideline.",

Progestogen type and route of HRT can impact bleeding profiles, with options such as the Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD) and transdermal preparations showing potential benefits. Recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, considering low dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial in reducing unscheduled bleeding episodes.\\n\\nCounsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding in perimenopausal women with sequential preparations. Consider timing and offering desogestrel or combined oral contraceptives. Adjust progestogen dose or type as needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists.\\n\\nStute P, Neulen J, Wildt L.

Your task is to analyze if the given clinical note follows the specified guideline and suggest improvements.\",\n  \"guideline_id\": \"bms-2024-management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-on-hrt-pdf\",\n  \"guideline_title\": \"BMS - 2024 - Management of unscheduled bleeding on HRT.pdf\"\n}\n\nA: ### Analysis of Clinical Note vs. BMS Guideline on Unscheduled Bleeding on HRT\n\nThe clinical note describes a **32-year-old AFAB patient with chronic pelvic pain (CPP)**, a history of endometriosis, and prior COCP use (discontinued due to migraine with aura). However, the **BMS guideline focuses on managing unscheduled bleeding in patients on HRT**, which does not directly apply to this case since:\n1. The patient is **not currently on HRT** (discontinued COCP in 2022).\n2. The primary complaint is **chronic pelvic pain**, not unscheduled bleeding.\n\nThus, **most recommendations in the BMS guideline are not directly relevant**. However, some general principles can be considered:\n\n---\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Clarify if the patient has any unscheduled bleeding episodes** (even if not on HRT)  \nReason: While the patient is not on HRT, the guideline emphasizes assessing bleeding patterns in women with pelvic pain to rule out endometrial pathology.  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - **If considering future HRT (e.g., for endometriosis management), counsel on bleeding risks and progestogen options**  \nReason: The guideline highlights the importance of progestogen selection (e.g., LNG-IUD) for endometrial protection if HRT is reintroduced.  \n\n---\n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Different management plan** - **If HRT is restarted (e.g., POP/Mirena), document a plan for managing unscheduled bleeding**  \nReason: The guideline recommends monitoring and adjusting HRT if bleeding occurs.  \n\n---\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Document BMI and smoking status more prominently if HRT is reconsidered**  \nReason: The guideline lists these as minor risk factors for endometrial cancer with HRT use.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nThe **BMS guideline is not directly applicable** to this case, as the patient is not on HRT and the primary issue is CPP. However, if HRT is reintroduced (e.g., for endometriosis), the guideline’s recommendations on bleeding management and progestogen selection become relevant.  \n\n**Key Missing Element:** The note does not mention unscheduled bleeding, which is the focus of the BMS guideline. If such bleeding were present, further investigations (e.g., TVS, endometrial biopsy) per the guideline would be warranted.  \n\n**Final Note:** This clinical note aligns well with general gynecological practice for CPP but does not intersect significantly with the BMS HRT bleeding guideline.\n\n--- Token Usage Report ---\nPrompt tokens: 4179\nCompletion tokens: 527\nTotal tokens: 4706\nEstimated cost: $0.002353",
