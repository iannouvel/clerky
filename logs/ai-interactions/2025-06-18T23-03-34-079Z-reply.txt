      "newValue": "**Summary of Maternity Telephone Triage SOP:** This guideline standardizes telephone triage for maternity care at UH Sussex SRH & WH, ensuring consistent, safe, and efficient service. Midwives and medical staff must follow the SOP, using professional judgment. Calls are triaged via NetCall or diverted to the labor ward. Assessments at referral determine care pathways, with all advice documented on MIS. Patients should be advised to attend after the third call unless concerns resolve. Escalation pathways address patient concerns. Appendices include a triage assessment card and care pathways for specific issues. Key focus: quality, safety, and patient satisfaction.
