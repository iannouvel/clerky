**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Ms. Jane Doe (pseudonym for testing purposes)  
- **Age:** 34 years  
- **Weight:** 125 kg  
- **BMI:** 48 (morbidly obese)  
- **Ethnicity:** White British  
- **Occupation:** Office administrator  

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-week history of irregular heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and intermittent pelvic pain. She also reports a 3-month history of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion.  

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
- Menstrual cycles previously regular (28-day cycle) but now prolonged (7–14 days) with flooding and clots.  
- Pelvic pain is dull, intermittent, and radiates to the lower back. No dyspareunia.  
- Fatigue is significant, impacting work. Denies syncope but reports light-headedness.  
- No post-coital bleeding or discharge.  
- LMP: 2 weeks ago (ongoing spotting).  

**Obstetric History:**  
- G2 P2 (2 prior vaginal deliveries, no complications).  
- Last delivery: 5 years ago.  
- No history of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago, on metformin).  
- Hypertension (on lisinopril).  
- Depression (on sertraline, stable).  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Appendectomy (age 20).  
- No prior gynaecological surgery.  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Regular cervical screening (last smear 1 year ago, normal).  
- No history of STIs.  
- No use of hormonal contraception (condoms only).  

**Drug History:**  
- Metformin 500mg BD.  
- Lisinopril 10mg OD.  
- Sertraline 50mg OD.  
- No NSAIDs or anticoagulants.  

**Allergies:**  
- Penicillin (rash).  

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker.  
- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  
- Lives with partner and two children.  
- Sedentary job, minimal exercise due to fatigue/joint pain.  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
- **Ideas:** Worried about "fibroids or cancer" due to bleeding.  
- **Concerns:** Anxiety about needing surgery.  
- **Expectations:** Wants investigation and treatment to improve quality of life.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **General:** Pale conjunctiva (possible anaemia), obese.  
- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  
- **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, minimal fresh bleeding.  
- **Bimanual:** Uterus enlarged (~12-week size), irregular contour (suggestive of fibroids), no adnexal tenderness.  

**Investigations Requested:**  
1. **Bloods:** FBC (anaemia likely), HbA1c, LFTs, clotting.  
2. **Pelvic USS:** To assess fibroids/endometrial thickness.  
3. **Endometrial biopsy:** If USS shows thickened endometrium.  

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Anaemia:** Start ferrous sulfate if Hb <100, consider transfusion if symptomatic.  
2. **Bleeding control:** Tranexamic acid initially; if ineffective, discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena coil).  
3. **Fibroids:** If confirmed, discuss surgical (myomectomy) vs. medical (GnRH analogues) options.  
4. **Weight/diabetes:** Refer to dietitian and weight management service.  
5. **Follow-up:** Review USS/blood results in 2 weeks.  

**Patient Counselling:**  
- Reassured that cancer is unlikely but requires exclusion.  
- Advised on iron-rich diet and gradual weight loss benefits.  
- Safety-netting: Return if bleeding worsens or syncope occurs.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Await investigations, then discuss definitive management.
