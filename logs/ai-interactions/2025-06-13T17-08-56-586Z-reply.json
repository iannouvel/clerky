She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.\nRelevant Obstetric History:\nPrevious pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.\n\n\nNo history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.\n\n\nNo history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.\n\n\nRelevant Medical History:\nMild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).\n\n\nNo known liver or gallbladder disease.\n\n\nMedications & Allergies:\nCurrently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband and toddler son.\n\n\nNon-smoker; does not consume alcohol.\n\n\nWorks part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.\n\n\nExamination Findings:\nGeneral: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.\n\n\nAbdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.\n\n\nTwins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.\n\n\nNo uterine tenderness or signs of labour.\n\n\nNo peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.\n\n\nNotable Omissions (for testing purposes):\nNo documented baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods.\n\n\nNo record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.\n\n\nNo documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nImpression:\n Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.\nManagement Plan:\nInvestigations:\n\n\nSerum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.\n\n\nFasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.\n\n\nFull blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).\n\n\nCTG to assess fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nGrowth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers if not done in past 2 weeks.\n\n\nMedical Management:\n\n\nStart ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg BID while awaiting results.\n\n\nConsider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.\n\n\nOngoing Care and Delivery Planning:\n\n\nWeekly bile acids and LFTs.\n\n\nIncrease surveillance: twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans.\n\n\nAim for delivery at 36–37 weeks if bile acids <100 µmol/L.\n\n\nConsider earlier delivery if bile acids ≥100 µmol/L or evidence of fetal compromise.\n\n\nCounseling Provided:\n\n\nDiscussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.\n\n\nReassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.\n\n\nAdvised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.\n\n\nProvided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.\n\n\nDictated by: Dr. [Fictional Name] Patel\n Date: [Fictional Date]\n--Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real patient data or medical advice is contained herein.\n\n\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Different management plan** - The guideline states that \"Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP,\" yet the management plan includes twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans. These should be reconsidered unless there are other indications.  \n   Reason: The guideline explicitly states that these monitoring methods do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - The guideline recommends against routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for adverse perinatal outcomes, yet the note includes starting UDCA 500 mg BID. The use of UDCA should be justified if prescribed for symptom relief only.  \n   Reason: The guideline states, \"Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP\" (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - The counseling should explicitly mention that ultrasound and CTG do not prevent stillbirth, and emphasize the importance of fetal movement monitoring.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights that fetal movement monitoring is more relevant than CTG or ultrasound for stillbirth prevention in ICP (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - The guideline recommends postnatal confirmation of ICP resolution with LFTs at least 4 weeks postpartum, but this is not mentioned in the note.  \n   Reason: The guideline states, \"Postnatal resolution of ICP should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after birth\" (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - The guideline suggests considering vitamin K only if steatorrhea or abnormal coagulation is present, but the note does not assess for these.  \n   Reason: The guideline states, \"routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms such as steatorrhoea are present\" (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - The counseling should include information about the increased risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, as well as long-term hepatobiliary risks.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that women with ICP have a higher chance of these conditions (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - The guideline suggests baseline LFTs and bile acids in subsequent pregnancies, but the note does not mention counseling the patient about this for future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends baseline testing in subsequent pregnancies (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - The counseling could include information about the increased recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - The guideline mentions that specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe or atypical cases, but the note does not explicitly state whether this was considered (though the case appears uncomplicated).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends specialist input for severe/atypical cases (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - The counseling could include links to ICP support groups (e.g., ICP Support and RCOG).  \n   Reason: The guideline lists these as useful resources (bjog-2022-girling-intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\nThese recommendations aim to align the clinical note more closely with the latest evidence-based guidelines for ICP management.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 53 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
