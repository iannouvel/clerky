You are provided with the text of a clinical note from a patient encounter and a set of clinical guidelines. Your task is to:

1. Cross-check the clinical note against each provided guideline:
2. Identify areas in the clinical note that do not fully adhere to the guideline recommendations.
3. Note any parts of the note that could be improved based on the guidelines.
Include the full text of each guideline in your response:
4. For every guideline you reference, include its complete text.
5. Next to each suggested change, provide a short reference to the guideline (e.g., the guideline's name or identifier).
6. Return the clinical note as HTML-formatted code:

The clinical note should be output as valid HTML.
Any text in the clinical note that has been adjusted or needs adjustment (in light of the guidelines) should be wrapped in <i></i> tags (to display in italics).
Ensure that the guideline reference appears immediately following the italicized adjustment for clarity.
Your final output should therefore contain:
The complete text of each guideline used, with clear references.
The HTML-formatted clinical note where adjustments appear in italics with the respective guideline reference.

For example, in the following clinical note text:

Further investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted.

Perform pelvic exam to assess reproductive organs.

Collaborate to determine the most appropriate management approach.

An adjustement in light of this guideline (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline - https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng73) would be to this sentence
Further investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted. A family history of endometriosis would make the diagnosis more likely (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline)
