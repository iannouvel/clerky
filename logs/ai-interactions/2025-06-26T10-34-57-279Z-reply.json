Pregnancy has been closely monitored with fortnightly scans. Recent growth scans show developing growth discordance between twins - Twin A estimated 1.8kg (50th centile), Twin B estimated 1.4kg (10th centile), representing 22% weight difference. She presented today with regular uterine contractions every 4-5 minutes for past 3 hours, accompanied by lower back ache and pelvic pressure. No bleeding, no rupture of membranes, both babies moving well. Previous antenatal care has been uncomplicated apart from gestational diabetes diagnosed at 26 weeks, well controlled with diet. She works as a teacher, supportive partner, anxious about early delivery.\n\nASSESSMENT: Maternal vital signs stable: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, temp 36.8°C. Abdomen shows regular contractions palpable every 4-5 minutes, both twins in longitudinal lie, Twin A cephalic presentation, Twin B breech. CTG monitoring shows both twins with reassuring patterns - Twin A baseline 140 bpm, Twin B baseline 155 bpm, both with good variability. Cervical assessment reveals 3cm dilatation, 60% effacement, soft consistency. Ultrasound confirms presentations and estimated fetal weights as above. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome excluded - both twins have adequate liquor volume. Bloods normal including FBC and inflammatory markers.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Preterm labor in twin pregnancy with growth discordance requiring immediate management. Tocolysis with nifedipine commenced to delay delivery. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) administered for fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate given for neuroprotection. Pediatric team alerted for twin delivery. Anesthetic consultation for potential operative delivery. Given growth discordance, immediate delivery not indicated unless fetal compromise develops. Plan for cesarean section if further cervical change or if Twin B becomes compromised. Continuous monitoring of both twins. Growth discordance investigation post-delivery to exclude underlying causes.\n\nGuideline:\n[ID] cg1126-multiple-pregnancy-and-birth-pdf\nTitle: CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth\nContent: CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 1 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nMultiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline \nSummary statement: How does the document \nsupport patient care? \nBy the provision of good practice evidence based \nguidelines for all staff involved in the antenatal and \nintrapartum care of pregnant women/people with a \nmultiple pregnancy \nStaff/stakeholders involved in development: \n \nObstetric Consultants, Senior Midwives, Joint Obstetric \nGuidelines Group Members \nDivision: \nWomen and Children’s \nDepartment: \nMaternity \nResponsible Person: \nChief of Service \nAuthor: \nObstetric Consultant, maternity team \nFor use by: \nMedical, Obstetric and Midwifery staff \nPurpose: \nTo provide high quality, evidence based care for \npregnant women/people a with multiple pregnancy \nThis document supports: \n \nRCOG (2016) Green-top guideline 51 \nNICE (2019) Caesarean Section \nNICE (2019) NG137 Twin and Triplet Pregnancy \nKey related documents: \nAntenatal and labour risk assessments. \nUH Sussex (SRH&WH) Maternity Guidelines: \nAntenatal Care and Patient Information, Induction of \nLabour, Antenatal Screening Tests, Fetal Fibronectin, \nAntepartum Haemorrhage, Hypertensive Disorders of \nPregnancy \nApproved by: \nJoint Obstetric Guidelines Group \nApproval date: \n15\nth\n June 2022 Date uploaded: 11\nth\n July 2022 \nRatified by Board of Directors/ Committee of the \nBoard of Directors \nNot Applicable- Divisional Ratification only required \nRatification Date: \nNot Applicable- Divisional Ratification only required \nExpiry Date: \nMarch 2024 \nReview date: \nSeptember 2023 \nIf you require this document in another format such as Braille, large print, audio or \nanother language please contact the Trusts Communications Team \nReference Number: \nCG1126 \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 2 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nVersion Date Author Status Comment \n1.0 January 2011 Obstetric Consultants Archived New Trustwide guideline \n2.0 February 2011 CNST Lead Midwife Archived Administrative update \n3.0 May 2012 Antenatal Clinic \nmanager and Fetal \nMedicine Consultant \nArchived Guideline updated to include \nNICE 2011 recommendations \n3.1 January 2014 Obstetric Consultant Archived 3 Year review-minor update to \nclarify care pathway \n Guideline given an extension \nuntil February 2017 whilst still \nunder review. \n4.0 Oct 2017 Obstetric Consultant Archived 3 year review – minor \namendment to pain relief \n5 August 2018 Obstetric Consultant Archived MCDA antenatal schedule \nupdated in line with RCOG \nguidance \n6.0 March 2021 Clinical Effectiveness \nSupport Midwife (J. \nCollard) with Twins \nWorking Party cross-\nsite \nArchived Guideline updated in line with \nNICE NG137 Twin and Triplet \nPregnancy 2019 \nMBRRACE-UK 2021 \n6.1 May 2022 R.

Hospitals Sussex (SRH&WH NHS Foundation Trust. \n \n2.0 Scope \n \n Obstetricians \n Midwives \n Ultrasonographers \n Anaesthetists \n \n3.0 Responsibilities \n \nMidwives & obstetricians are expected: \n \n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. \n To use their professional judgement in the application of this guideline. \n \nManagement teams are expected: \n \n To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and \nNational Recommendations. \n To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff. \n \n4.0 Introduction \n \nMultiple pregnancies are reported in 15.4 per 1000 births in the United Kingdom in 2018. \nThis is the third annual decline in multiple births from 16.1 per 1000 births in 2015 (Office for \nNational Statistics 2018). \n \nTwin and higher order multiple pregnancies are associated with increased risk of maternal \nand fetal complications: \n \n Complications for pregnant women/people include hyperemesis, anaemia, \nhypertensive disorders (PIH, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia), APH, increased risk of \noperative deliveries including caesarean section and postpartum haemorrhage. \n Fetal complications include first and second trimester pregnancy loss, prematurity \ndue to preterm birth, growth restriction, fetal death (one or both twins), neurological \nimpairment, increased risk of congenital anomalies. \n \nRCOG Study Group recommends that single embryo transfer should be considered in \nassisted conception and parents of high order multiple pregnancies (≥ 3) should be \ncounselled and offered multi-fetal pregnancy reduction to twins in specialist centres. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 6 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nIn addition monochorionic twins (constituting a third of all twin pregnancies) are associated \nwith a risk (10-15%) of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. \n \nFurthermore monochorionic monoamniotic twins are associated with the risk of cord \nentanglement which is further associated with increased perinatal mortality. \n \n5.0 Definitions \n \n A monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancy is one in which both babies are \ndependent on a single, shared placenta. \n A dichorionic pregnancy is where the babies are supported by separate \nplacentae. \n Monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy is where the babies are in a single \namniotic sac and are dependent on a single placenta. \n Dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy is where the babies are in separate amniotic \nsacs and are supported by separate placentae. \n Conjoined twins are twins whose body parts are joined up with each other due \nvarying degrees of incomplete separation. \n Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) only occurs in monochorionic \nmonozygotic twins (identical) and is the result of transfusion of blood from one fetal \ntwin to another twin. \n \n5.1 Abbreviations used within this guideline \n \nPIH - Pregnancy Induced Hypertension APH - Antepartum Haemorrhage \nMC - monochorionic TTTS - Twin to twin transfusion syndrome

Pregnancy Associated \nPlasma Protein \n\n6.0 Diagnosis and determination of chorionicity & amnionicity \n \n The diagnosis of a multiple pregnancy is usually made at the time of the dating \nscan in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some pregnant women/people may have \nthis identified at viability scans in Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic (EPAC) or \non routine scans after assisted conception. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 7 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Estimate gestational age should be from the largest baby in a twin or triplet \npregnancy to avoid the risk of estimating it from a baby with early growth \npathology. \n Assign nomenclature to babies (for example, upper and lower, or left and right) in a \ntwin or triplet pregnancy, and document this clearly in the pregnant \nwoman/person’s notes to ensure consistency throughout pregnancy. \n \n6.1 Ascertaining the chorionicity: \n \n Presence of a thick intertwin septum with detection of a “lambda sign” is indicative \nof dichorionic pregnancy, whereas a thin septum with single continuous placental \nmass is observed in monochorionic pregnancies. \n If there is doubt in the diagnosis of chorionicity, the pregnant woman/person \nshould be referred to a specialist without delay, as chorionicity is best determined \nbefore 14 weeks. \n If it is difficult to determine chorionicity, even after referral (for example, because \nthe pregnant woman/person has booked late in pregnancy), manage the \npregnancy as a monochorionic pregnancy until proved otherwise. \n If a pregnant woman/person with a twin or triplet pregnancy presents after 14+0 \nweeks, determine chorionicity and amnionicity at the earliest opportunity by \nultrasound using all of the following: \n- The number of placental masses. \n- The presence of amniotic membrane(s) and membrane thickness. \n- The lambda or T-sign. \n- Discordant fetal sex. \n A photographic record should be retained, in the case notes, of the ultrasound \nappearances of the membrane attachment to the placenta. \n Separate placentae and discordant genitalia are also signs of dichorionicity, \nparticularly in the mid-trimester. \n \n7.0 Antenatal care \n \nPregnant women/people with a multiple pregnancy must be offered consultant led care, and \ngiven information specific to twin and triplet pregnancies at their first contact after diagnosis. \n \nAntenatal clinical care for pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy should be \nprovided by a nominated multidisciplinary team consisting of: \n \n• A core team of named specialist obstetricians, specialist midwives and \nsonographers, all of whom have experience and knowledge of managing twin and \ntriplet pregnancies. \n \n• An enhanced team for referrals, which should include: \n- A perinatal mental health professional \n- A women’s health physiotherapist \n- An infant feeding specialist \n- A dietitian. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 8 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \nHowever do not routinely refer all pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy to \nthe enhanced team but base the decision to refer on each pregnant woman/person’s needs. \n \nInformation should be given on antenatal nutrition, anaemia, support groups, parent \neducation, breastfeeding, antenatal and postnatal mental health, and signs and symptoms of \npreterm labour. \n \nAlthough the majority their appointments will be at the Twins Clinic, the community midwife \nshould also offer separate appointments. How frequently they attend the community midwife \nappointments can be discussed with the midwife and scheduled to suit their individual \ncircumstances. \n \n7.1 Planning for birth \n \nAll discussions should involve the pregnant woman/person with the multiple pregnancy and \ntheir family or carers if appropriate. \n \nPregnant women/people should be given information on the risks and benefits of different \nmodes of birth to support them in planning their birth. This information is included on the \nMultiple Birth Care Pathway (Appendix 5) which is placed in the antenatal handheld record \nfor the pregnant woman/person to access during their pregnancy. \n \nFollowing discussion, the agreed planned place, timing and mode of birth should be \ndocumented in the health record, preferably on the Multiple Pregnancy Care Pathway. \n \n From 24 weeks in a twin or triplet pregnancy, discuss with the pregnant \nwoman/person (and her family members or carers, as appropriate) their plans and \nwishes for the birth of their babies. \n Provide information that is tailored to each pregnant woman/person’s pregnancy, \ntaking into account their needs and preferences. Revisit these conversations \nwhenever clinically indicated and whenever they want to. \n Ensure the following has been discussed (appendix 6) and documented by 28 \nweeks at the latest: \n- Place of birth and the possible need to transfer in case of preterm birth. \n- Timing and possible modes of birth. \n- Analgesia during labour: offer an epidural to pregnant women/people with a \ntwin or triplet pregnancy who choose to have a vaginal birth. Explain that \nthis is likely to improve the chance of success and optimal timing of \nassisted vaginal birth of all the babies and enables a quicker birth by \nemergency caesarean section if needed. \n- Analgesia during caesarean birth: Offer regional anaesthesia to pregnant \nwomen/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy that are having a caesarean \nsection. \n- Management of the third stage of labour and postpartum haemorrhage. \n(see section 12.3) \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 9 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n At 28 weeks intrapartum fetal heart monitoring should be discussed and \ndocumented. It should be explained that: \n- Recommendations on cardiotocography(CTG) are based on evidence from \npregnant women/people with a singleton pregnancy because there is a lack \nof evidence specific to twin pregnancy or preterm babies. \n- It allows simultaneous monitoring of both babies. \n- It might restrict their mobility. \n- Normal traces show the babies are coping well with labour; if traces are not \nnormal, there will be less certainty about the babies’ condition. \n- It is normal to see changes to the fetal heart rate pattern during labour and \nthis does not necessarily mean there is a problem. \n- Findings from the CTG are used to help make decisions during labour and \nbirth, but these will also be based on her wishes, their condition and that of \ntheir babies. \n \nPregnant women/people with multiple pregnancies should have the following discussed: \n Spontaneous preterm birth and planned preterm birth are associated with an \nincreased risk of admission to a neonatal unit. \n About 60 in 100 twin pregnancies result in spontaneous birth before 37 weeks. \n 75 in 100 triplet pregnancies result in spontaneous birth before 35 weeks. \n \nFor an uncomplicated multiple pregnancy, discuss and offer planned birth as follows, after a \ncourse of antenatal corticosteroids has been considered. The risks and benefits of \ncorticosteroids should be discussed and this discussion documented in line with the RCOG \ninfographic in the CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway. \n \nThe timing of birth should be individualised in each pregnancy and include considerations of \nsafety such as avoiding induction at weekends, aiming for birth of: \n \nDichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: \n Planned birth from 37+0 weeks does not appear to be associated with an \nincreased risk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 37+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \n Aim for birth of dichorionic diamniotic twins at 37 weeks. \n \nMonochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: \n Planned birth from 36 weeks does not appear to be associated with an increased \nrisk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 36+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \n Aim for birth of monochorionic diamniotic twins at 36 weeks. \n \nMonochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy: \n Planned birth between 32+0 and 33+6 weeks does not appear to be associated \nwith an increased risk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \n Their babies will usually need to be admitted to the neonatal unit and have an \nincreased risk of respiratory problems. \n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 33+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 10 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Aim for birth of monochorionic monoamniotic twins between \n32+0 and 33+6 weeks. \n \nTrichorionic triamniotic or dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies: \n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 35+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \n Aim for birth of trichorionic triamniotic or dichorionic triamniotic triplet at \n35 weeks. \n \nMonochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy or a triplet pregnancy that involves a \nshared amnion: \n Timing of birth will be decided and discussed with each pregnant woman/person \nindividually. \n \nIn twin pregnancy induction of labour would be advised as for singleton pregnancy (refer to \nInduction of Labour Guideline provided that the first twin is cephalic and no other risk factors \nare present. \n \nInform paediatric consultant of planned birth date for triplet pregnancies in order that \nresources and equipment can be organised. \n \nFor Pregnant women/people who decline planned birth at the recommended timing, offer \nweekly appointments with the specialist obstetrician. At each appointment, offer an \nultrasound scan and perform assessments of amniotic fluid level and Doppler of the umbilical \nartery flow for each baby in addition to fortnightly fetal growth scans. They should be made \naware that this enhanced surveillance cannot guarantee against a poor outcome. \n \n7.2 Screening, scans and antenatal appointments \n \n Booking bloods: blood group and antibody, screening for infections e.g. Hepatitis \nB, rubella immunity, HIV, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria etc. should be \nperformed as for all other pregnant women/people. \n Be aware of higher incidence of anaemia; consider the need for iron \nsupplementation. \n Pregnant women/people should be counselled before screening by appropriately \ntrained personnel regarding the implications of high risk results and antenatal \ndiagnosis in multiple pregnancies. \n Scan at 10-13 weeks gestation for viability, accurate dating, chorionicity, major \ncongenital malformation and nuchal translucency. \n Screening for Down’s syndrome: First trimester combined test (nuchal \ntranslucency (NT) scan with serum screening) can be offered to women/people \nwith twin pregnancies that opt for screening. For triplets and higher order multiple \npregnancies the screening is offered with NT and maternal age only (FASP 2019). \n Refer pregnant women/people with a dichorionic and monochorionic triplet \npregnancy who want to have screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome \nand Patau’s syndrome, to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 11 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n All triplet pregnancies should be referred to internal fetal medicine at point of \ndiagnosis. If not available then they should be referred to tertiary service directly at \nthe earliest opportunity. \n Pregnant women/people with a triplet pregnancy should be given information \nabout: \n- The greater likelihood of Down's syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and \nPatau’s syndrome in triplet pregnancy. \n- The different options for screening. \n- The increased false positive rate of screening tests in triplet pregnancy. \n- Their greater likelihood of being offered invasive test and higher chance of \ncomplications of invasive testing. \n- The physical risks and psychological implications in the short and long term \nrelating to selective fetal reduction. \n Anomaly ultrasound at 20/40 with extended views of the heart for monochorionic \ntwins and triplets. \n Full blood count should be performed at 20 weeks and at 28 weeks. \n Anaesthetic and paediatric antenatal appointments should be organised as \nnecessary on an individual basis. \n \n7.3 Monochorionic diamniotic twins (appendix 1) \n \nMonochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies should have 11 antenatal appointments \nscheduled with a healthcare professional from the core team. At least 2 of these \nappointments should be with the specialist obstetrician. \n \n7.4 Dichorionic diamniotic twins (appendix 2) \n \nDichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies 8 antenatal appointments scheduled with a \nhealthcare professional from the core team. At least 2 of these appointments should be with \nthe specialist obstetrician. \n \n7.5 Triamniotic triplet pregnancy – trichorionic, diachorionic or monochorionic \n(appendix 3) \n \nThese pregnancies should have 9 antenatal appointments scheduled with a healthcare \nprofessional from the core team. At least 2 of these appointments should be with the \nspecialist obstetrician. \n \n7.6 Dichorionic triamniotic or monochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies \n(appendix 4) \n \nThese pregnancies should have 11 antenatal appointments scheduled with a healthcare \nprofessional from the core team.

Monitoring with ultrasound must be targeted to assess all these \nparameters. Umbilical artery Dopplers from 24 weeks. \n Screening for fetal growth restriction or Twin-To-Twin Transfusion Syndrome \n(TTTS) should not be offered in the first trimester. \n Offer diagnostic monitoring for TTTS to women with a monochorionic twin or triplet \npregnancy. Monitor with ultrasound every 14 days from 16 weeks until birth. \n Explain that the relative likelihood of each complication changes with advancing \ngestation but that they can all occur at any gestational age. \n Offer pregnant women/people simultaneous monitoring for TTTS, fetal growth \nrestriction and advanced-stage twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS) at \nevery ultrasound. \n Offer weekly ultrasound monitoring for TAPS from 16 weeks of pregnancy using \nmiddle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) to Pregnant \nwomen/people whose pregnancies are complicated by: \n- Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome that has been treated by fetoscopic laser \ntherapy or \n- Selective fetal growth restriction (defined by an EFW discordance of 25% or \nmore and an EFW of any of the babies below the 10th centile for \ngestational age). \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 14 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Measure the DVP depths of amniotic fluid on either side of the amniotic \nmembrane. \n Increase the frequency of diagnostic monitoring in the second and third trimester to \nat least weekly if there are concerns about differences between the babies' \namniotic fluid level (a difference in DVP depth of 4 cm or more). Include Doppler \nassessment of the umbilical artery flow for each baby. \n For pregnant women/people with a monochorionic pregnancy showing any of the \nfollowing: \n- Cardiovascular compromise (such as fetal hydrops or cardiomegaly) or \n- Unexplained isolated polyhydramnios or \n- Abnormal umbilical artery. \nPerform ultrasound MCA PSV measurements to help detect advanced-stage TAPS, \nand seek management advice immediately from a tertiary level fetal medicine \nspecialist. \n \nWhere TTTS is diagnosed early referral to the regional tertiary centre or the fetal \nmedicine specialist is indicated. \n \n Refer the pregnant women/people to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre if TTTS \nis diagnosed, based on the following: \n- The amniotic sac of 1 baby has a DVP depth of less than 2 cm and \n- The amniotic sac of another baby has a DVP depth of: \nOover 8 cm before 20+0 weeks of pregnancy or \no Over 10 cm from 20+0 weeks. \n Further assessment and monitoring by the woman’s named Consultant is \nindicated if: \n- The amniotic sac of 1 baby has a DVP depth in the normal range and \n- The amniotic sac of another baby has a DVP depth of: \no Less than 2 cm or \no 8 cm or more. \n \n 10.1 Quintero Classification of TTTS \n \nStage I There is a discrepancy in amniotic fluid volume with oligohydramnios of a \nmaximum vertical pocket (MVP) ≤ 2 cm in one sac and polyhydramnios in \nother sac (MVP ≥ 8 cm). The bladder of the donor twin is visible and \nDoppler studies are normal. \nStage II The bladder of the donor twin is not visible (during length of examination, \nusually around 1 hour) but Doppler studies are not critically abnormal. \nStage III Doppler studies are critically abnormal in either twin and are characterised \nas abnormal or reversed end-diastolic velocities in the umbilical artery, \nreverse flow in the Ductus venosus or pulsatile umbilical venous flow. \nStage IV Ascites, pericardial or pleural effusion, scalp oedema or overt hydrops \npresent. \nStage V One or both babies are dead. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 15 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n \n10.2 Management of confirmed TTTS \n \n Where TTTS is diagnosed at gestations below 26 weeks, fetoscopic laser ablation \nis the intervention of choice. \n Anastomoses may be missed at laser ablation and TTTS can recur later in up to \n14% of pregnancies treated by laser ablation. Thus surveillance should continue. \n Laser ablation can be performed in mono- and dichorionic triplet pregnancies. \n Some pregnant women/people request termination of pregnancy when severe \nTTTS is diagnosed and this should be discussed as an option. \n Another option is to offer selective termination of pregnancy using bipolar \ndiathermy of one of the umbilical cords, with inevitable sacrifice of that baby. This \nmay be appropriate if there is severe hydrops fetalis in the recipient or evidence of \ncerebral damage in either twin. \n \n11.0 Single fetal demise in multiple pregnancy \n \nWhen counselling those pregnant women/people who have suffered from a twin demise, it is \nimportant to use the same statistics on each site. The timing of fetal demise does not affect \nthe incidence of neurodevelopmental delay, co-twin death or preterm birth in the surviving \ntwin but is different between MCDA and DCDA sets. Fetal brain imaging using MRI is offered \nto the surviving twin in MCDA sets. \n \nOutcome for survivor twin following co-twin demise in 2\nnd\n & 3\nrd\n trimesters: \n MCDA DCDA \nDeath of survivor twin \n15% 3% \nPreterm birth \n68% 54% \nNeurodevelopmental delay \n26% 2% \nHillman et al Obstet Gynecol 2011;118:928-40 \n \n When a twin is lost during the first trimester there is no influence on the outcome of \nthe pregnancy. \n Where the fetal demise occurs after 12 weeks, the continuing pregnancy should \ncontinue to be treated as a multiple pregnancy (i.e. scan and appointment \nschedules). \n Even though there is risk to the surviving twin rapid birth is usually unwise unless \nlater in pregnancy (>37 weeks)/CTG abnormality/abnormal MCA Doppler. \n \n12.0 Further complications of multiple pregnancy \n \n12.1 Hypertension and pre-eclampsia \n \nAdvise pregnant women/people that they should take Aspirin 150mg with food at night from \n12 weeks until 36 weeks or birth if before 36 weeks they have any of the following additional \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 16 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nmoderate risk factors for hypertension as multiple pregnancy compounds the risk of \nhypertension. \n First Pregnancy. \n Age 40 or over. \n Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years. \n BMI of 35 or over at first visit. \n Family history of pre-eclampsia. \n \nAdditional moderate risk factors for recommending aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care \nBundle: \n Assisted conception (IVF/ IUI). \n Current smoker. \n \nHigh risk factors for hypertension are: \n Chronic hypertension. \n Previous hypertensive disease during pregnancy – gestational hypertension and \npre-eclampsia. \n Chronic kidney disease. \n Autoimmune disease ie lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome. \n Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. \n \nAdditional high risk factors for recommending aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care \nBundle: \n Low Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein (PAPP-A) screening blood test. \n Previous Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) - either birth weight <2.5kg over \n37 week’s gestation or <10th centile). \n Previous stillbirth. \n \nFor GP letter to prescribe aspirin prophylaxis see Appendix 3 of CG1198 Management of \nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy. \n \nMeasure blood pressure and test urine for proteinuria to screen for hypertensive disorders at \neach antenatal appointment in a twin and triplet pregnancy. \n \n12.2 Screening for preterm labour \n \n Explain to pregnant women/people and their family members or carers (as \nappropriate) that: \n- They have a higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth than women with a \nsingleton pregnancy. \n- This risk is further increased if they have other risk factors, such as a \nspontaneous preterm birth in a previous pregnancy. \n- They should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of preterm labour \nand to call Triage if they experience any of these symptoms. \n They should be informed of the benefit of targeted corticosteroids. However do not \nuse single or multiple untargeted (routine) courses of corticosteroids in twin or \ntriplet pregnancy as there is no benefit. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 17 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Do not use fetal fibronectin testing alone to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm \nbirth in twin and triplet pregnancy. \n Do not use home uterine activity monitoring to predict the risk of spontaneous \npreterm birth in twin and triplet pregnancy. \n Do not offer intramuscular progesterone to prevent spontaneous preterm birth in \nwomen with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \n Do not offer the following interventions (alone or in combination) routinely to \nprevent spontaneous preterm birth in women with a twin or triplet pregnancy: \n- Arabin pessary. \n- Bed rest. \n- Cervical cerclage. \n- Oral tocolytics. \n \n12.3 Postpartum haemorrhage \n \n Start assessing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage in pregnant women/people \nwith a twin or triplet pregnancy in the antenatal period and continue throughout \nlabour and the third stage. \n Offer each pregnant woman/person an individualised assessment of their risk of \npostpartum haemorrhage and explain that multiple pregnancy is a risk factor for \nincreased blood loss at birth. \n By 28 weeks of pregnancy, discuss options for managing the third stage of labour \nwith pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \n Do not offer physiological management of the third stage to pregnant \nwomen/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \n Offer pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy active management \nof the third stage. Explain that it is associated with a lower risk of postpartum \nhaemorrhage and/or blood transfusion. \n Consider active management of the third stage with additional uterotonics for \npregnant women/people who have 1 or more risk factors (in addition to a twin or \ntriplet pregnancy) for postpartum haemorrhage. \n By 28 weeks of pregnancy, discuss with women/people who have a twin or triplet \npregnancy the potential need for blood transfusion, including the need for \nintravenous access. Document this discussion in their notes. \n \n13.0 Mode of birth \n \nExplain to pregnant women/people with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy planning their \nmode of birth, that giving birth after 32 weeks: \n Planned vaginal birth and planned caesarean section are both safe choices for \nthem and their babies if all of the following apply: \n- The pregnancy remains uncomplicated and has progressed beyond 32 \nweeks. \n- There are no obstetric contraindications to labour. \n- The first baby is in a cephalic (head-first) presentation. \n- There is no significant size discordance between the twins. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 18 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n More than a third of pregnant women/people who plan a vaginal birth go on to \nhave a caesarean section. \n Almost all pregnant women/people who plan a caesarean section do have one, but \na few will have a vaginal birth before caesarean section can be carried out. \n A small number of pregnant women/people who plan a vaginal birth will need an \nemergency caesarean section to deliver the second twin after vaginal birth of the \nfirst twin. \n \nOffer a caesarean section to pregnant women/people with a monochorionic monoamniotic \ntwin pregnancy: \n At the time of planned birth (between 32+0 and 33+6 weeks) or \n After any complication is diagnosed in her pregnancy requiring earlier birth or \n If they are in established preterm labour, and gestational age suggests there is a \nreasonable chance of survival of the babies (unless the first twin is close to vaginal \nbirth and a senior obstetrician advises continuing to vaginal birth). \n \nOffer a caesarean section to pregnant women/people with a triplet pregnancy: \n At the time of planned birth (35 weeks) or \n After any complication is diagnosed in their pregnancy requiring earlier birth or \n If they are in established preterm labour, and gestational age suggests there is a \nreasonable chance of survival of the babies. \n \n14.0 Unscheduled attendances to the maternity unit including threatened \npreterm labour \n \n All pregnant women/people with multiple pregnancies who attended the unit \noutside of scheduled appointments should be assessed promptly by a senior \nobstetrician. \n A clear plan should be documented for monitoring in labour, mode of birth and \nwhen referral is required, particularly in extremely preterm labour. \n There should be senior review at least daily. \n Where necessary ensure prompt review by senior neonatologist. \n All clinical staff working within a maternity triage or emergency assessment area \nshould be aware of the pathophysiology and warning signs of extreme preterm \nbirth and of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (see section 10.0 Twin to Twin \nTransfusion). \n Consider reduced fetal movements in a twin pregnancy as a ‘red-flag warning sign’ \nof TTTS, in addition to rapid maternal abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and \nacute dyspnoea (MBRRACE-UK 2021) \n Consideration of corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate should be made in line \nwith CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway. \n \n15.0 Labour and birth \n \n All pregnant women/people with a multiple pregnancy should be advised to give \nbirth on the Labour Ward. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 19 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n They should be assessed promptly by a senior obstetrician on admission. \n Ensure accurate estimation of gestational age when a pregnant woman/person \npresents with threatened or established extreme preterm labour. This enables the \ncorrect risk assessment for potential neonatal survival, and therefore directs the \noptimal multidisciplinary care bundle. \n Intrapartum care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team of obstetricians \nand midwives who have experience and knowledge of multiple pregnancies. \n A partogram should be started and completed for all pregnant women/people with \nmultiple births who are in labour. \n Offer caesarean section to pregnant women/people if the first twin is not cephalic \nat the time of planned birth. \n Offer caesarean section to pregnant women/people in established preterm labour \nbetween 26 and 32 weeks if the first twin is not cephalic. \n Offer an individualised assessment of mode of birth to pregnant women/people in \nsuspected, diagnosed or established preterm labour before 26 weeks. Take into \naccount the risks of caesarean section and the chance of survival of the babies. \n Where birth is anticipated between 22+0 and 26+6 weeks ensure prompt \ndiscussions between the parents, obstetric and neonatal teams to guide whether \nactive resuscitation or palliative care should be undertaken. Care of the pregnant \nwoman/person and their baby/babies should reflect their wishes and values and \nthose of their partner, informed and supported by joint discussion with obstetric \nand neonatal professionals. \n Conversations with parents must be clearly documented and agreed management \nplans carefully and clearly communicated between professionals and staff shifts. \n The decisions on management should be regularly reviewed before and after birth \nin conjunction with the parents and the plans reconsidered if the risk for the \nbaby/babies changes or if parental wishes change. Redirection of care, in the best \ninterests of the baby, should be discussed with the parents if deterioration occurs \ndespite maximum intensive care. \n Following spontaneous birth of Twin 1 at less than 24 weeks consider delaying the \nbirth of the surviving second twin, if there are no contraindications such as \ninfection, fetal compromise, bleeding or coagulopathy. \n Counsel parents prior to the birth of Twin 1, regarding the possible option of \ndelayed birth of Twin 2 including the maternal risks as well as the risk of Twin 2 \nbeing born at the extremes of prematurity. \n In cases where delayed birth of Twin 2 is an option, manage the pregnancy as \nhigh risk in a tertiary centre, with close monitoring for signs of infection, clotting \nabnormalities and fetal growth (MBRRACE-UK, 2021) \n The on-call obstetric consultant and on-call anaesthetic and paediatric teams \nshould be informed of admission in labour. \n IV access, FBC and Group and Save should be obtained early in labour so that \nprompt blood transfusion and intravenous fluids can be given if needed. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 20 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n15.1 Fetal monitoring in labour \n \n Perform a portable ultrasound scan when established labour starts, to confirm \nwhich twin is which, the presentation of each twin, and to locate the fetal hearts. \n For pregnant women/people between 23+0 and 25+6 weeks of pregnancy who are \nin established labour, involve a senior obstetrician in discussions with the pregnant \nwoman/person and their family members or carers about how to monitor the fetal \nheart rates. \n Offer continuous CTG to pregnant women/people with a twin pregnancy who are in \nestablished labour and are more than 26 weeks pregnant. Intermittent auscultation \nshould not be offered. Ensure: \n- A dual channel CTG monitor is used to allow simultaneous monitoring of \nboth fetal hearts. \n- Document on the CTG and in the clinical records which CTG trace belongs \nto which baby. \n- Monitor the maternal pulse electronically and display it simultaneously on \nthe same CTG trace. \n- Consider separating the fetal heart rates by 20 beats/minute if there is \ndifficulty differentiating between them. \n- Consider fetal scalp electrode on first twin once membranes have been \nruptured. \n \n15.1.1 Review of CTGs \n \nClassify and interpret cardiotocography in line with Fetal Monitoring Guideline taking into \naccount that: \n \n Twin pregnancy should be considered a fetal clinical risk factor when classifying a \nCTG trace as ‘abnormal’ versus ‘non-reassuring’. \n Fetal scalp stimulation should not be performed in twin pregnancy to gain \nreassurance after a CTG trace that is categorised as ‘pathological’. \n Carry out systematic assessments of both CTGs at least hourly, and more \nfrequently if there are concerns. \n- Document which CTG trace belongs to which baby. \n- Be aware of the possibility of monitoring the same baby twice. At each CTG \nreview, ensure that twin synchronicity is not occurring. \n \n15.1.2 Management based on CTGs in twin pregnancies \n \nIf abdominal monitoring is unsuccessful or there are concerns about synchronicity of the fetal \nhearts: \n Involve a senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \n Apply a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby (only after 34 weeks and if there are \nno contraindications) while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby. \n Perform a bedside ultrasound scan to confirm both fetal heart rates. \n If monitoring remains unsatisfactory, consider a caesarean section. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 21 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nIf the cardiotocograph trace is categorised as ‘suspicious’ in the first baby during \nestablished labour: \n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \n Correct any reversible causes. \n Apply a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby (only after 34 weeks and if there are \nno contraindications) while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby. \n \nIf the cardiotocograph trace is categorised as 'pathological' in the first baby during \nestablished labour: \n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \n Discuss with the pregnant women/people and their family members or carers the \npossible use of fetal blood sampling of the first baby from 34 weeks if the benefits \nare likely to outweigh the potential risks. They should be made aware that if a \nblood sample cannot be obtained then they are likely to need a caesarean section. \n If the results of fetal blood sampling are not available within 20 minutes or fetal \nblood sampling is contraindicated, offer an immediate caesarean. \n \nIf the CTG trace is categorised as ‘pathological’ in the first baby during the second stage of \nlabour: \n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \n Assess whether an assisted vaginal birth is an option. \n If vaginal birth is not an option or cannot be achieved within 20 minutes, offer an \nimmediate caesarean section. \n \nIf the CTG trace of the second baby is categorised as 'suspicious’ or ‘pathological’ during \nestablished labour before the first baby is born: \n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \n If vaginal birth of the second baby cannot be achieved within 20 minutes, discuss \nperforming a caesarean section with the pregnant woman/person and their family \nmembers or carers. \n \nAcute TTTS can occur in labour in MCDA twins; therefore a low threshold for CS is \nadvisable if any CTG abnormalities occur. \n \n15.2 Analgesia \n \nChoice of analgesia should be discussed with the pregnant woman/person and taking note of \ntheir preference and should have been discussed antenatally at 28weeks. \n \n15.3 Second stage \n \n The anaesthetist, theatre team and labour ward coordinator should be informed \nwhen the pregnant woman/person reaches second stage. \n Second stage events must be clearly documented by the clinician leading the birth. \n The first twin may be delivered by a midwife, as for singleton birth, with the \nobstetric registrar / consultant present in the room. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 22 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n Syntocinon infusion (refer to Induction of Labour Guideline) should be ready for \npossible uterine inertia following birth of the first twin. \n \n15.4 Birth of second twin \n \n Active management of the birth of twin 2 has been reported as the major factor in \nreducing morbidity and the need for caesarean section. There is no definite \nevidence about safe interval between the birth of first and second twins when there \nis no suspected fetal compromise; but there are reports of an increase in poor \noutcome for the second twin if delayed beyond 45 minutes. \n Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be continued and if there is \n‘suspicious’ or ‘pathological’ CTG trace, and vaginal birth cannot be achieved \nwithin 20 minutes, discuss performing a caesarean section with the pregnant \nwoman/person and their family members or carers. \n After birth of the first twin, a longitudinal lie should be maintained in the second \ntwin by holding the abdomen until the presenting part is fixed in the pelvis. \n The lie of the second twin should be assessed, by a senior experienced \npractitioner, using abdominal palpation, vaginal examination if necessary and/or a \nportable scan. \n If not longitudinal, the lie should be corrected either by external cephalic version \nor by internal podalic version. Both of these manoeuvres are more successful \nwith epidural analgesia. \n Should birth not be imminent after 30 minutes, consider transferring the pregnant \nwoman/person to theatre to avoid unnecessary delay of twin 2. \n A Syntocinon infusion can be used to augment uterine activity once the lie is \nlongitudinal if contractions are inadequate. This infusion should be made up and \nready to administer required in the room. \n Syntocinon should only be used if clinically indicated and not as a routine \nprocedure (MBRRACE-UK, 2021). \n When longitudinal lie and regular contractions have been established, pushing \nshould be recommenced when the presenting part is visible or there is an urge to \npush. \n Artificial rupture of membranes should be performed only when the presenting part \nis fixed in the pelvis. \n If breech presentation – birth should be by a practitioner competent in breech \nbirths/obstetric registrar. The obstetric consultant should be informed or present. \n \n15.5 Third stage \n \n Active management of third stage should be strongly advised. \n Syntocinon infusion 40 units in 500ml 0.9%NaCl is recommended following birth of \nthe second twin, to be infused over 4 hours at 125mls/hr, to prevent uterine atony. \n Delayed/ deferred cord clamping is recommended by 1-3 minutes after birth to \nallow placental transfusion, unless the need for neonatal resuscitation is \nrecognised. The timing of cord clamping does not appear to have a major impact \non blood loss at the time of birth. Ensure that the cords are clearly differentiated, \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 23 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nfor example one clamp at the cut end of the cord for twin 1 and two clamps for \ntwin 2. \n Consider double clamping the cord to allow umbilical cord blood gases to be \nsampled. Ensure that blood gas samples are correctly labelled for each baby. \n \n15.6 Anticipation and prevention of infant hypoglycaemia \n \nNeonatal Hypoglycaemia should be considered to establish risk factors for the babies in line \nwith Guideline for Neonatal Hypoglycaemia Including Reluctant Feeder. \n \n16.0 Postnatal care: special considerations where one, both or all babies \n have died. \n \n If there has been a fetal loss of either or both twins or all triplets the Bereavement \nCare Pathway should be followed as well as routine postnatal care (as appropriate) \nand referral made to Birth Afterthoughts if wanted - CG1120 Intrauterine death \nguideline \n For placental histology, ensure the pathologist is provided with a complete clinical \nhistory when requesting post-mortem or placental examination. In cases of twin \npregnancy, this should be clearly indicated on the request, including chorionicity and \ndetails of the other twin should the examination be requested separately or if there is \na surviving sibling. \n Discussion regarding placental examination should be fully documented. \n If one twin survives, ensure community midwives visiting in the community are \naware of the stillbirth or NND of the other twin. \n If indicated a six week follow-up an Obstetric Consultant appointment should be \nmade to discuss events and future pregnancies. This should be made a joint \nObstetric and Neonatal appointment if needed.

PREGADAY commenced today (aware risk of constipation and \nstool colour change). \n \nBirth discussed, vaginal birth not recommended if twin 1 is anything other than cephalic. \nEpidural available if wishes, may make manipulation of twin 2 less uncomfortable, enables \nquicker birth if, instrumental birth or emergency LSCS needed. \n \nPotential for vaginal birth / LSCS if concerns with twin 2 (affects 10% twin sets). \n \nDelayed cord clamping routine if twins in good condition, as is skin to skin for both. \n \nColostrum harvesting recommended from 36 weeks onwards. \n\nDCDA only \n \nUSS 4 weekly from 20 weeks. \n \nDCDA aim for birth at 37 weeks. \n\nMCDA only \n \nUSS – 2 weekly from diagnosis. \nTwin to twin transfusion syndrome discussed - 10% of MCDA pairs, most commonly occurs \nat 17 - 24 weeks, referred up to St Georges, option for laser ablation at stage 3 and above \n(33% 2 twin survival / 33% 1 twin survival / 33% no survival). \n \nSymptoms: \nSudden abdominal distension, abdominal pain, breathlessness, inability to lie on back, \nreduced fetal movements. \n \nAim to deliver at 36 weeks. \n\nMode of birth \n \nVaginal birth \n \nBenefits: Less bleeding, less infection, reduced risk of breathing difficulty in baby (TTN/RDS), \nprotects uterus for future pregnancy, less pain after birth, can have epidural if wishes. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 33 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nRisks: Unpredictable, induction can be a lengthy process and may not work, does not \nremove risk of emergency Caesarean for either twin (10% will have SVD/LSCS). \n \nMethod: Continuous monitoring of both fetal hearts (may need scalp electrode), after birth of \ntwin 1, twin 2 will be manually held in longitudinal lie, may need ECV, will have USS to \nconfirm presentation, will have Synto infusion for uterine inertia if needed, heart monitoring of \ntwin 2. \n \nCaesarean section \n \nBenefits: Planned procedure, no pain during procedure, removes risk of twin 1 SVD / twin 2 \nLSCS. \n \nRisks: Bleeding, infection, include injury to bladder / vessels / bowel / ureters/ fetal injury. \nTTN and admission to SCBU (will be given corticosteroids to reduce risk), more pain \nfollowing birth, may labour prior to date, permanent scar to uterus. Higher risk of VTE. \n \nInduction \n \nBenefits: Reduces risk of stillbirth, encourages vaginal birth. \n \nRisks: Prolonged procedure, increased risk of emergency Caesarean compared with \nspontaneous onset of labour. \n \nMethod: Ripen cervix, then ARM & Syntocinon drip. \n\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 34 of 38 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nAppendix 7: Placental Histology \n\n□ Admission to NICU (>37/40) for >4hours \n□ Apgar <7 at 5 minutes \n□ Cord pH <7.0 \n□ Prematurity <34/40 \n□ IUGR <3rd centile (on GROW) \n□ Suspected chorioamnionitis (pyrexia ≥38◦C) – \nsend swab to microbiology as well. \n□ Placental abruption \n□ Morbidly adherent placenta (not other MROP) \n□ Abnormal appearance of placenta eg tumour \n\n□ Stillbirth or early neonatal death \n□ MTOP (if requested by screening) \n \nIf yes to any of the above: \n1.

  "response": "Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document detailed counseling regarding risks/benefits of vaginal vs. cesarean delivery for this growth-discordant twin pregnancy (22% discordance).  \n   Reason: Guideline 13.0 states significant size discordance should be considered when discussing mode of birth. The note mentions planning for CS if Twin B becomes compromised but doesn't document prior counseling about risks of vaginal delivery with discordance.\n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider referral to tertiary fetal medicine center given 22% growth discordance (Twin B at 10th centile).  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.0 recommends referral for EFW discordance ≥25% with any baby <10th centile. While this case is at 22%, the borderline value and preterm labor risk warrant specialist input.\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Document explicit discussion about neonatal outcomes at 32 weeks, including NICU admission risks and potential long-term complications.  \n   Reason: Guideline 7.1 requires discussion of preterm birth risks by 28 weeks, including neonatal unit admission. The note mentions pediatric team alert but not parent counseling details.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether aspirin was prescribed given twin pregnancy + gestational diabetes (high pre-eclampsia risk).  \n   Reason: Guideline 12.1 recommends aspirin for multiple pregnancies with additional moderate/high risk factors like diabetes.\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Consider adding documentation about colostrum harvesting advice (from Appendix 6 discussion points).  \n   Reason: While not critical, Appendix 6 recommends discussing this from 36 weeks in twins to prepare for potential preterm birth.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Specify whether umbilical artery Dopplers were performed during growth scans.  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.0 recommends Doppler assessment with growth discordance, but the note only mentions \"bloods normal.\"\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Improved documentation** - Consider adding labels (Twin A/B) to CTG documentation for clarity.  \n   Reason: Guideline 15.1.1 emphasizes clear CTG trace labeling, though the note does mention \"both with good variability.\"\n\nThe clinical note generally follows guideline recommendations well, particularly regarding:\n- Appropriate tocolysis, steroids, and MgSO4 administration\n- Continuous monitoring and preparation for operative delivery\n- Exclusion of TTTS\n- Multidisciplinary team involvement\n\nThe most critical gap is the lack of documented counseling about delivery mode options specific to growth-discordant twins, as this significantly impacts shared decision-making. The borderline growth discordance also warrants consideration of tertiary center referral.",

Pregnancy has been closely monitored with fortnightly scans. Recent growth scans show developing growth discordance between twins - Twin A estimated 1.8kg (50th centile), Twin B estimated 1.4kg (10th centile), representing 22% weight difference. She presented today with regular uterine contractions every 4-5 minutes for past 3 hours, accompanied by lower back ache and pelvic pressure. No bleeding, no rupture of membranes, both babies moving well. Previous antenatal care has been uncomplicated apart from gestational diabetes diagnosed at 26 weeks, well controlled with diet. She works as a teacher, supportive partner, anxious about early delivery.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: Maternal vital signs stable: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, temp 36.8°C. Abdomen shows regular contractions palpable every 4-5 minutes, both twins in longitudinal lie, Twin A cephalic presentation, Twin B breech. CTG monitoring shows both twins with reassuring patterns - Twin A baseline 140 bpm, Twin B baseline 155 bpm, both with good variability. Cervical assessment reveals 3cm dilatation, 60% effacement, soft consistency. Ultrasound confirms presentations and estimated fetal weights as above. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome excluded - both twins have adequate liquor volume. Bloods normal including FBC and inflammatory markers.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Preterm labor in twin pregnancy with growth discordance requiring immediate management. Tocolysis with nifedipine commenced to delay delivery. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) administered for fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate given for neuroprotection. Pediatric team alerted for twin delivery. Anesthetic consultation for potential operative delivery. Given growth discordance, immediate delivery not indicated unless fetal compromise develops. Plan for cesarean section if further cervical change or if Twin B becomes compromised. Continuous monitoring of both twins. Growth discordance investigation post-delivery to exclude underlying causes.\\n\\nGuideline:\\n[ID] cg1126-multiple-pregnancy-and-birth-pdf\\nTitle: CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth\\nContent: CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 1 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\nMultiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline \\nSummary statement: How does the document \\nsupport patient care? \\nBy the provision of good practice evidence based \\nguidelines for all staff involved in the antenatal and \\nintrapartum care of pregnant women/people with a \\nmultiple pregnancy \\nStaff/stakeholders involved in development: \\n \\nObstetric Consultants, Senior Midwives, Joint Obstetric \\nGuidelines Group Members \\nDivision: \\nWomen and Children’s \\nDepartment: \\nMaternity \\nResponsible Person: \\nChief of Service \\nAuthor: \\nObstetric Consultant, maternity team \\nFor use by: \\nMedical, Obstetric and Midwifery staff \\nPurpose: \\nTo provide high quality, evidence based care for \\npregnant women/people a with multiple pregnancy \\nThis document supports: \\n \\nRCOG (2016) Green-top guideline 51 \\nNICE (2019) Caesarean Section \\nNICE (2019) NG137 Twin and Triplet Pregnancy \\nKey related documents: \\nAntenatal and labour risk assessments. \\nUH Sussex (SRH&WH) Maternity Guidelines: \\nAntenatal Care and Patient Information, Induction of \\nLabour, Antenatal Screening Tests, Fetal Fibronectin, \\nAntepartum Haemorrhage, Hypertensive Disorders of \\nPregnancy \\nApproved by: \\nJoint Obstetric Guidelines Group \\nApproval date: \\n15\\nth\\n June 2022 Date uploaded: 11\\nth\\n July 2022 \\nRatified by Board of Directors/ Committee of the \\nBoard of Directors \\nNot Applicable- Divisional Ratification only required \\nRatification Date: \\nNot Applicable- Divisional Ratification only required \\nExpiry Date: \\nMarch 2024 \\nReview date: \\nSeptember 2023 \\nIf you require this document in another format such as Braille, large print, audio or \\nanother language please contact the Trusts Communications Team \\nReference Number: \\nCG1126 \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 2 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nVersion Date Author Status Comment \\n1.0 January 2011 Obstetric Consultants Archived New Trustwide guideline \\n2.0 February 2011 CNST Lead Midwife Archived Administrative update \\n3.0 May 2012 Antenatal Clinic \\nmanager and Fetal \\nMedicine Consultant \\nArchived Guideline updated to include \\nNICE 2011 recommendations \\n3.1 January 2014 Obstetric Consultant Archived 3 Year review-minor update to \\nclarify care pathway \\n Guideline given an extension \\nuntil February 2017 whilst still \\nunder review. \\n4.0 Oct 2017 Obstetric Consultant Archived 3 year review – minor \\namendment to pain relief \\n5 August 2018 Obstetric Consultant Archived MCDA antenatal schedule \\nupdated in line with RCOG \\nguidance \\n6.0 March 2021 Clinical Effectiveness \\nSupport Midwife (J. \\nCollard) with Twins \\nWorking Party cross-\\nsite \\nArchived Guideline updated in line with \\nNICE NG137 Twin and Triplet \\nPregnancy 2019 \\nMBRRACE-UK 2021 \\n6.1 May 2022 R.

University Hospitals Sussex (SRH&WH NHS Foundation Trust. \\n \\n2.0 Scope \\n \\n Obstetricians \\n Midwives \\n Ultrasonographers \\n Anaesthetists \\n \\n3.0 Responsibilities \\n \\nMidwives & obstetricians are expected: \\n \\n To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. \\n To use their professional judgement in the application of this guideline. \\n \\nManagement teams are expected: \\n \\n To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and \\nNational Recommendations. \\n To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff. \\n \\n4.0 Introduction \\n \\nMultiple pregnancies are reported in 15.4 per 1000 births in the United Kingdom in 2018. \\nThis is the third annual decline in multiple births from 16.1 per 1000 births in 2015 (Office for \\nNational Statistics 2018). \\n \\nTwin and higher order multiple pregnancies are associated with increased risk of maternal \\nand fetal complications: \\n \\n Complications for pregnant women/people include hyperemesis, anaemia, \\nhypertensive disorders (PIH, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia), APH, increased risk of \\noperative deliveries including caesarean section and postpartum haemorrhage. \\n Fetal complications include first and second trimester pregnancy loss, prematurity \\ndue to preterm birth, growth restriction, fetal death (one or both twins), neurological \\nimpairment, increased risk of congenital anomalies. \\n \\nRCOG Study Group recommends that single embryo transfer should be considered in \\nassisted conception and parents of high order multiple pregnancies (≥ 3) should be \\ncounselled and offered multi-fetal pregnancy reduction to twins in specialist centres. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 6 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\nIn addition monochorionic twins (constituting a third of all twin pregnancies) are associated \\nwith a risk (10-15%) of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. \\n \\nFurthermore monochorionic monoamniotic twins are associated with the risk of cord \\nentanglement which is further associated with increased perinatal mortality. \\n \\n5.0 Definitions \\n \\n A monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancy is one in which both babies are \\ndependent on a single, shared placenta. \\n A dichorionic pregnancy is where the babies are supported by separate \\nplacentae. \\n Monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancy is where the babies are in a single \\namniotic sac and are dependent on a single placenta. \\n Dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy is where the babies are in separate amniotic \\nsacs and are supported by separate placentae. \\n Conjoined twins are twins whose body parts are joined up with each other due \\nvarying degrees of incomplete separation. \\n Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) only occurs in monochorionic \\nmonozygotic twins (identical) and is the result of transfusion of blood from one fetal \\ntwin to another twin. \\n \\n5.1 Abbreviations used within this guideline \\n \\nPIH - Pregnancy Induced Hypertension APH - Antepartum Haemorrhage \\nMC -

insemination \\nFGR - Fetal Growth Restriction \\nPAPP-A - Low Pregnancy Associated \\nPlasma Protein \\n\\n6.0 Diagnosis and determination of chorionicity & amnionicity \\n \\n The diagnosis of a multiple pregnancy is usually made at the time of the dating \\nscan in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some pregnant women/people may have \\nthis identified at viability scans in Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic (EPAC) or \\non routine scans after assisted conception. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 7 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Estimate gestational age should be from the largest baby in a twin or triplet \\npregnancy to avoid the risk of estimating it from a baby with early growth \\npathology. \\n Assign nomenclature to babies (for example, upper and lower, or left and right) in a \\ntwin or triplet pregnancy, and document this clearly in the pregnant \\nwoman/person’s notes to ensure consistency throughout pregnancy. \\n \\n6.1 Ascertaining the chorionicity: \\n \\n Presence of a thick intertwin septum with detection of a “lambda sign” is indicative \\nof dichorionic pregnancy, whereas a thin septum with single continuous placental \\nmass is observed in monochorionic pregnancies. \\n If there is doubt in the diagnosis of chorionicity, the pregnant woman/person \\nshould be referred to a specialist without delay, as chorionicity is best determined \\nbefore 14 weeks. \\n If it is difficult to determine chorionicity, even after referral (for example, because \\nthe pregnant woman/person has booked late in pregnancy), manage the \\npregnancy as a monochorionic pregnancy until proved otherwise. \\n If a pregnant woman/person with a twin or triplet pregnancy presents after 14+0 \\nweeks, determine chorionicity and amnionicity at the earliest opportunity by \\nultrasound using all of the following: \\n- The number of placental masses. \\n- The presence of amniotic membrane(s) and membrane thickness. \\n- The lambda or T-sign. \\n- Discordant fetal sex. \\n A photographic record should be retained, in the case notes, of the ultrasound \\nappearances of the membrane attachment to the placenta. \\n Separate placentae and discordant genitalia are also signs of dichorionicity, \\nparticularly in the mid-trimester. \\n \\n7.0 Antenatal care \\n \\nPregnant women/people with a multiple pregnancy must be offered consultant led care, and \\ngiven information specific to twin and triplet pregnancies at their first contact after diagnosis. \\n \\nAntenatal clinical care for pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy should be \\nprovided by a nominated multidisciplinary team consisting of: \\n \\n• A core team of named specialist obstetricians, specialist midwives and \\nsonographers, all of whom have experience and knowledge of managing twin and \\ntriplet pregnancies. \\n \\n• An enhanced team for referrals, which should include: \\n- A perinatal mental health professional \\n- A women’s health physiotherapist \\n- An infant feeding specialist \\n- A dietitian. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 8 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\nHowever do not routinely refer all pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy to \\nthe enhanced team but base the decision to refer on each pregnant woman/person’s needs. \\n \\nInformation should be given on antenatal nutrition, anaemia, support groups, parent \\neducation, breastfeeding, antenatal and postnatal mental health, and signs and symptoms of \\npreterm labour. \\n \\nAlthough the majority their appointments will be at the Twins Clinic, the community midwife \\nshould also offer separate appointments. How frequently they attend the community midwife \\nappointments can be discussed with the midwife and scheduled to suit their individual \\ncircumstances. \\n \\n7.1 Planning for birth \\n \\nAll discussions should involve the pregnant woman/person with the multiple pregnancy and \\ntheir family or carers if appropriate. \\n \\nPregnant women/people should be given information on the risks and benefits of different \\nmodes of birth to support them in planning their birth. This information is included on the \\nMultiple Birth Care Pathway (Appendix 5) which is placed in the antenatal handheld record \\nfor the pregnant woman/person to access during their pregnancy. \\n \\nFollowing discussion, the agreed planned place, timing and mode of birth should be \\ndocumented in the health record, preferably on the Multiple Pregnancy Care Pathway. \\n \\n From 24 weeks in a twin or triplet pregnancy, discuss with the pregnant \\nwoman/person (and her family members or carers, as appropriate) their plans and \\nwishes for the birth of their babies. \\n Provide information that is tailored to each pregnant woman/person’s pregnancy, \\ntaking into account their needs and preferences. Revisit these conversations \\nwhenever clinically indicated and whenever they want to. \\n Ensure the following has been discussed (appendix 6) and documented by 28 \\nweeks at the latest: \\n- Place of birth and the possible need to transfer in case of preterm birth. \\n- Timing and possible modes of birth. \\n- Analgesia during labour: offer an epidural to pregnant women/people with a \\ntwin or triplet pregnancy who choose to have a vaginal birth. Explain that \\nthis is likely to improve the chance of success and optimal timing of \\nassisted vaginal birth of all the babies and enables a quicker birth by \\nemergency caesarean section if needed. \\n- Analgesia during caesarean birth: Offer regional anaesthesia to pregnant \\nwomen/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy that are having a caesarean \\nsection. \\n- Management of the third stage of labour and postpartum haemorrhage. \\n(see section 12.3) \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 9 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n At 28 weeks intrapartum fetal heart monitoring should be discussed and \\ndocumented. It should be explained that: \\n- Recommendations on cardiotocography(CTG) are based on evidence from \\npregnant women/people with a singleton pregnancy because there is a lack \\nof evidence specific to twin pregnancy or preterm babies. \\n- It allows simultaneous monitoring of both babies. \\n- It might restrict their mobility. \\n- Normal traces show the babies are coping well with labour; if traces are not \\nnormal, there will be less certainty about the babies’ condition. \\n- It is normal to see changes to the fetal heart rate pattern during labour and \\nthis does not necessarily mean there is a problem. \\n- Findings from the CTG are used to help make decisions during labour and \\nbirth, but these will also be based on her wishes, their condition and that of \\ntheir babies. \\n \\nPregnant women/people with multiple pregnancies should have the following discussed: \\n Spontaneous preterm birth and planned preterm birth are associated with an \\nincreased risk of admission to a neonatal unit. \\n About 60 in 100 twin pregnancies result in spontaneous birth before 37 weeks. \\n 75 in 100 triplet pregnancies result in spontaneous birth before 35 weeks. \\n \\nFor an uncomplicated multiple pregnancy, discuss and offer planned birth as follows, after a \\ncourse of antenatal corticosteroids has been considered. The risks and benefits of \\ncorticosteroids should be discussed and this discussion documented in line with the RCOG \\ninfographic in the CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway. \\n \\nThe timing of birth should be individualised in each pregnancy and include considerations of \\nsafety such as avoiding induction at weekends, aiming for birth of: \\n \\nDichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: \\n Planned birth from 37+0 weeks does not appear to be associated with an \\nincreased risk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \\n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 37+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \\n Aim for birth of dichorionic diamniotic twins at 37 weeks. \\n \\nMonochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: \\n Planned birth from 36 weeks does not appear to be associated with an increased \\nrisk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \\n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 36+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \\n Aim for birth of monochorionic diamniotic twins at 36 weeks. \\n \\nMonochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy: \\n Planned birth between 32+0 and 33+6 weeks does not appear to be associated \\nwith an increased risk of serious neonatal adverse outcomes. \\n Their babies will usually need to be admitted to the neonatal unit and have an \\nincreased risk of respiratory problems. \\n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 33+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 10 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Aim for birth of monochorionic monoamniotic twins between \\n32+0 and 33+6 weeks. \\n \\nTrichorionic triamniotic or dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies: \\n Continuing the pregnancy beyond 35+6 weeks increases the risk of fetal death. \\n Aim for birth of trichorionic triamniotic or dichorionic triamniotic triplet at \\n35 weeks. \\n \\nMonochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy or a triplet pregnancy that involves a \\nshared amnion: \\n Timing of birth will be decided and discussed with each pregnant woman/person \\nindividually. \\n \\nIn twin pregnancy induction of labour would be advised as for singleton pregnancy (refer to \\nInduction of Labour Guideline provided that the first twin is cephalic and no other risk factors \\nare present. \\n \\nInform paediatric consultant of planned birth date for triplet pregnancies in order that \\nresources and equipment can be organised. \\n \\nFor Pregnant women/people who decline planned birth at the recommended timing, offer \\nweekly appointments with the specialist obstetrician. At each appointment, offer an \\nultrasound scan and perform assessments of amniotic fluid level and Doppler of the umbilical \\nartery flow for each baby in addition to fortnightly fetal growth scans. They should be made \\naware that this enhanced surveillance cannot guarantee against a poor outcome. \\n \\n7.2 Screening, scans and antenatal appointments \\n \\n Booking bloods: blood group and antibody, screening for infections e.g. Hepatitis \\nB, rubella immunity, HIV, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria etc. should be \\nperformed as for all other pregnant women/people. \\n Be aware of higher incidence of anaemia; consider the need for iron \\nsupplementation. \\n Pregnant women/people should be counselled before screening by appropriately \\ntrained personnel regarding the implications of high risk results and antenatal \\ndiagnosis in multiple pregnancies. \\n Scan at 10-13 weeks gestation for viability, accurate dating, chorionicity, major \\ncongenital malformation and nuchal translucency. \\n Screening for Down’s syndrome: First trimester combined test (nuchal \\ntranslucency (NT) scan with serum screening) can be offered to women/people \\nwith twin pregnancies that opt for screening. For triplets and higher order multiple \\npregnancies the screening is offered with NT and maternal age only (FASP 2019). \\n Refer pregnant women/people with a dichorionic and monochorionic triplet \\npregnancy who want to have screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome \\nand Patau’s syndrome, to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 11 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n All triplet pregnancies should be referred to internal fetal medicine at point of \\ndiagnosis. If not available then they should be referred to tertiary service directly at \\nthe earliest opportunity. \\n Pregnant women/people with a triplet pregnancy should be given information \\nabout: \\n- The greater likelihood of Down's syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and \\nPatau’s syndrome in triplet pregnancy. \\n- The different options for screening. \\n- The increased false positive rate of screening tests in triplet pregnancy. \\n- Their greater likelihood of being offered invasive test and higher chance of \\ncomplications of invasive testing. \\n- The physical risks and psychological implications in the short and long term \\nrelating to selective fetal reduction. \\n Anomaly ultrasound at 20/40 with extended views of the heart for monochorionic \\ntwins and triplets. \\n Full blood count should be performed at 20 weeks and at 28 weeks. \\n Anaesthetic and paediatric antenatal appointments should be organised as \\nnecessary on an individual basis. \\n \\n7.3 Monochorionic diamniotic twins (appendix 1) \\n \\nMonochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies should have 11 antenatal appointments \\nscheduled with a healthcare professional from the core team. At least 2 of these \\nappointments should be with the specialist obstetrician. \\n \\n7.4 Dichorionic diamniotic twins (appendix 2) \\n \\nDichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies 8 antenatal appointments scheduled with a \\nhealthcare professional from the core team.

Monitoring with ultrasound must be targeted to assess all these \\nparameters. Umbilical artery Dopplers from 24 weeks. \\n Screening for fetal growth restriction or Twin-To-Twin Transfusion Syndrome \\n(TTTS) should not be offered in the first trimester. \\n Offer diagnostic monitoring for TTTS to women with a monochorionic twin or triplet \\npregnancy. Monitor with ultrasound every 14 days from 16 weeks until birth. \\n Explain that the relative likelihood of each complication changes with advancing \\ngestation but that they can all occur at any gestational age. \\n Offer pregnant women/people simultaneous monitoring for TTTS, fetal growth \\nrestriction and advanced-stage twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS) at \\nevery ultrasound. \\n Offer weekly ultrasound monitoring for TAPS from 16 weeks of pregnancy using \\nmiddle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) to Pregnant \\nwomen/people whose pregnancies are complicated by: \\n- Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome that has been treated by fetoscopic laser \\ntherapy or \\n- Selective fetal growth restriction (defined by an EFW discordance of 25% or \\nmore and an EFW of any of the babies below the 10th centile for \\ngestational age). \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 14 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Measure the DVP depths of amniotic fluid on either side of the amniotic \\nmembrane. \\n Increase the frequency of diagnostic monitoring in the second and third trimester to \\nat least weekly if there are concerns about differences between the babies' \\namniotic fluid level (a difference in DVP depth of 4 cm or more). Include Doppler \\nassessment of the umbilical artery flow for each baby. \\n For pregnant women/people with a monochorionic pregnancy showing any of the \\nfollowing: \\n- Cardiovascular compromise (such as fetal hydrops or cardiomegaly) or \\n- Unexplained isolated polyhydramnios or \\n- Abnormal umbilical artery. \\nPerform ultrasound MCA PSV measurements to help detect advanced-stage TAPS, \\nand seek management advice immediately from a tertiary level fetal medicine \\nspecialist. \\n \\nWhere TTTS is diagnosed early referral to the regional tertiary centre or the fetal \\nmedicine specialist is indicated. \\n \\n Refer the pregnant women/people to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre if TTTS \\nis diagnosed, based on the following: \\n- The amniotic sac of 1 baby has a DVP depth of less than 2 cm and \\n- The amniotic sac of another baby has a DVP depth of: \\nOover 8 cm before 20+0 weeks of pregnancy or \\no Over 10 cm from 20+0 weeks. \\n Further assessment and monitoring by the woman’s named Consultant is \\nindicated if: \\n- The amniotic sac of 1 baby has a DVP depth in the normal range and \\n- The amniotic sac of another baby has a DVP depth of: \\no Less than 2 cm or \\no 8 cm or more. \\n \\n 10.1 Quintero Classification of TTTS \\n \\nStage I There is a discrepancy in amniotic fluid volume with oligohydramnios of a \\nmaximum vertical pocket (MVP) ≤ 2 cm in one sac and polyhydramnios in \\nother sac (MVP ≥ 8 cm). The bladder of the donor twin is visible and \\nDoppler studies are normal. \\nStage II The bladder of the donor twin is not visible (during length of examination, \\nusually around 1 hour) but Doppler studies are not critically abnormal. \\nStage III Doppler studies are critically abnormal in either twin and are characterised \\nas abnormal or reversed end-diastolic velocities in the umbilical artery, \\nreverse flow in the Ductus venosus or pulsatile umbilical venous flow. \\nStage IV Ascites, pericardial or pleural effusion, scalp oedema or overt hydrops \\npresent. \\nStage V One or both babies are dead. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 15 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n \\n10.2 Management of confirmed TTTS \\n \\n Where TTTS is diagnosed at gestations below 26 weeks, fetoscopic laser ablation \\nis the intervention of choice. \\n Anastomoses may be missed at laser ablation and TTTS can recur later in up to \\n14% of pregnancies treated by laser ablation. Thus surveillance should continue. \\n Laser ablation can be performed in mono- and dichorionic triplet pregnancies. \\n Some pregnant women/people request termination of pregnancy when severe \\nTTTS is diagnosed and this should be discussed as an option. \\n Another option is to offer selective termination of pregnancy using bipolar \\ndiathermy of one of the umbilical cords, with inevitable sacrifice of that baby. This \\nmay be appropriate if there is severe hydrops fetalis in the recipient or evidence of \\ncerebral damage in either twin. \\n \\n11.0 Single fetal demise in multiple pregnancy \\n \\nWhen counselling those pregnant women/people who have suffered from a twin demise, it is \\nimportant to use the same statistics on each site. The timing of fetal demise does not affect \\nthe incidence of neurodevelopmental delay, co-twin death or preterm birth in the surviving \\ntwin but is different between MCDA and DCDA sets. Fetal brain imaging using MRI is offered \\nto the surviving twin in MCDA sets. \\n \\nOutcome for survivor twin following co-twin demise in 2\\nnd\\n & 3\\nrd\\n trimesters: \\n MCDA DCDA \\nDeath of survivor twin \\n15% 3% \\nPreterm birth \\n68% 54% \\nNeurodevelopmental delay \\n26% 2% \\nHillman et al Obstet Gynecol 2011;118:928-40 \\n \\n When a twin is lost during the first trimester there is no influence on the outcome of \\nthe pregnancy. \\n Where the fetal demise occurs after 12 weeks, the continuing pregnancy should \\ncontinue to be treated as a multiple pregnancy (i.e. scan and appointment \\nschedules). \\n Even though there is risk to the surviving twin rapid birth is usually unwise unless \\nlater in pregnancy (>37 weeks)/CTG abnormality/abnormal MCA Doppler. \\n \\n12.0 Further complications of multiple pregnancy \\n \\n12.1 Hypertension and pre-eclampsia \\n \\nAdvise pregnant women/people that they should take Aspirin 150mg with food at night from \\n12 weeks until 36 weeks or birth if before 36 weeks they have any of the following additional \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 16 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nmoderate risk factors for hypertension as multiple pregnancy compounds the risk of \\nhypertension. \\n First Pregnancy. \\n Age 40 or over. \\n Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years. \\n BMI of 35 or over at first visit. \\n Family history of pre-eclampsia. \\n \\nAdditional moderate risk factors for recommending aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care \\nBundle: \\n Assisted conception (IVF/ IUI). \\n Current smoker. \\n \\nHigh risk factors for hypertension are: \\n Chronic hypertension. \\n Previous hypertensive disease during pregnancy – gestational hypertension and \\npre-eclampsia. \\n Chronic kidney disease. \\n Autoimmune disease ie lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome. \\n Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. \\n \\nAdditional high risk factors for recommending aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care \\nBundle: \\n Low Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein (PAPP-A) screening blood test. \\n Previous Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) - either birth weight <2.5kg over \\n37 week’s gestation or <10th centile). \\n Previous stillbirth. \\n \\nFor GP letter to prescribe aspirin prophylaxis see Appendix 3 of CG1198 Management of \\nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy. \\n \\nMeasure blood pressure and test urine for proteinuria to screen for hypertensive disorders at \\neach antenatal appointment in a twin and triplet pregnancy. \\n \\n12.2 Screening for preterm labour \\n \\n Explain to pregnant women/people and their family members or carers (as \\nappropriate) that: \\n- They have a higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth than women with a \\nsingleton pregnancy. \\n- This risk is further increased if they have other risk factors, such as a \\nspontaneous preterm birth in a previous pregnancy. \\n- They should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of preterm labour \\nand to call Triage if they experience any of these symptoms. \\n They should be informed of the benefit of targeted corticosteroids. However do not \\nuse single or multiple untargeted (routine) courses of corticosteroids in twin or \\ntriplet pregnancy as there is no benefit. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 17 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Do not use fetal fibronectin testing alone to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm \\nbirth in twin and triplet pregnancy. \\n Do not use home uterine activity monitoring to predict the risk of spontaneous \\npreterm birth in twin and triplet pregnancy. \\n Do not offer intramuscular progesterone to prevent spontaneous preterm birth in \\nwomen with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \\n Do not offer the following interventions (alone or in combination) routinely to \\nprevent spontaneous preterm birth in women with a twin or triplet pregnancy: \\n- Arabin pessary. \\n- Bed rest. \\n- Cervical cerclage. \\n- Oral tocolytics. \\n \\n12.3 Postpartum haemorrhage \\n \\n Start assessing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage in pregnant women/people \\nwith a twin or triplet pregnancy in the antenatal period and continue throughout \\nlabour and the third stage. \\n Offer each pregnant woman/person an individualised assessment of their risk of \\npostpartum haemorrhage and explain that multiple pregnancy is a risk factor for \\nincreased blood loss at birth. \\n By 28 weeks of pregnancy, discuss options for managing the third stage of labour \\nwith pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \\n Do not offer physiological management of the third stage to pregnant \\nwomen/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy. \\n Offer pregnant women/people with a twin or triplet pregnancy active management \\nof the third stage. Explain that it is associated with a lower risk of postpartum \\nhaemorrhage and/or blood transfusion. \\n Consider active management of the third stage with additional uterotonics for \\npregnant women/people who have 1 or more risk factors (in addition to a twin or \\ntriplet pregnancy) for postpartum haemorrhage. \\n By 28 weeks of pregnancy, discuss with women/people who have a twin or triplet \\npregnancy the potential need for blood transfusion, including the need for \\nintravenous access. Document this discussion in their notes. \\n \\n13.0 Mode of birth \\n \\nExplain to pregnant women/people with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy planning their \\nmode of birth, that giving birth after 32 weeks: \\n Planned vaginal birth and planned caesarean section are both safe choices for \\nthem and their babies if all of the following apply: \\n- The pregnancy remains uncomplicated and has progressed beyond 32 \\nweeks. \\n- There are no obstetric contraindications to labour. \\n- The first baby is in a cephalic (head-first) presentation. \\n- There is no significant size discordance between the twins. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 18 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n More than a third of pregnant women/people who plan a vaginal birth go on to \\nhave a caesarean section. \\n Almost all pregnant women/people who plan a caesarean section do have one, but \\na few will have a vaginal birth before caesarean section can be carried out. \\n A small number of pregnant women/people who plan a vaginal birth will need an \\nemergency caesarean section to deliver the second twin after vaginal birth of the \\nfirst twin. \\n \\nOffer a caesarean section to pregnant women/people with a monochorionic monoamniotic \\ntwin pregnancy: \\n At the time of planned birth (between 32+0 and 33+6 weeks) or \\n After any complication is diagnosed in her pregnancy requiring earlier birth or \\n If they are in established preterm labour, and gestational age suggests there is a \\nreasonable chance of survival of the babies (unless the first twin is close to vaginal \\nbirth and a senior obstetrician advises continuing to vaginal birth). \\n \\nOffer a caesarean section to pregnant women/people with a triplet pregnancy: \\n At the time of planned birth (35 weeks) or \\n After any complication is diagnosed in their pregnancy requiring earlier birth or \\n If they are in established preterm labour, and gestational age suggests there is a \\nreasonable chance of survival of the babies. \\n \\n14.0 Unscheduled attendances to the maternity unit including threatened \\npreterm labour \\n \\n All pregnant women/people with multiple pregnancies who attended the unit \\noutside of scheduled appointments should be assessed promptly by a senior \\nobstetrician. \\n A clear plan should be documented for monitoring in labour, mode of birth and \\nwhen referral is required, particularly in extremely preterm labour. \\n There should be senior review at least daily. \\n Where necessary ensure prompt review by senior neonatologist. \\n All clinical staff working within a maternity triage or emergency assessment area \\nshould be aware of the pathophysiology and warning signs of extreme preterm \\nbirth and of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (see section 10.0 Twin to Twin \\nTransfusion). \\n Consider reduced fetal movements in a twin pregnancy as a ‘red-flag warning sign’ \\nof TTTS, in addition to rapid maternal abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and \\nacute dyspnoea (MBRRACE-UK 2021) \\n Consideration of corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate should be made in line \\nwith CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway. \\n \\n15.0 Labour and birth \\n \\n All pregnant women/people with a multiple pregnancy should be advised to give \\nbirth on the Labour Ward. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 19 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n They should be assessed promptly by a senior obstetrician on admission. \\n Ensure accurate estimation of gestational age when a pregnant woman/person \\npresents with threatened or established extreme preterm labour. This enables the \\ncorrect risk assessment for potential neonatal survival, and therefore directs the \\noptimal multidisciplinary care bundle. \\n Intrapartum care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team of obstetricians \\nand midwives who have experience and knowledge of multiple pregnancies. \\n A partogram should be started and completed for all pregnant women/people with \\nmultiple births who are in labour. \\n Offer caesarean section to pregnant women/people if the first twin is not cephalic \\nat the time of planned birth. \\n Offer caesarean section to pregnant women/people in established preterm labour \\nbetween 26 and 32 weeks if the first twin is not cephalic. \\n Offer an individualised assessment of mode of birth to pregnant women/people in \\nsuspected, diagnosed or established preterm labour before 26 weeks. Take into \\naccount the risks of caesarean section and the chance of survival of the babies. \\n Where birth is anticipated between 22+0 and 26+6 weeks ensure prompt \\ndiscussions between the parents, obstetric and neonatal teams to guide whether \\nactive resuscitation or palliative care should be undertaken. Care of the pregnant \\nwoman/person and their baby/babies should reflect their wishes and values and \\nthose of their partner, informed and supported by joint discussion with obstetric \\nand neonatal professionals. \\n Conversations with parents must be clearly documented and agreed management \\nplans carefully and clearly communicated between professionals and staff shifts. \\n The decisions on management should be regularly reviewed before and after birth \\nin conjunction with the parents and the plans reconsidered if the risk for the \\nbaby/babies changes or if parental wishes change. Redirection of care, in the best \\ninterests of the baby, should be discussed with the parents if deterioration occurs \\ndespite maximum intensive care. \\n Following spontaneous birth of Twin 1 at less than 24 weeks consider delaying the \\nbirth of the surviving second twin, if there are no contraindications such as \\ninfection, fetal compromise, bleeding or coagulopathy. \\n Counsel parents prior to the birth of Twin 1, regarding the possible option of \\ndelayed birth of Twin 2 including the maternal risks as well as the risk of Twin 2 \\nbeing born at the extremes of prematurity. \\n In cases where delayed birth of Twin 2 is an option, manage the pregnancy as \\nhigh risk in a tertiary centre, with close monitoring for signs of infection, clotting \\nabnormalities and fetal growth (MBRRACE-UK, 2021) \\n The on-call obstetric consultant and on-call anaesthetic and paediatric teams \\nshould be informed of admission in labour. \\n IV access, FBC and Group and Save should be obtained early in labour so that \\nprompt blood transfusion and intravenous fluids can be given if needed. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 20 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n15.1 Fetal monitoring in labour \\n \\n Perform a portable ultrasound scan when established labour starts, to confirm \\nwhich twin is which, the presentation of each twin, and to locate the fetal hearts. \\n For pregnant women/people between 23+0 and 25+6 weeks of pregnancy who are \\nin established labour, involve a senior obstetrician in discussions with the pregnant \\nwoman/person and their family members or carers about how to monitor the fetal \\nheart rates. \\n Offer continuous CTG to pregnant women/people with a twin pregnancy who are in \\nestablished labour and are more than 26 weeks pregnant. Intermittent auscultation \\nshould not be offered. Ensure: \\n- A dual channel CTG monitor is used to allow simultaneous monitoring of \\nboth fetal hearts. \\n- Document on the CTG and in the clinical records which CTG trace belongs \\nto which baby. \\n- Monitor the maternal pulse electronically and display it simultaneously on \\nthe same CTG trace. \\n- Consider separating the fetal heart rates by 20 beats/minute if there is \\ndifficulty differentiating between them. \\n- Consider fetal scalp electrode on first twin once membranes have been \\nruptured. \\n \\n15.1.1 Review of CTGs \\n \\nClassify and interpret cardiotocography in line with Fetal Monitoring Guideline taking into \\naccount that: \\n \\n Twin pregnancy should be considered a fetal clinical risk factor when classifying a \\nCTG trace as ‘abnormal’ versus ‘non-reassuring’. \\n Fetal scalp stimulation should not be performed in twin pregnancy to gain \\nreassurance after a CTG trace that is categorised as ‘pathological’. \\n Carry out systematic assessments of both CTGs at least hourly, and more \\nfrequently if there are concerns. \\n- Document which CTG trace belongs to which baby. \\n- Be aware of the possibility of monitoring the same baby twice. At each CTG \\nreview, ensure that twin synchronicity is not occurring. \\n \\n15.1.2 Management based on CTGs in twin pregnancies \\n \\nIf abdominal monitoring is unsuccessful or there are concerns about synchronicity of the fetal \\nhearts: \\n Involve a senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \\n Apply a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby (only after 34 weeks and if there are \\nno contraindications) while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby. \\n Perform a bedside ultrasound scan to confirm both fetal heart rates. \\n If monitoring remains unsatisfactory, consider a caesarean section. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 21 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nIf the cardiotocograph trace is categorised as ‘suspicious’ in the first baby during \\nestablished labour: \\n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \\n Correct any reversible causes. \\n Apply a fetal scalp electrode to the first baby (only after 34 weeks and if there are \\nno contraindications) while continuing abdominal monitoring of the second baby. \\n \\nIf the cardiotocograph trace is categorised as 'pathological' in the first baby during \\nestablished labour: \\n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \\n Discuss with the pregnant women/people and their family members or carers the \\npossible use of fetal blood sampling of the first baby from 34 weeks if the benefits \\nare likely to outweigh the potential risks. They should be made aware that if a \\nblood sample cannot be obtained then they are likely to need a caesarean section. \\n If the results of fetal blood sampling are not available within 20 minutes or fetal \\nblood sampling is contraindicated, offer an immediate caesarean. \\n \\nIf the CTG trace is categorised as ‘pathological’ in the first baby during the second stage of \\nlabour: \\n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \\n Assess whether an assisted vaginal birth is an option. \\n If vaginal birth is not an option or cannot be achieved within 20 minutes, offer an \\nimmediate caesarean section. \\n \\nIf the CTG trace of the second baby is categorised as 'suspicious’ or ‘pathological’ during \\nestablished labour before the first baby is born: \\n Involve the senior obstetrician and senior midwife. \\n If vaginal birth of the second baby cannot be achieved within 20 minutes, discuss \\nperforming a caesarean section with the pregnant woman/person and their family \\nmembers or carers. \\n \\nAcute TTTS can occur in labour in MCDA twins; therefore a low threshold for CS is \\nadvisable if any CTG abnormalities occur. \\n \\n15.2 Analgesia \\n \\nChoice of analgesia should be discussed with the pregnant woman/person and taking note of \\ntheir preference and should have been discussed antenatally at 28weeks. \\n \\n15.3 Second stage \\n \\n The anaesthetist, theatre team and labour ward coordinator should be informed \\nwhen the pregnant woman/person reaches second stage. \\n Second stage events must be clearly documented by the clinician leading the birth. \\n The first twin may be delivered by a midwife, as for singleton birth, with the \\nobstetric registrar / consultant present in the room. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 22 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n Syntocinon infusion (refer to Induction of Labour Guideline) should be ready for \\npossible uterine inertia following birth of the first twin. \\n \\n15.4 Birth of second twin \\n \\n Active management of the birth of twin 2 has been reported as the major factor in \\nreducing morbidity and the need for caesarean section. There is no definite \\nevidence about safe interval between the birth of first and second twins when there \\nis no suspected fetal compromise; but there are reports of an increase in poor \\noutcome for the second twin if delayed beyond 45 minutes. \\n Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be continued and if there is \\n‘suspicious’ or ‘pathological’ CTG trace, and vaginal birth cannot be achieved \\nwithin 20 minutes, discuss performing a caesarean section with the pregnant \\nwoman/person and their family members or carers. \\n After birth of the first twin, a longitudinal lie should be maintained in the second \\ntwin by holding the abdomen until the presenting part is fixed in the pelvis. \\n The lie of the second twin should be assessed, by a senior experienced \\npractitioner, using abdominal palpation, vaginal examination if necessary and/or a \\nportable scan. \\n If not longitudinal, the lie should be corrected either by external cephalic version \\nor by internal podalic version. Both of these manoeuvres are more successful \\nwith epidural analgesia. \\n Should birth not be imminent after 30 minutes, consider transferring the pregnant \\nwoman/person to theatre to avoid unnecessary delay of twin 2. \\n A Syntocinon infusion can be used to augment uterine activity once the lie is \\nlongitudinal if contractions are inadequate. This infusion should be made up and \\nready to administer required in the room. \\n Syntocinon should only be used if clinically indicated and not as a routine \\nprocedure (MBRRACE-UK, 2021). \\n When longitudinal lie and regular contractions have been established, pushing \\nshould be recommenced when the presenting part is visible or there is an urge to \\npush. \\n Artificial rupture of membranes should be performed only when the presenting part \\nis fixed in the pelvis. \\n If breech presentation – birth should be by a practitioner competent in breech \\nbirths/obstetric registrar. The obstetric consultant should be informed or present. \\n \\n15.5 Third stage \\n \\n Active management of third stage should be strongly advised. \\n Syntocinon infusion 40 units in 500ml 0.9%NaCl is recommended following birth of \\nthe second twin, to be infused over 4 hours at 125mls/hr, to prevent uterine atony. \\n Delayed/ deferred cord clamping is recommended by 1-3 minutes after birth to \\nallow placental transfusion, unless the need for neonatal resuscitation is \\nrecognised. The timing of cord clamping does not appear to have a major impact \\non blood loss at the time of birth. Ensure that the cords are clearly differentiated, \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 23 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nfor example one clamp at the cut end of the cord for twin 1 and two clamps for \\ntwin 2. \\n Consider double clamping the cord to allow umbilical cord blood gases to be \\nsampled. Ensure that blood gas samples are correctly labelled for each baby. \\n \\n15.6 Anticipation and prevention of infant hypoglycaemia \\n \\nNeonatal Hypoglycaemia should be considered to establish risk factors for the babies in line \\nwith Guideline for Neonatal Hypoglycaemia Including Reluctant Feeder. \\n \\n16.0 Postnatal care: special considerations where one, both or all babies \\n have died. \\n \\n If there has been a fetal loss of either or both twins or all triplets the Bereavement \\nCare Pathway should be followed as well as routine postnatal care (as appropriate) \\nand referral made to Birth Afterthoughts if wanted - CG1120 Intrauterine death \\nguideline \\n For placental histology, ensure the pathologist is provided with a complete clinical \\nhistory when requesting post-mortem or placental examination. In cases of twin \\npregnancy, this should be clearly indicated on the request, including chorionicity and \\ndetails of the other twin should the examination be requested separately or if there is \\na surviving sibling. \\n Discussion regarding placental examination should be fully documented. \\n If one twin survives, ensure community midwives visiting in the community are \\naware of the stillbirth or NND of the other twin. \\n If indicated a six week follow-up an Obstetric Consultant appointment should be \\nmade to discuss events and future pregnancies.

PREGADAY commenced today (aware risk of constipation and \\nstool colour change). \\n \\nBirth discussed, vaginal birth not recommended if twin 1 is anything other than cephalic. \\nEpidural available if wishes, may make manipulation of twin 2 less uncomfortable, enables \\nquicker birth if, instrumental birth or emergency LSCS needed. \\n \\nPotential for vaginal birth / LSCS if concerns with twin 2 (affects 10% twin sets). \\n \\nDelayed cord clamping routine if twins in good condition, as is skin to skin for both. \\n \\nColostrum harvesting recommended from 36 weeks onwards. \\n\\nDCDA only \\n \\nUSS 4 weekly from 20 weeks. \\n \\nDCDA aim for birth at 37 weeks. \\n\\nMCDA only \\n \\nUSS – 2 weekly from diagnosis. \\nTwin to twin transfusion syndrome discussed - 10% of MCDA pairs, most commonly occurs \\nat 17 - 24 weeks, referred up to St Georges, option for laser ablation at stage 3 and above \\n(33% 2 twin survival / 33% 1 twin survival / 33% no survival). \\n \\nSymptoms: \\nSudden abdominal distension, abdominal pain, breathlessness, inability to lie on back, \\nreduced fetal movements. \\n \\nAim to deliver at 36 weeks. \\n\\nMode of birth \\n \\nVaginal birth \\n \\nBenefits: Less bleeding, less infection, reduced risk of breathing difficulty in baby (TTN/RDS), \\nprotects uterus for future pregnancy, less pain after birth, can have epidural if wishes. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 33 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nRisks: Unpredictable, induction can be a lengthy process and may not work, does not \\nremove risk of emergency Caesarean for either twin (10% will have SVD/LSCS). \\n \\nMethod: Continuous monitoring of both fetal hearts (may need scalp electrode), after birth of \\ntwin 1, twin 2 will be manually held in longitudinal lie, may need ECV, will have USS to \\nconfirm presentation, will have Synto infusion for uterine inertia if needed, heart monitoring of \\ntwin 2. \\n \\nCaesarean section \\n \\nBenefits: Planned procedure, no pain during procedure, removes risk of twin 1 SVD / twin 2 \\nLSCS. \\n \\nRisks: Bleeding, infection, include injury to bladder / vessels / bowel / ureters/ fetal injury. \\nTTN and admission to SCBU (will be given corticosteroids to reduce risk), more pain \\nfollowing birth, may labour prior to date, permanent scar to uterus. Higher risk of VTE. \\n \\nInduction \\n \\nBenefits: Reduces risk of stillbirth, encourages vaginal birth. \\n \\nRisks: Prolonged procedure, increased risk of emergency Caesarean compared with \\nspontaneous onset of labour. \\n \\nMethod: Ripen cervix, then ARM & Syntocinon drip. \\n\\nCG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022 Page 34 of 38 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\nAppendix 7: Placental Histology \\n\\n□ Admission to NICU (>37/40) for >4hours \\n□ Apgar <7 at 5 minutes \\n□ Cord pH <7.0 \\n□ Prematurity <34/40 \\n□ IUGR <3rd centile (on GROW) \\n□ Suspected chorioamnionitis (pyrexia ≥38◦C) – \\nsend swab to microbiology as well. \\n□ Placental abruption \\n□ Morbidly adherent placenta (not other MROP) \\n□ Abnormal appearance of placenta eg tumour \\n\\n□ Stillbirth or early neonatal death \\n□ MTOP (if requested by screening) \\n \\nIf yes to any of the above: \\n1.

Your task is to analyze if the given clinical note follows the specified guideline and suggest improvements.\",\n  \"guideline_id\": \"cg1126-multiple-pregnancy-and-birth-pdf\",\n  \"guideline_title\": \"CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth\"\n}\n\nA: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth Guideline v6.1 June 2022) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document detailed counseling regarding risks/benefits of vaginal vs. cesarean delivery for this growth-discordant twin pregnancy (22% discordance).  \n   Reason: Guideline 13.0 states significant size discordance should be considered when discussing mode of birth. The note mentions planning for CS if Twin B becomes compromised but doesn't document prior counseling about risks of vaginal delivery with discordance.\n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider referral to tertiary fetal medicine center given 22% growth discordance (Twin B at 10th centile).  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.0 recommends referral for EFW discordance ≥25% with any baby <10th centile. While this case is at 22%, the borderline value and preterm labor risk warrant specialist input.\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Document explicit discussion about neonatal outcomes at 32 weeks, including NICU admission risks and potential long-term complications.  \n   Reason: Guideline 7.1 requires discussion of preterm birth risks by 28 weeks, including neonatal unit admission. The note mentions pediatric team alert but not parent counseling details.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document whether aspirin was prescribed given twin pregnancy + gestational diabetes (high pre-eclampsia risk).  \n   Reason: Guideline 12.1 recommends aspirin for multiple pregnancies with additional moderate/high risk factors like diabetes.\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Consider adding documentation about colostrum harvesting advice (from Appendix 6 discussion points).  \n   Reason: While not critical, Appendix 6 recommends discussing this from 36 weeks in twins to prepare for potential preterm birth.\n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Specify whether umbilical artery Dopplers were performed during growth scans.  \n   Reason: Guideline 9.0 recommends Doppler assessment with growth discordance, but the note only mentions \"bloods normal.\"\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Improved documentation** - Consider adding labels (Twin A/B) to CTG documentation for clarity.  \n   Reason: Guideline 15.1.1 emphasizes clear CTG trace labeling, though the note does mention \"both with good variability.\"\n\nThe clinical note generally follows guideline recommendations well, particularly regarding:\n- Appropriate tocolysis, steroids, and MgSO4 administration\n- Continuous monitoring and preparation for operative delivery\n- Exclusion of TTTS\n- Multidisciplinary team involvement\n\nThe most critical gap is the lack of documented counseling about delivery mode options specific to growth-discordant twins, as this significantly impacts shared decision-making. The borderline growth discordance also warrants consideration of tertiary center referral.\n\n--- Token Usage Report ---\nPrompt tokens: 20402\nCompletion tokens: 588\nTotal tokens: 20990\nEstimated cost: $0.010495",
