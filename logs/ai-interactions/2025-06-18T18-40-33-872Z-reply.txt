Document declined tests. - **Individualized Care:** Tailor care to each woman’s needs, involving partners if desired. Provide unbiased information and language support as needed. - **Screening & Tests:** Offer blood/urine tests, discuss blood product consent, and ensure proper documentation. Monitor for UTIs (urinalysis at each visit) and refer recurrent cases. - **Risk Assessment:** Update at each visit, referring high-risk women to consultants/specialists (e.g., mental health, safeguarding, FGM support). - **Lifestyle Advice:** Address smoking cessation, alcohol use, and weight management (BMI <30). - **Fetal Monitoring:** Track growth and wellbeing; refer for growth scans if concerns arise. Manage common pregnancy issues (e.g., nausea, bleeding). - **High-Risk Groups:** Closely monitor minority ethnic, deprived, or migrant women; ensure medical history review and additional support. - **Continuity & Coordination:** Maintain consistent care, clear communication, and accessible environments. Refer unexplained bleeding (<16 weeks to EPAC; ≥16 weeks to labour ward). - **Documentation:** Ensure records include test results, risk assessments, and specialist referrals. *References: MBRRACE-UK 2023; UK NSC guidelines.*",
