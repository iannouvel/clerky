It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing midwives, healthcare assistants, and pediatricians. Key actions include anticipating hypothermia in at-risk infants, performing observations, and taking prompt measures. Midwives should recognize risk factors, maintain a warm environment, and promote skin-to-skin contact. Immediately after birth, dry the baby, ensure skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding. For low temperatures, use skin-to-skin contact, monitoring, and a hot cot if needed. Skin-to-skin contact stabilizes heart rate, temperature, and supports feeding. When using a hot cot, keep it switched on, monitor temperature closely, and gradually reduce heat once stable. Continue care by discontinuing monitoring if temperature normalizes and focusing on feeding. Parents should be informed about monitoring and management. Audit processes are detailed in the Maternity Audit Document",
