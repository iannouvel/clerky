Check bile acids and LFTs at 4 weeks postpartum; investigate persistent abnormalities. - **Recurrence & Contraception:** Advise recurrence risk; recommend progesterone-only/non-hormonal contraception. Refer for consultant-led care in future pregnancies. - **Audit:** Monitor adherence to birth timing and fetal monitoring recommendations",
