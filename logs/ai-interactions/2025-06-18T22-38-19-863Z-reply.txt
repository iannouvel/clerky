Acutely ill cases require early emergency/maternity team involvement. - **Obstetric Problems:** - <14 weeks: A&E assessment + EPU referral. - ≥24 weeks: Urgent A&E review + obstetric registrar referral. - **Postnatal Problems:** Under midwife care → DAU/Triage; others → GAU/A&E. - **Ectopic Pregnancy:** Must be excluded in women of childbearing age with unexplained abdominal pain. - **Non-Obstetric Problems:** Stabilize first, then involve obstetric team. - **Perimortem Caesarean:** Part of resuscitation for arrests in late pregnancy. - **Ambulance Services:** Direct high-risk cases to labor ward. - **Other Admissions:** Medical admissions require obstetric team discussion. - **Compliance:** Monitored via Trust auditing processes.
