  "response": "Since the provided \"clinical transcript\" does not contain any actual clinical information but rather appears to be a system notification about missing content in guidelines, I cannot generate a clinical note from it.  \n\nTo proceed, please provide the actual clinical transcript containing the patient's history, examination findings, or physician discussion. A proper clinical note requires details such as:  \n- Patient demographics (age, sex)  \n- Presenting complaint(s)  \n- Relevant history  \n- Examination findings  \n- Physician assessment/plan  \n\nWithout these, I cannot generate a meaningful clinical summary. Let me know if you'd like to provide the correct transcript.",
