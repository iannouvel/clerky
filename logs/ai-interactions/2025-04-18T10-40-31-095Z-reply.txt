A: Here is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guidelines, along with the HTML-formatted note with suggested adjustments and guideline references:

### Guidelines Referenced:

1. **BJOG - 2017 - Management of Breech Presentation**  
   - "External cephalic version (ECV) should be offered to all women with an uncomplicated breech presentation from 36 weeks’ gestation, after discussion of risks and benefits. Success rates are approximately 50%. Contraindications include placenta praevia, fetal compromise, or ruptured membranes. Vaginal breech delivery may be considered in selected cases, but elective caesarean section is recommended if ECV is unsuccessful or declined, particularly in nulliparous women or those with additional risk factors (e.g., advanced maternal age)."

2. **UHSussex - MP046 - Management of Breech and ECV**  
   - "ECV should be performed after 37 weeks in nulliparous women unless there are specific indications for earlier intervention. A pre-procedure CTG and ultrasound are mandatory to confirm fetal wellbeing and exclude contraindications (e.g., fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios). Cervical assessment is not routinely required unless labour is suspected. Patient counseling must include success rates, risks (e.g., cord entanglement, placental abruption), and alternative delivery options."

3. **UHSussex - MP019 - Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy**  
   - "Women with pre-existing hypertension should have blood pressure monitored at least every 2 weeks during pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia should be excluded if new-onset hypertension or proteinuria develops. Antihypertensive therapy should be adjusted to maintain BP <140/90 mmHg."

4. **GTG 2016 - Epilepsy in Pregnancy**  
   - (Not applicable to this note, as the patient does not have epilepsy.)

<p>
  <strong>Summary:</strong> <br>
  - Age: 50 <br>
  - BMI: 28.8 <br>
  - Gravida 1, Para 0 (currently pregnant, no prior deliveries) <br>
  - Presenting complaint: Breech presentation at 36 weeks gestation <br>
  - No significant pain, contractions, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage <br>
  - Concerns about delivery risks and interest in ECV <br>
  - PMH: Hypertension (controlled), hypothyroidism <br>
  - No gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia <br><br>

  <strong>Details:</strong> <br>
  - Breech presentation first noted at 34-week scan, with no prior ECV attempted. <br>
  - Fetal movements normal, no signs of fetal compromise. <br>
  - Patient anxious about ECV discomfort and seeks clarity on delivery options. <br>
  - Examination findings: Fundal height consistent with dates, breech palpable, fetal heart rate normal (140 bpm). <br>
  - <i>Cervical status not yet assessed (not routinely required unless labour is suspected)</i> (UHSussex - MP046). <br>
  - ECV counseling includes success rates (~50%) and risks (e.g., transient fetal bradycardia). <br>
  - <i>Vaginal delivery possible if ECV successful; elective caesarean recommended if ECV unsuccessful or declined (given nulliparity and maternal age)</i> (BJOG - 2017). <br><br>

  <strong>Plan:</strong> <br>
  1. <i>Offer ECV at 37 weeks (rather than 36) after confirming fetal wellbeing (CTG, ultrasound)</i> (UHSussex - MP046). <br>
  2. Counsel on ECV risks, success rates, and contraindications. <br>
  3. Arrange obstetric review for ECV consent and planning. <br>
  4. Schedule follow-up scan to reassess presentation. <br>
  5. Provide patient information leaflet on breech management. <br>
  6. Assess cervical status and exclude contraindications (e.g., placenta praevia). <br>
  7. Document patient’s final decision post-counseling. <br>

### Key Adjustments and Rationale:
1. **ECV Timing**: Adjusted from 36 to 37 weeks for nulliparous women (UHSussex - MP046).  
2. **Cervical Assessment**: Clarified that it is not routinely required (UHSussex - MP046).  
3. **Delivery Plan**: Reinforced recommendation for elective caesarean if ECV fails (BJOG - 2017).  

No adjustments were needed for hypertension management, as the note already states it is controlled (UHSussex - MP019 was referenced but not applied). The epilepsy guideline (GTG 2016) was irrelevant to this case.
