They should be informed they can opt for screening later and will be contacted for further discussion.

Negative results do not guarantee protection; repeat testing can be requested. - **Positive Results:** Confirmatory testing is done in a designated lab. Key staff are notified, and women are referred to specialists within 10 working days.
