    "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 35-year-old G4P2+1 at 28+5 weeks gestation with major placenta previa and recent bleeding episode requiring management\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Ahmed has known complete placenta previa diagnosed at 20-week anomaly scan, where placenta was noted to completely cover the cervical os. She has been managed with pelvic rest and regular monitoring. Yesterday evening she experienced sudden onset bright red vaginal bleeding, described as 'heavy like a heavy period' lasting approximately 20 minutes before settling. No associated pain, no contractions, good fetal movements felt. This is her second bleeding episode - first was at 24 weeks requiring overnight observation. Obstetric history: 2 previous caesarean sections (emergency then elective), 1 first trimester miscarriage requiring ERPC. Significant risk factors for placenta previa include previous uterine surgery and maternal age. She has been compliant with activity restrictions and regular antenatal care.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, patient appears well, slightly anxious about bleeding. Vital signs stable: BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temp 36.6°C. Abdomen soft, non-tender, fundal height 29cm. No current bleeding visible, small clots in pad from earlier episode. No abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern with baseline 145 bpm, good variability, no decelerations. Recent ultrasound confirms complete placenta previa with placental edge 0mm from internal os. No evidence of placental abruption. Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (down from 11.4 g/dL last month), other bloods normal. Kleihauer-Betke test negative (Rh positive mother).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Admission for observation and surveillance given significant bleeding episode. IV access established, cross-match for 4 units of blood. Antenatal corticosteroids administered for fetal lung maturity given risk of early delivery. Strict bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization if no further bleeding. Daily monitoring with CTG and maternal observations. Serial hemoglobin monitoring. Emergency caesarean section if further significant bleeding occurs. Elective caesarean section planned for 36-37 weeks if no further complications. Anesthetic consultation arranged given high-risk nature and potential for emergency delivery. Blood transfusion service informed of high-risk patient.\n\nApply these changes:\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: specific corticosteroid regimen documentation\" with \"Document the specific corticosteroid regimen administered (dexamethasone phosphate 24mg IM or betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix 24mg IM) and timing relative to potential delivery\" (Reason: The guideline specifies: 'The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly.' This documentation is critical for this patient at 28+5 weeks with placenta previa and bleeding, as it confirms proper administration and timing for maximal fetal benefit if delivery occurs within 7 days.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Gap: no documentation of counseling about corticosteroid risks/benefits\" with \"Document detailed counseling regarding: 1) Benefits (reduced neonatal respiratory distress and mortality) 2) Risks (neonatal hypoglycemia, potential long-term metabolic effects) 3) Timeframe of effectiveness (maximal benefit if delivery occurs 24h-7d post-administration)\" (Reason: The guideline emphasizes informed discussions: 'Women should be informed about...potential risks and benefits of corticosteroids.' For this high-risk patient with recurrent bleeding, explicit documentation of counseling is essential given the significant neonatal benefits (reduced RDS and mortality) and potential risks that require monitoring.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Serial hemoglobin monitoring\" with \"Serial hemoglobin monitoring every 12-24 hours initially given active bleeding risk and drop from 11.4 to 10.8 g/dL\" (Reason: While not explicitly stated in the corticosteroid guideline, this modification aligns with general high-risk pregnancy management principles for placenta previa with active bleeding. The hemoglobin drop indicates significant blood loss, warranting closer monitoring in this specific case to guide potential transfusion needs.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: documentation of fetal growth assessment\" with \"Document fetal growth percentile from most recent ultrasound to assess for growth restriction\" (Reason: The guideline specifies: 'Women should be informed about the lack of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in small-for-gestational-age babies.' While not urgent, documenting growth status is relevant for this high-risk pregnancy as it may influence counseling about corticosteroid efficacy and neonatal monitoring needs.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",
