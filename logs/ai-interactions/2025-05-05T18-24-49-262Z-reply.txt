Delivery: - Expedited delivery via cesarean section due to maternal instability and non-reassuring fetal status. 3. Monitoring: - Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line if available). - Serial labs (CBC, coagulation panel, ABG). 4.

A: **Summary:**  
- 30-year-old G2P1 at 39+2 weeks gestation.  
- BMI: 36.3.  
- Acute onset of severe dyspnea and hypotension during second stage of labor.  
- Profound hypotension (BP 70/40 mmHg), altered mental status, and fetal heart tracing with prolonged decelerations.  
- No prior history of clotting disorders or allergies.  

**Details:**  
- Ms. Doe developed acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and confusion during labor, with oxygen saturation at 82% on room air.  
- Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia (HR 130 bpm) and weak pulses, while respiratory exam noted tachypnea (RR 32).  
- Neurologic assessment showed confusion and sluggish pupillary response.  
- No uterine tenderness or documented signs of DIC.  
- High suspicion for amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) given acute collapse, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.  
- Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, or hemorrhage, but AFE is most likely.  
- Family counseled on critical nature and high mortality/morbidity risk of AFE.  

**Plan:**  
1. Immediate resuscitation: multidisciplinary team activation, airway management, high-flow oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and blood products if DIC confirmed.  
2. Expedited delivery via cesarean section due to maternal instability and non-reassuring fetal status.  
3. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line if available) and serial labs (CBC, coagulation panel, ABG).  
4. Transfer to ICU post-delivery.  
5. Hematology consult for coagulopathy management.  
6. Social work support for family.
