She is currently 10 weeks pregnant (by last menstrual period) and is concerned about recurrent miscarriage.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- The patient reports intermittent dark-brown vaginal bleeding, occasionally mixed with fresh red blood, for the past 2 weeks.  \n- She describes cramping lower abdominal pain, worse on the left side, but no fever or foul-smelling discharge.  \n- No history of trauma or recent intercourse preceding symptoms.  \n- She has had 3 prior pregnancies:  \n  - First pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery at age 16 (no complications).  \n  - Second pregnancy: Miscarriage at 8 weeks (spontaneous, no intervention).  \n  - Third pregnancy: Full-term vaginal delivery 6 months ago (no complications).  \n- She has not used contraception since her last delivery.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No known chronic medical conditions.  \n- No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  \n- No previous hospital admissions (other than deliveries).  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- No prior surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche at age 12.  \n- Regular cycles (28-day cycle, 5-day duration) prior to current pregnancy.  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections (last screen negative 1 year ago).  \n- No abnormal cervical screening history.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- No regular medications.  \n- Takes over-the-counter paracetamol occasionally for headaches.  \n- No current use of folic acid or prenatal vitamins.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- No known drug allergies.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works part-time in retail.  \n- Lives with her partner and 2 children.  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 15).  \n- Occasional alcohol (1-2 units/week).  \n- Denies recreational drug use.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- She is worried this may be another miscarriage and fears complications due to her rapid repeat pregnancies.  \n- She wants to know if the pregnancy is viable and if she needs any treatment.  \n- She is also concerned about the impact of smoking on her pregnancy.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General appearance: Well, no pallor or distress.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, mild suprapubic tenderness, no guarding/rigidity.  \n- Speculum exam: Small amount of dark blood in vaginal vault, closed cervical os.  \n- Bimanual exam: Uterus slightly enlarged (consistent with 10 weeks), mild left adnexal tenderness, no palpable masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Threatened miscarriage** – Given history of bleeding and pain but closed os, pregnancy may still be viable.  \n2. **Possible subchorionic haemorrhage** – Could explain intermittent bleeding.  \n3. **Risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome** – Rapid repeat pregnancy, smoking, lack of prenatal vitamins.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Urgent ultrasound** – To confirm viability, rule out ectopic pregnancy, and assess for subchorionic haemorrhage.  \n2. **Serial beta-hCG monitoring** – If ultrasound is inconclusive.  \n3. **Advice:**  \n   - Pelvic rest (avoid intercourse/tampons).  \n   - Start folic acid and prenatal vitamins.  \n   - Smoking cessation support (referral to cessation program).  \n   - Close follow-up in early pregnancy clinic.  \n4. **Emotional support** – Counselling regarding recurrent pregnancy loss risks and contraception options post-recovery.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review ultrasound results within 48 hours.  \n- Return if bleeding worsens or severe pain develops.  \n\n---  \n\n**Second Scenario – Complex Gynaecological Issue**  \n\n**Patient Details:**  \nName: [Fictional Name – e.g., \"Ms. Y\"]  \nAge: 18 years  \nWeight: 52 kg  \nBMI: 20  \nNumber of prior pregnancies: 3 (G3P1A2 – 1 live birth, 2 miscarriages)  \n\n**Presenting Complaint:**  \nSevere dysmenorrhea and heavy menstrual bleeding for 6 months, worsening in the last 2 cycles.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Periods last 7-8 days, with flooding/clots.  \n- Pain starts 2 days before bleeding, radiates to back/thighs, not relieved by NSAIDs.  \n- Associated fatigue and dizziness (possible anaemia).  \n- No intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding.  \n\n**Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:**  \n- Anaemia (treated with iron supplements in past).  \n- No surgeries.  \n- Previous copper IUD inserted 1 year ago (removed 3 months ago due to pain).  \n\n**Drug/Allergy/Social History:**  \n- Takes ibuprofen for pain (limited relief).  \n- No allergies.  \n- Student, single, sexually active (1 partner, uses condoms inconsistently).  \n- Non-smoker, no alcohol/drugs.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- Mild pallor.  \n- Abdomen: Soft, tender suprapubically.  \n- PV exam: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Secondary dysmenorrhea** – Possible adenomyosis/endometriosis given refractory pain.  \n2. **Menorrhagia with iron deficiency anaemia** – Needs haemoglobin check.  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Bloods** – FBC, ferritin, coagulation screen.  \n2. **Pelvic ultrasound** – Rule out structural causes.  \n3. **Trial of hormonal therapy** – Combined oral contraceptive pill or progesterone-only options.  \n4. **Gynaecology referral** – If symptoms persist for laparoscopy.  \n\n**Follow-Up:**  \n- Review blood results and ultrasound.  \n- Discuss long-term contraception if desired.  \n\n---  \n\n**Note:** This dictation is entirely fictional for testing purposes.
