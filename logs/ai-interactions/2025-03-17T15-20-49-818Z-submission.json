She also describes intermittent pelvic pain, especially during menstruation, which has been progressively worsening.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Hypertension\n- Type 2 Diabetes\n- Obesity\n- Depression\n\nPast Surgical History:\n- Cesarean section x 4\n\nGynecological History:\n- Regular menstrual cycles prior to the onset of heavy bleeding\n- No history of abnormal pap smears\n- No history of sexually transmitted infections\n\nDrug History:\n- Metformin\n- Lisinopril\n- Sertraline\n\nAllergy History:\n- No known drug allergies\n\nSocial History:\nMrs. Doe is an office manager, married with four children. She denies tobacco or alcohol use.\n\nIdeas, Concerns, and Expectations:\nMrs. Doe is concerned about the impact of her symptoms on her daily life and is interested in finding a solution to alleviate her heavy bleeding and pelvic pain.\n\nExamination Findings:\nOn examination, Mrs. Doe appears uncomfortable due to pelvic tenderness. Abdominal examination reveals no masses or organomegaly. Pelvic examination shows a bulky, tender uterus with no adnexal masses palpated.\n\nManagement Advice and Guidance:\nBased on Mrs. Doe&#x27;s history and examination findings, the heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain are likely due to conditions such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis. Further investigations such as an ultrasound and possibly an MRI may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the interim, management options may include:\n1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief\n2. Oral contraceptives or hormonal IUDs to help regulate menstrual bleeding\n3. Tranexamic acid to reduce heavy bleeding\n4. Referral to a gynecologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical options if needed.\n\nMrs. Doe should also be counseled on lifestyle modifications to help manage her conditions, including weight loss to improve her overall health and potentially reduce symptoms.\n\nFollow-up:\nMrs. Doe will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review investigation results and discuss further management options.\n\nDictated by: Dr. A. Smith\nSigned: [Electronic Signature]\nDate: [Today&#x27;s Date]",
