It applies to all caregivers of newborns, emphasizing prevention, monitoring, and timely intervention. **Key Recommendations:** - **Prevention:** Anticipate hypothermia in at-risk infants; maintain a warm environment, encourage skin-to-skin contact, and ensure drying after birth. - **Immediate Post-Birth Care:** Dry the baby, initiate skin-to-skin contact, and encourage feeding to stabilize temperature. - **Management of Hypothermia:** Use skin-to-skin contact, continuous monitoring, and a hot cot if needed (keep it pre-warmed, monitor closely, and gradually reduce heat). - **Ongoing Care:** Discontinue monitoring once temperature stabilizes; prioritize feeding. - **Parental Communication:** Explain procedures and monitoring to parents. - **Audit:** Compliance and outcomes are tracked via the Maternity Audit Document. Staff must use professional judgment while adhering to these guidelines",
