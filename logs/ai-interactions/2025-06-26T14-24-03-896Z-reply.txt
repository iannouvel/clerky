such as a patient controlled analgesia pump (PCA) and the facility to monitor ECG, \nas well as access to resuscitation equipment. \n \n6.0 Monitoring and observations following general anaesthesia \n \nAfter any procedure involving a general anaesthetic, a healthcare professional with airway \nskills should carry out continuous, one-to-one observation of the woman/person until they \nhave regained airway control, is haemodynamically stable, and is able to \ncommunicate. \n \nUnless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise, this period of continuous observation \nshould be carried out in theatre by the obstetric anaesthetist responsible for the case. \n \nOnce the above criteria have been met, care may then be handed over to an appropriately \ntrained member of staff for ongoing care prior to discharge from the recovery area. \n \nAll observations carried out by the anaesthetist or theatre recovery staff should be recorded \non the anaesthetic chart. Once the woman/person’s care is handed over to the midwife, \nobservations should be recorded on the MEOWS chart. \n \nAs a minimum the following observations should be recorded every 5 minutes for the first \n15 minutes, and recorded on the Maternity Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) chart. \nThe MEOWS instructions should be followed for abnormal observations (see Recognition \nand Management of the Severely Ill Pregnant Woman guideline). \n \n• Level of consciousness (using AVPU as per MEOWS chart). \n• Heart rate. \n• Blood pressure. \n• Respiratory rate. \n• Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. \n• Verbal pain. \n• Vaginal bleeding. \n• Overall appearance (well or unwell). \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 6 of 13 \n\nThese observations, if stable should then be recorded ½ hourly for 2 hours. Following this, \nhourly observations should continue until the pre-discharge from recovery checklist criteria \nwithin the Obstetric Theatre record is met, before commencing 4 hourly observations. This \npre-discharge checklist must be fully completed including date and time of assessment prior \nto discharge to the Postnatal Ward. \n \nAny red or 2 yellow MEOWS scores must be actioned according to MEOWS escalation \nprocess. \n \nThe following observations should be closely monitored and documented: \n \n• Nausea/vomiting. \n• Wound-bleeding from operation site, wound drains. \n• Uterine fundus. \n \nTemperature should be recorded ½ hourly for the first 2 hours. \n \nUrine output should be recorded hourly for the first 2 hours. The obstetrician and \nanaesthetist should be informed if urinary output falls below 30mls per hour on 2 consecutive \noccasions. \n \nThese observations, if stable for 2 hours can be reduced to 4 hourly. \n \n7.0 Monitoring and observations following regional anaesthesia \n \nAfter any procedure carried out under a spinal or epidural anaesthetic, a healthcare \nprofessional should carry out continuous one-to-one observation of the woman/person until \nthey are haemodynamically stable (for example when pulse and blood pressure have \nreturned to baseline values). \n \nAs a minimum the following observations should be recorded every 5 minutes for the first \n15 minutes, and recorded on the Maternity Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) chart. \nThe MEOWS instructions should be followed for abnormal observations (see ‘Recognition \nand Management of the Severely Ill Pregnant Woman guideline). \n \n• Level of consciousness (using AVPU as per MEOWS chart). \n• Heart rate. \n• Blood pressure. \n• Respiratory rate. \n• Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. \n• Verbal pain. \n• Vaginal bleeding. \n• Overall appearance (well or unwell). \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 7 of 13 \n\nThese observations, if stable should then be recorded ½ hourly for 1 hour. Following this, \nhourly observations should continue until the pre-discharge from recovery checklist criteria \nwithin the Obstetric Theatre record is met, before commencing 4 hourly observations. This \npre-discharge checklist must be fully completed including date and time of assessment prior \nto discharge to the Postnatal Ward. \n \nAny red or 2 yellow MEOWS scores must be actioned according to MEOWS escalation \nprocess. \n \nThe following observations should be closely monitored and documented: \n \n• Nausea/vomiting. \n• Wound-bleeding from operation site, wound drains. \n• Uterine fundus. \nAdditional observations to be recorded hourly for the first two hours: \n \n• Urine output - Obstetrician and Anaesthetist should be informed if urinary output \nfalls below 30mls per hour on 2 consecutive occasions. \n• Temperature. \n \nThese observations, if stable for 2 hours can be reduced to 4 hourly. \n \nA woman who has received spinal or epidural diamorphine who is deemed to be at a higher \nrisk of respiratory depression (for example, a significantly raised BMI, or diagnosed \nobstructive sleep apnoea syndrome) should receive for the first 12 hours: \n \n• Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. \n \nHourly monitoring of: \n \n• Respiratory rate. \n• Heart rate. \n• Blood pressure. \n• Temperature. \n• Pain. \n• Sedation (AVPU). \n \nIf the woman remains stable, routine 4 hourly observations may continue after this point. \n \n7.1 Straight-leg raise \n \nStraight-leg raise should be used as a screening tool to assess motor block during recovery \nfrom a spinal anaesthetic or epidural top-up. If the woman/person is unable to straight-leg \nraise at 4 hours after the last dose of epidural/spinal local anaesthetic, the anaesthetist \nshould be urgently called to perform an assessment.

Delayed detection of symptoms and signs may be exacerbated by delay in \nclinical diagnosis and referral for appropriate imaging which would be an MRI scan.\n7\n\nWomen/people should be informed of the likely timescale (3 to 5 hours) for resolution of \ntheir neuraxial block and encouraged to alert staff should this be delayed. \n \nThe anaesthetist should be called to assess the patient if there is any residual sensory loss \nin the next 12-24 hours of recovery. They should be called immediately if there is any \nworsening of sensory loss or a return of motor weakness after a return of normal function.\n7\n\n8.0 Ongoing care in the recovery area \n \n• Care should be taken to ensure that intravenous cannulas are patent and that \nintravenous fluids and other medications are administered and recorded as \nprescribed. \n• If the woman/person’s condition necessitates a return to theatre for such \nprocedures as laparotomy, the Obstetric Consultant on call must be asked to \nattend. \n• The woman/person must not be left unattended with the baby unless fully \nconscious and alert. \n• Additional support should be provided to help the woman/person in caring for and \nfeeding her baby. \n• Recovery care after a general anaesthetic by the anaesthetist or recovery nurse \nshould be continued on the anaesthetic chart until full care is handed over to the \nmidwife. \n• Recovery care for regional anaesthesia, and care after handover from recovery \nstaff following general anaesthesia, should be documented in the Obstetric \nTheatre Care Record. \n \n9.0 Discharge and subsequent transfer to postnatal ward \n \nBefore any woman/person is discharged from the recovery area on Labour Ward, the \nmidwife/nurse should satisfy themselves of the following points: \n \n• The patient is conscious, can maintain a clear airway and protective reflexes are \npresent. \n• Breathing and oxygenation are normal. \n• The cardiovascular system is stable with no unexplained cardiac irregularity or \npersistent bleeding and that the woman is haemodynamically stable. \n• Adequate analgesia and anti-emetic provisions have been made. \n• Pressure dressings must be removed prior to transfer to the postnatal ward. \n• Dressings should be dry and intact and any drains should be secure and patent. \n• Uterus should be well contracted and lochia normal. \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 9 of 13 \n\nWhen the above criteria are met and documented in the Obstetric Theatre Record, the \npatient should be transferred to the postnatal ward on a clean bed and accompanied by a \nsuitably trained health care professional. \n \nFollowing anaesthesia, women/people should remain on clear fluids only until IV Syntocinon \nis discontinued. \n \n10.0 Pressure area care \n \nAlthough pressure ulcers can occur in any patient, the biggest risk factor in maternity is \nhaving limited mobility - i.e. those that have had regional or general anaesthesia. In order to \nprevent this damage, the following post-natal care is recommended: \n \n• Skin assessment and change of Inco pads at birth and then 2-3 hourly until woman is \nmobilising independently and is scoring “green” on the Maternity PURPOSE T risk \nassessment tool. \n• If scoring “red” for having a previous pressure ulcer, once mobilising independently \n(and otherwise scoring “green”), skin assessments should be performed 12 hourly \nuntil home. Repositioning should continue 1-2 hourly. \n• Keep Moving: Encourage/assist to reposition 1-2 hourly - if able to stand, the woman \nshould be encouraged to do so for at least 2 minutes. \n• Keep Moving: Once scoring “green”, women should be advised to mobilise/reposition \nregularly and pressure areas should be assessed at every post-natal check by a \nmidwife (or earlier if reporting any signs of compromised peripheral perfusion on her \npressure areas). \n• Keep Moving: Optimum maximum length of time spent in bed = up to 12 hours. \n• Incontinence/Moisture: Protect the skin from moisture with a barrier cream when \nrequired. \n• Incontinence/Moisture: cleanse the skin promptly after episodes of incontinence. \n \nFor further information, please refer to the Trust ‘Maternity Pressure Area Care’ guideline \nand the intranet page for all resources. \n \n11.0 Further postnatal care \n \nPostnatal observations of temperature, pulse and blood pressure should be recorded 4 \nhourly for 24 hours and then if normal, every 12hours (once a shift) until discharge, unless \nthere is any deviation from the norm. \n \nFor women/people who have undergone a caesarean section refer to: CG12030 Caesarean \nSection Birth Guideline. \n \nExtra support to help establish breastfeeding/infant feeding and with care of the baby should \nbe offered. \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 10 of 13 \n\nWomen/people with problems thought to be attributable to a complication of their anaesthetic \nshould be referred to the obstetric anaesthetist for review. This might include headaches, \nback pain, numbness or weakness in the legs, difficulty passing urine or opening bowels. \n \nIf symptoms persist for escalation to consultant obstetric anaesthetist. \n \nAnalgesia, anti-emetics and laxatives should continue as per trust guidelines determined by \nthe woman’s surgery, allergies and preferences. \n \nFor further guidance on routine postnatal care refer to: CG1134 Postnatal Care Guideline. \n \n12.0 Training \n \nStaff training for recovery care is evidenced in the Maternity Training Needs Analysis. \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 11 of 13 \n\n13.0 Audit/Monitoring \n \nSuggested audit points: \n \n• Regional anaesthesia: There is documented evidence of completion of the \nfollowing during recovery care - BP, Pulse, Respirations, O2 Saturations, Lochia, \nAVPU, verbal pain score and overall appearance recorded on the MEOWS chart at \nthe following intervals: \no 5 minutely for the first 15 minutes. \no Half hourly for the first hour. \no Hourly until final recovery criteria met. \no Straight-leg raise assessed at 4 hours. \no Any concerns with MEOWS chart are escalated appropriately. \n \n• General anaesthesia: There is documented evidence of completion of the following \nduring recovery care - BP, Pulse, Respirations, O2 Saturations, Lochia, AVPU, \nverbal pain score and overall appearance recorded on the MEOWS chart at the \nfollowing intervals: \no 5 minutely for the first 15 minutes. \no Half hourly for the two hours. \no Hourly until final recovery criteria met. \no Any concerns with MEOWS chart are escalated appropriately. \n \n• All recovery care: There is documented evidence of completion of the following: \no Hourly temperature recorded for the first two hours. \no MEOW score completed at each entry (red and yellow scoring). \no Fluid balance chart is completed with hourly urine outputs for first two hours \nand then four hourly if within normal limits. \n\nCG11103 Recovery Post Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline v10.0 October 2021 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \nPage 12 of 13 \n\nReferences \n \n1.

A: ### Very Important Recommendations  
**Different management plan** - Document a clear post-operative monitoring plan for neurological assessment (including straight-leg raise at 4 hours post-spinal anesthesia) and MEOWS charting frequency (5-minutely for first 15 minutes, then ½ hourly for 1 hour, then hourly until discharge criteria met).  
**Reason**: The guideline (CG11103, Section 7.1) mandates straight-leg raise assessment to screen for motor block complications, and Section 7.0 specifies monitoring intervals for regional anesthesia. The note lacks this detail, risking delayed detection of epidural hematoma or residual block.  

**Additional information needed** - Include a plan for post-CS urinary output monitoring (hourly for first 2 hours, with escalation if <30mL/hr on two consecutive readings).  
**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.0 requires hourly urine output monitoring to detect renal impairment or hypovolemia, critical in preeclampsia.  

### Somewhat Important Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on expected timeline for resolution of spinal anesthesia (3–5 hours) and symptoms requiring urgent reporting (e.g., worsening sensory loss).  
**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.1 emphasizes patient education to facilitate early detection of complications like epidural hematoma.  

**Additional information needed** - Document pressure area care plan (e.g., repositioning 1–2 hourly, skin assessments) due to immobility post-CS.  
**Reason**: Section 10.0 highlights pressure ulcer prevention for anesthetized patients, especially relevant with preeclampsia-associated edema.  

### Less Important Recommendations  
**Different management plan** - Specify post-CS analgesia/anti-emetics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs if no contraindications) and laxatives in the plan.  
**Reason**: Section 11.0 recommends standardized postoperative analgesia, though this is less urgent than hemodynamic monitoring.  

**Additional information needed** - Note plans for breastfeeding/infant feeding support post-CS.  
**Reason**: Section 11.0 advises extra support for feeding establishment, but this is secondary to maternal stabilization.  

### Unimportant Recommendations  
**Improved patient advice** - Mention anticipated discharge criteria (e.g., hemodynamic stability, clear fluids tolerance).  
**Reason**: Section 9.0 lists discharge criteria, but this is minor compared to acute monitoring needs.  

**Note**: The clinical note aligns well with acute management of severe preeclampsia but lacks granularity for post-anesthesia recovery per CG11103. Prioritize adding neurological monitoring, MEOWS documentation, and urinary output tracking.
