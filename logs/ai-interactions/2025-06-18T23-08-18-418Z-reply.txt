Conflicts may arise from guideline deviations, unacknowledged concerns, or disagreements on management. Key principles include timely response, multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement, patient inclusion, clear communication, and thorough documentation. Tools like MEOWS, NEWTT, CTG stickers, SBAR, and PAUSES aid conflict resolution. Escalation involves senior staff and MDT discussion, focusing on optimal patient outcomes. Essential skills include facilitating respectful dialogue and refocusing on patient safety. Incident reports monitor conflicts. Safety emphasizes respectful communication, freedom to raise concerns, and seeking support. The on-call consultant holds ultimate clinical and legal accountability",
