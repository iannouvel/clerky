She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.\nRelevant Obstetric History:\nPrevious pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.\n\n\nNo history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.\n\n\nNo history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.\n\n\nRelevant Medical History:\nMild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).\n\n\nNo known liver or gallbladder disease.\n\n\nMedications & Allergies:\nCurrently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband and toddler son.\n\n\nNon-smoker; does not consume alcohol.\n\n\nWorks part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.\n\n\nExamination Findings:\nGeneral: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.\n\n\nAbdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.\n\n\nTwins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.\n\n\nNo uterine tenderness or signs of labour.\n\n\nNo peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.\n\n\nNotable Omissions (for testing purposes):\nNo documented baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods.\n\n\nNo record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.\n\n\nNo documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nImpression:\n Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.\nManagement Plan:\nInvestigations:\n\n\nSerum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.\n\n\nFasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.\n\n\nFull blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).\n\n\nCTG to assess fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nGrowth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers if not done in past 2 weeks.\n\n\nMedical Management:\n\n\nStart ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg BID while awaiting results.\n\n\nConsider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.\n\n\nOngoing Care and Delivery Planning:\n\n\nWeekly bile acids and LFTs.\n\n\nIncrease surveillance: twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans.\n\n\nAim for delivery at 36–37 weeks if bile acids <100 µmol/L.\n\n\nConsider earlier delivery if bile acids ≥100 µmol/L or evidence of fetal compromise.\n\n\nCounseling Provided:\n\n\nDiscussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.\n\n\nReassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.\n\n\nAdvised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.\n\n\nProvided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.\n\n\nDictated by: Dr. [Fictional Name] Patel\n Date: [Fictional Date]\n--Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real patient data or medical advice is contained herein.\n\n\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n## Analysis Against Guidelines\n\n### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Different management plan** - Avoid routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) unless for symptomatic relief, as it does not improve perinatal outcomes.  \n   Reason: The guideline states \"Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP\" and \"Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes.\"  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Reduce the frequency of CTG and growth scans, as they do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.  \n   Reason: The guideline explicitly states \"Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised.\"  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Clearly counsel the patient that UDCA is for symptom relief only and does not reduce stillbirth risk.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes that treatments do not improve pregnancy outcomes, and patients should understand this to make informed decisions.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available, as this helps establish a reference for comparison.  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends baseline measurements in subsequent pregnancies to establish normal levels.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing with a hepatologist if bile acids are very high or presentation is atypical.  \n   Reason: The guideline advises seeking specialist hepatology advice for severe, very early, or atypical presentations.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clearer counseling on the increased risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, with advice on monitoring.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that women with ICP have a higher chance of these conditions and should be monitored.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider checking for steatorrhea or fat malabsorption symptoms before initiating vitamin K.  \n   Reason: The guideline states vitamin K is not routinely recommended unless symptoms like steatorrhea are present.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer written information on ICP recurrence risk in future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: The guideline notes that women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a more detailed social history (e.g., support system during pregnancy).  \n   Reason: While useful for holistic care, this is not a specific guideline requirement.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide links to ICP support groups (e.g., ICP Support and RCOG).  \n   Reason: The guideline lists these as useful resources, but this is not critical for clinical management.  \n\n### Summary of Key Adjustments Needed:\n- **Stop routine UDCA use** unless strictly for symptom relief.  \n- **Reduce unnecessary CTG/growth scans** and focus on bile acid monitoring and fetal movement awareness.  \n- **Improve counseling** to clarify the limitations of treatments and additional risks (e.g., pre-eclampsia).  \n- **Consider hepatology referral** if bile acids are very high or presentation is atypical.  \n\nThese changes align the note with the guideline’s emphasis on avoiding over-investigation/unproven treatments while ensuring appropriate risk communication.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 58 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
