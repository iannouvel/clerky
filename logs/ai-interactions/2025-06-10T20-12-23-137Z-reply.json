Smith, OB/GYN  \n**Patient:** Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  \n**Age:** 32 years  \n**Gestational Age:** 28 weeks  \n**Weight:** 68 kg  \n**Last Menstrual Period:** [Fictional Date]  \n**Chief Complaint:** Decreased fetal movements over the past 48 hours  \n\n### **History of Present Illness:**  \nMs. Doe is a 32-year-old G2P1 at 28 weeks gestation who reports a noticeable reduction in fetal movements over the last two days. She describes her baby as typically active, with regular movements felt daily, but now perceives only 2-3 faint movements in a 12-hour period. No associated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or fluid leakage. She denies recent trauma, illness, or fever.  \n\n**Past Obstetric History:**  \n- Previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 39 weeks (male infant, 3.4 kg).  \n- No history of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or prior fetal growth restriction.  \n\n**Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Mild asthma (well-controlled, uses salbutamol PRN).  \n- No known hypertension, diabetes, or thrombophilia.  \n- No prior surgeries.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- Occasional salbutamol inhaler  \n\n**Allergies:** NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, no alcohol or recreational drug use.  \n- Works as a teacher, moderate physical activity.  \n\n*(Note: Incomplete history—did not inquire about family history of clotting disorders, prior stillbirth, or detailed dietary habits.)*  \n\n### **Examination Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/72 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- Temp: 36.8°C  \n- RR: 16/min  \n\n**Abdomen:**  \n- Fundal height: 26 cm (slightly small for dates)  \n- Leopold’s maneuvers: Fetus in cephalic presentation  \n- Fetal heart rate: 142 bpm (Doppler)  \n- No uterine tenderness or palpable contractions  \n\n*(Note: Incomplete exam—no documentation of maternal weight trend, no urinalysis performed, no assessment for edema.)*  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \n**Concern for possible placental insufficiency** given:  \n- Decreased fetal movements (potential marker of fetal compromise).  \n- Fundal height lagging by 2 cm (possible early growth restriction).  \n- No other clear etiology identified at this time.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Immediate Fetal Monitoring:**  \n   - Arrange for a **non-stress test (NST) and biophysical profile (BPP)** to assess fetal well-being.  \n   - If abnormal, consider urgent ultrasound for Doppler studies (umbilical artery resistance).  \n\n2. **Maternal Surveillance:**  \n   - Monitor BP trends for signs of preeclampsia (though currently normotensive).  \n   - Consider baseline labs (CBC, renal function, coagulation screen) if high suspicion.  \n\n3. **Patient Counseling:**  \n   - Advised to perform **daily fetal kick counts** and present immediately if <6 movements in 2 hours.  \n   - Low threshold for re-evaluation if symptoms worsen.  \n\n4. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Repeat growth scan in 2 weeks to assess interval fetal growth.  \n   - If placental insufficiency confirmed, may need increased surveillance or early delivery depending on severity.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Patient to return in 1 week for repeat assessment or sooner if concerns arise.  \n- Dictated by: Dr. A. Smith (for fictional testing purposes only).  \n\n---  \n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional clinical scenario for educational/testing use only. No real medical advice is given. Always follow institutional protocols and complete assessments in real practice.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Antenatal Care Guideline\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the NICE 2021 Antenatal Care guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n**Additional information needed** - Inquire about family history of clotting disorders, prior stillbirth, and detailed dietary habits.  \nReason: The guideline emphasizes comprehensive history-taking to identify risk factors for complications like placental insufficiency (NICE 2021, sections on risk assessment for pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and venous thromboembolism).  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Perform urinalysis for proteinuria and assess for edema.  \nReason: The guideline recommends offering a urine dipstick test for proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment to screen for pre-eclampsia (NICE 2021, section on routine antenatal clinical care).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Advise the patient to avoid sleeping on her back after 28 weeks and explain the potential link to stillbirth.  \nReason: The guideline specifically recommends discussing sleep position after 28 weeks to reduce the risk of stillbirth (NICE 2021, section 1.3.25-1.3.26).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Assess risk factors for domestic abuse and female genital mutilation (FGM) in a sensitive manner.  \nReason: The guideline highlights the importance of addressing inequalities and safeguarding concerns (NICE 2021, sections on addressing inequalities and social history).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Discuss birth preferences and provide information on preparing for labor and postnatal care.  \nReason: The guideline recommends starting discussions about birth preferences before 28 weeks and providing comprehensive information (NICE 2021, sections 1.3.14-1.3.16).  \n\n**Different management plan** - Consider offering a lumbopelvic belt if the patient reports pelvic girdle pain.  \nReason: The guideline suggests non-rigid lumbopelvic belts for pelvic girdle pain, though this is not critical in this case (NICE 2021, section on interventions for common problems).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Document maternal weight trend and consider nutritional counseling.  \nReason: The guideline discusses the importance of nutrition and diet in antenatal care, though this is less urgent (NICE 2021, section 1.3.9).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Offer information about local peer support services.  \nReason: The guideline recommends discussing peer support to reduce isolation, though this is not critical (NICE 2021, sections 1.3.23-1.3.24).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - Inquire about access to antenatal classes.  \nReason: The guideline mentions antenatal classes but does not prioritize this for high-risk cases (NICE 2021, section on information and support).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed information on heartburn management if symptomatic.  \nReason: The guideline covers heartburn interventions, but this is not relevant to the current presentation (NICE 2021, section on common problems).  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps  \nThe note lacks:  \n1. Urinalysis and pre-eclampsia screening (very important).  \n2. Sleep position counseling (very important).  \n3. Domestic abuse/FGM screening (somewhat important).  \n\nThese align with the guideline’s emphasis on comprehensive risk assessment and patient education.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 58 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Antenatal Care Guideline\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
