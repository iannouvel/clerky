Based on your history and examination findings, it appears that your symptoms may be related to a possible recurrence of endometriosis. I recommend further investigations such as an ultrasound and possibly a pelvic MRI to assess the extent of the disease. Depending on the results, we may need to consider medical management with hormonal therapy or surgical intervention. I will also refer you to a gynaecologist for a more detailed evaluation and management plan.
