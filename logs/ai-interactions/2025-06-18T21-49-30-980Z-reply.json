Assess feeding within the first week. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes to avoid teat confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Provide responsive feeding education, safe preparation instructions, and ready-made formula for medical needs. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Promote rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and safe sleeping practices (e.g., cot beside the bed). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Track supplementation rates, weigh newborns (birth/day 5/day 10), and refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Challenges:** Avoid unnecessary formula supplementation to protect milk supply and reduce infection/allergy risks. Emphasis is on individualized care, parental partnership, and maintaining breastmilk as the optimal nutrition\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
