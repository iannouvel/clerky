She denies associated pain but expresses concern given her family history of gynecological conditions.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Onset: First noticed spotting 4 months ago, occurring approximately twice monthly.  \n- Duration: Episodes last 1–2 days.  \n- Associated symptoms: No dyspareunia, pelvic pain, or urinary/bowel changes.  \n- Exacerbating/relieving factors: None identified.  \n- Previous episodes: None prior to menopause (age 52).  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (well-controlled on lisinopril).  \n- Osteopenia (no fractures).  \n- No history of diabetes or thromboembolism.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 24).  \n- No prior gynecological surgeries.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche: Age 12.  \n- Menopause: Age 52 (no HRT use).  \n- Parity: G1P1.  \n- Contraception: Previous COCP use (discontinued age 50).  \n- Cervical screening: Up to date (last smear 2 years ago, normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD.  \n- Calcium/vitamin D supplementation.  \n- No NSAIDs or anticoagulants.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Retired teacher.  \n- Smoking: Never.  \n- Alcohol: Occasional glass of wine (1–2/week).  \n- Exercise: Regular walking.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- The patient is anxious about cancer due to a cousin with endometrial cancer.  \n- She hopes to \"rule out anything serious\" and seeks clarity on management options.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- General: Well-appearing, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  \n- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- Speculum: Small amount of old blood in vault; cervix appears normal.  \n- Bimanual: Uterus normal size, mobile, non-tender; adnexae clear.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Postmenopausal bleeding** (PMB) in a 61-year-old with BMI 23.4 and 1 prior pregnancy.  \n- Differential includes **endometrial hyperplasia** (aligned with GTG 2014 guidelines for PMB investigation) or atrophy.  \n- Low clinical suspicion for malignancy but requires exclusion.  \n\n**Management Plan (per GTG 2014 Endometrial Hyperplasia Guidelines):**  \n1. **Urgent imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness.  \n   - If endometrial thickness ≥4 mm → outpatient hysteroscopy + biopsy.  \n   - If <4 mm and bleeding resolves, consider atrophic cause.  \n2. **Biopsy**: Pipelle endometrial sampling during hysteroscopy to exclude hyperplasia/cancer.  \n3. **Lifestyle advice**: Maintain healthy BMI (23.4 is optimal; no weight-related risk).  \n4. **Follow-up**:  \n   - If histology shows **non-atypical hyperplasia**: Consider progesterone therapy (e.g., Mirena IUS) + 6-month follow-up biopsy.  \n   - If atypical hyperplasia → discuss surgical options (hysterectomy).  \n5. **Patient reassurance**: Emphasized that most PMB is benign but requires thorough evaluation.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- TVUS scheduled for next week.  \n- Patient advised to report any worsening bleeding/pain.  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician’s Name]  \n**Date:** [Redacted]  \n\n---  \n*This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only.
