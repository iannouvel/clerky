The patient meets criteria for OPH referral (section 2.1) due to persistent AUB >3 months in a woman >40 years with potential benefit from cavity assessment.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion if biopsy normal\" with \"Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion during outpatient hysteroscopy if biopsy normal\" (Reason: The guideline specifies that OPH appointments include 'insertion of Mirena coil if indicated' (section 9.1). Since this patient has a history of IUD expulsion and meets OPH criteria, combining these procedures would be efficient. The guideline supports this approach for patients with AUB where endometrial assessment is needed (section 2.1).)\nACCEPT: Replace \"If hysteroscopy is required, use vaginoscopic approach with miniaturised hysteroscope (≤3.5mm) and saline distension at lowest effective pressure\" with \"If outpatient hysteroscopy is performed, document: scope size (≤3.5mm), vaginoscopic approach, saline distension medium, pressure used, and any interventions\" (Reason: The guideline requires 'standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings' (Additional Considerations). This patient meets OPH suitability criteria (section 3.1) and the detailed documentation aligns with protocol requirements for procedure quality assurance.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: documentation of patient's ability to tolerate speculum examination\" with \"Document confirmation of patient's ability to tolerate speculum examination (required for OPH suitability per section 3.1.2)\" (Reason: The guideline specifies 'She is able to tolerate a speculum examination' as a key suitability criterion for OPH (section 3.1.2). While the PV exam was performed, this specific tolerance assessment should be explicitly documented as it directly impacts OPH feasibility.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Provide written information to the patient prior to hysteroscopy appointment\" with \"Provide standardized written information about outpatient hysteroscopy prior to appointment, including procedure details, benefits/risks, pre-procedure analgesia advice, and unit contact details\" (Reason: The guideline mandates 'Written patient information should be provided before the appointment' (section 1.4). This expansion ensures all required elements are covered, which is particularly important as this patient is new to OPH (previous IUD was inserted under different circumstances).)\nACCEPT: Replace \"If hysteroscopy is planned, recommend pre-procedure NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid 500mg 1 hour prior) and consider TENS as first-line analgesia options\" with \"If outpatient hysteroscopy is planned, implement pre-procedure analgesic regimen: paracetamol 1g PO, codeine 30mg PO, and diclofenac 100mg PR 1 hour prior (per Appendix B)\" (Reason: The guideline provides specific analgesic protocols in Appendix B. For this patient with no NSAID contraindications, following the standardized regimen for Myosure morcellation (though not planned) provides adequate coverage for diagnostic OPH. This replaces the less specific NSAID recommendation.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

### **SITUATION:**  
**Patient Demographics:**

- **Gestation:** N/A (G4P2, previous SVD x2, LSCS x1)  
- **Presenting Complaint:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) – heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) for 3/12, worsening over last 2/52.  
- **Key Clinical Issue:** Persistent AUB with associated fatigue (likely secondary to iron deficiency anemia). No hemodynamic instability at present.  

### **BACKGROUND:**  
**Relevant PMHx:**  
- **OBGYN Hx:**  
  - G4P2 (2x SVD, 1x LSCS for FTP, 1x TOP)  
  - Previous IUD (Mirena®) removed 6/12 ago due to expulsion  
  - No known fibroids or endometriosis  
- **Medical Hx:**  
  - Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 75mcg OD)  
  - Obesity (BMI 32)  
  - No known coagulopathy  
- **Surgical Hx:**  
  - LSCS (2018)  
  - Appendicectomy (2005)

- **Allergies:** NKDA  
- **Social Hx:**  
  - Non-smoker, occasional ETOH  
  - Works as a teacher, moderately active  

**Risk Factors for AUB:**  
- Obesity (↑ endometrial hyperplasia risk)  
- Hypothyroidism (may exacerbate HMB)  
- Previous IUD expulsion (possible structural cause)  

### **ASSESSMENT:**  
**Clinical Findings (0800 hours):**  
- **Vitals:**  
  - BP: 128/78 mmHg  
  - HR: 88 bpm (regular)  
  - Temp: 36.7°C  
  - SpO₂: 98% RA  
  - RR: 14/min  
- **General Exam:**  
  - Pale conjunctivae (clinical anemia)  
  - No signs of hemodynamic compromise  
- **Abdo Exam:**  
  - Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses  
- **PV Exam (consented & chaperoned):**  
  - No active bleeding at time of exam  
  - Cervix appears normal, no cervical excitation  
  - Uterus anteverted, non-tender, normal size  
  - No adnexal masses  
  - **Document confirmation of patient's ability to tolerate speculum examination (required for OPH suitability per section 3.1.2)**  

**Investigations:**  
- **Bloods (FBC, LFTs, U&Es, CRP, TFTs, coagulation screen):**  
  - Hb: 98 g/L (↓ from 112 g/L 6/12 ago)

    - Endometrial thickness: 12mm (heterogeneous)  
    - No fibroids/polyps seen  
    - Normal adnexa  
  - **Pipelle biopsy (awaiting histology)**  

**Differential Diagnosis (PALM-COEIN):**  
1. **Polyp/Adenomyosis** (USS inconclusive, biopsy pending)  
2. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (↑ risk due to obesity)  
3. **Coagulopathy** (unlikely given normal coagulation)  
4. **Ovulatory dysfunction** (secondary to hypothyroidism?)  
5. **Iatrogenic** (none identified)  

### **RECOMMENDATION:**  
**Immediate Management:**  
- **Iron supplementation:** Ferrous sulfate 200mg BD + vitamin C (monitor Hb in 4/52)  
- **Hormonal therapy:**  
  - Start norethisterone 5mg TDS for 21/7 (to regulate bleeding)  
  - **Consider Mirena® IUD reinsertion during outpatient hysteroscopy if biopsy normal**  
- **Analgesia:** Mefenamic acid 500mg TDS PRN (if dysmenorrhea)  

**Monitoring & Follow-Up:**  
- **Repeat Hb in 4/52** (target >110 g/L)  
- **Await endometrial biopsy results** (exclude hyperplasia/malignancy)  
- **GYN OPD follow-up in 6/52 with outpatient hysteroscopy planning including: written patient information provision, confirmation of speculum tolerance, safety checklist (pregnancy exclusion), consent discussion about potential pain, and arrangement of dedicated recovery area**  

**Further Investigations if Needed:**  
- **If outpatient hysteroscopy is performed, document: scope size (≤3.5mm), vaginoscopic approach, saline distension medium, pressure used, and any interventions**  
- **Thyroid antibody testing** if TFTs fluctuate  

**Contingencies:**  
- If hemodynamically unstable → admit for IV iron/transfusion  
- If biopsy shows hyperplasia → consider progestogens/hysterectomy (if completed family)  

**Additional Considerations:**  
- **Provide standardized written information about outpatient hysteroscopy prior to appointment, including procedure details, benefits/risks, pre-procedure analgesia advice, and unit contact details**  
- **If outpatient hysteroscopy is planned, implement pre-procedure analgesic regimen: paracetamol 1g PO, codeine 30mg PO, and diclofenac 100mg PR 1 hour prior (per Appendix B)**  
- **Ensure standardized documentation of hysteroscopic technique and findings if procedure is performed, including: scope size, approach (vaginoscopic), distension medium (saline), pressure, and any interventions**
