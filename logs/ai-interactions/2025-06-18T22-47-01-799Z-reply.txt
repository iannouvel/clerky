Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for peri-partum procedures. - **High-Risk Groups:** Specific interventions are advised for high-risk laboring women, elective cesarean sections (CS), and emergency CS. - **Risk Stratification:** Low-risk and high-risk factors for aspiration are defined to guide management. - **Prophylaxis:** Antacid prophylaxis (e.g., sodium citrate) is recommended. - **Oral Medications:** H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors may be used. - **Dietary Restrictions:** Clear fluid intake is permitted; solid foods should be avoided in labor. - **Fluid Guidelines:** Maintain hydration with oral fluids or IV therapy as needed. Key focus is on risk assessment, antacid use, and dietary management to reduce aspiration risk during delivery",
