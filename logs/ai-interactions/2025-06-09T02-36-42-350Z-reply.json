It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and referral for improved outcomes. Conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign ovarian masses, with referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings are key factors in assessing the risk of malignancy. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules can aid in estimating the risk of malignancy without relying solely on CA-125 levels. Women with specific ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy should be referred to a gynaecological oncology service. Other guidelines from the USA and Canada also provide recommendations for managing premenopausal women with pelvic masses. Asymptomatic women with small simple ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly.\n\nWomen with simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter should have yearly ultrasound follow-up, and those with larger simple cysts should be considered for further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or increasing ovarian cysts may warrant surgical management, especially in cases of mature cystic teratomas. Combined oral contraceptives do not help in the treatment of functional ovarian cysts. The laparoscopic approach is preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses, with lower morbidity and quicker recovery time. Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is less effective and has a high rate of recurrence. Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent potential malignancy. The possibility of removing an ovary should be discussed preoperatively. Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy after laparoscopic surgery and complications following surgery for ovarian cysts.\n\nThree-dimensional quantification of tumor vascularity as a tertiary test after B-mode and power Doppler evaluation for detection of ovarian cancer.

  "response": "### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Perform a pelvic ultrasound to assess for ovarian masses or structural abnormalities**  \nReason: The guideline emphasizes the importance of ultrasound evaluation for premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding to rule out ovarian masses or other structural pathologies. The current note mentions planning a pelvic ultrasound but does not document its completion or findings, which is critical for comprehensive evaluation (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62).  \n\n**Different management plan** - **Consider measuring serum CA-125 levels if an ovarian mass is detected on ultrasound**  \nReason: The guideline highlights the role of CA-125 levels in assessing the risk of malignancy in ovarian masses. If the planned ultrasound reveals an ovarian mass, CA-125 should be measured to calculate the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Inquire about family history of gynecological malignancies (e.g., ovarian, breast cancer)**  \nReason: Family history is relevant for assessing hereditary cancer risk (e.g., BRCA mutations), which may influence management decisions, including referral to a gynaecological oncologist if high-risk features are present (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - **Discuss the possibility of laparoscopic management if a benign ovarian mass is identified**  \nReason: The guideline recommends laparoscopic techniques for benign ovarian masses due to lower morbidity and faster recovery. Patient counseling should include this option if surgical intervention becomes necessary (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Document prior Pap smear history and HPV vaccination status**  \nReason: While not directly related to ovarian masses, this information provides a broader gynecological health context and may influence follow-up recommendations (general gynecological best practice).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - **Clarify that combined oral contraceptives (COCP) do not treat functional ovarian cysts**  \nReason: The guideline states that COCPs are ineffective for treating functional cysts. If cysts are detected, this should be communicated to avoid unrealistic expectations (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - **Include a more detailed social history (e.g., exercise habits, dietary patterns)**  \nReason: While potentially useful for holistic care, this is not directly relevant to the guideline’s focus on ovarian mass evaluation (general clinical note completeness).  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - **Provide written information on abnormal uterine bleeding**  \nReason: Although helpful for patient education, this does not directly impact guideline compliance (general patient-centered care).  \n\n### Summary of Critical Actions:  \n1. **Complete pelvic ultrasound** and document findings.  \n2. **Measure CA-125** if an ovarian mass is detected.  \n3. **Refer to gynaecological oncology** if malignancy is suspected (e.g., high RMI, suspicious ultrasound features).  \n4. **Avoid cyst aspiration** if surgery is planned (due to high recurrence risk and potential for spillage).  \n\nThese steps align with the guideline’s emphasis on structured evaluation, risk stratification, and appropriate referral for premenopausal women with potential ovarian pathology.",
