No dysuria or bowel symptoms.  \n- She has had **two prior pregnancies**:  \n  - First pregnancy at age 15 – **spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks**, birth weight 3.2 kg.  \n  - Second pregnancy at age 16 – **missed miscarriage at 10 weeks**, managed medically.  \n- No contraception currently in use.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** – diagnosed age 14 (based on oligomenorrhea and ultrasound findings).  \n- **Iron-deficiency anaemia** – previously treated with oral iron.  \n- **Depression** – on fluoxetine 20 mg daily.  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- None.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- **Sexually active** since age 14, multiple partners, inconsistent condom use.  \n- **Last menstrual period (LMP):** 2 weeks ago (heavy, prolonged).  \n- **Last cervical screening:** Never performed (under age for routine screening).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Fluoxetine 20 mg OD (depression).  \n- Occasional ibuprofen for pain (no regular analgesia).  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Lives with mother; estranged from father.  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day since age 15.  \n- Denies alcohol or recreational drug use.  \n- Limited physical activity due to mobility issues related to obesity.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Believes her symptoms are due to \"hormone imbalance\" and is worried about cancer.  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about weight affecting fertility and future pregnancies.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants help regulating periods and pain relief.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese, no pallor or lymphadenopathy.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic Examination (consent obtained):**  \n  - **Speculum:** Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions.  \n  - **Bimanual:** Uterus bulky, right adnexal tenderness (no palpable mass).  \n- **BP:** 128/82 mmHg, HR 88 bpm.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) secondary to PCOS** – Likely exacerbated by obesity and anovulation.  \n2. **Chronic Pelvic Pain** – Possible causes:  \n   - **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** – Given sexual history, though no fever/cervical motion tenderness.  \n   - **Ovarian pathology** (e.g., cyst, residual tissue from prior miscarriage).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - **Bloods:** FBC (anaemia), CRP (inflammation), HbA1c (insulin resistance), hormonal profile (LH/FSH, testosterone).  \n   - **Pelvic USS:** Assess endometrial thickness, ovarian morphology, exclude retained products.  \n   - **STI screen:** Chlamydia/gonorrhoea NAAT, HIV/syphilis serology.  \n2. **Immediate Treatment:**  \n   - **Progestogen therapy (e.g., norethisterone)** to regulate bleeding.  \n   - **Iron supplementation** (ferrous sulfate) for anaemia.  \n   - **Analgesia:** Paracetamol PRN (avoid NSAIDs if PID suspected).  \n3. **Long-term:**  \n   - **Contraception counselling:** Consider progesterone-only pill or implant (avoid oestrogen due to BMI/DVT risk).  \n   - **Weight management referral:** Dietitian + bariatric specialist input.  \n   - **Psychological support:** Reinforce mental health follow-up.  \n4. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review in 2 weeks with investigation results.  \n   - If PID confirmed: Treat with doxycycline + metronidazole.  \n\n**Patient Advice:**  \n- Encouraged smoking cessation (referral to youth support service).  \n- Safe sex counselling provided.  \n- Emergency contact details given if bleeding worsens.  \n\n**Prognosis:**  \n- Symptoms likely manageable with hormonal therapy and lifestyle changes.  \n- Requires close monitoring due to high-risk factors (obesity, prior pregnancies, PCOS).  \n\n**Dictated by:** [Clinician Name]  \n**Date:** [Redacted]  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional case for testing purposes only.
