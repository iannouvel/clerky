Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:

Examination Findings:
On examination, Mrs. Doe appears uncomfortable due to pelvic tenderness. Abdominal examination reveals no masses or organomegaly. Pelvic examination shows a bulky, tender uterus with no adnexal masses palpated.

Management Advice and Guidance:
Based on Mrs. Doe's history and examination findings, the heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain are likely due to conditions such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis. Further investigations such as an ultrasound and possibly an MRI may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

In the interim, management options may include:
1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief
2. Oral contraceptives or hormonal IUDs to help regulate menstrual bleeding
3. Tranexamic acid to reduce heavy bleeding
4. Referral to a gynecologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical options if needed.

Mrs. Doe should also be counseled on lifestyle modifications to help manage her conditions, including weight loss to improve her overall health and potentially reduce symptoms.

Follow-up:
Mrs. Doe will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review investigation results and discuss further management options.
