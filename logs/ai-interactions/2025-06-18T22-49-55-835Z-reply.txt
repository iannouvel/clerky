Key points: - **Recovery Setting**: Patients must recover in a designated area with one-to-one care by trained staff. - **Transfer Criteria**: Patients must be extubated, self-ventilating, oxygenated, and cardiovascularly stable before transfer. - **Handover**: Details of the procedure, anaesthesia, and post-op instructions must be communicated. - **Monitoring & Care**: Continuous observation for complications, pain management (regular analgesia and laxatives if opiates given), and MEOWS chart triggers for obstetric/anaesthetic review if abnormal. - **Emergency Actions**: Heavy bleeding/hypovolaemic shock triggers the Obstetric Haemorrhage pathway; oxygen therapy if SpOâ‚‚ <95%; inform anaesthetist if discharge criteria unmet. - **Discharge Criteria**: Patient must be conscious, cardiovascularly stable, with controlled pain and normal vitals. - **Documentation & Follow-up**: Assessments must be recorded; urinary catheter removed once mobile; refer to anaesthetist for anaesthesia-related complications. Pain relief is emphasized to prevent chronic pain or depression. Staff must escalate concerns promptly",
