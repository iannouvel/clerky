    "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 28-year-old G1P0 at 26+2 weeks gestation with newly diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus requiring management plan\n\nBACKGROUND: Miss Chen presented for routine 26-week antenatal appointment. She had been feeling well with no specific symptoms but mentioned increased thirst and frequent urination over the past 3 weeks, which she attributed to normal pregnancy changes. OGTT was performed due to risk factors including BMI 32 at booking, family history of type 2 diabetes (both parents), and South Asian ethnicity. She works in an office, has a sedentary lifestyle, and admits to poor dietary habits with frequent takeaways. Previous pregnancy history nil. No known drug allergies. Taking folic acid 5mg daily and pregnancy multivitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: OGTT results: fasting glucose 5.9 mmol/L (normal <5.6), 2-hour post-load 10.1 mmol/L (normal <7.8). Patient appears well, vital signs stable. Fundal height measures 27cm (appropriate for dates). Blood pressure 128/78 mmHg. Urinalysis shows 1+ glucose, no protein, no nitrites. Recent anomaly scan at 20 weeks was normal. Home glucose monitoring initiated showing morning readings 5.8-6.4 mmol/L, post-meal readings 8.2-9.8 mmol/L over past week.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Urgent diabetes team referral arranged for next week. Comprehensive dietary counselling provided with written information. Self-monitoring blood glucose recommended QDS (pre-meals and 2 hours post-meals). Growth and liquor scans arranged for every 4 weeks. Target glucose levels discussed: fasting <5.3 mmol/L, 2-hour post-meal <6.4 mmol/L. If dietary control inadequate after 2 weeks trial, metformin +/- insulin will be considered. Antenatal care intensified with 2-weekly visits. Delivery planning discussed - aim for vaginal delivery at 38-40 weeks if well controlled.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### CG1109 Diabetes in Pregnancy guideline\n\nSince the guideline content is not available (as noted in your message), I cannot provide specific recommendations tied to guideline references. However, I can provide general recommendations based on standard gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) management principles from major guidelines (e.g., NICE, ADA, RANZCOG). \n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document fetal movement assessment and discuss signs of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision) and hypoglycemia (e.g., sweating, dizziness).  \n   Reason: Essential for early detection of complications.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider earlier follow-up (e.g., 1 week instead of 2 weeks) given her elevated postprandial readings (8.2–9.8 mmol/L).  \n   Reason: Post-meal values >8.5 mmol/L may warrant earlier pharmacological intervention.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide clear instructions on when to seek urgent care (e.g., persistent hyperglycemia, reduced fetal movements).  \n   Reason: Critical for preventing adverse outcomes (e.g., macrosomia, stillbirth).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Assess for comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, PCOS) and previous HbA1c if available.  \n   Reason: Helps stratify risk and guide long-term follow-up.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer structured education on carbohydrate counting and portion control, not just general dietary advice.  \n   Reason: Improves glycemic control more effectively than generic advice.  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Discuss aspirin prophylaxis if additional risk factors for preeclampsia (e.g., BMI >30, ethnicity).  \n   Reason: Some guidelines recommend aspirin for GDM patients with other risk factors.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document detailed physical activity habits and barriers to exercise.  \n   Reason: Helps tailor lifestyle advice but may not change immediate management.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written resources in her preferred language (if non-English-speaking).  \n   Reason: Enhances adherence but may not be critical if she is fluent in English.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Record exact timings of glucose measurements (e.g., pre-breakfast vs. pre-lunch).  \n   Reason: Minor detail unlikely to alter management at this stage.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest specific brands of glucose monitors.  \n   Reason: Patient can choose any reliable device; brand preference is low-priority.  \n\n**Note:** To provide guideline-specific recommendations, the full guideline content (e.g., target glucose thresholds, monitoring frequency, delivery timing) would be required. The above suggestions align with general GDM best practices.  \n\nWould you be able to share the relevant sections of **CG1109**? This would allow for precise, guideline-congruent feedback.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 125 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: CG1109 Diabetes in Pregnancy guideline\n\n\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified. For each suggestion, include detailed context with relevant quoted text from the guideline to help the user understand the reasoning behind the recommendation.",
