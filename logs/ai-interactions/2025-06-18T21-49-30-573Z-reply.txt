      "newValue": "**Summary of Newborn Feeding Guideline:** - **Breastfeeding Support:** Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged, with 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. Mothers separated from babies should start expressing milk early. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) for small colostrum amounts; cup or tube feeding for larger volumes. Formula supplementation should be limited and responsive. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Mothers receive instructions on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is preferred in hospitals. - **Safety & Care Standards:** Emphasize safe sleeping (cot by bed, avoid sofas), rooming-in, and regular weight checks (birth, day 5, day 10). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative standards. - **Problem Management:** Feeding assessments, referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie), and incident reporting for re-admitted newborns. - **Parent Support:** Encourage skin-to-skin bonding, recognize feeding cues, and provide local parenting resources. *Focus: Promote breastfeeding, ensure safe alternatives, and support informed parental choices.* (200 words)",
