Patient: Hi, I&#x27;m here for my appointment today.

Healthcare Professional: Welcome! How have you been feeling since our last visit?

Patient: I&#x27;ve been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles and severe cramps.

Healthcare Professional: Have you noticed any changes in your flow or any unusual discharge?

Healthcare Professional: Have you been sexually active recently?

Patient: Yes, but I always use protection.

Healthcare Professional: It&#x27;s important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. We may need to perform a pelvic exam and some tests to investigate further.
