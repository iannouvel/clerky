Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss (most recent loss at 18 weeks). 2. Chronic pelvic pain (worsening over the past 6 months, particularly during menstruation). History of Presenting Complaint: - Recurrent pregnancy loss: - Three prior uncomplicated term deliveries. - One first-trimester miscarriage (managed expectantly). - One second-trimester loss at 18 weeks (no clear cause identified, no signs of infection or trauma). - No history of cervical insufficiency, but no prior cervical length assessments. - No known thrombophilia or autoimmune disorders. - Chronic pelvic pain: - Dull, aching pain, worse during menses and intercourse (deep dyspareunia). - No associated urinary&#x2F;bowel symptoms. - No recent weight loss or fever. Past Medical History: - Mild asthma (well-controlled, no recent exacerbations). - No diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders. Past Surgical History: - Appendectomy (age 20). - No prior gynaecological surgeries. Gynaecological History: - Menarche at 12, cycles regular (28-day intervals). - Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) with clots, no intermenstrual bleeding. - No prior STI diagnoses. - Last cervical smear: 2 years ago (normal). Drug History: - Salbutamol PRN for asthma. - Occasional ibuprofen for pelvic pain (limited relief). - No regular contraception (desires future pregnancy). Allergy History: - No known drug allergies. Social History: - Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units&#x2F;week). - Works as a teacher; moderate physical activity. - Stable relationship, supportive partner. Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations: - Ideas: Worried about undiagnosed cause for recurrent losses; concerned pelvic pain may indicate endometriosis. - Concerns: Anxious about future pregnancy viability. - Expectations: Wants investigations for recurrent loss and pain management options. Examination Findings: - General: Well-appearing, no pallor or distress. - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no masses. - Speculum: Healthy cervix, no discharge. - Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, mildly tender on cervical motion; no adnexal masses. Assessment: 1. Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss: Possible cervical insufficiency, thrombophilia, or anatomical factors. 2. Chronic pelvic pain: Suspect endometriosis or adenomyosis given cyclical pain and dyspareunia. Management Plan: 1. Recurrent loss workup: - Pelvic ultrasound (assess uterine anatomy). - Thrombophilia screen (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies). - Preconception counselling; consider cervical cerclage in future pregnancy if cervical insufficiency confirmed. 2. Pelvic pain: - Trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill or GnRH analogue if endometriosis suspected). - Diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist. 3. Patient education: - Discussed lifestyle modifications (e.g., pelvic floor exercises). - Provided reassurance and arranged follow-up in 4 weeks. Follow-Up: - Review investigation results. - Discuss further fertility&#x2F;pregnancy planning.

   - No prior cervical length assessments or thrombophilia workup.  
   - Plan includes pelvic ultrasound for uterine anatomy, thrombophilia screen, and preconception counselling.  
   - Cervical cerclage may be considered in future pregnancy if cervical insufficiency is confirmed.  

2. **Chronic pelvic pain**:  
   - Cyclical worsening during menses and deep dyspareunia, suggestive of endometriosis or adenomyosis.

   - Thrombophilia screen (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies).  
   - Preconception counselling; consider cervical cerclage in future pregnancy if indicated.

   - Trial of hormonal therapy (progesterone-only pill or GnRH analogue).  
   - Diagnostic laparoscopy if symptoms persist.  

3. Patient education:  
   - Lifestyle modifications (e.g., pelvic floor exercises).
