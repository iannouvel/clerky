Provide clean needles/safer sex advice for injectable drug users. - **Care Pathways:** Follow specific protocols for stimulants, cannabis, opioids, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Avoid abrupt cessation; stabilize use with support. - **Intrapartum Care:** Offer standard pain relief. Follow birth plan (maternal/neonatal urine toxicology if requested). Avoid mother-baby separation unless safety concerns exist. - **Postnatal Care:** Monitor for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Breastfeeding decisions are individualized; encourage expression/discard if substance use is recent. Ensure safeguarding assessments if needed. - **Disclosure at Admission:** If substance use is disclosed late, consult specialists (neonatology, obstetrics, addiction services) and test urine if required. - **Discharge Planning:** Confirm follow-up with community midwives/health visitors.
