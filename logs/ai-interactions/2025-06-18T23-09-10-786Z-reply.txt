High-risk pregnancies (e.g., pre-existing conditions, previous complications) should deliver in an obstetric unit. - **Informed Choice**: Women opting for homebirth against medical advice must be respected and referred to a consultant midwife for discussion. - **Risk Assessment**: Midwives must conduct ongoing risk assessments, document recommendations, and discuss emergency transfer plans. - **Intrapartum Care**: Requires two midwives, adherence to guidelines, and prompt transfer if complications arise (e.g., fetal distress, hemorrhage, prolonged labor). - **Freebirth**: Respectful communication is essential; safeguarding concerns must be addressed, and referrals made if needed. - **Staffing**: Homebirth services require two midwives; suspension occurs if staffing is unsafe. Geographic and travel safety must be considered. - **Postnatal Care**: Midwives provide immediate postnatal care, arrange newborn checks, and ensure emergency contact availability. - **Documentation**: All interactions, decisions, and transfers must be thoroughly documented. - **Equity & Rights**: Guidelines comply with equality and human rights principles. *Key exclusions for homebirth*: fetal distress, abnormal presentation, meconium-stained liquor, chorioamnionitis, postpartum hemorrhage, or neonatal complications requiring resuscitation",
