Midwives must adhere to a supervision framework, maintain professional boundaries, and manage potential conflicts of interest. Key responsibilities include understanding and applying the guidance, seeking advice if conflicts arise, and providing appropriate antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care. Failure to follow the procedure risks adverse outcomes for the mother or baby and may harm the midwifeâ€™s wellbeing. Compliance is monitored through annual appraisals and PMA supervision checks. The goal is to uphold safety and accountability while addressing the unique challenges of caring for personal contacts",
