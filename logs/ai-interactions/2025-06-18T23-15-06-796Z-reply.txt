Incidence: 1:100-200 births. **Key Causes**: Trapped placenta, uterine atony, full bladder, constriction ring, uterine abnormality, or morbidly adherent placenta (e.g., placenta accreta, 1:1500 births). **Management (No Active Bleeding)**: - Obtain consent for active management if physiological management fails after 60 minutes. - Catheterize bladder, encourage breastfeeding (to stimulate contractions), and position upright. - Unclamp cord to drain blood, transfer to hospital if at home. - Monitor vitals, keep nil by mouth, and avoid IV oxytocin unless bleeding. - If placenta remains undelivered after 30 minutes (active) or 60 minutes (physiological), assess for manual removal under regional/general anesthesia. **Management (Active Bleeding)**: - Start oxytocin infusion (40 units in 50ml NaCl 0.9% at 12.5ml/hour). - Prepare for manual removal in theatre, crossmatch 2 units blood, inform anaesthetist. - Follow PPH protocol, give IV Cefuroxime prophylaxis, and maintain fluid balance. **Responsibilities**: Staff must follow guidelines; divisions ensure accessibility and review",
