**Summary:**  
- Age: 16 years.  
- BMI: 42 (obese class III).  
- Presenting complaints: Irregular menstrual cycles, severe dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain.  
- History of two first-trimester miscarriages (age 14 and 15).  
- Diagnosed with PCOS at age 13.  
- No history of STIs or PID.  
- Sexually active with inconsistent condom use.  

**Detailed Description:**  
The patient reports irregular menstrual cycles since menarche at age 12, with cycles ranging from 21 to 45 days and heavy bleeding lasting 7-10 days.  
She experiences severe dysmenorrhea, described as cramping pain localized to the lower abdomen and radiating to the lower back, worsening over the past six months.  
She has a history of two first-trimester miscarriages, at ages 14 and 15, and no history of STIs or PID.  
PCOS was diagnosed at age 13, and she discontinued OCPs one year ago due to side effects (nausea and weight gain).  
She is sexually active with one partner and uses condoms inconsistently.  
The patient is concerned about her ability to conceive in the future and seeks treatment to regulate her cycles and reduce pain.  

**Plan:**  
1. Investigations:  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to assess for ovarian cysts or structural abnormalities.  
   - Hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin, TSH) to evaluate PCOS and rule out endocrine disorders.  
   - HbA1c and lipid profile to assess metabolic health.  

2. Lifestyle modifications:  
   - Referral to a dietitian for weight management and nutritional counseling.  
   - Encourage regular physical activity tailored to her fitness level.  

3. Medical management:  
   - Consider restarting OCP or alternative hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill) to regulate cycles and reduce dysmenorrhea.  
   - Discuss potential use of metformin to improve insulin sensitivity and support weight loss.  

4. Contraception and fertility counseling:  
   - Emphasize consistent condom use to prevent STIs and unplanned pregnancies.  
   - Discuss fertility preservation options and the impact of PCOS on future conception.  

5. Follow-up:  
   - Schedule follow-up in 4-6 weeks to review investigation results and adjust management plan.  
   - Offer psychological support or counseling to address concerns about fertility and recurrent miscarriages.
