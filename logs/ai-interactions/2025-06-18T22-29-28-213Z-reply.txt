      "newValue": "**Summary:** This guideline outlines staffing requirements for maternity services at Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) and Princess Royal Hospital (PRH), including midwifery, nursing, and support staff. Key points include: - **Staffing Ratios:** Supervisors of midwives maintain a 1:15 ratio with midwives, with three trainees supported annually. A 24/7 on-call rota is managed by senior staff. - **Staffing Levels:** Determined by local care models, case mix, and patient needs, using tools like *Birthrate Plus* and *Safer Childbirth* for evidence-based ratios. Skill mix distinguishes midwife-supported vs. midwife-replaced roles. - **Additional Roles:** Includes specialist midwives, governance, risk management, and practice development. Community staff receive travel time allowances. - **Leave & Absence:** Managed per sickness policy, with shortfalls addressed by Labour Ward coordinators via shift changes or bank staff. Unplanned workload increases require internal cover. - **Review & Compliance:** Annual staffing reviews ensure adherence to standards. Unresolved issues require a business case for funding. Compliance and contingency plans are audited annually. *(References: Birthrate Plus 2009, RCOG 2007 Safer Childbirth.)*",
