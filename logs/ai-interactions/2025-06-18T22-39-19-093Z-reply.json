Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU) for early pregnancy issues, DAU for 2nd/3rd trimester concerns. - **Referrals**: Community midwives/GPs refer to DAU; documentation must be complete. Direct admission to Delivery Suite if needed. - **Risk Assessment**: Maternal observations (BP, pulse, urinalysis) and fetal assessment (abdominal palpation, SFH, movements). CTG if reduced fetal movements ≥26 weeks. Registrar review required, with consultant discussion if concerns. - **Small for Dates**: Abnormal Doppler (UA PI >95th, MCA PI <5th) requires urgent consultant review, possible steroids, and delivery planning. Normal Doppler with AC ≤5th centile warrants fortnightly growth scans. - **Large for Dates (Non-Diabetic)**: No scan if >3cm above gestation without risk factors. Check for glycosuria; if positive, refer for GTT. Suspected polyhydramnios requires obstetric review and possible USS. - **Growth Scans**: Additional scans for high-risk maternal conditions, managed via consultant clinics or DAU. - **IOL (Induction of Labour)**: Follow MP033; low-risk pregnancies booked via BadgerNet. Urgent IOL (<72h) via MAU. - **GTT Booking**: Criteria-based referral (e.g., obesity/diabetes).
