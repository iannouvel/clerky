 which meets the thresholder diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in his history Kaylee has also had
 gallstones and it's been considered for a cystectomy however given that her symptoms resolved subsequent to her last pregnancy entirely and she's currently asymptomatic
 it may not be that the gallstones are provoking this race
 she's also got hypothyroidism and thyroxine

 antenna go from a prophylaxis from 28 weeks
 it's good diagnosis of gestational diabetes
tight controlled
 she just had a
 fetal cardiac ultrasound at the evalina due to difficulty at the anomaly scan obtaining adequate views they were also defining a difficult at the evilina and so they're unable to exclude small ventricular settle defects partial hue of intriculation to defects or minor valve or arterial abnormalities and as such I have suggested that maybe safer local delivery although they've specified Brighton where there is a
 new native care unit this may have been due to confusion the Evelina as to where she was due to deliver and they've advised cardiovascular examination including thermal checks for Limp and pre-imposed doctors saturations
 and a cardiology and Echo review within the first week either locally or the Evelina

 Monday
 at the time of birth she were to have preeclampsia would be from 37 weeks she's also got diabetes 37 plus 0 seems to reasonable and she's keen to get this done sooner rather than later
 so we've asked for her to be booked for that day
 and I'll clarify with my pediatric colleagues to whether or not she suitable for delivery of the Princess Royal Hospital
 and we suggested that she would begin on a postpartum mirin coil insertion which some of our doctors and consultants can do post nicely and they've talked for about the wrists and benefits including expulsion and long threads should that be feasible that'd be great otherwise follow up either with your Primary Care physician or sexual health clinic
 I'll prescribe for an expert here while admitted and to continue until the either has reduction of labor or goes into spontaneously
