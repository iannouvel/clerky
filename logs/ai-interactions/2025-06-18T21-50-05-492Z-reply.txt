      "newValue": "**Summary of Assisted Vaginal Birth Guideline:** - **Instrument choice:** Operators should select the most appropriate instrument (forceps or vacuum) for the first attempt. Vacuum extraction has a higher failure rate but less maternal trauma, while forceps are more effective but risk maternal injury. Vacuum does not increase cesarean rates or neonatal adverse outcomes. - **Risk factors for failure:** Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure:** Ultrasound is recommended if fetal head position is uncertain. - **Post-birth care:** Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document and plan postnatal follow-up. - **Psychological support:** Offer referral to midwife counselors for traumatic births but avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. - **Safety & reporting:** Units must support patients and staff after adverse events. Adhere to duty of candour and complete incident reports. Monitor auditable standards per RCOG guidelines",
