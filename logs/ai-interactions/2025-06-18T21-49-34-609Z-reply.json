Skin-to-skin contact aids initiation. Mothers separated from babies should express milk early. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) for small amounts; cup/tube feeding for larger volumes. Formula supplementation should be limited and responsive. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Mothers receive instructions on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is recommended for hospital use. - **Safety & Support:** Emphasize safe sleeping (cot by bed, avoid sofas) and parent-infant bonding. Rooming-in is encouraged. - **Monitoring & Referrals:** Weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Address feeding issues with assessments; refer complex cases (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly standards. - **Parent Education:** Recognize feeding cues, optimize positioning, and avoid nipple confusion. Supplement only if medically indicated, maintaining breastmilk supply. (Word count: 200)\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
