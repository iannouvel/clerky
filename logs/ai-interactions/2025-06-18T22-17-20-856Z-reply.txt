Key recommendations: - **Fundamentals of Care:** Ensure mothers/birthing parents stay with their baby in CCU, supported by a birth partner or maternity staff. - **Postnatal Care:** Promote mother-baby togetherness, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding support, and safe medication use. - **Infection Control:** Skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding help reduce infection risks. - **Older Infants (>24 hours):** Provide breast pumps and assistance. - **Sedated Patients:** Collaborative decision-making (birth partner, nursing, maternity staff) to facilitate baby contact if aligned with the motherâ€™s wishes. Applies to all CCU and maternity staff, with management ensuring guideline accessibility and review",
