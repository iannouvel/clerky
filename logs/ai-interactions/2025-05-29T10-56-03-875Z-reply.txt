A: ### Summary:  
- 36-year-old female, BMI 18.9.  
- G1P1, prior full-term vaginal delivery.  
- Presents with 4-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding (7–10 days, every 2–3 weeks).  
- Associated fatigue, occasional cramping.  
- No intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding.  
- Not sexually active in the past year.  
- Pale conjunctivae on exam; otherwise unremarkable pelvic exam.  

### Details:  
- Irregular bleeding pattern consistent with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), with differentials including ovulatory dysfunction (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorder), endometrial polyp, or perimenopausal changes.  
- Fatigue and pale conjunctivae suggest possible anemia, though iron studies or hemoglobin levels were not assessed.  
- No structural abnormalities noted on pelvic exam, but pelvic ultrasound is required to exclude underlying pathology.  
- Tranexamic acid was advised for symptomatic relief of heavy bleeding.  
- Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) was suggested for cycle regulation if no contraindications exist.  
- Patient reassured about the commonality of AUB but advised on the necessity of further evaluation.  

### Plan:  
Plan:  
1. Investigations:  
   - Full blood count (FBC) to assess for anemia.  
   - TSH and prolactin levels to evaluate endocrine causes.  
   - Pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural abnormalities.  
2. Symptomatic relief:  
   - Tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding.  
   - Consider COCP for cycle regulation if appropriate.  
3. Follow-up in 6 weeks with results; escalate to gynecology if bleeding worsens or anemia is confirmed.  
4. Advised to monitor for syncope or severe fatigue.
