This patient has confirmed endometriosis with refractory pain, making hormonal therapy an appropriate consideration. The guideline emphasizes tailoring treatment to symptoms and preferences rather than disease stage alone.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Laparoscopic excision + adhesiolysis (if MRI confirms DIE)\" with \"Laparoscopic excision (rather than ablation) + adhesiolysis by a specialist endometriosis surgeon if MRI confirms DIE\" (Reason: The guideline states: 'Perform surgery for endometriosis laparoscopically unless there are contraindications' and 'Consider excision rather than ablation to treat endometriomas.' Given this patient's history of ASRM Stage III disease and recurrent symptoms, excision by a specialist surgeon would be preferred over ablation for optimal outcomes.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Missing: fertility-focused counseling details\" with \"Provide detailed fertility counseling regarding impact of endometriosis on conception and timing of interventions, noting that hormonal treatment does not improve pregnancy rates\" (Reason: The guideline specifies: 'Do not offer hormonal treatment alone or in combination with surgery to women trying to conceive as it does not improve spontaneous pregnancy rates.' This patient is TTC for 18 months, making fertility counseling essential. The guideline emphasizes separating pain management from fertility considerations.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"MDT referral (Gynae, Fertility, Pain Team)\" with \"MDT referral to specialist endometriosis center (Gynae, Fertility, Pain Team) given complex disease with DIE suspicion\" (Reason: The guideline recommends managed clinical networks for complex cases: 'Ensure that pelvic MRI scans are interpreted by a healthcare professional with specialist expertise in gynaecological imaging.' This patient's suspected DIE and fertility concerns warrant specialist center involvement per guideline recommendations for complex endometriosis management.)\nACCEPT: Replace \"Repeat CA-125 post-treatment (monitor for malignant transformation risk)\" with \"Consider discontinuing routine CA-125 monitoring as it has limited utility in benign endometriosis management\" (Reason: While the transcript mentions CA-125 monitoring, the guideline does not recommend routine biomarker monitoring for benign endometriosis. The slightly elevated CA-125 (85 IU/mL) is likely due to endometriosis rather than malignancy risk in this context. Clinical and imaging follow-up would be more appropriate.)\n\nReturn the updated transcript with these changes applied.",

    - **CA-125** **85 IU/mL** (↑).  
  - **Awaiting:** MRI pelvis (requested for **DIE assessment**).
