Use appropriate-sized endotracheal tubes (ETT), masks, and drugs based on weight/gestation (detailed in Appendix 1). - **Drug Dosing**: Adrenaline (0.2 ml/kg IV/IO), bicarbonate (2–4 ml/kg of 4.2%), glucose 10% (2.5 ml/kg), and 0.9% sodium chloride (10 ml/kg) are key medications. Doses vary by weight (0.5–4 kg). - **Preterm Infants (<26 weeks)**: Individualized decision-making with parental involvement. Options include resuscitation, comfort care, or survival-focused care, based on gestational age and viability. - **Equipment Checklist**: Resuscitaire must include laryngoscopes, ETTs (sizes 2.5–4.0), suction catheters, masks (sizes 0–1), and umbilical clamps. Verify heater, oxygen supply, and clock functionality. - **Training**: Staff must be trained in neonatal resuscitation, with adherence to NMC professional standards.
