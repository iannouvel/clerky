      "newValue": "**Summary of NIPE Screening Guidelines:** - **Timing:** Perform within 72 hours of birth and repeat at 6-8 weeks. Parents must be informed of findings and advised to report concerns. - **Eligibility:** All live babies, ideally examined by NIPE-trained midwives or pediatricians. Parents should be present for explanations. - **Key Screenings:** - **Hips:** Check for developmental dysplasia (risk factors: breech, family history). Use Ortolani/Barlow maneuvers; refer for ultrasound if abnormal. - **Heart:** Auscultate for murmurs, assess pulses (weak/absent femoral pulses suggest coarctation). Critical cases require urgent pediatric review, ECG, and oximetry. - **Spine:** Check for abnormalities (e.g., spina bifidaâ€”urgent neurosurgical referral if sac defect present). - **Genitalia/Anus:** Ambiguous genitalia or anorectal malformations need immediate referral. - **Nervous System:** Assess tone, reflexes (Moro/grasp). Absent reflexes warrant consultant review. - **Referrals:** Document findings in S4N system. Urgent referrals for critical conditions (e.g., heart defects, spinal abnormalities). - **Special Cases:** Ill/preterm babies may delay screening; SCBU infants should be screened when stable. - **TB/BCG:** Screen at-risk infants; vaccinate eligible babies up to 1 year. - **Follow-up:** Parents should be informed of results and 6-8 week GP review, as some conditions manifest later.
