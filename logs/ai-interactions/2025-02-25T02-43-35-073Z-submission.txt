Based on these guidelines, create a realistic consultation transcript that includes:
1. A complex case with multiple issues requiring reference to several guidelines
2. Patient questions and concerns
3. The clinician&#x27;s responses and explanations
4. Clinical details including vital signs, examination findings, and test results where relevant
5. A natural conversation flow with both medical terminology and patient-friendly explanations

The transcript should demonstrate the need to reference multiple guidelines in the patient&#x27;s care. Please make it realistic and detailed enough to test the system&#x27;s ability to identify relevant guidelines.
