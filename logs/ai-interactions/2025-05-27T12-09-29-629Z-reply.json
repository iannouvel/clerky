She describes her periods as \"unpredictable,\" occurring every 2–3 weeks, with heavy flow lasting 7–10 days, requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 6–8 pads/day). She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports occasional clots. She has associated fatigue but denies dizziness, syncope, or severe pelvic pain.  \n\n**Relevant History:**  \n- Gravida 2, Para 2 (vaginal deliveries).  \n- No history of gynecologic surgeries.  \n- Last Pap smear: 2 years ago (reported as normal).  \n- No personal or family history of bleeding disorders or gynecologic malignancies.  \n- Medications: Over-the-counter iron supplements; no hormonal contraception.  \n- Allergies: NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol.  \n- Works as a teacher; reports stress but denies significant life changes.  \n\n**Missed Questions:**  \n- Sexual history (e.g., new partners, STI risk) not explored.  \n- No detailed family history of fibroids or endometriosis.  \n- Did not ask about weight changes, hirsutism, or acne (possible PCOS).  \n\n---\n\n### **Objective Findings:**  \n**Vitals:**  \n- BP: 118/76 mmHg  \n- HR: 82 bpm  \n- BMI: 26  \n\n**Abdominal Exam:**  \n- Soft, non-tender; no palpable masses.  \n\n**Pelvic Exam (Limited):**  \n- External: No lesions.  \n- Speculum: Active bleeding noted; cervix appears normal.  \n- Bimanual: Uterus anteverted, non-tender; adnexa not palpated due to patient discomfort.  \n\n**Missed Examinations:**  \n- No cervical motion tenderness assessed.  \n- No documentation of uterine size or irregularities (fibroids?).  \n- No breast exam (to assess for galactorrhea).  \n\n---\n\n### **Assessment:**  \n**Working Diagnosis:**  \n- Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), likely due to ovulatory dysfunction (given irregular cycles).  \n- Differential includes fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, or coagulopathy (though no history suggests this).  \n\n**Unaddressed Concerns:**  \n- Endometrial pathology (no transvaginal ultrasound ordered yet).  \n- Thyroid dysfunction or PCOS not ruled out.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - CBC, TSH, ferritin, coagulation screen (to rule out anemia/thrombocytopenia).  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred) to assess endometrial thickness/structural causes.  \n   - *Consider adding progesterone level if PCOS suspected (not mentioned today).*  \n\n2. **Empirical Management:**  \n   - Start norethisterone 5 mg TID for 21 days to regulate bleeding.  \n   - Iron supplementation continued.  \n   - Advised to track bleeding patterns using a diary.  \n\n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Return in 4 weeks for ultrasound results and symptom review.  \n   - *No discussion of long-term options (e.g., IUD, hormonal therapy) yet.*  \n\n**Patient Counseling:**  \n- Educated on alarm symptoms (e.g., hemorrhage, severe pain).  \n- Encouraged to seek care if worsening fatigue or dizziness.  \n\n**Disposition:**  \nStable for outpatient management.  \n\n---  \n**End of Dictation**  \n\n**Note:** This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only.
