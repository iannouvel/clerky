Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower neonatal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Failure risk factors**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, and large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound for fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, ensure documentation, provide bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Offer postnatal discussions and support. - **Psychological support**: Refer to midwife counselors for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. - **Adverse events**: Follow duty of candour, complete incident reports, and provide supportive frameworks for families and staff. - **Audit**: Monitor compliance with RCOG standards",
