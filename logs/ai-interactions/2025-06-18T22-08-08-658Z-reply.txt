Eligibility requires low-risk, singleton pregnancy with spontaneous labor onset. Key recommendations: - Maintain pool temperature (37Â°C) and monitor maternal/fetal observations. - Hands-off delivery; avoid cord palpation. - Post-delivery: monitor temperatures and assess perineum. **Indications to exit pool:** - Maternal pyrexia, hypertension, meconium-stained liquor, or request. - Fetal distress, significant bleeding, opioid/epidural use, prolonged stages, or excessive contamination. - Follow emergency evacuation protocols for maternal collapse. **Audit points:** - Document antenatal discussions. - Monitor pool temperature. - Delay perineal suturing if needed",
