  "response": "### Summary  \n- Premature rupture of membranes (PROM)  \n- Gestational age not explicitly stated  \n- Sterile speculum examination not documented  \n- Antibiotic therapy (erythromycin) not initiated  \n- Corticosteroids not offered if indicated (24+0 to 33+6 weeks)  \n- Neonatology team discussion not documented  \n- Magnesium sulfate not considered if indicated (24+0 to 29+6 weeks)  \n- Emotional support and resources not documented  \n\n### Detailed Issues  \n- Diagnosis of PPROM requires confirmation via sterile speculum examination, which was not documented.  \n- Antibiotic therapy (erythromycin for 10 days or until established labor) was not initiated per guideline recommendations.  \n- Corticosteroids should be offered if gestational age is between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks, but gestational age was not explicitly stated.  \n- Discussion with the neonatology team was not documented, which is recommended when PPROM is confirmed and delivery is anticipated.  \n- Magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection should be considered if delivery is planned within 24 hours and gestation is 24+0 to 29+6 weeks.  \n- Emotional support and links to support groups (e.g., Little Heartbeats) were not documented.  \n\n### Plan:  \n1. Perform and document sterile speculum examination to confirm PPROM diagnosis.  \n2. Initiate erythromycin for 10 days or until established labor.  \n3. Document explicit gestational age in weeks+days format.  \n4. Offer corticosteroids if gestation is between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks.  \n5. Discuss case with neonatology team and document discussion.  \n6. Consider magnesium sulfate if delivery is planned within 24 hours and gestation is 24+0 to 29+6 weeks.  \n7. Provide emotional support and written resources (e.g., RCOG patient leaflet).",
