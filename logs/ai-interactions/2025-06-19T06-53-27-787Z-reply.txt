  "transcript": "SITUATION: 30-year-old G1P0 with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy at 32+2 weeks presenting with preterm labor and growth discordance\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Liu conceived via IVF after 2 years of unexplained infertility, single embryo transfer resulted in spontaneous splitting to monozygotic twins. Pregnancy has been closely monitored with fortnightly scans. Recent growth scans show developing growth discordance between twins - Twin A estimated 1.8kg (50th centile), Twin B estimated 1.4kg (10th centile), representing 22% weight difference. She presented today with regular uterine contractions every 4-5 minutes for past 3 hours, accompanied by lower back ache and pelvic pressure. No bleeding, no rupture of membranes, both babies moving well. Previous antenatal care has been uncomplicated apart from gestational diabetes diagnosed at 26 weeks, well controlled with diet. She works as a teacher, supportive partner, anxious about early delivery.\n\nASSESSMENT: Maternal vital signs stable: BP 132/84 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, temp 36.8Â°C. Abdomen shows regular contractions palpable every 4-5 minutes, both twins in longitudinal lie, Twin A cephalic presentation, Twin B breech. CTG monitoring shows both twins with reassuring patterns - Twin A baseline 140 bpm, Twin B baseline 155 bpm, both with good variability. Cervical assessment reveals 3cm dilatation, 60% effacement, soft consistency. Ultrasound confirms presentations and estimated fetal weights as above. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome excluded - both twins have adequate liquor volume. Bloods normal including FBC and inflammatory markers.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Preterm labor in twin pregnancy with growth discordance requiring immediate management. Tocolysis with nifedipine commenced to delay delivery. Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) administered for fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate given for neuroprotection. Pediatric team alerted for twin delivery. Anesthetic consultation for potential operative delivery. Given growth discordance, immediate delivery not indicated unless fetal compromise develops. Plan for cesarean section if further cervical change or if Twin B becomes compromised. Continuous monitoring of both twins. Growth discordance investigation post-delivery to exclude underlying causes.",
