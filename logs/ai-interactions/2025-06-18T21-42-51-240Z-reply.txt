Escalate concerns promptly. - **Poor CTG Quality:** Reposition transducers, use fetal scalp electrode (FSE), or switch machines if issues persist. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS):** Consider for pathological CTG if no contraindications (e.g., acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders, prematurity <34 weeks). Avoid if expediting birth is needed. - **Cord Blood Sampling:** Paired samples required for concerning labors, SGA/FGR cases, or after FBS. Analyze promptly; document results. - **Care Analysis (FM800E):** Use antenatally only; requires 10 minutes of quality data. Results update every 2 minutes (max 60 mins). Not diagnosticâ€”clinical judgment essential. - **Key Principles:** Prioritize maternal preferences, multidisciplinary communication, and holistic clinical assessment. Store CTG traces for 25 years",
