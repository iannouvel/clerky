      "newValue": "**Summary of Anaemia during Pregnancy Guidelines** **Diagnosis**: Screen for anaemia at booking and 28 weeks. Diagnose based on trimester-specific Hb thresholds. Iron deficiency is confirmed by low ferritin (<30 µg/L) with or without anaemia. **Causes & Risks**: Iron deficiency is most common; other causes include B12/folate deficiency. High-risk factors: multiparity, poor diet, bleeding history. Anaemia increases perinatal risks (preterm birth, low birth weight). **Management**: - **Dietary advice**: Encourage iron-rich foods (27 mg/day). - **Oral iron**: First-line for diagnosed anaemia. - **IV iron**: For intolerance, malabsorption, or poor response. Avoid in 1st trimester, hypersensitivity, or active infection. Use Ferric Derisomaltose, monitor for reactions. **IV Iron Administration**: - Avoid out-of-hours infusions. - Monitor for hypersensitivity (stop infusion if severe; follow anaphylaxis protocol). - Manage delayed reactions (arthralgia, fever) symptomatically. **Postnatal Care**: Check Hb postpartum; treat symptomatic anaemia with oral/IV iron. Transfuse only if severe. **Key Lab Tests**: Low Hb, MCV, MCH suggest iron deficiency. Ferritin <30 µg/L confirms iron deficiency without anaemia. Routine ferritin screening not recommended",
