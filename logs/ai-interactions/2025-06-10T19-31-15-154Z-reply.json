She reports increased frequency of Braxton Hicks contractions over the past week, occurring 3–4 times per hour, non-painful but noticeable. She denies vaginal bleeding, fluid leakage, or decreased fetal movement. She notes intermittent lower back pain, which she attributes to prolonged standing at work. No recent travel or illness.  \n\n*Missing Pertinent Questions:*  \n- No documented inquiry about urinary symptoms (possible UTI contributing to contractions).  \n- No detailed dietary history (potential nutritional deficiencies in twin gestation).  \n- No assessment of recent stressors or sleep disturbances.  \n\n### **Past Medical/Surgical History:**  \n- Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine, last TSH within normal range).  \n- No prior gestational diabetes or hypertension.  \n- No surgeries.  \n\n### **Medications:**  \n- Prenatal vitamins  \n- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily  \n\n### **Family History:**  \n- Mother with type 2 diabetes.  \n- No known twin pregnancies in family.  \n\n### **Social History:**  \n- Works full-time as a teacher.  \n- No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use.  \n- Married, supportive partner.  \n\n### **Review of Systems:**  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, fatigue reported.  \n- **Cardiovascular:** No palpitations or edema.  \n- **Respiratory:** No shortness of breath.  \n- **Gastrointestinal:** Occasional heartburn, no nausea/vomiting.  \n- **Neurological:** No headaches or visual changes.  \n\n*Missing Pertinent Exam Findings:*  \n- No fundal height measurement documented.  \n- No cervical exam performed (to assess for shortening/dilation).  \n- No documentation of fetal heart tones for both twins.  \n\n### **Assessment:**  \n- **Multiple gestation (DCDA twins)** at 24 weeks with increased Braxton Hicks contractions.  \n- Differential includes normal uterine irritability vs. preterm labor risk.  \n- Back pain may be musculoskeletal but requires monitoring.  \n\n### **Plan:**  \n1. **Activity Modification:** Advised reduced standing, pelvic rest, and hydration.  \n2. **Contraction Monitoring:** Instructed to time contractions—if ≥6/hour or painful, present to labor and delivery.  \n3. **Nutrition:** Emphasized increased protein/caloric intake (not quantified).  \n4. **Follow-Up:** Scheduled for growth ultrasound in 2 weeks; no additional cervical length screening ordered.  \n5. **Patient Counseling:** Discussed signs of preterm labor but did not provide written materials.  \n\n*Gaps in Management:*  \n- No referral to maternal-fetal medicine despite twin gestation.  \n- No discussion of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity in case of preterm delivery.  \n- No contingency plan if symptoms worsen before next visit.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. A. Smith, OB/GYN  \n**Date:** [Fictional]  \n*For testing purposes only—not real medical advice.*  \n\n---  \nThis fictional dictation includes intentional omissions and management gaps for testing/educational review.
