Smith, Obstetrics & Gynaecology  Patient: Ms. Jane Doe (Fictional Name)  Age: 28 years  Weight: 98 kg | BMI: 37 (Obese Class II)  Gravida: 3 | Para: 2 (1 term vaginal delivery, 1 early miscarriage)  ---### Presenting Complaint:  Ms. Doe presents with:  1. Irregular heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) for 4 months, associated with clots and fatigue.  2. Chronic pelvic pain, worsening during menstruation and intercourse.  ---### History of Presenting Complaint:  - HMB: Bleeding lasts 10–14 days per cycle, soaking 6–8 pads/day. Reports dizziness but no syncope. No post-coital bleeding.  - Pelvic pain: Dull, bilateral, radiating to lower back. Rates 6/10 during menses. No dysuria or bowel symptoms.  - Obstetric concern: Interested in future pregnancy but worried about fertility due to symptoms.  ---### Past Medical/Surgical/Gynaecological History:  - Medical: PCOS diagnosed aged 18 (irregular cycles, hirsutism). No diabetes/hypertension.  - Surgical: Appendectomy (age 12).  - Gynaecological:    - Miscarriage at 8 weeks (2 years ago).    - Previous transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showed bilateral ovarian cysts (likely PCOS).    - No prior STI screening.  ---### Drug/Allergy History:  - Medications: NSAIDs PRN for pain. No regular contraception (uses condoms).  - Allergies: Nil known.  ---### Social History:  - Occupation: Office administrator (sedentary).  - Smoking: 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-years).  - Alcohol: 6 units/week.  - Relationships: Stable partner, no domestic concerns.  ---### Ideas, Concerns, Expectations:  - Ideas: Worries her symptoms are \"endometriosis or cancer.\"  - Concerns: Fertility impact and \"being taken seriously.\"  - Expectations: Wants \"answers quickly\" and options to reduce pain/bleeding.  ---### Examination Findings:  - General: Pale conjunctiva (possible anemia). No thyromegaly.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender. No masses.  - Pelvic (bimanual):    - Cervix: Normal appearance. No cervical excitation.    - Uterus: Slightly enlarged, retroverted, non-tender.    - Adnexa: Mild right-sided tenderness. No palpable masses.  ---### Differential Diagnoses:  1. Adenomyosis (enlarged uterus, HMB, dysmenorrhea).  2. Endometriosis (chronic pain, dyspareunia).  3. PCOS-related dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  ---### Investigations Planned:  1. Bloods: FBC (assess anemia), TSH, coagulation screen.  2. Pelvic TVUS: Evaluate endometrial thickness, ovarian cysts.  3. STI screen: Chlamydia/gonorrhea PCR.  4. Consider MRI if endometriosis suspected.  ---### Management Advice:  1. Symptom control:     - Tranexamic acid for HMB.     - Progestin-only pill (e.g., desogestrel) to regulate cycles if not seeking pregnancy soon.  2. Fertility counseling: Refer to reproductive endocrinology if pregnancy desired within 1 year.  3. Lifestyle: Weight loss support (BMI 37 → higher miscarriage risk). Smoking cessation referral.  4. Follow-up: Review in 4 weeks with results. Discuss laparoscopy if endometriosis suspected.  ---Clinician Signature: Dr. A. Smith  Disclaimer: This is a fictional case for testing purposes only. No real patient data or medical advice is implied.  --- Would you like a second fictional case with a different obstetric/gynaecological focus?"
