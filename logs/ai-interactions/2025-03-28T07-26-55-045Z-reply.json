She also reports a 4-month history of secondary amenorrhea prior to the onset of bleeding.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- The bleeding is described as \"flooding,\" requiring frequent pad changes (soaking 1–2 pads hourly on heavy days).  \n- Associated with passage of large clots and intermittent cramping pain, rated 7/10 in severity.  \n- No fever, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP) was approximately 6 months ago, followed by amenorrhea until recent bleeding.  \n- Denies unprotected intercourse in the last year.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin)  \n- Hypertension (on lisinopril)  \n- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – diagnosed age 28  \n- Depression (on sertraline)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendectomy (age 20)  \n- Dilation and curettage (D&C) for incomplete miscarriage (age 32)  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 13, cycles historically irregular (every 35–90 days).  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  \n- Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  \n- Contraception: Condoms intermittently, no hormonal contraception in the last 5 years.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 1g BD  \n- Lisinopril 10mg OD  \n- Sertraline 50mg OD  \n- No recent NSAID use  \n\n**Allergies:**  \n- Penicillin (rash)  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smokes 10 cigarettes/day (15 pack-year history)  \n- Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  \n- Lives with partner and two children  \n- Sedentary occupation, reports difficulty with physical activity due to weight and joint pain  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried that bleeding may be \"something serious like cancer\" due to family history (mother had endometrial cancer at 55).  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about needing surgery, given her weight and diabetes.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants clarity on the cause and treatment options, including \"whether hormones or an operation is needed.\"  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of hemodynamic instability.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum:** Active bleeding noted, cervix appears nulliparous with no visible lesions.  \n- **Bimanual:** Uterus bulky (~12-week size), non-tender, no adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Complex Gynaecological Issue 1: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) secondary to likely endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.**  \n   - Risk factors: obesity, PCOS, anovulation, diabetes.  \n2. **Complex Gynaecological Issue 2: Chronic pelvic pain with possible adenomyosis** (given bulky uterus and history of D&C).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness and adnexae.  \n   - Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle) to exclude hyperplasia/malignancy.  \n   - HbA1c and full blood count (FBC) to assess anemia and diabetic control.  \n2. **Immediate:**  \n   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS for heavy bleeding.  \n   - Counsel on weight loss impact on symptoms and surgical risks.  \n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Urgent gynaecology clinic review with results.  \n   - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD) if hyperplasia benign.  \n   - Smoking cessation referral.  \n\n**Patient Counseled:**  \n- Risks of untreated AUB (anemia, cancer progression).  \n- Importance of biopsy despite discomfort.  \n- Weight loss as a long-term priority to reduce recurrence risk.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Expedited TVUS and biopsy arranged.  \n- GP to monitor blood pressure and HbA1c.  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (Fictional Clinician)  \n**Date:** [Fictional date]  \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional case for educational purposes only.
