      "newValue": "**Summary of Care in Labour Guideline:** - **Goal:** Optimal outcomes for low-risk pregnancies through shared decision-making. - **Initial Assessment:** Review records, physical observations, and fetal movements. Conduct risk assessments on admission or at home, with timely referrals if risks are identified. - **Labor Management:** Promote normal birth; avoid unnecessary interventions. Monitor maternal/fetal condition, fluid balance, and labor progress. - **Delay in First Stage:** Assess factors like parity, cervical dilation, contractions, and emotional state. Consider amniotomy if membranes intact; reassess after 2 hours. Refer to obstetric team if delay is confirmed. - **Pain Relief:** Options include non-pharmacological (support, hydrotherapy) and pharmacological (Entonox, epidural, Remifentanil PCA). - **Second Stage:** Monitor progress; encourage pushing and position changes. Define lack of progress by specific timeframes; manage with amniotomy, bladder emptying, or fetal monitoring. - **Third Stage:** Offer active (uterotonic, cord clamping) or physiological management (no uterotonic, delayed clamping). Inspect placenta, estimate blood loss. Refer if undelivered after 1 hour. - **Post-Birth Care:** Encourage skin-to-skin, breastfeeding, and newborn examination. Placental histology if indicated. - **Nutrition:** Light diet recommended unless contraindicated. - **Review Date:** August 2027",
