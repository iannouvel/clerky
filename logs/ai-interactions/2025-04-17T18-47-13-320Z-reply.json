She describes passing **clots** and experiencing **intermenstrual spotting**. She also reports **pelvic discomfort** but denies dyspareunia.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began gradually, worsening over the last 3 months.  \n- No associated fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  \n- She has tried over-the-counter NSAIDs with partial relief.  \n- No recent contraceptive use (last hormonal contraception 5 years ago).  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **PCOS** (diagnosed age 25) – irregular cycles since menarche.  \n- **Obesity** (BMI previously 30, now improved to 26.2).  \n- **Gestational diabetes** (second pregnancy, resolved postpartum).  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Tubal ligation** (age 35, post-second child).  \n- No prior hysteroscopy or endometrial sampling.  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12, cycles previously irregular (30–60 days), now heavier and unpredictable.  \n- No history of STIs.  \n- Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Paracetamol PRN (no regular medications).  \n- No current hormonal therapy.  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as a school teacher.  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week).  \n- Married, monogamous.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Mother: **endometrial cancer** (diagnosed age 58).  \n- No other significant malignancies.  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried symptoms may indicate \"early menopause\" or \"something like my mum had.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Anxiety about cancer risk given family history.  \n- **Expectations:** Wants \"answers quickly\" and prefers \"non-hormonal options if possible.\"  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no masses.  \n- **Speculum:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \n- **Bimanual:** Uterus anteverted, normal size, no adnexal tenderness/masses.  \n- **No evidence of acute bleeding at time of exam.**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Suspected endometrial hyperplasia** (given AUB, PCOS, obesity, and family history of endometrial cancer).  \n- Differential includes **anovulatory bleeding** (PCOS-related) or **endometrial polyp**.  \n\n**Management Plan (aligned with GTG 2014 – Endometrial Hyperplasia):**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - **Transvaginal ultrasound** to assess endometrial thickness (if >4mm in postmenopausal equivalent symptoms, biopsy indicated).  \n   - **Endometrial biopsy** (pipelle or hysteroscopy-guided) for histology.  \n2. **Risk Reduction:**  \n   - Weight management counselling (BMI 26.2 → aim for <25).  \n   - Discuss **progestin therapy** (e.g., Mirena IUD or oral progestins) if hyperplasia confirmed, given cancer risk.  \n3. **Follow-Up:**  \n   - Urgent 2-week-wait referral if biopsy shows atypia.  \n   - Routine gynaecology follow-up if non-atypical hyperplasia.  \n4. **Patient Education:**  \n   - Reassurance that most hyperplasia is treatable.  \n   - Emphasize importance of biopsy for definitive diagnosis.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Schedule USS and biopsy.  \n- Provide leaflet on endometrial hyperplasia.  \n- Advise to return if bleeding worsens (e.g., flooding, dizziness).  \n\n**Dictated by:** Dr. Smith (fictional)  \n**Date:** [Today’s date]  \n\n---  \n*Note: This is a fictional case for testing purposes only.
