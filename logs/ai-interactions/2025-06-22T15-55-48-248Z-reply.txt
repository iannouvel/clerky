She denies any new skin rashes or recent medication changes. No history of abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. Fetal movements are reported as normal for both twins. No vaginal bleeding or uterine tightenings.\nRelevant Obstetric History:\nPrevious pregnancy uncomplicated; term vaginal delivery.\n\n\nNo history of intrahepatic cholestasis in prior pregnancy.\n\n\nNo history of preterm labour or hypertensive disorders.\n\n\nRelevant Medical History:\nMild childhood asthma (not on regular treatment).\n\n\nNo known liver or gallbladder disease.\n\n\nMedications & Allergies:\nCurrently taking ferrous fumarate and pregnancy multivitamin.\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband and toddler son.\n\n\nNon-smoker; does not consume alcohol.\n\n\nWorks part-time as a dental nurse; currently on maternity leave.\n\n\nExamination Findings:\nGeneral: Alert and well, no jaundice noted.\n\n\nAbdomen: Uterus consistent with gestational age; fundal height 33 cm.\n\n\nTwins in cephalic/cephalic lie; both heartbeats auscultated and regular.\n\n\nNo uterine tenderness or signs of labour.\n\n\nNo peripheral oedema; BP 118/74 mmHg.\n\n\nNotable Omissions (for testing purposes):\nNo documented baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods.\n\n\nNo record of fetal growth scan within the last 2 weeks.\n\n\nNo documentation of CTG to assess current fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nImpression:\n Twin pregnancy (DCDA) complicated by suspected obstetric cholestasis. Pruritus in the absence of rash raises concern for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), particularly given gestation and multifetal pregnancy.\nManagement Plan:\nInvestigations:\n\n\nSerum bile acids and liver function tests (LFTs) urgently.\n\n\nFasting bile acids if initial results are borderline.\n\n\nFull blood count and clotting screen (due to potential risk of coagulopathy).\n\n\nCTG to assess fetal wellbeing.\n\n\nGrowth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers if not done in past 2 weeks.\n\n\nMedical Management:\n\n\nStart ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg BID while awaiting results.\n\n\nConsider chlorphenamine for symptomatic relief of itching.\n\n\nOngoing Care and Delivery Planning:\n\n\nWeekly bile acids and LFTs.\n\n\nIncrease surveillance: twice-weekly CTGs and weekly growth scans.\n\n\nAim for delivery at 36–37 weeks if bile acids <100 µmol/L.\n\n\nConsider earlier delivery if bile acids ≥100 µmol/L or evidence of fetal compromise.\n\n\nCounseling Provided:\n\n\nDiscussed nature of obstetric cholestasis and increased risk of stillbirth in twin pregnancies.\n\n\nReassured about ongoing monitoring and early delivery plan.\n\n\nAdvised to monitor fetal movements closely and report any reduction.\n\n\nProvided written information and contact details for triage if symptoms worsen.\n\n\nDictated by: Dr. [Fictional Name] Patel\n Date: [Fictional Date]\n--Note: This is a fictional dictation for testing purposes only. No real patient data or medical advice is contained herein.\n\n\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Different management plan** - Avoid routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) unless for symptomatic relief, as it does not improve perinatal outcomes.  \n   Reason: Guideline states \"No treatments improve pregnancy outcomes or reduce bile acid concentrations\" and \"Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.\"  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Reconsider the frequency of growth scans and CTGs, as they do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.  \n   Reason: Guideline states \"Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised.\"  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Clearly counsel the patient that UDCA is for symptomatic relief only and does not reduce stillbirth risk.  \n   Reason: Guideline emphasizes that treatments do not improve pregnancy outcomes, and patient understanding should align with this.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available, to establish a reference point.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends baseline measurements in subsequent pregnancies, which could be extrapolated to initial presentations for comparison.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing with a hepatologist if bile acids are very high or presentation is atypical.  \n   Reason: Guideline states \"Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP.\"  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide specific information about the increased risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and the need for monitoring.  \n   Reason: Guideline notes that women with ICP have a higher chance of these conditions and should be monitored regularly.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider testing for hepatitis C only if clinically indicated, not routinely.  \n   Reason: Guideline states \"Routine use of other investigations, including for hepatitis C, is no longer recommended.\"  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Offer information about long-term risks (hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases) and recurrence in future pregnancies.  \n   Reason: Guideline mentions these risks, though they are less immediately relevant to current management.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document postnatal follow-up plans to confirm resolution of ICP.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends postnatal confirmation, but this is less critical during the acute management phase.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide links to support groups (e.g., ICP Support, RCOG) for additional patient resources.  \n   Reason: Guideline lists these as useful links, but this is a minor enhancement to patient care.  \n\nThese recommendations aim to align the clinical note with the guideline’s emphasis on avoiding unnecessary interventions, focusing on symptom management, and providing accurate patient counseling.\n\n### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available.  \n   Reason: Guideline emphasizes the importance of bile acid levels for diagnosis and management (ID: guideline-no-452). Baseline values can help track progression.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure fetal growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers are performed if not done in the past 2 weeks.  \n   Reason: Guideline highlights the increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes in twin pregnancies with ICP, necessitating closer surveillance (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Clearly document counseling about the high recurrence risk (~70%) in future pregnancies and the need for monitoring in subsequent pregnancies.  \n   Reason: Guideline explicitly states the high recurrence risk and need for future vigilance (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider testing for alternative diagnoses (e.g., AFLP, HELLP, biliary obstruction) if bile acids/LFTs are inconclusive.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends further testing for alternative diagnoses in certain cases (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed written information about postpartum follow-up, including monitoring for resolution of symptoms and metabolic disease risk.  \n   Reason: Guideline notes the need for postpartum follow-up and long-term metabolic risks (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Discuss contraceptive options postpartum, particularly combined estrogen-progestin contraception (if appropriate).  \n   Reason: Guideline endorses specific contraceptive considerations for patients with ICP (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document a more detailed social history (e.g., support system for twin care postpartum).  \n   Reason: While not directly related to ICP, this may help in holistic care planning.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include statistics on neonatal outcomes (e.g., respiratory distress risk) during counseling.  \n   Reason: Guideline mentions neonatal risks, but this is secondary to immediate management (ID: guideline-no-452).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document childhood asthma history in more detail.  \n   Reason: Unlikely to impact ICP management.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide additional written materials on general twin pregnancy care.  \n   Reason: While helpful, this is not specific to ICP management.  \n\nOverall, the note is well-aligned with the guideline but could be strengthened by ensuring baseline bile acid documentation, explicit counseling on recurrence risk, and closer fetal surveillance in twins.\n\n### CG1116 Fetal Heart Monitoring & Sampling\n\nSince the guideline content (CG1116 Fetal Heart Monitoring & Sampling) is not available, I cannot provide specific recommendations based on that guideline. However, I can analyze the clinical note for general best practices in obstetric cholestasis management and twin pregnancy care, drawing from common guidelines (e.g., RCOG, ACOG). Below are the recommendations:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods or repeat them if not previously done.  \n   Reason: Baseline bile acids are critical for diagnosing obstetric cholestasis and guiding management (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 43).  \n\n2. [Different management plan] - Ensure immediate CTG is performed given the high-risk nature of twin pregnancy with suspected cholestasis.  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies with cholestasis have an increased risk of fetal compromise, warranting prompt assessment (ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 231).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. [Additional information needed] - Include a recent growth scan (within the last 2 weeks) to assess fetal growth discordance or restriction.  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies require more frequent growth surveillance (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 51).  \n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Provide clearer counseling on the risks of preterm delivery and neonatal unit admission.  \n   Reason: Patients with twin pregnancies and cholestasis should understand the balance between fetal risks and prematurity complications (SMFM Consult Series #52).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. [Additional information needed] - Consider checking hepatitis serology if LFTs are significantly deranged.  \n   Reason: To exclude viral hepatitis as a cause of pruritus and elevated LFTs (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 43).  \n\n2. [Different management plan] - Document a contingency plan for steroids if delivery before 34 weeks is likely.  \n   Reason: Antenatal corticosteroids may be needed for preterm delivery (ACOG Committee Opinion No. 766).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. [Improved patient advice] - Suggest moisturizers or oatmeal baths for symptomatic pruritus relief.  \n   Reason: Non-pharmacological measures may improve comfort but do not affect outcomes (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 43).  \n\nSince the intended guideline (CG1116) is unavailable, these recommendations are based on general obstetric principles. If the guideline content becomes accessible, a more targeted analysis can be provided.  \n\nWould you like me to refine recommendations based on a different available guideline?\n\n### CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth\n\nSince the guideline content (CG1126 Multiple Pregnancy and Birth) is not provided, I cannot make specific recommendations based on it. However, I can provide general recommendations based on standard obstetric guidelines for twin pregnancies with obstetric cholestasis.  \n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods (if available) and ensure fetal growth scan and umbilical artery Dopplers are performed within the last 2 weeks.  \n   Reason: Baseline bile acids are crucial for comparison, and serial growth scans are essential in twin pregnancies to monitor for discordance or growth restriction (standard twin pregnancy and obstetric cholestasis guidelines).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure a clear escalation plan if bile acids rise above 100 µmol/L, including consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.  \n   Reason: Severe cholestasis (bile acids ≥100 µmol/L) significantly increases stillbirth risk, particularly in twins, warranting earlier delivery and multidisciplinary input (standard obstetric cholestasis guidelines).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed counseling on the risks of preterm birth, neonatal unit admission, and potential complications of early delivery (e.g., respiratory distress syndrome).  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies already carry higher risks of preterm birth, and early delivery for cholestasis further increases neonatal risks (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Consider screening for gestational diabetes (if not already done), as twin pregnancies and cholestasis may increase insulin resistance.  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies have a higher incidence of gestational diabetes, which can further complicate fetal growth and neonatal outcomes (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Offer psychological support resources, as twin pregnancies with complications can increase maternal anxiety.  \n   Reason: Mental health support improves coping and adherence to monitoring plans (general obstetric care principles).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document a clear contingency plan for delivery (e.g., mode of delivery if one twin is non-cephalic).  \n   Reason: Twin pregnancies require detailed delivery planning, especially if early induction is needed (standard twin pregnancy guidelines).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest moisturizers or oatmeal baths for pruritus relief in addition to antihistamines.  \n   Reason: Non-pharmacological measures may improve comfort but are not critical to management (general obstetric cholestasis symptom management).  \n\nWithout the specific guideline (CG1126), these recommendations are based on general best practices. If the guideline content becomes available, a more tailored analysis can be provided.\n\n### CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway\n\nSince the guideline content (CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway) is not available for review, I cannot make specific recommendations tied to that guideline. However, based on standard obstetric practice for twin pregnancies with suspected obstetric cholestasis, I can provide general recommendations for improvement of this clinical note:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document baseline bile acid levels from booking bloods if available, or explicitly state they were not done\nReason: Baseline bile acids are crucial for comparison in suspected obstetric cholestasis cases (RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 43)\n\n2. [Different management plan] - Consider admission for monitoring given twin pregnancy with suspected cholestasis\nReason: Twin pregnancies with cholestasis have higher risk of adverse outcomes and may benefit from closer inpatient monitoring (RCOG)\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document detailed counseling about specific risks of preterm delivery in twin pregnancy with cholestasis\nReason: Patients should understand the balance between fetal risks from cholestasis versus prematurity (SMFM guidelines on twin pregnancy)\n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Provide specific written information about signs of preterm labor to watch for\nReason: Twin pregnancies have higher risk of preterm labor, especially with cholestasis (ACOG practice bulletin on multifetal gestations)\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Consider adding total weight gain in pregnancy to documentation\nReason: Weight gain patterns may be relevant in twin pregnancies (NIH guidelines on twin pregnancy management)\n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Suggest specific non-pharmacological itch relief measures (cool baths, loose clothing)\nReason: Can improve quality of life while awaiting medication effects (RCOG patient information leaflets)\n\nWithout access to the specific CG20013 guideline content, I cannot make recommendations that directly reference it. The recommendations above are based on general obstetric guidelines for management of twin pregnancies with suspected cholestasis. To provide more targeted feedback, the full text of the CG20013 guideline would need to be available for review.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against 5 most relevant guidelines successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 141 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the top 5 most relevant.*\n\n\nGuideline: Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nKey recommendations:\n- Consider ICP in pregnant women with itching and raised bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.\n- Additional investigations not recommended unless itch is severe or associated with comorbidities.\n- Discuss severe or atypical cases with a hepatologist.\n- Confirm ICP postnatally with resolution of symptoms and normal liver function tests.\n- Risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acid concentrations: advise on planned birth timing accordingly.\n- Risk of stillbirth higher in twin pregnancies with ICP.\n- Ultrasound and CTG do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.\n- Risk factors and comorbidities may increase stillbirth risk in ICP.\n- No treatments improve pregnancy outcomes or reduce bile acid concentrations.\n- Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.\n\nAdditional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended in every woman with suspected ICP, but could be considered on an individual basis. Routine use of other investigations, including for hepatitis C, is no longer recommended. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe, very early, or atypical presentations of ICP. Postnatal resolution of ICP should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after birth. The risk of stillbirth in ICP increases when serum bile acid concentrations are 100 micromol/L or more. Women with ICP have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They should have regular monitoring for these conditions. Women with ICP also have a small increased chance of developing hepatobiliary and immune-mediated diseases later in life. Women with moderate or severe ICP have a higher chance of preterm birth, meconium stained amniotic fluid, and their baby requiring neonatal care.\n\nActive management with planned early birth is recommended for women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Women with ICP should be monitored closely, with regular liver function tests and bile acid measurements. Fetal ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP, so monitoring fetal movements is advised. Drug treatments for ICP, such as topical emollients and antihistamines, can help alleviate symptoms but do not improve pregnancy outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes. Other treatments for ICP should only be considered in research studies or under specialist care. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies.\n\nDietary fat absorption is impaired in women with ICP, but routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms such as steatorrhoea are present. Women with ICP should consider planned birth based on peak bile acid concentration and other risk factors. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered to women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more. Standard analgesia and anaesthesia options should be offered for women with uncomplicated ICP during birth. Follow-up should be arranged at least 4 weeks postpartum for women with uncomplicated ICP to confirm resolution. ICP does not impact the choice of contraception or hormone replacement therapy. Women with a history of ICP have an increased chance of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and should have baseline liver function tests and bile acid concentrations checked at booking blood investigations.\n\nIn subsequent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests and bile acid concentrations should be performed to establish normal levels. Repeat testing should only be done if clinically indicated. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:\n- Identify prognostic tools for adverse perinatal outcomes in women with ICP\n- Determine if women with ICP should be tested for gestational diabetes\n- Investigate effective treatments for itching and prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes\n\nAUDITABLE TOPICS:\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered appropriate timing of birth\n- Proportion of women with uncomplicated raised bile acid concentrations receiving additional investigations\n- Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations offered ursodeoxycholic acid\n- Proportion of women with severe ICP offered continuous fetal monitoring during labor\n\nUSEFUL LINKS AND SUPPORT GROUPS:\n- Information for healthcare professionals on maternal medication use in pregnancy\n- Information for women and families from ICP Support and RCOG\n- Information for women and families on medication use in pregnancy\n\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS:\nJG, CLK, and LC have declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nFUNDING INFORMATION:\nAll individuals involved in developing the Green-top Guidelines are unpaid volunteers except for RCOG staff.
