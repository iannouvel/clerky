She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### CG1198 Management of Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether aspirin prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, as this is recommended for women with risk factors for pre-eclampsia (family history of pre-eclampsia is a moderate risk factor).  \n   Reason: Guideline Section 7.0-7.2 recommends aspirin 150mg daily from 12-36 weeks for women with ≥1 high risk or ≥2 moderate risk factors for pre-eclampsia.\n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing vaginal delivery as an option unless there are contraindications, as the guideline does not mandate cesarean section for severe pre-eclampsia.  \n   Reason: Guideline Section 11.1.2 states timing/mode of birth should be individualized, with vaginal delivery preferred if maternal/fetal condition allows.\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Include baseline oxygen saturation and urine output monitoring, as fluid balance is critical in severe pre-eclampsia.  \n   Reason: Guideline Section 13.3 emphasizes fluid balance monitoring for severe pre-eclampsia.\n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Document detailed counseling about long-term cardiovascular risks and postnatal follow-up plan.  \n   Reason: Guideline Section 15.0 recommends discussing long-term cardiovascular risks and Section 13.4 outlines required postnatal follow-up.\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider adding fundoscopic examination findings given visual symptoms.  \n   Reason: While not mandatory, severe headaches/visual symptoms may warrant fundoscopy per general pre-eclampsia evaluation principles.\n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include more specifics about magnesium sulfate side effects and monitoring.  \n   Reason: Guideline references CG112 for severe pre-eclampsia, which includes detailed magnesium monitoring protocols.\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting BMI given obesity is a pre-eclampsia risk factor.  \n   Reason: While useful for risk stratification, BMI is not critical for acute management decisions in this case.\n\nThe note generally aligns well with guideline recommendations for severe pre-eclampsia management, particularly regarding:\n- Immediate hospitalization\n- BP control with labetalol\n- Magnesium for seizure prophylaxis\n- Timely delivery planning\n- Multidisciplinary involvement\n\nThe most critical gap is documentation of aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy, as this is a key preventive measure per the guideline. The other recommendations would optimize documentation and patient counseling.\n\n### MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy) with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) to quantify proteinuria, as dipstick alone is insufficient per guideline (Section 7.1).  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends PCR >30mg/mmol as threshold for significant proteinuria (Section 2.2.3).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider CVP line insertion given oliguria (current creatinine 98 µmol/L vs booking 65 µmol/L) and HELLP risk (platelets 98 x10⁹/L, ALT/AST elevation).  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends CVP for oliguria unresponsive to fluids or HELLP suspicion (Section 12.1).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly document discussion of long-term cardiovascular risks (e.g., 2-5x increased hypertension risk post-pre-eclampsia) and postnatal follow-up plan.  \n   Reason: Guideline mandates counseling on recurrence risks and cardiovascular disease (Section 19.1-19.4).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Include MAP calculation (current BP 168/112 mmHg → MAP ~131 mmHg) to guide urgency of treatment.  \n   Reason: Guideline defines MAP ≥125 mmHg as obstetric emergency (Section 9).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Specify labetalol dosing regimen (e.g., IV bolus vs infusion) and target BP (135/85 mmHg).  \n   Reason: Guideline details stepwise IV labetalol protocol (Section 9.4-9.7).  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Document breastfeeding-compatible antihypertensive options (e.g., enalapril/nifedipine) for postnatal planning.  \n   Reason: Guideline advises avoiding diuretics/ARBs postpartum (Section 18.1.1).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Record fundoscopic exam findings (e.g., papilledema) given headaches/visual disturbances.  \n   Reason: Papilledema is a feature of severe pre-eclampsia (Section 7.2).  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include written materials on pre-eclampsia symptoms for postnatal vigilance.  \n   Reason: Guideline references patient leaflets (Section 20).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n1. **Additional information needed** - Note exact betamethasone dosing (e.g., 12mg x2 doses 24h apart).  \n   Reason: Though recommended for fetal lung maturity (Section 10.1), exact dosing is not critical for guideline compliance.  \n\n### Key Omissions Addressed:  \n- **HELLP syndrome criteria**: Platelets <100 x10⁹/L and AST/ALT >70 IU/L meet biochemical criteria (Section 1.6) – consider adding HELLP to assessment.  \n- **Fluid restriction**: Guideline limits maintenance fluids to 80 mL/hr in severe pre-eclampsia (Section 11.1) – this should be explicitly stated.  \n\nThe note largely aligns with urgent delivery and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (Section 8.3), but could better detail monitoring intervals (e.g., hourly reflexes/respiratory rate post-magnesium, Section 8.7) and anesthetic consultation specifics (Section 13.2).  \n\nWould you like me to refine any specific recommendations further?\n\n### Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Neonatal Outcomes in Preterm Birth\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Different management plan** - The note states betamethasone was given for fetal lung maturity at 36+4 weeks, but the guideline recommends corticosteroids should be **considered** (not routinely offered) between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks, weighing risks (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia) and benefits (short-term respiratory improvement).  \n**Reason**: The guideline explicitly states corticosteroids in late preterm (35+0 to 36+6 weeks) require careful risk-benefit discussion, especially as this patient has severe preeclampsia with imminent delivery. The note lacks documentation of this discussion or justification for steroid use. [Reference: Guideline section on \"Antenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation.\"]  \n\n**Improved patient advice** - The note mentions \"risks explained\" to the partner but does not specify if the risks/benefits of late preterm corticosteroids (e.g., hypoglycemia vs. respiratory benefits) were discussed with the patient.  \n**Reason**: The guideline emphasizes informed decision-making for corticosteroids in late preterm births, particularly when maternal conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) may limit time for administration. [Reference: Guideline section on \"The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits.\"]  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - The note does not document whether the patient has diabetes or gestational diabetes, which would require additional insulin and monitoring per the guideline.  \n**Reason**: The guideline highlights that women with diabetes should not be excluded from corticosteroids but need close glucose monitoring. [Reference: Guideline section on \"Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended.\"]  \n\n**Different management plan** - The guideline recommends not delaying birth for corticosteroids if maternal/fetal health is at risk, but the note plans delivery \"within 6 hours.\" If maternal stabilization (e.g., BP control) allows, earlier delivery may be preferable.  \n**Reason**: The guideline states, \"Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby.\" Severe preeclampsia with clonus and severe hypertension warrants expedited delivery. [Reference: Guideline section on \"Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby.\"]  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Additional information needed** - The note does not mention whether this is a singleton or multiple pregnancy, which affects corticosteroid recommendations (e.g., limited evidence for twins).  \n**Reason**: The guideline notes targeted corticosteroids may be less beneficial in twins. [Reference: Guideline section on \"In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons.\"]  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - The note could explicitly state the betamethasone dose (24 mg) and route (IM) for clarity, though this is likely standard practice.  \n**Reason**: The guideline specifies the optimum dose/route. [Reference: Guideline section on \"The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly.\"]  \n\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:  \n1. **Lack of documented risk-benefit discussion** for late preterm steroids (very important).  \n2. **Potential delay in delivery** for a non-urgent 6-hour window (somewhat important).  \n3. **Missing screening for diabetes** (somewhat important).  \n**Actionable improvements**:  \n- Add a brief note clarifying the rationale for betamethasone (e.g., \"Corticosteroids administered after discussion with patient regarding potential respiratory benefits vs. neonatal hypoglycemia risks\").  \n- Consider earlier delivery if maternal condition deteriorates further.  \n- Document diabetes screening status.\n\n### CG11103 Recovery Post Regional and GA Anaesthesia\n\n### Very Important Recommendations  \n**Different management plan** - Document a clear post-operative monitoring plan for neurological assessment (including straight-leg raise at 4 hours post-spinal anesthesia) and MEOWS charting frequency (5-minutely for first 15 minutes, then ½ hourly for 1 hour, then hourly until discharge criteria met).  \n**Reason**: The guideline (CG11103, Section 7.1) mandates straight-leg raise assessment to screen for motor block complications, and Section 7.0 specifies monitoring intervals for regional anesthesia. The note lacks this detail, risking delayed detection of epidural hematoma or residual block.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Include a plan for post-CS urinary output monitoring (hourly for first 2 hours, with escalation if <30mL/hr on two consecutive readings).  \n**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.0 requires hourly urine output monitoring to detect renal impairment or hypovolemia, critical in preeclampsia.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on expected timeline for resolution of spinal anesthesia (3–5 hours) and symptoms requiring urgent reporting (e.g., worsening sensory loss).  \n**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.1 emphasizes patient education to facilitate early detection of complications like epidural hematoma.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Document pressure area care plan (e.g., repositioning 1–2 hourly, skin assessments) due to immobility post-CS.  \n**Reason**: Section 10.0 highlights pressure ulcer prevention for anesthetized patients, especially relevant with preeclampsia-associated edema.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations  \n**Different management plan** - Specify post-CS analgesia/anti-emetics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs if no contraindications) and laxatives in the plan.  \n**Reason**: Section 11.0 recommends standardized postoperative analgesia, though this is less urgent than hemodynamic monitoring.  \n\n**Additional information needed** - Note plans for breastfeeding/infant feeding support post-CS.  \n**Reason**: Section 11.0 advises extra support for feeding establishment, but this is secondary to maternal stabilization.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \n**Improved patient advice** - Mention anticipated discharge criteria (e.g., hemodynamic stability, clear fluids tolerance).  \n**Reason**: Section 9.0 lists discharge criteria, but this is minor compared to acute monitoring needs.  \n\n**Note**: The clinical note aligns well with acute management of severe preeclampsia but lacks granularity for post-anesthesia recovery per CG11103. Prioritize adding neurological monitoring, MEOWS documentation, and urinary output tracking.\n\n### CG13019 Triage of Maternity Patients Guideline\n\nBased on the provided clinical note and guideline, here are the recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the time of initial triage assessment and ensure it was completed within 15 minutes of arrival as per BSOTS protocol.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.3) mandates that the initial triage assessment should be completed within 15 minutes of arrival to prioritize care effectively.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the patient was categorized using the BSOTS algorithm (likely Red or Orange given severe preeclampsia) and document the specific category.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.1 and 7.5) requires categorization (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green) to determine the urgency of care and subsequent management steps.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Document detailed counseling on the risks of severe preeclampsia, including potential maternal and fetal complications, and the rationale for urgent delivery.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes clear communication with the patient (Section 7.7) to ensure understanding of their condition and management plan.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a MEOWS (Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score) was calculated and reviewed.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.3) includes MEOWS as part of the standard assessment for triage.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure an SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) handover was used during transfer to the delivery suite.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.6) recommends structured handovers using SBAR for effective communication.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on preeclampsia and postpartum monitoring.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.7) highlights the importance of patient education and follow-up.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a translation service was offered if needed.  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.7) states that translation services should be available for non-English-speaking patients.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider documenting the specific BSOTS algorithm used (e.g., \"Hypertension\" algorithm).  \n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.5) recommends using symptom-specific algorithms for triage.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include the midwife’s PIN/stamp on the Triage Assessment Card (TAC).  \n   Reason: The guideline (Appendix 4) suggests documenting the assessing midwife’s details, though this is minor for clinical care.  \n\nThese recommendations ensure the note aligns with the BSOTS triage system and improves compliance with the guideline.

for staff to enable them to \ndeliver safe and timely care. \n \n2.0 Scope \n \n• Midwives \n• Obstetricians \n \n3.0 Responsibilities \n \nMidwives and Obstetricians are expected: \n \n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. \n• To use their professional judgement in the application of this guideline. \n \nManagement are expected: \n \n• To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and \nNational recommendations. \n• To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. \n \nNote: - In cases of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia please refer to CG112 \nManagement of Severe Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia. \n \n4.0 Introduction \n \nHypertensive disorders during pregnancy occur in women/people with pre-existing or \nchronic hypertension, and in women/people who develop new-onset hypertension in \npregnancy. \nHypertensive disorders during pregnancy carry risks for the woman/person and the \nbaby. Hypertension in pregnancy remains one of the leading causes of maternal \ndeath in the UK. \n \nHypertensive disorders also carry a risk for the baby. Small-for-gestational-age \nbabies (mainly because of fetal growth restriction arising from placental disease) are \ncommon, with 20–25% of preterm births and 14–19% of term births in women/people \nwith pre-eclampsia being less than the tenth growth centile of birth weight for \ngestation. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 6 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n5.0 Definitions \n \nFor the purposes of this guideline, the following definitions apply: \n \n• Chronic hypertension (formerly known as essential hypertension) is \nhypertension that is present at the booking visit or before 20 weeks or if the \nwoman/person is already taking antihypertensive medication when referred \nto maternity services. It can be primary or secondary in aetiology. \n• Gestational hypertension (formerly known as pregnancy induced \nhypertension) is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without \nsignificant proteinuria. \n• Pre-eclampsia is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks with \nsignificant proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that can \naffect almost all maternal organ systems and the unborn baby. \n• Severe pre-eclampsia is pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension and/or \nwith symptoms, and/or biochemical and/or haematological impairment. \n• Eclampsia is a convulsive condition associated with pre-eclampsia. \n• HELLP syndrome is haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet \ncount. \n \n6.0 Assessment of blood pressure and urine \n \n6.1 Degrees of hypertension \n \n• Hypertension blood pressure of 140/90-159/109 mmHg. \n• Severe hypertension blood pressure of 160/110 or more. \n \n6.2 Assessment of proteinuria in pypertensive disorders of pegnancy \n \n• A reagent-strip reading device (if available) should be used to measure \nproteinuria in the antenatal period in secondary care settings. \n• Do not use first morning void to test for proteinuria. \n• If 1+ proteinuria or more is detected, a sample of urine for urinary protein: \ncreatinine ratio (PCR) should be obtained to quantify proteinuria. \nSignificant proteinuria is diagnosed with a PCR 30mg/mmol or more.

Do not repeat if results normal. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 21 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n13.3 Fluid balance \n \nChronic hypertension and gestational hypertension: \nFluid balance monitoring should continue as per CG21009 Maternity Fluid \nManagement as an In-Patient or in Labour Guideline. \nSevere pre-eclampsia: \nIf creatinine levels are within normal range after step down from intensive fluid \nbalance monitoring as per CG112 Management of Severe Pre-eclampsia and \nEclampsia, commence routine fluid balance monitoring as per CG21009 Maternity \nFluid Management as an In-Patient or in Labour Guideline. \n13.4 Follow up \n \nA member of the Obstetric Team should telephone the woman/person’s GP Surgery \ndirectly on discharge with plan for follow up, in addition to sending a Discharge Letter \nmarked ‘Urgent for Immediate Medical Review’ (see Appendix 7). \n \nOffer medical review (can be with GP or Obstetrician) for women/people with \npre-eclampsia: \n• Who remain on antihypertensive treatment at 2 weeks after discharge. \n• And at 6-8 weeks postnatally (to include urinary reagent dipstick test). \n \nWomen/people who remain on antihypertensive treatment at 6-8 weeks postnatally, \nor have persistent proteinuria should be referred for specialist assessment of their \nhypertension and/or proteinuria to assess kidney function. If abnormal after 3 months \nthey should be referred for specialist kidney assessment. (See appendix 8) \n13.5 Postnatal antihypertensive treatment \n \n• Discuss and decide treatment options with the woman/person based on \nher preferences. \n• Offer Enalapril to treat hypertension in women/people during the postnatal \nperiod, with appropriate monitoring of maternal renal function and maternal \nserum potassium. \n• For women/people of black African or Caribbean family origin with \nhypertension during the postnatal period, consider antihypertensive \ntreatment with: \n- Nifedipine or \n- Amlodipine if the womanperson has previously used this to \nsuccessfully control their blood pressure. \n- For women/people with hypertension in the postnatal period, if blood \npressure is not controlled with a single medicine consider a \ncombination of Nifedipine (or Amlodipine) and Enalapril. If this \ncombination is not tolerated or is ineffective, consider either: \no Adding Atenolol or Labetalol to the combination treatment or \no Swapping 1 of the medicines already being used for Atenolol \nor Labetalol. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 22 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n• When treating women/person with antihypertensive medication during the \npostnatal period, use medicines that are taken once daily when possible. \n• Treat women/people with hypertension in the postnatal period who are not \nbreastfeeding and who are not planning to breastfeed in line with the NICE \nGuideline on Hypertension in Adults. \n \n13.6 Antihypertensive treatment and breastfeeding \n \nInform women/people with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that their treatment \ncan be adapted to accommodate breastfeeding, and will not prevent them from \nbreastfeeding. Explain: \n• Antihypertensive medicines can pass into breast milk. \n• Most antihypertensive medicines taken while breastfeeding only lead to very \nlow levels in breast milk and would be unlikely to have any clinical effect. \n• Most medicines are not tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women/people, \nso disclaimers in the manufacturer’s information are not because of any \nspecific safety concerns or evidence of harm. \n \nAs antihypertensive agents have the potential to transfer into breast milk: \n \n• Consider monitoring the blood pressure of babies, especially those born \npreterm, who have symptoms of low blood pressure for the first few weeks. \n• When discharged home, advise women/people to monitor their babies for \ndrowsiness, lethargy, pallor, cold peripheries or poor feeding. \n \nWhere possible, avoid using diuretics or angiotensin receptor blockers to treat \nhypertension in women/people in the postnatal period who are breastfeeding or \nexpressing milk. \n \nFor further information on breastfeeding and anti-hypertensives see Breastfeeding & \nAntihypertensives. \n\n14.0 Risk of reoccurrence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy \n \nInform women/people with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy that there is an \napproximate 1:5 risk of reoccurrence (see Appendix 4). \n \n15.0 Long-term risks of cardiovascular disease \n \nInform women/people who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that this is \nassociated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in later \nlife (see Appendix 5). \n \nDiscuss how to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertensive \ndisorders, with their GP or specialist. This may include: \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 23 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n• Avoiding smoking. \n• Maintaining a healthy lifestyle. \n• Maintaining a healthy weight. \n \nIn women/people who have had pre-eclampsia or hypertension with early birth before \n34 weeks, consider pre-pregnancy counselling to discuss possible risks of recurrent \nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and how to lower them for any future \npregnancies. \n \nAdvise women/people who have had pre-eclampsia to achieve and keep a BMI \nwithin the healthy range before their next pregnancy (18.5–24.9kg/m\n2\n). \n \nAdvise women/people who have had pre-eclampsia that the likelihood of recurrence \nincreases with an inter-pregnancy interval greater than 10 years. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 24 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\n16.0 Monitoring / Audit \n \n• Pregnant women/people at increased risk of pre-eclampsia at booking \nappointment are offered a prescription 150mg of Aspirin to take daily at night \nuntil 36 weeks. \n \n• Women/people taking antihypertensive medication have a blood pressure of \n135/85mmHg or less. \n \n• Pregnant women/people with severe hypertension are admitted for a full \nassessment carried out by a healthcare professional trained in managing \nhypertension in pregnancy. \n \n• Women/people with pre-eclampsia who have severe hypertension or a high \nrisk of adverse events, or if there are any clinical concerns are admitted to \nhospital and monitored. \n \n• Women/people with PET have a senior obstetrician involved in any decisions \nabout timing of birth. \n \n• Women/people who have had hypertension have a plan for ongoing \nantihypertensive management included within the postnatal care plan, which \nis communicated to their GP when they are transferred to community care \nafter the birth. \n\nFor further audit guidance please contact the Maternity Clinical Effectiveness Team. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 25 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nReferences \n \nMBRRACE UK. 2019.

Drugs for which particular attention should be paid to the \ncontraindications and special warnings during pregnancy and lactation are listed below. \n \nAtenolol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that anticipated benefit \nbe weighed against the possible risks of its use particularly in the first and second \ntrimesters of pregnancy, and in women who may become pregnant or who are \nbreastfeeding. Informed consent on the use of atenolol in these situations should be \nobtained and documented. \nCaptopril is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used in UK \npostnatalobstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated \nin the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in lactation and that it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy or in breastfeeding for preterm \ninfants and for the first few weeks after delivery. Informed consent on the use of captopril \nin these situations should be obtained and documented. \nEnalapril is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated \nin the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and that it is not recommended during the \nfirst trimester of pregnancy or in breastfeeding for preterm infants and for the first few \nweeks after delivery. Informed consent on the use of enalapril in these situations should \nbe obtained and documented. \n \nLabetalol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension, including during pregnancy and is \nalready used widely in UK obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it \nshould only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk, and that breastfeeding is not recommended. Informed \nconsent on the use of labetalol in these situations should be obtained and documented. \nMethyldopa is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in \nUK obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that its use in women who are, \nor may become, pregnant or who are breastfeeding their newborn infant requires that \nanticipated benefits be weighed against possible risks. Informed consent on the use of \nmethyldopa in these situations should be obtained and documented. \n \nMetoprolol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013)advises that anticipated benefit be \nweighed against the possible risks of its use in women who are pregnant or \nbreastfeeding. Informed consent on the use of metoprolol in these situations should be \nobtained and documented. \n \nNifedipine is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \nobstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated in women \nwho may become pregnant, and in pregnancy before week 20, and that any use in \npregnancy after week 20 requires a very careful individual risk benefit assessment. It also \nadvises that nifedipine should not be used during breastfeeding. Informed consent on the \nuse of nifedipine in these situations should be obtained and documented. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 27 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAspirin in pregnancy \nAppendix 2: Antenatal risk assessment for pre-eclampsia \n \nWhy is aspirin given during pregnancy? \nSome pregnant women are at risk of developing pre-eclampsia (a serious condition which usually \npresents as high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and fetal growth restriction (when the baby is \nsmaller than usual due to not growing at a normal rate in the womb). There is evidence to suggest that \nthis group of women are at reduced risk of developing these conditions if they take a low dose of aspirin \nduring their pregnancy. \nWhy do I need aspirin during my pregnancy? \nIf you have 1 of the following risk factors you will be offered aspirin during your pregnancy: \n(Your midwife/doctor will indicate which risk factor(s) apply to you) \n▪ Hypertensive disease during your previous pregnancy \n▪ Chronic kidney disease \n▪ Autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome \n▪ Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes \n▪ Chronic hypertension \n▪ Low Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein (PAPP-A) screening blood test \n▪ Previous Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) - either birth weight <2.5kg over 37 week’s gestation \nor <10th centile) \n▪ Previous stillbirth \n▪ Previous pre-eclampsia or eclampsia \nIf you have 2 of the following risk factors you will be offered aspirin during your pregnancy: \n(Your midwife/doctor will indicate which risk factors apply to you) \n▪ First pregnancy \n▪ Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years \n▪ Family history of pre-eclampsia \n▪ Assisted conception (IVF/ IUI) \n▪ Age 40 years or older \n▪ Body Mass index (BMI) of 35Kg/m2 or more at first contact \n▪ Current smoker \n▪ Multiple pregnancy \nHow much aspirin do I need to take? \nYou will be prescribed 150mg of aspirin to take once daily ideally at night with food. You should take this \nas soon as you receive the prescription (as this is associated with better outcomes) until the birth of your \nbaby. \nHow will I receive the prescription? \nMost risk factors will be identified by your midwife at your first booking appointment. The midwife will \nsend a letter to your doctor to request the prescription which you can collect from your doctor’s surgery. \nSome risk factors may be identified later in your pregnancy, for example following an ultrasound scan. If \nthis is the case your midwife or doctor will inform you at that time and will notify your doctor in the same \nmanner. \nAre there any contraindications to taking aspirin? \nIf you have any of the conditions below, we would not recommend taking aspirin during your pregnancy: \nactive or previous peptic (stomach or duodenal) ulcer; bleeding disorders (antiplatelet dose); children \nunder 16 years (risk of Reye’s syndrome); haemophilia or severe cardiac failure. \n \nIf you develop any side effects, then please contact your midwife or Doctor. \n▪ Your obstetrician will discuss the benefits and risks of treatment with aspirin after 36 weeks \ngestation and agree with you when to stop aspirin treatment. \n▪ Stop aspirin 24 hours prior to an elective caesarean section, induction of labour, or any \ninvasive procedures. \nStop aspirin if signs of labour or heavy vaginal bleeding. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 28 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAppendix 3: GP letter – Aspirin prophylaxis \n\nDate: \n \nDear \nRE: \nNHS number: \n \nYour patient ................................. has been identified as having one or more risk \nfactors for development of pre-eclampsia and or intra-uterine growth \nrestriction and therefore meets the criteria for aspirin prophylaxis in \npregnancy. She does not have any contraindication or allergy to aspirin and \nhas accepted prophylaxis in accordance with NICE guideline NG133 \nHypertension in Pregnancy 2019. \n \nI would be grateful if you could prescribe aspirin 150mg daily at night with food \nthroughout the pregnancy. The woman/person will be advised by her \nobstetrician when to cease taking this dose of aspirin from around 36 weeks \nbut this will be an individualised plan. \n \nYours sincerely, \n\nMidwife \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 29 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAppendix 4: Risk of reoccurrence of hypertensive disorders \nin pregnancy \n\nType of hypertension in previous or current pregnancy \nPrevalence of \nhypertensive \ndisorder in a \nfuture pregnancy \nAny \nhypertension in \npregnancy \n \nPre-eclampsia \nGestational \nhypertension \n \nAny hypertension \nApproximately \n21% \n(1 in 5) \nApproximately 20% \n(1 in 5) \nApproximately 22% \n(1 in 5) \n\nPre-eclampsia \n\nApproximately \n14% \n(1 in 7) \nUp to approximately \n16% \n(1 in 6) \nIf birth was at 28–34 \nweeks\na\n: \napproximately 33% \n(1 in 3) \n \nIf birth was at 34–37 \nweeks: \napproximately 23% \n(1 in 4) \n\nApproximately 7% \n(1 in 14) \n \nGestational \nhypertension \nApproximately \n9% \n(1 in 11) \nBetween \napproximately 6 and \n12% \n(up to 1 in 8) \nBetween \napproximately 11 \nand 15% \n(up to 1 in 7) \nChronic \nhypertension \n \nNot applicable \nApproximately 2% \n(up to 1 in 50) \nApproximately 3% \n(up to 1 in 34) \na\n No evidence was identified for women/people who gave birth at less than 28 weeks, \nbut the committee agreed that the risk was likely to be at least as high, if not higher, \nthan that for women/people who gave birth between 28 and 34 weeks. \nNICE NG133 Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy 2019 \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 30 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAppendix 5: Risk of future cardiovascular disease \n\nType of hypertension in current or previous pregnancy \nRisk of future \ncardiovascular \ndisease\na,b\n \nAny \nhypertension \nin pregnancy \nPre- \neclampsia \nGestational \nhypertension \nChronic \nhypertension \nMajor adverse \ncardiovascular \nevent \nRisk increased \n(up to \napproximately \n2 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n1.5–3 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n1.5–3 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n1.7 times) \nCardiovascular \nmortality \nRisk increased \n(up to \napproximately \n2 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n2 times) \n(no data) (no data) \nStroke \nRisk increased \n(up to \napproximately \n1.5 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n2–3 times) \nRisk may be \nincreased \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n1.8 times) \nHypertension \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n2–4 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n2–5 times) \nRisk increased \n(approximately \n2–4 times) \n(not \napplicable) \na\n Risks described are overall estimates, summarised from risk ratios, odds ratios and \nhazard ratios. \nb\n Increased risk is compared to the background risk in women who did not have \nhypertensive disorders during pregnancy.

They may wish to purchase \ntheir own. \n \nExclusion Criteria: \nBefore women start on this pathway the healthcare professionals must make sure that the \nwomen do not come under any of the exclusion categories below. \n• Women who are diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia. \n• Women who have had any systolic BP measurement of 160 mmHg or above and diastolic \nBP measurement of 110 or above. \n• Women with worsening abnormality in PET bloods. \n• Women with symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, abdominal pain or feeling \nunwell. \n \nProcess: \nArrange for a woman to attend face to face appointment in day assessment unit or antenatal \nclinic and check eligibility for self-monitoring of blood pressure. Provide antenatal (or \npostnatal) check as usual. Women may already own their own validated monitor (which can \nbe used). \n \nThe home monitors can be obtained from DAU on each site. \nEnsure that women’s contact details are up to date on hospital electronic system (home, \nmobile phone number, email) and update these as necessary. \n \nWomen who are suitable for self-monitoring should have a one to one training session on how \nto measure Blood Pressure (BP) using the equipment provided and how to record it on the \nmonitoring sheet, with a midwife or doctor. They must also complete a blood pressure monitor \nloan form with the woman/person. \n \nThe woman/person should be given an information leaflet, which describes the technique of \nmonitoring and the action to take at each threshold of Blood Pressure. They should be given \nwritten instructions on expected frequency of blood pressure monitoring determined by the \nConsultant as well as the contact details for the Maternity telephone triage 01903 285269, \nwhere they could call in for help. \n \nAll women suitable for self-monitoring should be entered in a register to be kept in the Day \nAssessment Unit on both sites. Women/people will be contacted by their community midwife \nweekly if PIH (gestational hypertension) or alternate week if stable pre-existing hypertension \nand asked to read out the BP recordings on their sheet or alternatively contact can be \nmaintained via email with a screenshot of BP sheet which should be uploaded onto Medway. \n \nBP and urinalysis, current antihypertensive regime and follow up plan must be recorded on \nMedway following discussion with the on-call obstetric team or the woman/person’s named \nconsultant. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 32 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nIt is anticipated that women with chronic hypertension will require home BP monitor for entire \npregnancy and be followed up in consultant led antenatal clinic/ maternal medicine clinic. \n \nWomen with suspected PET/PIH should be discussed with oncall obstetric team, and follow \nthe NICE guidelines for management of hypertension in pregnancy \n(www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng133) – which includes weekly ‘PET’ blood tests and \nurinanalysis in women/people with PIH, which may be done by community midwife. \nWomen/people with suspected pre-eclampsia require twice weekly blood tests and should be \nreviewed in DAU. \n \nPostnatal women with hypertension should monitor BP daily for 10-14 days and see their GP \nat 2 weeks post-partum. (See appendix 8) \n \nEnsure the woman/person is aware of who (i.e. the labour ward/triage) and when to contact if \nthe BP rises above the target readings. It is the responsibility of the patient’s named \ncommunity midwife and the labour ward/obstetric team to oversee the care of the postnatal \nwomen with hypertension in liaison with the maternal medicine consultants until they are \ndischarged back to the GP (usually between 2and 6 weeks postnatal). \n \nMonitors should be returned to DAU (SRH or WH) by 6-8 weeks after birth at the very latest. \nCommunity midwives can facilitate the return of the monitor to DAU. \n \nOnce returned, wipe the blood pressure monitor thoroughly with a cleaning wipe, and check \nthat all components are correct (e.g. cuff, connector, batteries). \n \n(NB Consider how to record details of blood pressure monitor loans and associated uptake \nand outcomes as a service evaluation). \n \nEducating women on how to perform and record blood pressure: \nWomen need to be trained in the appropriate technique for taking Blood Pressure. \nThey should be informed about the following and provided with written information: \n \n• Resting for 5 minutes before taking blood pressure. \n• Do not smoke or drink caffeinated beverages for at least 30 minutes before. \n• Take the blood pressure reading before (not after) eating. \n• Sit comfortably with back supported and both feet on the floor (do not cross their \nlegs). \n• Elevate arm to heart level on a table or a desk. \n \nAsk the woman/person to take her blood pressure twice, at least one minute apart and write \nthe second blood pressure down in the Blood Pressure monitoring sheet provided. \nGive written instructions on expected frequency of blood pressure monitoring. \n \nValidating the monitor: \nBlood Pressure monitors once purchased will be inspected by the EBME department and \nsigned off as fit to use, this lasts for one year. After the year it will need to go back to EBME \nfor re-validation. \n \nPlease see Home BP Pathway for appendices for forms and written information to give \nto women monitoring their BP at home. \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 33 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nAppendix 7: GP referral letter for postnatal care \n \nSt Richard’s Hospital Worthing Hospital \nSpitalfield Lane Lyndhurst Road \nChichester Worthing \nWest Sussex West Sussex \nPO19 6SE BN11 2DH \nTel: 01243 788122 Tel: 01903 205111 \n\nwww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk \n\nURGENT – for immediate review by GP \n \nDate: \n\nDear Doctor, \nThis is to inform you that your patient (name).............................. \nhas been discharged from Worthing Hospital / St Richards Hospital (delete as \nappropriate) on ..................... following a delivery of a male/female infant. \nThe baby was delivered at ..................... weeks of gestation by: \n(Mode of delivery) \n \nShe has been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia/pregnancy-induced hypertension \nand has been put on the following treatment regime: \n\nPlan: Please continue with the antihypertensive treatment for 6 weeks. \n \nAt 6-8 week postnatal appointment please perform urine dipstick test and \nBP measurement. \n \nPlease refer to specialist any women who remain on antihypertensives or \nhave persistent proteinuria to assess for kidney function. \n \nOther comments: \n\nThank you \nYours faithfully, \n\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 34 of 34 \nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \n\nIt is the responsibility of the patient’s named community midwife and the labour \nward/obstetric team to oversee the care of the postnatal women with hypertension in \nliaison with the maternal medicine consultants until they are discharged back to the GP \n(usually between 2 and 6 weeks postnatal). \nAppendix 8: Postnatal management of hypertension flow chart \n \nCommunity & Secondary Care Pathway for managing hypertension \nin the postnatal period \n \nWomen/people with complicated PET should remain in hospital for 48-72 hrs post birth.

  "textContent": "AI: DeepSeek (deepseek-chat)\n\nQ: {\n  \"prompt\": \"Original Transcript:\\nSITUATION: 32-year-old G2P1 at 36+4 weeks gestation presenting with severe preeclampsia requiring urgent delivery planning\\n\\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Jones has had an uncomplicated pregnancy until 34 weeks when routine antenatal bloods showed mild proteinuria. She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.\\n\\nGuideline Analysis:\\n### CG1198 Management of Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether aspirin prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, as this is recommended for women with risk factors for pre-eclampsia (family history of pre-eclampsia is a moderate risk factor).  \\n   Reason: Guideline Section 7.0-7.2 recommends aspirin 150mg daily from 12-36 weeks for women with ≥1 high risk or ≥2 moderate risk factors for pre-eclampsia.\\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider discussing vaginal delivery as an option unless there are contraindications, as the guideline does not mandate cesarean section for severe pre-eclampsia.  \\n   Reason: Guideline Section 11.1.2 states timing/mode of birth should be individualized, with vaginal delivery preferred if maternal/fetal condition allows.\\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include baseline oxygen saturation and urine output monitoring, as fluid balance is critical in severe pre-eclampsia.  \\n   Reason: Guideline Section 13.3 emphasizes fluid balance monitoring for severe pre-eclampsia.\\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Document detailed counseling about long-term cardiovascular risks and postnatal follow-up plan.  \\n   Reason: Guideline Section 15.0 recommends discussing long-term cardiovascular risks and Section 13.4 outlines required postnatal follow-up.\\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider adding fundoscopic examination findings given visual symptoms.  \\n   Reason: While not mandatory, severe headaches/visual symptoms may warrant fundoscopy per general pre-eclampsia evaluation principles.\\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include more specifics about magnesium sulfate side effects and monitoring.  \\n   Reason: Guideline references CG112 for severe pre-eclampsia, which includes detailed magnesium monitoring protocols.\\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Consider documenting BMI given obesity is a pre-eclampsia risk factor.  \\n   Reason: While useful for risk stratification, BMI is not critical for acute management decisions in this case.\\n\\nThe note generally aligns well with guideline recommendations for severe pre-eclampsia management, particularly regarding:\\n- Immediate hospitalization\\n- BP control with labetalol\\n- Magnesium for seizure prophylaxis\\n- Timely delivery planning\\n- Multidisciplinary involvement\\n\\nThe most critical gap is documentation of aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy, as this is a key preventive measure per the guideline. The other recommendations would optimize documentation and patient counseling.\\n\\n### MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy\\n\\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline (MP019 Hypertension and Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy) with recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) to quantify proteinuria, as dipstick alone is insufficient per guideline (Section 7.1).  \\n   Reason: Guideline recommends PCR >30mg/mmol as threshold for significant proteinuria (Section 2.2.3).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider CVP line insertion given oliguria (current creatinine 98 µmol/L vs booking 65 µmol/L) and HELLP risk (platelets 98 x10⁹/L, ALT/AST elevation).  \\n   Reason: Guideline recommends CVP for oliguria unresponsive to fluids or HELLP suspicion (Section 12.1).  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly document discussion of long-term cardiovascular risks (e.g., 2-5x increased hypertension risk post-pre-eclampsia) and postnatal follow-up plan.  \\n   Reason: Guideline mandates counseling on recurrence risks and cardiovascular disease (Section 19.1-19.4).  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include MAP calculation (current BP 168/112 mmHg → MAP ~131 mmHg) to guide urgency of treatment.  \\n   Reason: Guideline defines MAP ≥125 mmHg as obstetric emergency (Section 9).  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Specify labetalol dosing regimen (e.g., IV bolus vs infusion) and target BP (135/85 mmHg).  \\n   Reason: Guideline details stepwise IV labetalol protocol (Section 9.4-9.7).  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Document breastfeeding-compatible antihypertensive options (e.g., enalapril/nifedipine) for postnatal planning.  \\n   Reason: Guideline advises avoiding diuretics/ARBs postpartum (Section 18.1.1).  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Record fundoscopic exam findings (e.g., papilledema) given headaches/visual disturbances.  \\n   Reason: Papilledema is a feature of severe pre-eclampsia (Section 7.2).  \\n\\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Include written materials on pre-eclampsia symptoms for postnatal vigilance.  \\n   Reason: Guideline references patient leaflets (Section 20).  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n1. **Additional information needed** - Note exact betamethasone dosing (e.g., 12mg x2 doses 24h apart).  \\n   Reason: Though recommended for fetal lung maturity (Section 10.1), exact dosing is not critical for guideline compliance.  \\n\\n### Key Omissions Addressed:  \\n- **HELLP syndrome criteria**: Platelets <100 x10⁹/L and AST/ALT >70 IU/L meet biochemical criteria (Section 1.6) – consider adding HELLP to assessment.  \\n- **Fluid restriction**: Guideline limits maintenance fluids to 80 mL/hr in severe pre-eclampsia (Section 11.1) – this should be explicitly stated.  \\n\\nThe note largely aligns with urgent delivery and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (Section 8.3), but could better detail monitoring intervals (e.g., hourly reflexes/respiratory rate post-magnesium, Section 8.7) and anesthetic consultation specifics (Section 13.2).  \\n\\nWould you like me to refine any specific recommendations further?\\n\\n### Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Neonatal Outcomes in Preterm Birth\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations  \\n**Different management plan** - The note states betamethasone was given for fetal lung maturity at 36+4 weeks, but the guideline recommends corticosteroids should be **considered** (not routinely offered) between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks, weighing risks (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia) and benefits (short-term respiratory improvement).  \\n**Reason**: The guideline explicitly states corticosteroids in late preterm (35+0 to 36+6 weeks) require careful risk-benefit discussion, especially as this patient has severe preeclampsia with imminent delivery. The note lacks documentation of this discussion or justification for steroid use. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"Antenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation.\\\"]  \\n\\n**Improved patient advice** - The note mentions \\\"risks explained\\\" to the partner but does not specify if the risks/benefits of late preterm corticosteroids (e.g., hypoglycemia vs. respiratory benefits) were discussed with the patient.  \\n**Reason**: The guideline emphasizes informed decision-making for corticosteroids in late preterm births, particularly when maternal conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) may limit time for administration. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"The use of corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully weighed for its risks and benefits.\\\"]  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n**Additional information needed** - The note does not document whether the patient has diabetes or gestational diabetes, which would require additional insulin and monitoring per the guideline.  \\n**Reason**: The guideline highlights that women with diabetes should not be excluded from corticosteroids but need close glucose monitoring. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"Women with diabetes should not be excluded from receiving corticosteroids, but additional insulin and close monitoring are recommended.\\\"]  \\n\\n**Different management plan** - The guideline recommends not delaying birth for corticosteroids if maternal/fetal health is at risk, but the note plans delivery \\\"within 6 hours.\\\" If maternal stabilization (e.g., BP control) allows, earlier delivery may be preferable.  \\n**Reason**: The guideline states, \\\"Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby.\\\" Severe preeclampsia with clonus and severe hypertension warrants expedited delivery. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"Antenatal corticosteroids should not delay birth if it is necessary for the health of the woman or baby.\\\"]  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n**Additional information needed** - The note does not mention whether this is a singleton or multiple pregnancy, which affects corticosteroid recommendations (e.g., limited evidence for twins).  \\n**Reason**: The guideline notes targeted corticosteroids may be less beneficial in twins. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids for early birth should be considered, as there is little evidence of benefit in twins compared to singletons.\\\"]  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n**Improved patient advice** - The note could explicitly state the betamethasone dose (24 mg) and route (IM) for clarity, though this is likely standard practice.  \\n**Reason**: The guideline specifies the optimum dose/route. [Reference: Guideline section on \\\"The optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal corticosteroids recommend 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly.\\\"]  \\n\\n### Summary of Critical Gaps:  \\n1. **Lack of documented risk-benefit discussion** for late preterm steroids (very important).  \\n2. **Potential delay in delivery** for a non-urgent 6-hour window (somewhat important).  \\n3. **Missing screening for diabetes** (somewhat important).  \\n**Actionable improvements**:  \\n- Add a brief note clarifying the rationale for betamethasone (e.g., \\\"Corticosteroids administered after discussion with patient regarding potential respiratory benefits vs. neonatal hypoglycemia risks\\\").  \\n- Consider earlier delivery if maternal condition deteriorates further.  \\n- Document diabetes screening status.\\n\\n### CG11103 Recovery Post Regional and GA Anaesthesia\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations  \\n**Different management plan** - Document a clear post-operative monitoring plan for neurological assessment (including straight-leg raise at 4 hours post-spinal anesthesia) and MEOWS charting frequency (5-minutely for first 15 minutes, then ½ hourly for 1 hour, then hourly until discharge criteria met).  \\n**Reason**: The guideline (CG11103, Section 7.1) mandates straight-leg raise assessment to screen for motor block complications, and Section 7.0 specifies monitoring intervals for regional anesthesia. The note lacks this detail, risking delayed detection of epidural hematoma or residual block.  \\n\\n**Additional information needed** - Include a plan for post-CS urinary output monitoring (hourly for first 2 hours, with escalation if <30mL/hr on two consecutive readings).  \\n**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.0 requires hourly urine output monitoring to detect renal impairment or hypovolemia, critical in preeclampsia.  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations  \\n**Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on expected timeline for resolution of spinal anesthesia (3–5 hours) and symptoms requiring urgent reporting (e.g., worsening sensory loss).  \\n**Reason**: Guideline Section 7.1 emphasizes patient education to facilitate early detection of complications like epidural hematoma.  \\n\\n**Additional information needed** - Document pressure area care plan (e.g., repositioning 1–2 hourly, skin assessments) due to immobility post-CS.  \\n**Reason**: Section 10.0 highlights pressure ulcer prevention for anesthetized patients, especially relevant with preeclampsia-associated edema.  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations  \\n**Different management plan** - Specify post-CS analgesia/anti-emetics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs if no contraindications) and laxatives in the plan.  \\n**Reason**: Section 11.0 recommends standardized postoperative analgesia, though this is less urgent than hemodynamic monitoring.  \\n\\n**Additional information needed** - Note plans for breastfeeding/infant feeding support post-CS.  \\n**Reason**: Section 11.0 advises extra support for feeding establishment, but this is secondary to maternal stabilization.  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations  \\n**Improved patient advice** - Mention anticipated discharge criteria (e.g., hemodynamic stability, clear fluids tolerance).  \\n**Reason**: Section 9.0 lists discharge criteria, but this is minor compared to acute monitoring needs.  \\n\\n**Note**: The clinical note aligns well with acute management of severe preeclampsia but lacks granularity for post-anesthesia recovery per CG11103. Prioritize adding neurological monitoring, MEOWS documentation, and urinary output tracking.\\n\\n### CG13019 Triage of Maternity Patients Guideline\\n\\nBased on the provided clinical note and guideline, here are the recommendations for improvement:\\n\\n### Very Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document the time of initial triage assessment and ensure it was completed within 15 minutes of arrival as per BSOTS protocol.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.3) mandates that the initial triage assessment should be completed within 15 minutes of arrival to prioritize care effectively.  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure the patient was categorized using the BSOTS algorithm (likely Red or Orange given severe preeclampsia) and document the specific category.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.1 and 7.5) requires categorization (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green) to determine the urgency of care and subsequent management steps.  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Document detailed counseling on the risks of severe preeclampsia, including potential maternal and fetal complications, and the rationale for urgent delivery.  \\n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes clear communication with the patient (Section 7.7) to ensure understanding of their condition and management plan.  \\n\\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a MEOWS (Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score) was calculated and reviewed.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.3) includes MEOWS as part of the standard assessment for triage.  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure an SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) handover was used during transfer to the delivery suite.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.6) recommends structured handovers using SBAR for effective communication.  \\n\\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on preeclampsia and postpartum monitoring.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.7) highlights the importance of patient education and follow-up.  \\n\\n### Less Important Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether a translation service was offered if needed.  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.7) states that translation services should be available for non-English-speaking patients.  \\n\\n2. **Different management plan** - Consider documenting the specific BSOTS algorithm used (e.g., \\\"Hypertension\\\" algorithm).  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Section 7.5) recommends using symptom-specific algorithms for triage.  \\n\\n### Unimportant Recommendations\\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include the midwife’s PIN/stamp on the Triage Assessment Card (TAC).  \\n   Reason: The guideline (Appendix 4) suggests documenting the assessing midwife’s details, though this is minor for clinical care.  \\n\\nThese recommendations ensure the note aligns with the BSOTS triage system and improves compliance with the guideline. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAnalyzed against 5 most relevant guidelines successfully.\\n\\n*Note: Found 159 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the top 5 most relevant.*\\n\\n\\nGuideline: CG1198 Management of Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\\n\\n\\nFull Guideline Content:\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 1 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nHypertensive Disorders during Pregnancy Guideline \\nSummary statement: How does the \\ndocument support patient care? \\nBy providing evidence based guidance for staff in the \\nmanagement and treatment of hypertensive disorders during \\npregnancy \\nStaff/stakeholders involved in \\ndevelopment: \\nLeads for Maternity Risk Management (Obstetric and \\nMidwifery), Labour Ward Leads (Obstetric and Midwifery), \\nJoint Obstetric Guidelines Group, Anaesthetists. \\nDivision: \\nWomen and Children’s \\nDepartment: \\nMaternity \\nResponsible Person: \\nChief of Service \\nAuthor: \\nConsultant obstetrician/Midwife \\nFor use by: \\nMedical Obstetric, Midwifery and Anaesthetic Staff \\nPurpose: \\nTo provide evidence based guidance for staff when caring for \\nwomen with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

information for staff to enable them to \\ndeliver safe and timely care. \\n \\n2.0 Scope \\n \\n• Midwives \\n• Obstetricians \\n \\n3.0 Responsibilities \\n \\nMidwives and Obstetricians are expected: \\n \\n• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. \\n• To use their professional judgement in the application of this guideline. \\n \\nManagement are expected: \\n \\n• To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and \\nNational recommendations. \\n• To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. \\n \\nNote: - In cases of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia please refer to CG112 \\nManagement of Severe Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia. \\n \\n4.0 Introduction \\n \\nHypertensive disorders during pregnancy occur in women/people with pre-existing or \\nchronic hypertension, and in women/people who develop new-onset hypertension in \\npregnancy. \\nHypertensive disorders during pregnancy carry risks for the woman/person and the \\nbaby. Hypertension in pregnancy remains one of the leading causes of maternal \\ndeath in the UK. \\n \\nHypertensive disorders also carry a risk for the baby. Small-for-gestational-age \\nbabies (mainly because of fetal growth restriction arising from placental disease) are \\ncommon, with 20–25% of preterm births and 14–19% of term births in women/people \\nwith pre-eclampsia being less than the tenth growth centile of birth weight for \\ngestation. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 6 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n5.0 Definitions \\n \\nFor the purposes of this guideline, the following definitions apply: \\n \\n• Chronic hypertension (formerly known as essential hypertension) is \\nhypertension that is present at the booking visit or before 20 weeks or if the \\nwoman/person is already taking antihypertensive medication when referred \\nto maternity services. It can be primary or secondary in aetiology. \\n• Gestational hypertension (formerly known as pregnancy induced \\nhypertension) is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without \\nsignificant proteinuria. \\n• Pre-eclampsia is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks with \\nsignificant proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that can \\naffect almost all maternal organ systems and the unborn baby. \\n• Severe pre-eclampsia is pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension and/or \\nwith symptoms, and/or biochemical and/or haematological impairment. \\n• Eclampsia is a convulsive condition associated with pre-eclampsia. \\n• HELLP syndrome is haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet \\ncount. \\n \\n6.0 Assessment of blood pressure and urine \\n \\n6.1 Degrees of hypertension \\n \\n• Hypertension blood pressure of 140/90-159/109 mmHg. \\n• Severe hypertension blood pressure of 160/110 or more. \\n \\n6.2 Assessment of proteinuria in pypertensive disorders of pegnancy \\n \\n• A reagent-strip reading device (if available) should be used to measure \\nproteinuria in the antenatal period in secondary care settings. \\n• Do not use first morning void to test for proteinuria. \\n• If 1+ proteinuria or more is detected, a sample of urine for urinary protein: \\ncreatinine ratio (PCR) should be obtained to quantify proteinuria. \\nSignificant proteinuria is diagnosed with a PCR 30mg/mmol or more. If \\nthere is uncertainty about the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re- \\ntesting on a new sample, alongside clinical review. \\n \\nDo not routinely use 24-hour urine collection to quantify proteinuria. Interpret \\nproteinuria measurements in the context of a full clinical review of symptoms, signs, \\nand other investigations for pre-eclampsia. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 7 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n7.0 Risk factors for pre-eclampsia \\n \\nAt the booking appointment and repeat in the second trimester either at the 16-18 \\nweek or 25 week appointment, the following risk factors for pre-eclampsia should be \\nassessed: \\n \\n7.1 Moderate risk factors \\n \\n• Maternal age 40 years or older \\n• Nulliparity \\n• Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years \\n• Family history of pre-eclampsia \\n• Body mass index (BMI) 35 kg/m\\n2\\n or above \\n• Multiple pregnancy \\n \\nAdditional moderate risk factors for taking aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care \\nBundle Version 2 (please note these two risk factors are not risk factors for \\ndeveloping PET): \\n \\n• Assisted conception (IVF/ IUI) \\n• Current smoker \\n \\n7.2 High risk factors \\n \\n• Chronic hypertension \\n• Previous hypertensive disease during pregnancy – gestational \\nhypertension and pre/eclampsia \\n• Chronic kidney disease \\n• Autoimmune disease i.e. lupus of antiphospholipid syndrome \\n• Type 1 or type 2 Diabetes \\n \\nAdditional high risk factors for taking aspirin from Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle \\n(please note these three risk factors are not risk factors for developing PET): \\n \\n• Low Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein (PAPP-A) screening blood test \\n• Previous Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) - either birth weight less than \\n2.5kg over 37 week’s gestation or below the 10th growth centile). \\n• Previous stillbirth \\n \\nWomen/people with one high risk factor or two moderate risk factors of pre- \\neclampsia should be advised to take 150mg of aspirin once daily at night from \\n12 weeks until 36 weeks. \\n \\nWomen/people with one high risk factor should be referred to the Antenatal Clinic \\nideally for care under the Obstetric Medicine Consultant or other appropriate \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 8 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nConsultant as per local protocol. For women with 2 or more moderate risk factors, \\nreferral to Antenatal Clinic should be considered. \\n \\n7.3 Uterine artery dopplers \\n \\nPregnant women/people with risk factors should be managed as indicated in the \\ntable below: \\n\\nTwo moderate risk factors \\n \\nor \\n \\nOne high risk factor \\n\\nUterine artery \\ndopplers with \\nanomaly scan \\nIf normal: \\nSerial USS from 32 weeks every \\n2-4 weeks until birth. \\nIf abnormal uterine artery \\ndopplers and EFW 10\\nth\\n Growth \\nCentile or more: Serial USS \\nfrom 28 weeks every 2-4 weeks \\nuntil birth. \\nAbnormal uterine artery \\ndopplers and AC or EFW below \\n10\\nth\\n Growth Centile: Refer to \\nFetal Medicine Consultant. \\nNew onset of \\nhypertension, \\ngestational hypertension, \\npre-eclampsia \\n \\nSerial USS from diagnosis until birth. \\nSaving Babies Lives Care Bundle V2 \\n \\n8.0 Antenatal care of women/people at high risk of pre-eclampsia \\n \\nPerform uterine artery doppler with anomaly scan and carry out ultrasound fetal \\ngrowth, amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry \\n(see table in Section 7.3) starting at 32 weeks (or at least 2 weeks before previous \\ngestational age of onset if earlier than 28 weeks) and repeating 2-4 weeks until birth \\nin women with previous: \\n \\n• Severe pre-eclampsia. \\n• Pre-eclampsia that needed birth before 34 weeks. \\n• Pre-eclampsia with a baby whose birth weight was less than the \\n10th growth centile. \\n• Intrauterine death. \\n• Placental abruption. \\n \\nFor women/people at high risk of pre-eclampsia, antenatal monitoring of blood \\npressure (BP) and urinalysis should be individualised depending on clinical picture, \\nbut should be checked every 2 weeks from 28 weeks. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 9 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nPerform CTG when fetal movements are reduced or required in professional \\njudgment. \\n \\nPregnant women/people should be made aware of the need to contact Labour Ward \\npromptly if they experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Symptoms include: \\n \\n• Severe headache. \\n• Problems with vision, such as blurring or flashing before the eyes. \\n• Severe pain just below the ribs. \\n• Vomiting. \\n• Sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet. \\n \\nWhen women/people present with new onset of any of these symptoms, blood \\npressure and urinalysis must be checked and further assessment/referral considered. \\n \\n9.0 Management of pregnancy with chronic hypertension \\n \\nChronic hypertension is hypertension that is present at the booking visit or before \\n20 weeks or if the woman/person is already taking antihypertensive medication when \\nreferred to maternity services. It can be primary or secondary in aetiology. \\n \\n9.1 Pre-pregnancy care \\n \\nOffer women/people with chronic hypertension referral to maternal medicine/ \\nspecialist in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to discuss the risks and benefits of \\ntreatment. \\n \\nContinue with existing antihypertensive treatment if safe in pregnancy or switch to an \\nalternative treatment, unless there is a: \\n \\n• Sustained systolic blood pressure reading less than 110 mmHg or \\n• Sustained diastolic blood pressure reading less than 70 mmHg or \\n• The woman/person is symptomatic of hypotension. \\n \\nOffer antihypertensive treatment to pregnant women/people not currently on \\ntreatment who have chronic hypertension if they have a: \\n \\n• Sustained systolic blood pressure reading of 140 mmHg or higher or \\n• Sustained diastolic blood pressure reading of 90 mmHg or higher. \\n \\nThere is an increased risk of congenital abnormalities if angiotensin-converting \\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are taken \\nduring pregnancy. These should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. \\nAlternative antihypertensive treatment can be discussed with the healthcare \\nprofessional responsible for managing their hypertension ideally pre-pregnancy. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 10 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nChlorothiazide diuretics may be associated with congenital abnormality and neonatal \\ncomplications and alternatives should be considered. \\n \\nAdvise women/people who take antihypertensive treatments other than ACE \\ninhibitors, ARBs, Thiazide or Thiazide-like diuretics that the limited evidence \\navailable has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such \\ntreatments. \\n \\nCommence Aspirin 150mg daily at night from 12 weeks gestation until 36 weeks. \\n \\nAvoid using nitric oxide donors, progesterone, diuretics or low molecular weight \\nheparin, and nutritional supplements or salt restriction to prevent hypertensive \\ndisorders in pregnancy. \\n \\n9.2 Antihypertensive treatment appropriate for pregnancy \\n \\n• Labetalol can be used to treat women with chronic hypertension. \\n• If Labetalol not suitable (contraindicated with asthma) consider Nifedipine or \\n• Third line, Methyldopa. \\n \\nDecide treatment based on side effects, risks (to mother and fetus), and the \\nwoman/person’s preferences. \\n \\n9.3 Antenatal care \\n \\nWomen/people with chronic hypertension must be referred to the Obstetric Medicine \\n/ Maternal Medicine Clinic as early as possible in the pregnancy for assessment and \\nplan. \\n \\nConsider: \\n \\n• Full history to consider underlying causes of secondary hypertension. \\n• Cardiovascular examination. \\n• Baseline U&E’s and LFT’s and ECG. \\n \\nA pregnancy plan should be made outlining timing of antenatal appointments and \\nparameters for referral to Day Assessment Unit (DAU) / Antenatal Clinic. \\n \\nHome BP monitoring should be offered (see Appendix 6 for home BP protocol and \\npathway). If not available, women/people will need weekly midwifery review if BP \\ncontrol is difficult or 2-4 weekly for well controlled BP. In addition they should be \\nfollowed up in maternal medicine clinic. \\n \\nUrinalysis for proteinuria should be performed at every visit or if home BP monitoring, \\nweekly. Refer to Day Assessment Unit if new onset proteinuria or other symptoms / \\nsigns of pre-eclampsia and follow guidance in section 11 for management of \\nsuspected pre-eclampsia. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 11 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nAim for a target blood pressure of 135/85mmHg or less. \\n \\nOffer advice on weight management, exercise, healthy eating and lowering the \\namount of salt in their diet. \\n \\nOffer placental growth factor (PIGF) - based testing (if available) to help rule out pre- \\neclampsia between 20 weeks and up to 35 weeks of pregnancy, if a woman/person \\nwith chronic hypertension is suspect of developing pre-eclampsia. \\n \\nSchedule additional appointments based on the individual needs of the \\nwoman/person and their baby. \\n \\n9.3.1 Fetal monitoring \\n \\nIf normal artery doppler at anomaly scans, carry out ultrasound fetal growth scans to \\ninclude amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry at \\n32 weeks and then every 2-4 weeks until birth. \\n \\nIf abnormal artery doppler, perform serial ultrasounds from 28 weeks and then every \\n2-4 weeks until birth. \\n \\nCardiotocography (CTG) is only necessary if fetal activity is abnormal or required in \\nprofessional judgment. \\n \\nRefer to the CG15022 Small for Gestational Age and Fetal Growth Restriction \\nGuideline for further information. \\n \\n9.3.2 Timing of birth \\n \\nAvoid induction of labour before 37 weeks in women/people with chronic \\nhypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, with or without \\nantihypertensive treatment, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Timing of birth and \\nmaternal / fetal indications for birth should be agreed between the senior obstetrician \\nand the woman/person on an individual basis. \\n \\nConsider induction of labour before 37 weeks for women/people with uncontrolled \\nsevere chronic hypertension (110/160 or above), after a course of corticosteroids has \\nbeen completed (if less than 35 weeks), and consider Magnesium Sulphate in line \\nwith CG20013 Preterm Birth Risk Pathway. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 12 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n10.0 Management of pregnancy with later onset or \\ngestational hypertension \\n \\nGestational hypertension is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without \\nsignificant proteinuria. \\n \\n10.1 Antenatal care \\n \\n• Women/people with gestational hypertension should be reviewed in DAU, \\nAntenatal Clinic or Labour Ward depending on the severity by a healthcare \\nprofessional trained in the management of hypertensive disorders of \\npregnancy. \\n• Refer women/people over 20+0 weeks with a first episode of hypertension \\n(blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher) to DAU or labour ward to be \\nseen within 24 hours. \\n• Urgently refer women/people with severe hypertension (blood pressure of \\n160/110 mmHg or higher) to labour ward to be seen on the same day. The \\nurgency of the referral should be determined by an overall clinical \\nassessment. \\n• Previous history of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension, pre-existing \\nvascular or kidney disease, moderate risk factors for pre-eclampsia and \\ngestational age at presentation should be considered. \\n• Offer placental growth factor (PIGF) - based testing (if available) to help \\nrule out pre-eclampsia between 20 weeks and up to 35 weeks of \\npregnancy, if a woman/person with chronic hypertension is suspect of \\ndeveloping pre-eclampsia. \\n• Antihypertensive treatment (see table below and Section 9.2 – for \\ntreatment acceptable in pregnancy). \\n• Bed rest should not be offered as treatment for gestational hypertension. \\n• Home BP monitoring pathway (Appendix 4) may be considered in \\nwomen/people requiring antihypertensive therapy to maintain normal range \\nBP. \\n \\nAction Degree of hypertension \\n \\nHypertension: \\nblood pressure of \\n140/90–159/109mmHg \\nSevere hypertension: \\nblood pressure of \\n160/110mmHg or more \\nAdmission to \\nhospital \\nDo not routinely admit to \\nhospital. \\nAdmit, but if BP falls below \\n160/110mmHg then manage \\nas for hypertension. \\nAntihypertensive \\npharmacological \\ntreatment \\nOffer pharmacological \\ntreatment if BP remains \\nabove 140/90mmHg. \\nOffer pharmacological \\ntreatment to all women. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 13 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nTarget blood \\npressure once on \\nantihypertensive \\ntreatment \\n \\nAim for BP of 135/85mmHg \\nor less. \\n \\nAim for BP of 135/85mmHg or \\nless. \\nBlood pressure \\nmeasurement \\nOnce or twice a week \\n(depending on BP) until BP \\nis 135/85mmHg or less. \\nEvery 15–30 minutes until BP \\nis less than 160/110mmHg. \\nDipstick \\nproteinuria testing* \\nOnce or twice a week (with \\nBP measurement). \\nDaily while admitted. \\n \\nBlood tests \\nMeasure full blood count, \\nliver function and renal \\nfunction at presentation and \\nthen weekly. \\nMeasure full blood count, liver \\nfunction and renal function at \\npresentation and then weekly. \\nPlGF-based testing \\n(if available) \\nCarry out PlGF-based \\ntesting (if available) on \\n1 occasion if there is \\nsuspicion of pre-eclampsia. \\nCarry out PlGF-based testing \\n(if available) on 1 occasion if \\nthere is suspicion of pre- \\neclampsia. \\n\\nFetal assessment \\n• Offer fetal heart \\nauscultation at every \\nface-to-face antenatal \\nappointment. \\n• Ask about fetal \\nmovements at every \\nappointment including \\ntelephone \\nappointments. \\n• Carry out ultrasound \\nassessment of the fetus \\nat diagnosis and, if \\nnormal, repeat every \\n2 weeks. \\n• Refer to CG15022 Small \\nfor Gestational Age and \\nFetal Growth Restriction \\nGuideline \\n• Offer fetal heart \\nauscultation at every face- \\nto-face antenatal \\nappointment. \\n• Ask about fetal movements \\nat every appointment \\nincluding telephone \\nappointments. \\n• Carry out a CTG at \\ndiagnosis and then only if \\nclinically indicated. \\n• Carry out ultrasound \\nassessment of the fetus at \\ndiagnosis and, if normal, \\nrepeat every 2 weeks. \\n• Refer to CG15022 Small \\nfor Gestational Age and \\nFetal Growth Restriction \\nGuideline \\n*\\n Use an automated reagent-strip reading device (if available) for dipstick screening \\nfor proteinuria in a secondary care setting. \\nAbbreviations: BP, blood pressure; CTG, cardiotocography; PIGF, placental growth \\nfactor. \\nNICE NG133 Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy 2019 \\n \\nIn hospital, observations must be recorded on the MEOW chart and referral made \\naccordingly. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 14 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\n10.1.1 Fetal monitoring \\n \\nGestational hypertension (140/90 – 159/109mmHg) \\n \\nIn women/people with gestational hypertension, carry out ultrasound fetal growth to \\ninclude amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry at \\ndiagnosis.

Drugs for which particular attention should be paid to the \\ncontraindications and special warnings during pregnancy and lactation are listed below. \\n \\nAtenolol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \\npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that anticipated benefit \\nbe weighed against the possible risks of its use particularly in the first and second \\ntrimesters of pregnancy, and in women who may become pregnant or who are \\nbreastfeeding. Informed consent on the use of atenolol in these situations should be \\nobtained and documented. \\nCaptopril is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used in UK \\npostnatalobstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated \\nin the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in lactation and that it is not \\nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy or in breastfeeding for preterm \\ninfants and for the first few weeks after delivery. Informed consent on the use of captopril \\nin these situations should be obtained and documented. \\nEnalapril is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \\npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated \\nin the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and that it is not recommended during the \\nfirst trimester of pregnancy or in breastfeeding for preterm infants and for the first few \\nweeks after delivery. Informed consent on the use of enalapril in these situations should \\nbe obtained and documented. \\n \\nLabetalol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension, including during pregnancy and is \\nalready used widely in UK obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it \\nshould only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if the potential benefit \\noutweighs the potential risk, and that breastfeeding is not recommended. Informed \\nconsent on the use of labetalol in these situations should be obtained and documented. \\nMethyldopa is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in \\nUK obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that its use in women who are, \\nor may become, pregnant or who are breastfeeding their newborn infant requires that \\nanticipated benefits be weighed against possible risks. Informed consent on the use of \\nmethyldopa in these situations should be obtained and documented. \\n \\nMetoprolol is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \\npostnatal obstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013)advises that anticipated benefit be \\nweighed against the possible risks of its use in women who are pregnant or \\nbreastfeeding. Informed consent on the use of metoprolol in these situations should be \\nobtained and documented. \\n \\nNifedipine is licensed for the treatment of hypertension and is already used widely in UK \\nobstetric practice, but the SPC (August 2013) advises that it is contraindicated in women \\nwho may become pregnant, and in pregnancy before week 20, and that any use in \\npregnancy after week 20 requires a very careful individual risk benefit assessment. It also \\nadvises that nifedipine should not be used during breastfeeding. Informed consent on the \\nuse of nifedipine in these situations should be obtained and documented. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 27 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nAspirin in pregnancy \\nAppendix 2: Antenatal risk assessment for pre-eclampsia \\n \\nWhy is aspirin given during pregnancy? \\nSome pregnant women are at risk of developing pre-eclampsia (a serious condition which usually \\npresents as high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and fetal growth restriction (when the baby is \\nsmaller than usual due to not growing at a normal rate in the womb). There is evidence to suggest that \\nthis group of women are at reduced risk of developing these conditions if they take a low dose of aspirin \\nduring their pregnancy. \\nWhy do I need aspirin during my pregnancy? \\nIf you have 1 of the following risk factors you will be offered aspirin during your pregnancy: \\n(Your midwife/doctor will indicate which risk factor(s) apply to you) \\n▪ Hypertensive disease during your previous pregnancy \\n▪ Chronic kidney disease \\n▪ Autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome \\n▪ Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes \\n▪ Chronic hypertension \\n▪ Low Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein (PAPP-A) screening blood test \\n▪ Previous Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) - either birth weight <2.5kg over 37 week’s gestation \\nor <10th centile) \\n▪ Previous stillbirth \\n▪ Previous pre-eclampsia or eclampsia \\nIf you have 2 of the following risk factors you will be offered aspirin during your pregnancy: \\n(Your midwife/doctor will indicate which risk factors apply to you) \\n▪ First pregnancy \\n▪ Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years \\n▪ Family history of pre-eclampsia \\n▪ Assisted conception (IVF/ IUI) \\n▪ Age 40 years or older \\n▪ Body Mass index (BMI) of 35Kg/m2 or more at first contact \\n▪ Current smoker \\n▪ Multiple pregnancy \\nHow much aspirin do I need to take? \\nYou will be prescribed 150mg of aspirin to take once daily ideally at night with food. You should take this \\nas soon as you receive the prescription (as this is associated with better outcomes) until the birth of your \\nbaby. \\nHow will I receive the prescription? \\nMost risk factors will be identified by your midwife at your first booking appointment. The midwife will \\nsend a letter to your doctor to request the prescription which you can collect from your doctor’s surgery. \\nSome risk factors may be identified later in your pregnancy, for example following an ultrasound scan. If \\nthis is the case your midwife or doctor will inform you at that time and will notify your doctor in the same \\nmanner. \\nAre there any contraindications to taking aspirin? \\nIf you have any of the conditions below, we would not recommend taking aspirin during your pregnancy: \\nactive or previous peptic (stomach or duodenal) ulcer; bleeding disorders (antiplatelet dose); children \\nunder 16 years (risk of Reye’s syndrome); haemophilia or severe cardiac failure. \\n \\nIf you develop any side effects, then please contact your midwife or Doctor. \\n▪ Your obstetrician will discuss the benefits and risks of treatment with aspirin after 36 weeks \\ngestation and agree with you when to stop aspirin treatment. \\n▪ Stop aspirin 24 hours prior to an elective caesarean section, induction of labour, or any \\ninvasive procedures. \\nStop aspirin if signs of labour or heavy vaginal bleeding. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 28 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nAppendix 3: GP letter – Aspirin prophylaxis \\n\\nDate: \\n \\nDear \\nRE: \\nNHS number: \\n \\nYour patient ................................. has been identified as having one or more risk \\nfactors for development of pre-eclampsia and or intra-uterine growth \\nrestriction and therefore meets the criteria for aspirin prophylaxis in \\npregnancy.

They may wish to purchase \\ntheir own. \\n \\nExclusion Criteria: \\nBefore women start on this pathway the healthcare professionals must make sure that the \\nwomen do not come under any of the exclusion categories below. \\n• Women who are diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia. \\n• Women who have had any systolic BP measurement of 160 mmHg or above and diastolic \\nBP measurement of 110 or above. \\n• Women with worsening abnormality in PET bloods. \\n• Women with symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, abdominal pain or feeling \\nunwell. \\n \\nProcess: \\nArrange for a woman to attend face to face appointment in day assessment unit or antenatal \\nclinic and check eligibility for self-monitoring of blood pressure. Provide antenatal (or \\npostnatal) check as usual. Women may already own their own validated monitor (which can \\nbe used). \\n \\nThe home monitors can be obtained from DAU on each site. \\nEnsure that women’s contact details are up to date on hospital electronic system (home, \\nmobile phone number, email) and update these as necessary. \\n \\nWomen who are suitable for self-monitoring should have a one to one training session on how \\nto measure Blood Pressure (BP) using the equipment provided and how to record it on the \\nmonitoring sheet, with a midwife or doctor. They must also complete a blood pressure monitor \\nloan form with the woman/person. \\n \\nThe woman/person should be given an information leaflet, which describes the technique of \\nmonitoring and the action to take at each threshold of Blood Pressure. They should be given \\nwritten instructions on expected frequency of blood pressure monitoring determined by the \\nConsultant as well as the contact details for the Maternity telephone triage 01903 285269, \\nwhere they could call in for help. \\n \\nAll women suitable for self-monitoring should be entered in a register to be kept in the Day \\nAssessment Unit on both sites. Women/people will be contacted by their community midwife \\nweekly if PIH (gestational hypertension) or alternate week if stable pre-existing hypertension \\nand asked to read out the BP recordings on their sheet or alternatively contact can be \\nmaintained via email with a screenshot of BP sheet which should be uploaded onto Medway. \\n \\nBP and urinalysis, current antihypertensive regime and follow up plan must be recorded on \\nMedway following discussion with the on-call obstetric team or the woman/person’s named \\nconsultant. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 32 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nIt is anticipated that women with chronic hypertension will require home BP monitor for entire \\npregnancy and be followed up in consultant led antenatal clinic/ maternal medicine clinic. \\n \\nWomen with suspected PET/PIH should be discussed with oncall obstetric team, and follow \\nthe NICE guidelines for management of hypertension in pregnancy \\n(www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng133) – which includes weekly ‘PET’ blood tests and \\nurinanalysis in women/people with PIH, which may be done by community midwife. \\nWomen/people with suspected pre-eclampsia require twice weekly blood tests and should be \\nreviewed in DAU. \\n \\nPostnatal women with hypertension should monitor BP daily for 10-14 days and see their GP \\nat 2 weeks post-partum. (See appendix 8) \\n \\nEnsure the woman/person is aware of who (i.e. the labour ward/triage) and when to contact if \\nthe BP rises above the target readings. It is the responsibility of the patient’s named \\ncommunity midwife and the labour ward/obstetric team to oversee the care of the postnatal \\nwomen with hypertension in liaison with the maternal medicine consultants until they are \\ndischarged back to the GP (usually between 2and 6 weeks postnatal). \\n \\nMonitors should be returned to DAU (SRH or WH) by 6-8 weeks after birth at the very latest. \\nCommunity midwives can facilitate the return of the monitor to DAU. \\n \\nOnce returned, wipe the blood pressure monitor thoroughly with a cleaning wipe, and check \\nthat all components are correct (e.g. cuff, connector, batteries). \\n \\n(NB Consider how to record details of blood pressure monitor loans and associated uptake \\nand outcomes as a service evaluation). \\n \\nEducating women on how to perform and record blood pressure: \\nWomen need to be trained in the appropriate technique for taking Blood Pressure. \\nThey should be informed about the following and provided with written information: \\n \\n• Resting for 5 minutes before taking blood pressure. \\n• Do not smoke or drink caffeinated beverages for at least 30 minutes before. \\n• Take the blood pressure reading before (not after) eating. \\n• Sit comfortably with back supported and both feet on the floor (do not cross their \\nlegs). \\n• Elevate arm to heart level on a table or a desk. \\n \\nAsk the woman/person to take her blood pressure twice, at least one minute apart and write \\nthe second blood pressure down in the Blood Pressure monitoring sheet provided. \\nGive written instructions on expected frequency of blood pressure monitoring. \\n \\nValidating the monitor: \\nBlood Pressure monitors once purchased will be inspected by the EBME department and \\nsigned off as fit to use, this lasts for one year. After the year it will need to go back to EBME \\nfor re-validation. \\n \\nPlease see Home BP Pathway for appendices for forms and written information to give \\nto women monitoring their BP at home. \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 33 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nAppendix 7: GP referral letter for postnatal care \\n \\nSt Richard’s Hospital Worthing Hospital \\nSpitalfield Lane Lyndhurst Road \\nChichester Worthing \\nWest Sussex West Sussex \\nPO19 6SE BN11 2DH \\nTel: 01243 788122 Tel: 01903 205111 \\n\\nwww.westernsussexhospitals.nhs.uk \\n\\nURGENT – for immediate review by GP \\n \\nDate: \\n\\nDear Doctor, \\nThis is to inform you that your patient (name).............................. \\nhas been discharged from Worthing Hospital / St Richards Hospital (delete as \\nappropriate) on ..................... following a delivery of a male/female infant. \\nThe baby was delivered at ..................... weeks of gestation by: \\n(Mode of delivery) \\n \\nShe has been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia/pregnancy-induced hypertension \\nand has been put on the following treatment regime: \\n\\nPlan: Please continue with the antihypertensive treatment for 6 weeks. \\n \\nAt 6-8 week postnatal appointment please perform urine dipstick test and \\nBP measurement. \\n \\nPlease refer to specialist any women who remain on antihypertensives or \\nhave persistent proteinuria to assess for kidney function. \\n \\nOther comments: \\n\\nThank you \\nYours faithfully, \\n\\nCG1198 Management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy guideline v4.1 Sept 2021 Page 34 of 34 \\nPlease check against Staffnet that this printout is the most recent version of this document. \\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the patient’s named community midwife and the labour \\nward/obstetric team to oversee the care of the postnatal women with hypertension in \\nliaison with the maternal medicine consultants until they are discharged back to the GP \\n(usually between 2 and 6 weeks postnatal). \\nAppendix 8: Postnatal management of hypertension flow chart \\n \\nCommunity & Secondary Care Pathway for managing hypertension \\nin the postnatal period \\n \\nWomen/people with complicated PET should remain in hospital for 48-72 hrs post birth.
