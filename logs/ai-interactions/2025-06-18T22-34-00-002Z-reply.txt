Give IV acyclovir in labour; inform neonatology. - **Recurrent herpes at delivery:** Vaginal delivery permitted if no lesions; avoid invasive procedures. - **PPROM with primary HSV:** Cesarean advised; IV acyclovir during conservative management. - **Postnatal care:** Hand hygiene critical; avoid kissing with cold sores. Breastfeeding safe unless nipple lesions present. - **Suppressive therapy:** Consider aciclovir from 36 weeks for recurrent HSV. **General:** Professional judgement applies; ensure protocol accessibility",
