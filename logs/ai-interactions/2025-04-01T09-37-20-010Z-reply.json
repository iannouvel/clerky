She also reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) for the past two months.  History of Presenting Complaint:  - Pelvic pain is described as dull and cramping, radiating to the lower back, worse during menstruation.  - Menstrual cycles are regular (28-day cycle) but now last 7-8 days with excessive clotting. Previously, her cycles lasted 5 days with moderate flow.  - Dyspareunia is deep and occurs primarily with deep penetration. No post-coital bleeding reported.  - No associated urinary or bowel symptoms.  - No recent weight loss, fever, or vaginal discharge.  Past Medical History:  - Iron deficiency anaemia (treated with oral iron supplements, now resolved).  - No history of diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders.  Past Surgical History:  - Caesarean section x 2 (first for fetal distress, second elective due to previous section).  - Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (right ovary, 3 years ago).  Gynaecological History:  - Menarche at age 12.  - No history of sexually transmitted infections.  - Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  - Contraception: Currently using condoms intermittently. Previously used combined oral contraceptive pill (stopped due to headaches).  Drug History:  - Paracetamol as needed for pain (no regular use).  - No current regular medications.  Allergy History:  - No known drug allergies.  Social History:  - Non-smoker.  - Occasional alcohol (1-2 units&#x2F;week).  - Works as a primary school teacher.  - Lives with partner and three children.  Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:  - Ideas: Ms. Doe is concerned that her symptoms may be due to fibroids or endometriosis, as her sister has a history of the latter.  - Concerns: She is worried about fertility implications if further surgery is needed.  - Expectations: She hopes for symptom relief and reassurance about future pregnancy plans.  Examination Findings:  - General: Well-appearing, no pallor.  - Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  - Speculum Examination: Cervix appears healthy, no visible lesions or discharge.  - Bimanual Examination: Uterus slightly enlarged (approximately 10-week size), non-tender. No adnexal masses, but mild tenderness in the posterior fornix.  Assessment:  1. Adenomyosis vs. Endometriosis: Given her history of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, dyspareunia, and tender retroverted uterus, adenomyosis or endometriosis are likely.  2. Fibroids: Uterine enlargement could suggest fibroids, though bimanual exam did not reveal obvious nodules.  Management Plan:  1. Investigations:     - Pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal preferred) to assess uterine structure, adenomyosis, fibroids, or endometriomas.     - Full blood count (FBC) to check for anaemia.     - Consider CA-125 if endometriosis is strongly suspected (though non-specific).  2. Medical Management:     - Trial of hormonal therapy (e.g., progesterone-only pill or Mirena IUD) to reduce bleeding and pain.     - NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) for dysmenorrhoea.  3. Surgical Consideration:     - If symptoms persist, diagnostic laparoscopy may be warranted to assess for endometriosis.  4. Follow-Up:     - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.     - Discuss long-term contraception if desired.  Patient Counselling:  - Reassured that her symptoms are manageable and unlikely to affect fertility at this stage.  - Advised to track symptoms in a pain&#x2F;bleeding diary.  - Encouraged to return sooner if pain becomes severe or if new symptoms arise.  Dictated by: Dr. Smith (fictional clinician)  Date: [Today’s date]  Note: This is a fictional dictation for educational&#x2F;testing purposes only. No real medical advice is given.  ---  Would you like any modifications or a second fictional case for comparison?",
