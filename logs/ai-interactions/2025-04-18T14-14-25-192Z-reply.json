No reported loss of consciousness.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 2 hours prior to arrival.  \n- No preceding trauma, chest pain, or dyspnoea.  \n- No recent illness or fever.  \n- Denies headache, visual disturbances, or abdominal pain.  \n- No reported vaginal bleeding or contractions.  \n- Last ate 4 hours prior to symptoms (small meal).  \n- No recent travel or prolonged immobility.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No known medical conditions.  \n- No previous surgeries.  \n- No known allergies.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- No regular medications.  \n- Denies recent use of over-the-counter or recreational drugs.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker.  \n- Occasional alcohol (last drink 1 week ago).  \n- No current employment (student).  \n- Lives with parents.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Alert, appears slightly pale.  \n- **Vitals:**  \n  - BP: 98/62 mmHg (left arm, sitting)  \n  - HR: 110 bpm (regular)  \n  - RR: 16/min  \n  - SpO₂: 98% (room air)  \n  - Temp: 36.7°C  \n- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, no murmurs.  \n- **Respiratory:** Clear, equal air entry.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Neurological:** No focal deficits, normal gait (not formally assessed).  \n\n**Notable Omissions (for testing purposes):**  \n- No documented fetal heart rate assessment (if applicable).  \n- No recorded lying/standing BP comparison.  \n- No detailed fluid intake/output history.  \n- No urinalysis performed.  \n- No assessment for signs of DVT.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nPossible vasovagal episode or orthostatic hypotension in a young primigravida (gestation unclear).
