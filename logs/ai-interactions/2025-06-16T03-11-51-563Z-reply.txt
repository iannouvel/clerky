  "prompt": "Original Transcript:\nSITUATION: 35-year-old G3P1 with recent diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy following investigation results\n\nBACKGROUND: Initially presented with non-specific symptoms 2 weeks ago. Investigations arranged including USS, bloods, and specialist referral. No significant past medical history. Currently 26+2 weeks pregnant. Husband anxious about implications.\n\nASSESSMENT: Results confirm diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. USS shows [relevant findings]. Blood results: Hb 10.2, platelets 180, normal renal function. Patient appears anxious but cooperative. Vital signs stable throughout consultation.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Multidisciplinary team involvement arranged. Patient education provided with written information leaflet. Specialist clinic appointment booked. Serial monitoring planned. Discussed implications for current and future pregnancies.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n- Patient counselled regarding condition and management options\n- Written information provided\n- Next of kin contacted and updated\n- Documentation completed in patient notes\n- Handover given to on-call team\n\nPLAN:\n- Continuous monitoring as per protocol\n- Serial observations 4-hourly\n- Repeat bloods in 24 hours\n- Consultant review tomorrow morning\n- Discharge planning when appropriate\n\nSigned: Dr. [Name]\nDate: [Current date]\nTime: [Current time]\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Include specific ultrasound findings (e.g., adnexal mass, gestational sac location, myometrial involvement) and serum b-hCG levels at diagnosis.  \n   Reason: Guideline emphasizes transvaginal ultrasound as the diagnostic tool of choice and serum b-hCG for management planning (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Specify whether surgical, pharmacological (methotrexate), or expectant management is planned, including criteria for selection (e.g., b-hCG levels, pain severity).  \n   Reason: Guideline outlines tailored management options based on clinical and diagnostic criteria (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n3. **Additional information needed** - Document Rh status and administer anti-D immunoglobulin if RhD-negative.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends anti-D prophylaxis for RhD-negative women undergoing surgical management (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Provide detailed counseling on long-term fertility prospects and conception timing (e.g., 3-month wait post-methotrexate).  \n   Reason: Guideline highlights the importance of discussing fertility outcomes and post-treatment precautions (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Clarify MDT involvement (e.g., surgeon, radiologist) and ensure access to all management options (surgical/pharmacological).  \n   Reason: Guideline stresses the need for trained clinicians and comprehensive service provision (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Offer written information on support groups and bereavement counseling.  \n   Reason: Guideline recommends psychosocial support but does not mandate specific resources (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Document plans for follow-up b-hCG monitoring (e.g., 48-hour repeat if expectant/pharmacological management).  \n   Reason: Guideline notes serial b-hCG levels aid decision-making but is context-dependent (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Improved patient advice** - Suggest muscle relaxation training if methotrexate is used.  \n   Reason: Guideline mentions potential benefits but lacks strong evidence (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n2. **Additional information needed** - Include virtual reality simulator use for surgical training (if applicable).  \n   Reason: Guideline notes VR as a training tool but is irrelevant to direct patient care (bjog-2016-diagnosis-and-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy-pdf).  \n\n**Summary**: Prioritize adding diagnostic details (ultrasound/b-hCG), clarifying management rationale, and addressing Rh status. Fertility counseling and MDT documentation are also valuable. Minor suggestions (e.g., support resources) are optional.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 53 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nPlease extract actionable suggestions from this analysis and format them as specified.",
