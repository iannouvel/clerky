Higher-risk cases should be advised against vaginal delivery. - **Intrapartum care**: - Continuous monitoring, multidisciplinary team involvement. - Lower tolerance for labor delay; expedite delivery if fetal distress occurs. - Assisted maneuvers (e.g., Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit for head delay), no traction on breech. - **Contraindications**: Induction not recommended; cesarean preferred for preterm breech or twin pregnancies with breech-presenting twin. - **Emergency care**: Unplanned breech in labor may require cesarean, especially in first stage. - **Training & governance**: Regular audits, skills drills, and clear communication with patients. - **Patient counseling**: Risks/benefits of ECV, vaginal breech, and cesarean must be discussed\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
