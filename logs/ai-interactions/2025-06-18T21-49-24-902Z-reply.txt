      "newValue": "**Summary of Newborn Feeding Guideline:** - **Breastfeeding Promotion:** Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged for optimal outcomes, with support for positioning, attachment, and responsive feeding. Skin-to-skin contact post-birth aids initiation. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) or cup feeding can be used if needed; formula supplementation should be limited and medically justified to avoid nipple confusion. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Mothers receive instruction on safe preparation and responsive practices. Ready-made formula is preferred in hospitals. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, and recognizing feeding cues are emphasized. Safe sleeping practices (e.g., cot by bed) are discussed. - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support; all staff receive mandatory training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative standards. - **Monitoring & Support:** Newborns are weighed at birth, day 5, and day 10. Complex feeding issues (e.g., tongue-tie) warrant referrals. Expressed breastmilk is encouraged for separated mothers. - **Supplementation:** Only for medical indications; small volumes via cup/tube to protect breastfeeding. Mothers supplementing are supported to maintain milk supply. (Word count: 200)",
