  "response": "Since the guideline content for \"CG1116 Fetal Heart Monitoring & Sampling\" is not available, I cannot provide specific recommendations referencing this guideline. However, based on general obstetric guidelines and standard practice, here are some potential recommendations for improving the clinical note:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Document whether the patient received counseling about macrosomia risks (shoulder dystocia, birth injury, etc.) and whether this was documented in the notes.\n   Reason: Macrosomia is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes, and proper counseling is essential for informed decision-making (standard obstetric practice).\n\n2. [Different management plan] - Consider more urgent fetal assessment (e.g., immediate repeat CTG or ultrasound for biophysical profile) given reduced fetal movements + non-reassuring CTG (did not meet Dawes-Redman criteria).\n   Reason: Reduced fetal movements + non-reassuring CTG may indicate fetal compromise, warranting closer monitoring (standard obstetric practice for fetal surveillance).\n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. [Improved patient advice] - Provide clearer documentation of the risks/benefits of expectant management vs. induction of labor (e.g., specific stillbirth risk statistics, shoulder dystocia risk with macrosomia).\n   Reason: Better patient counseling improves informed decision-making (standard for shared decision-making in obstetrics).\n\n2. [Additional information needed] - Document whether a growth scan was recently repeated to confirm ongoing macrosomia and amniotic fluid volume.\n   Reason: Macrosomia and fluid status may change near term, affecting management decisions (standard obstetric practice).\n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Include more details on the CTG trace (e.g., baseline rate, decelerations, accelerations) rather than just STV and variation comments.\n   Reason: More complete CTG documentation improves interpretation and future review (standard for CTG documentation).\n\n2. [Improved patient advice] - Document whether the patient was given written information on reduced fetal movements and macrosomia risks.\n   Reason: Improves patient understanding and medico-legal documentation (general best practice).\n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. [Additional information needed] - Consider documenting the patient's specific reasons for declining sweep/IOL (e.g., personal preferences, cultural factors).\n   Reason: Minor point, but can help tailor future counseling (general communication best practice).\n\nWithout access to the specific guideline (CG1116), these recommendations are based on general obstetric principles. If you can provide the guideline content, I can refine these to better match its specific recommendations.",
