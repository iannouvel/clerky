Check sodium levels at 28 weeks for those on carbamazepine or levetiracetam. - **Seizure Management in Labor**: Provide one-to-one midwifery care and continuous fetal monitoring for high-risk cases. - **Postnatal Care**: Give Vitamin K to neonates if mother is on enzyme-inducing AEDs. Breastfeeding is generally safe, but avoid initiating lamotrigine during this period. - **Contraception**: Tailor advice based on AED type (e.g., avoid Cu-IUDs/LNG-IUS with enzyme-inducing AEDs). - **Medication Adjustments**: Levetiracetam dose for active seizures is 60 mg/kg (max 4.5 g). - **Risks**: Increased maternal mortality, fetal malformations, and AED concentration fluctuations during pregnancy. - **Monitoring & Audit**: Regular practice audits and access to patient resources (leaflets, support groups) are recommended. *Guideline review due: August 2027.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
