Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, provide analgesia, bladder care, and thromboprophylaxis. Document thoroughly and plan postnatal follow-up. - **Psychological support**: Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions.
