She reports passing **large clots** and describes the bleeding as significantly heavier than her usual pattern. She also complains of **pelvic pressure discomfort** but denies dyspareunia or postcoital bleeding.  \n\n**History of Presenting Complaint:**  \n- Symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, initially intermittent but now occurring almost continuously.  \n- No associated fever, weight loss, or urinary/bowel symptoms.  \n- She has tried over-the-counter pain relief (ibuprofen) with minimal improvement.  \n- No recent contraceptive use (last hormonal contraception discontinued 2 years ago).  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- **Obesity (BMI 37.4)**  \n- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** – diagnosed age 22  \n- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** – diagnosed age 28, managed with metformin  \n- **Hypertension** – on lisinopril  \n- **Previous miscarriage** (spontaneous at 10 weeks, 5 years ago)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- **Cesarean section x2** (last 4 years ago)  \n- **Dilation & Curettage (D&C)** post-miscarriage  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12, cycles previously irregular (PCOS-related) but now heavier and unpredictable.  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections.  \n- Last cervical smear (2 years ago) – normal.  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Metformin 1000 mg BD  \n- Lisinopril 10 mg OD  \n- Ibuprofen PRN (for menstrual pain)  \n\n**Allergy History:**  \n- NKDA  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as a receptionist (sedentary role).  \n- Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (10 pack-year history).  \n- Alcohol: 4-5 units/week.  \n- Lives with partner and 3 children.  \n\n**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried that her symptoms may be due to \"hormonal imbalance\" or \"something more serious like cancer.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Anxious about the impact of prolonged bleeding on her daily life and fertility.  \n- **Expectations:** Hopes for a clear diagnosis and effective treatment to regulate bleeding.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **General:** Obese, no pallor or signs of endocrine abnormality.  \n- **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Pelvic Exam:**  \n  - Speculum – **bulky uterus**, no visible cervical lesions.  \n  - Bimanual – **uterus slightly enlarged**, no adnexal tenderness/masses.  \n- **No evidence of active infection or cervical motion tenderness.**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven her **obesity, PCOS, and persistent abnormal uterine bleeding**, **endometrial hyperplasia** is a significant concern (aligned with **GTG 2014 guidelines**).
