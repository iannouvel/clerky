      "newValue": "**Summary of Antenatal Care Guidelines** - **Provision of Care**: Antenatal care should be individualized, locally accessible, and delivered by a midwifery team, with structured appointments allowing informed decision-making. - **Booking Appointment**: Includes risk assessment (medical, obstetric, psychiatric, social history), health promotion, and screening consent (e.g., Chlamydia/Gonorrhea for ≤24-year-olds, blood/urine tests). Declined tests must be documented. - **Screening & Documentation**: Discuss and record consent for antenatal screening, blood products, and document results/risks in maternity records. Provide information on fetal development and involve partners if desired. - **Clinical Monitoring**: - Urinalysis at each visit for proteinuria/UTIs; culture for high-risk preterm cases. Refer recurrent UTIs to obstetrics. - Monitor fetal growth; refer for scans if concerns. Address common pregnancy issues (e.g., nausea, pelvic pain). - Refer unexplained bleeding (<16 weeks to EPAC; ≥16 weeks to labour ward). - **High-Risk Groups**: - Consultant review for pre-existing conditions. - Additional support for minority ethnic, deprived, or migrant populations; ensure language access. - Safeguarding: Screen for mental health, domestic abuse, FGM, and smoking/alcohol use. Offer cessation advice. - **Continuity & Equity**: Maintain continuity of care, prioritize clear communication for complex cases, and ensure unbiased information in a welcoming environment. - **References**: Aligns with MBRRACE-UK 2023 and UK NSC screening recommendations",
