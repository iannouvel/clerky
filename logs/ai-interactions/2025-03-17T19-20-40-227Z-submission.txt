You are provided with the text of a clinical note from a patient encounter and a set of clinical guidelines. Your task is to:

1. Cross-check the clinical note against each provided guideline:
2. Identify areas in the clinical note that do not fully adhere to the guideline recommendations.
3. Note any parts of the note that could be improved based on the guidelines.
Include the full text of each guideline in your response:
4. For every guideline you reference, include its complete text.
5. Next to each suggested change, provide a short reference to the guideline (e.g., the guideline's name or identifier).
6. Return the clinical note as HTML-formatted code:

The clinical note should be output as valid HTML.
Any text in the clinical note that has been adjusted or needs adjustment (in light of the guidelines) should be wrapped in <i></i> tags (to display in italics).
Ensure that the guideline reference appears immediately following the italicized adjustment for clarity.
Your final output should therefore contain:
The complete text of each guideline used, with clear references.
The HTML-formatted clinical note where adjustments appear in italics with the respective guideline reference.

For example, in the following clinical note text:
Summary:
Patient presents with irregular menstrual cycles, intense cramps, and heavier flow, raising concerns for underlying conditions.

Body:
Patient reports irregular menstrual cycles, increased cramps, and heavier flow.
No history of ovarian cysts or endometriosis.
Further investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted.

Perform pelvic exam to assess reproductive organs.
Consider imaging studies for detailed evaluation.
Discuss family planning goals and contraceptive needs.
Collaborate to determine the most appropriate management approach.

An adjustement in light of this guideline (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline - https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng73) would be to this sentence
Further investigation with pelvic exam and imaging studies is warranted. A family history of endometriosis would make the diagnosis more likely (Endometriosis: diagnosis and management NICE guideline)

Here is the note text: **Summary:**- Age: 39 years old- Presenting complaints: Heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain- BMI: 61- Three prior pregnancies, all delivered via cesarean section**Body:**Mrs. Smith, a 39-year-old female with a BMI of 61, presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and worsening pelvic pain, impacting her daily life. She has a history of fibroids, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, with surgical history significant for appendectomy. The clinician recommends a pelvic ultrasound to assess the fibroids' size and location, considering a myomectomy or endometrial ablation due to the severity of symptoms and previous cesarean sections. A physical examination will be performed to rule out other gynecological issues.**Plan:**1. Schedule pelvic ultrasound to evaluate fibroids.2. Consider myomectomy or endometrial ablation based on ultrasound findings.3. Refer to a nutritionist for weight management.4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and address any questions or concerns.
Here is each guideline with the title followed by the guideline:
1. Menorrhagia and pelvic pain from fibroids
2. Obesity with BMI 61, hypertension, type 2 diabetes
3. Previous cesarean sections, potential myomectomy
