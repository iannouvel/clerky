### Plan:  
1. Urgent quantitative serum β-hCG and progesterone.  
2. Formal transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate for ectopic pregnancy.  
3. Admit for hemodynamic monitoring (tachycardia, pain).  
4. OB/GYN consult for potential methotrexate if ectopic confirmed.  
5. Optimize diabetic control (consider insulin if pregnancy continues).  
6. Counsel on rupture risk, close monitoring, and smoking cessation.  
7. Review β-hCG trends and scan results within 24 hours.  
8. Long-term: Discuss weight management and contraception post-resolution.
