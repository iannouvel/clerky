She reports the pain is sharp, localized to the left iliac fossa, and worsens with movement. She denies fever or urinary symptoms but notes light spotting between periods for the past two cycles. **History of Presenting Complaint:** - Symptoms began after her last menstrual period, which was heavier than usual. - No associated dizziness, syncope, or shoulder tip pain. - Last sexual activity was 4 weeks ago, and she uses condoms inconsistently. - No recent travel or trauma. **Past Medical History:** - Anaemia (postpartum, resolved with iron supplementation). - No known diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disorders. **Past Surgical History:** - Caesarean section x2 (first for fetal distress, second elective due to previous scar). - Dilation & curettage x1 (for incomplete miscarriage). **Gynaecological History:** - Menarche at age 12, cycles previously regular (28-day intervals). - Dysmenorrhea managed with NSAIDs. - No history of STIs (last screen 6 months ago, negative). **Drug History:** - Paracetamol PRN for pain. - No regular medications. **Allergy History:** - NKDA. **Social History:** - Works as a retail assistant. - Smokes 5 cigarettes/day (since age 16). - Occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week). - No recreational drug use. **Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:** - **Ideas:** Worried about another miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. - **Concerns:** Anxiety about fertility due to multiple pregnancies/losses. - **Expectations:** Wants clarity on diagnosis and reassurance about future pregnancies. **Examination Findings:** - **General:** Well-appearing, no pallor or distress. - **Abdominal:** Soft, mild tenderness in left iliac fossa, no guarding/rigidity. - **Speculum:** Minimal blood in vault, cervix appears closed. - **Bimanual:** Cervical motion tenderness negative, left adnexal fullness (no overt mass). **Assessment:** 1. **Suspected Ectopic Pregnancy (high index suspicion given history).** 2. **Differential:** Ovarian cyst complication, pelvic inflammatory disease (less likely). **Management Plan:** 1. **Urgent Investigations:** - Serum beta-hCG (quantitative). - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess pregnancy location/adnexa. - FBC, group & save (given bleeding history). 2. **Immediate Advice:** - Attend ED if severe pain/dizziness occurs. - Avoid intercourse until cleared. 3. **Follow-Up:** - Review results within 24 hours. - If ectopic confirmed, discuss methotrexate vs. surgical options. 4. **Long-Term:** - Contraceptive counselling (given high parity and inconsistent use). - Smoking cessation referral. **Patient Reassured:** Risks/next steps explained. Patient verbalised understanding and agreed to urgent tests. --- **Second Scenario (Gynaecological Focus):** **Patient Details:** - **Name:** Sarah Lee (pseudonym) - **Age:** 35 years - **Weight:** 70 kg - **BMI:** 27 kg/m² - **Gravida:** 0 **Presenting Complaint:** Chronic pelvic pain (6+ months) and worsening dyspareunia. Pain described as deep, cyclical, and radiating to back. **Examination Findings:** - **Bimanual:** Fixed retroverted uterus, tender nodules in posterior fornix. - **USS:** Endometriotic cysts bilateral ovaries (3 cm left, 2 cm right). **Diagnosis:** - **Endometriosis with probable deep infiltrating disease.** **Management:** - MRI pelvis for surgical planning. - Trial of hormonal suppression (progestin-first). - Fertility preservation discussion (given age/nulliparity). --- **Note:** This dictation is entirely fictional for testing purposes. No real medical advice is implied."
