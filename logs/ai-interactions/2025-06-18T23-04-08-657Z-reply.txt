Staff (midwives, obstetricians, etc.) must follow defined responsibilities, with training required for equipment use. Student midwives require mentor assessment. **Key Clinical Recommendations:** - **Baseline vital signs** must be recorded on admission (maternity unit/DAU/Triage). - **MEOWS score** calculated with each observation set; escalate per MEOWS table. - **Frequency of observations** follows flowchart, adjusted per clinical need, MEOWS escalation, or obstetric plan. - **Specific assessments**: carotid pulse if radial absent, ACVPU for consciousness, appropriate temperature methods. - **Emergency Team criteria**: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure, urine output, or other concerns. Deficiencies in student performance must be reported to the university link tutor and documented. Local processes for the Maternal Observation Bundle must be completed at placement start",
