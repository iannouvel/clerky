transvaginal ultrasound should be considered if feasible.  \n5. **Delivery planning:** Discuss mode of delivery (higher risk of cesarean) and anesthetic challenges.  \n6. **Contraception:** Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) should be strongly advised postpartum to prevent rapid repeat pregnancy.  \n\n---\n\n### **HTML-Formatted Clinical Note with Adjustments**  \n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Clinical Note - Miss X</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h2>Summary:</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Age: 16 years</li>\n        <li>BMI: 54 (morbid obesity)</li>\n        <li>Gravidity: 5 (Para 3 + 1 miscarriage + 1 termination)</li>\n        <li>Presenting complaint: 4-month amenorrhoea, intermittent lower abdominal pain, and vaginal spotting for 1 week</li>\n        <li>Irregular menstrual cycles (35–60 days)</li>\n        <li>Inconsistent contraceptive use (primarily condoms)</li>\n        <li>Fatigue and mild dyspnoea on exertion</li>\n        <li>No current breast tenderness, nausea, or urinary symptoms</li>\n        <li>Positive urine hCG, ultrasound confirms intrauterine pregnancy (~14 weeks)</li>\n        <li>Hb 98 g/L (iron-deficiency anaemia), random glucose 8.2 mmol/L (elevated)</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Details:</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Miss X has a history of irregular cycles and inconsistent contraception, with five prior pregnancies (three live births, one miscarriage, one termination).</li>\n        <li>She reports no recent unprotected intercourse but admits to occasional lapses in barrier use.</li>\n        <li>Obesity (BMI 54) and prior gestational diabetes increase pregnancy risks, including thromboembolism and recurrent gestational diabetes.</li>\n        <li>Ultrasound confirmed intrauterine pregnancy at ~14 weeks, though imaging was challenging due to adiposity. <i>Consider transvaginal ultrasound if further clarification is needed (BJOG - 2018 - Denison - Care of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy).</i></li>\n        <li>Elevated random glucose (8.2 mmol/L) and anaemia (Hb 98 g/L) noted, warranting further assessment.</li>\n        <li>Patient expressed concerns about health impacts and family judgement;
