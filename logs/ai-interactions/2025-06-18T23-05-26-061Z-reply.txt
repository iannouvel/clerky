Transfer to RSCH for NICU care. - **Initial Management:** Rapid triage, local stabilization (steroids, antibiotics, tocolysis), and timely transfer. - **Transfer Principles:** Emergency transfer unless specified. Document plan in maternal notes. Escalate refusal cases. - **Communication:** Multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion and clear communication between trusts. RSCH accepts transfers <32 weeks (expected <27 weeks). - **Exception Reporting:** Required if IUT fails (<27 weeks or <28 weeks multiples delivered outside NICU; <31/32 weeks in non-NICU/LNU centers). **Scope:** Applies to all staff involved in antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care. Mandatory training and adherence to guidance required. **Appendices:** Include SBAR tool, SECAmb guidance, exception reporting, and learning review processes. Cases of non-compliance or missed transfers must be reviewed and shared at quality forums. **Exception Report:** Captures gestation, delivery details, missed transfer reasons, and outcomes. Ensures accountability and learning. (Word count: 200)",
