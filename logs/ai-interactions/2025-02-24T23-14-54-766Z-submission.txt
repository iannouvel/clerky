        Here follows the transcript:

30 years old paranoes 28 plus 3 weeks pregnant
 BMI 32 recess negative
 patient known to me from prior antenatal clinic appointment
 had not taken the higher dose of the Beta altitude of side effects
 came in for a blood pressure review
 Mr blood pressure 170 over 116 then 168 over 115 then 159 over 112
 normal reflexes not breath
 no clowness
 this advice to start methodofa 250 milligrams as required and continue with infinite 20 milligrams twice daily
is also due to have a growth scan urgently given poorly controlled potential
 on my review Bethany feeling well with no symptoms of preeclamps here&#x27;s moving well
 she believes as I understand it that the methodopine was to be stopped and methadopa used instead given that she attended with her ongoing courses libido 400 milligrams four times a day and the Philippine 20 milligrams modified release 2 times a day and still had quite labile
 and uncontrolled blood pressure
 the latest blood pressure was in Roman range 139 over 85
 discussion with her about how to optimize going forward she understands that this may be difficult and may require more than two agents concurrently
 and light of the previous data plan we will suspend the nephilippine and continue with methodopa 20750 milligrams twice daily in addition to the Lidl 400 milligrams four times a day
 hopefully this is sufficient to maintain a reasonable blood pressure
 or aiming for 135 over 85 so have the growth again tomorrow and hopefully remains stable four hourly basis for the next
 day or so then she can go home thereafter
