From 38 weeks, discuss risks/benefits of induction of labor (IOL) for macrosomia. - **Birth Options:** - **IOL:** Reduces shoulder dystocia risk but increases perineal tears. No significant difference in perinatal death, brachial plexus injury, or emergency caesarean vs. expectant management. - **Caesarean:** Consider for high-risk cases (e.g., suspected fetal weight â‰¥4.5kg). - **Shared Decision-Making:** Provide informed discussion on risks/benefits, respecting patient preferences for birth experience and outcomes. - **Key Emphasis:** Individualized care, balancing clinical risks with patient autonomy",
