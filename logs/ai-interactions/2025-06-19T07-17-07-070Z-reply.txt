She reports vomiting 15-20 times daily, unable to keep down solid food for 2 weeks, and has lost 6kg since pregnancy confirmation. She also noticed vaginal spotting for 3 days, initially light pink but now brown discharge. Her symptoms seem disproportionately severe for gestational age. Last menstrual period was 13 weeks ago, home pregnancy tests have been consistently strongly positive. No previous pregnancies, conceived naturally after 4 months of trying. Family history includes thyroid disease (maternal). She appears significantly dehydrated and has been unable to work for 1 week due to severity of symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell, with obvious weight loss. Vital signs: BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Weight 52kg (down from 58kg at GP booking). Thyrotoxic signs present: mild tremor, warm skin, tachycardia. Abdominal examination reveals uterine size larger than expected for dates (approximately 16-week size). Speculum shows brown discharge from cervical os, no active bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance with multiple cystic spaces throughout uterine cavity, no fetal pole visible. Quantitative β-hCG markedly elevated at 186,000 mIU/mL (much higher than expected for gestational age). Thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH <0.1 mU/L, elevated free T4 28 pmol/L indicating gestational thyrotoxicosis. Chest X-ray clear, no evidence of pulmonary metastases.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole requiring urgent evacuation. Pre-operative investigations including FBC, coagulation screen, cross-match for 2 units blood. Surgical evacuation arranged urgently via suction curettage under general anesthetic. IV fluid resuscitation commenced. Antiemetics for symptom control. Propranolol considered for thyrotoxicosis symptoms. Post-evacuation histology confirmation and registration with regional trophoblastic screening center mandatory. Serial β-hCG monitoring weekly until negative then monthly for 6 months. Reliable contraception essential during follow-up period. Patient counseled regarding excellent prognosis with appropriate follow-up and monitoring.\n\nGuideline Analysis:\n### Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease\n\nHere is the analysis of the clinical note against the provided guideline, with recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Very Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether Anti-D prophylaxis was given (if patient is Rh-negative).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends Anti-D prophylaxis following removal of a molar pregnancy to prevent Rh sensitization.  \n\n2. **Different management plan** - Ensure oxytocic infusion is **not** used prior to completion of suction curettage unless significant hemorrhage occurs.  \n   Reason: The guideline advises against oxytocic infusion before completion of removal due to the risk of tissue embolization, unless heavy bleeding necessitates it.  \n\n3. **Improved patient advice** - Explicitly counsel the patient on the **importance of reliable contraception** during follow-up and the recommended interval before attempting another pregnancy.  \n   Reason: The guideline emphasizes avoiding pregnancy until hCG levels normalize and follow-up is complete to prevent complications.  \n\n### Somewhat Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Confirm whether ultrasound guidance was used during suction curettage.  \n   Reason: The guideline suggests ultrasound guidance may help minimize perforation risk and ensure complete evacuation.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Provide written information on **support groups and GTD resources** for psychological support.  \n   Reason: The guideline highlights the availability of support for women and families affected by GTD.  \n\n3. **Different management plan** - Consider **prophylactic antibiotics** if there is a high risk of infection post-evacuation.  \n   Reason: While not explicitly stated in the guideline, infection prevention is critical in surgical management.  \n\n### Less Important Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Document whether the **patient was referred to a GTD center** for follow-up (though implied in the note).  \n   Reason: The guideline recommends registration with a regional trophoblastic screening center.  \n\n2. **Improved patient advice** - Clarify the **expected timeline for hCG normalization** and the possibility of chemotherapy if levels plateau.  \n   Reason: The guideline discusses follow-up based on hCG trends, which should be clearly communicated.  \n\n### Unimportant Recommendations\n1. **Additional information needed** - Note whether the **patient was counseled on the risk of future molar pregnancies** (though prognosis is excellent).  \n   Reason: The guideline states the risk is low, but some patients may appreciate reassurance.  \n\n### Summary of Key Improvements Needed:\n- **Critical:** Ensure Anti-D prophylaxis (if applicable) and avoid premature oxytocics.  \n- **Significant:** Use ultrasound guidance during evacuation and provide detailed contraceptive counseling.  \n- **Minor:** Document referral to a GTD center and offer support resources.  \n\nThe clinical note largely aligns with the guideline but could be strengthened with these additions.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nAnalyzed against the most relevant guideline successfully.\n\n*Note: Found 139 relevant guidelines total, analyzed against the most relevant one.*\n\n\nGuideline: Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease\n\n\nFull Guideline Content:\nManagement of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease\n\nHow do molar pregnancies present to the clinician?\nClinicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancy. The most common presentation is irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. Less common presentations include hyperemesis, excessive uterine enlargement, hyperthyroidism, early-onset pre-eclampsia, and abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts. Very rarely, women can present with haemoptysis or seizures due to metastatic disease affecting the lungs or brain.\n\nHow are molar pregnancies diagnosed?\nThe definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination.\n\nRemoval of a molar pregnancy\nWhat is the best method for removal of a molar pregnancy?\nSuction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Ultrasound guidance during removal and curettage may be of use to minimize the chance of perforation and to ensure that as much tissue as possible is removed. Suction curettage is also the method of choice for removal of partial molar pregnancies except when the size of fetal parts deters the use of suction curettage and then medical removal can be used. Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended following removal of a molar pregnancy.\n\nIs it safe to prepare the cervix prior to surgical removal?\nPreparation of the cervix immediately prior to uterine removal is safe.\n\nCan oxytocic infusions be used during surgical removal?\nExcessive vaginal bleeding can be associated with surgical management of molar pregnancy, and the involvement of an experienced clinician is advised. The use of oxytocic infusion prior to completion of the removal is not recommended. If the woman is experiencing significant hemorrhage prior to or during removal, surgical removal should be expedited, and the need for oxytocin infusion weighed up against the risk of tissue embolization.\n\nIn what circumstances should a repeat surgical removal be indicated and what is the timing?\nThere is almost always a role for urgent surgical management for the woman who is experiencing heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise, particularly in the presence of retained pregnancy tissue on ultrasound. Outside the context of acute compromise, there should be consultation with the relevant GTD referral center before performing surgical management for the second time in the same pregnancy. \n\nHistological examination of pregnancy tissue in the diagnosis of GTD\nShould pregnancy tissue from all miscarriages be examined histologically?\nThe histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia if no fetal parts are identified at any stage of the pregnancy. Women who receive care for a miscarriage should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after miscarriage. \n\nShould pregnancy tissue be sent for examination after abortion?\nThere is no need to routinely send pregnancy tissue for histological examination following therapeutic abortion, provided that fetal parts have been identified at the time of surgical abortion or on prior ultrasound examination. Women who undergo medical abortion should be recommended to do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\n\nHow should women with an elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin after a possible pregnancy event be managed?\nReferral to a GTD center should be considered for all women with persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) either after an ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, or after two consecutive treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\n\nWhich women should be investigated for GTN after a non-molar pregnancy?\nAny woman who develops persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event is at risk of having GTN. A urine hCG test should be performed in all cases of persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding lasting more than 8 weeks after a pregnancy event. Symptoms from metastatic disease, such as dyspnea and hemoptysis, or new onset of seizures or paralysis, can occur very rarely.\n\nBiopsy of secondary deposits in the vagina can cause major hemorrhage and is not recommended.\n\nHow should suspected ectopic molar pregnancy in women be managed?\nCases of women with ectopic pregnancy suspected to be molar in nature should be managed as any other case of ectopic pregnancy. If there is a local tissue diagnosis of ectopic molar pregnancy, the tissue should be sent to a center with appropriate expertise for pathological review.\n\nHow is twin pregnancy of a viable fetus and presumptive coexistent molar pregnancy managed?\nWomen diagnosed with a combined molar pregnancy and viable twin, or where there is diagnostic doubt, should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center. In the situation of a twin pregnancy where there is one viable fetus and the other pregnancy is molar, the woman should be counseled about the potential increased risk of perinatal morbidity and the outcome for GTN. Prenatal invasive testing for\n\nThe incidence of GTD is associated with age at conception, being higher in the extremes of age. GTN may develop after a molar pregnancy, a non-molar pregnancy, or a live birth. Clinicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancy, which include irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. The definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination. Suction curettage is the method of choice for removal of complete molar pregnancies. Preparation of the cervix prior to uterine removal is safe. Repeat surgical removal may be indicated in cases of heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute hemodynamic compromise. The histological assessment of material obtained from the medical or surgical management of all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.\n\n- Pregnancy tissue does not need to be routinely sent for histological examination after therapeutic abortion if fetal parts have been identified.\n- Women who undergo medical abortion should do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.\n- Referral to a GTD center should be considered for women with persistently elevated hCG after excluding ectopic pregnancy or after two treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.\n- Persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event should prompt investigation for GTN.\n- Women with suspected ectopic molar pregnancy should be managed like any other case of ectopic pregnancy.\n- Women with combined molar pregnancy and viable twin should be referred to a regional fetal medicine center and GTD center.\n- Women with PSTT or ETT should be registered and cared for within a GTD center.\n- Women with atypical PSN should have their histology reviewed centrally for further management.\n- All women diagnosed with GTD should be registered at GTD centers for follow-up.\n- Follow-up for GTD should be based on hCG levels and may include chemotherapy.\n- Women with GTN may be treated with single-agent or multi-agent chemotherapy based on the FIGO scoring system.\n- Surgery may be considered for PSTT and ETT as they are less sensitive to chemotherapy.\n- The recommended interval between a complete or partial molar pregnancy and trying for another pregnancy should be followed.\n\nWomen following a successful pregnancy after a previous molar pregnancy are advised not to conceive until their follow-up is complete. Chemotherapy recipients are advised to wait 1 year before conceiving. Women who have a pregnancy after a molar pregnancy that did not require treatment for GTN do not need to send a post-pregnancy hCG sample. The risk of another molar pregnancy is low, and women are not at increased risk of maternal complications. However, women exposed to a molar pregnancy prior to the index birth have an increased risk of preterm birth, large-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. The long-term outcome for women treated for GTN is generally excellent, with a high cure rate and successful pregnancies achieved in about 80% of cases. Women should be cautious about premature menopause after treatment with combination agent chemotherapy. It is important to avoid pregnancy until hCG levels return to normal, and contraception guidance can be found through the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health. Exogenous estrogens and fertility drugs may be used after hCG levels normalize. Hormone replacement therapy is safe to use after GTD. Support is available for women and families affected by GTD. Treatment centres are recommended for GTD care. Further research is needed on predicting molar pregnancy outcomes, refining chemotherapy resistance predictions, and managing multi-relapsed disease.
