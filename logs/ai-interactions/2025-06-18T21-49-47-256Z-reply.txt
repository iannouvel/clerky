      "newValue": "**Summary:** This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assisted vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum extraction), emphasizing instrument selection based on risks and benefits. Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates and neonatal risks (cephalohematoma, retinal hemorrhage) but less maternal trauma than forceps. Factors increasing failure risk include mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, and large fetal head circumference. Pre-procedure ultrasound is advised if fetal head position is uncertain. Post-birth care includes antibiotics, monitoring for complications, thromboprophylaxis, analgesia, and bladder care. Psychological support should be offered for traumatic births, avoiding single-session trauma-focused interventions. Units must ensure supportive frameworks for adverse events, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports. Auditable standards should be monitored per RCOG guidelines",
