Vacuum extraction has higher failure rates but less maternal trauma; forceps carry higher maternal risks but lower neonatal risks like cephalohematoma. - **Risk factors for failure**: Mid-cavity/rotational birth, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short maternal stature, or large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and analgesia. Document thoroughly and provide postnatal follow-up discussions. - **Psychological support**: Offer referral to a midwife counselor for traumatic births; avoid single-session, trauma-focused interventions. - **Adverse events**: Units must support affected families and staff, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports when required. - **Audit**: Monitor compliance with RCOG standards",
