      "newValue": "**Summary of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Protocol: GP003** **Definition & Epidemiology**: PID is an ascending infection from the endocervix, causing inflammation of pelvic organs. Incidence is likely underestimated and increasing due to rising STIs. **Pathogens**: Commonly caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, anaerobes, and *Mycoplasma*. **Diagnosis**: - Clinical features: Lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia, abnormal bleeding/discharge, tenderness, fever. - Testing: Screen for gonorrhoea/chlamydia; consider urinalysis, blood tests, swabs, and pelvic ultrasound. **Management**: - **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum regimens (outpatient or inpatient), adjusted for pregnancy and penicillin allergy. - **IV to oral switch**: After clinical improvement. - **Analgesia/anti-emetics**: Offer as needed; paracetamol safe in early pregnancy. **Patient Advice**: Rest, abstain from sex until treatment completion, avoid alcohol with metronidazole, and adhere to follow-up. **Complications & Follow-up**: Discuss long-term sequelae (e.g., infertility); refer for monitoring. Ensure partner notification and STI testing. **Pregnancy Considerations**: Most antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, azithromycin) are safe; limited data for metronidazole/ofloxacin. IUCD removal debated. **Compliance**: Training and protocol adherence are critical for effective management",
