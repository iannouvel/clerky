If not met by 60 minutes, seek obstetric review. - **Intrapartum Monitoring**: Regular CTG review, assess fetal/maternal risks, and document findings. Abnormalities require clinical correlation. - **Poor CTG Quality**: Address transducer issues, reposition, or use fetal scalp electrode (FSE). For telemetry loss, check battery/antenna or switch to wired monitoring. - **Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS)**: Consider for pathological CTG if conservative measures fail. Contraindications include acute fetal compromise, sepsis, bleeding disorders, or prematurity (<34 weeks). Avoid with meconium due to contamination risk. - **Cord Blood Sampling**: Perform if fetal concerns arise during labor or birth, especially for SGA/FGR cases. Paired samples (artery and vein) should be analyzed promptly; delayed analysis (up to 60 mins) is acceptable if necessary. - **Care Analysis (FM800E)**: Use antenatally only; ensure 10 minutes of quality data. Results update every 2 minutes (max 60 mins). Not diagnostic—requires clinical correlation. - **Documentation & Escalation**: Store CTG traces for 25 years. Escalate concerns promptly and consider human factors in interpretation. *Key principles: Prioritize patient preferences, integrate clinical context, and ensure effective team communication.*\",\n      \"action\": \"added\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
