**Clinical Dictation: Fictional Obstetric and Gynaecological Consultation**  

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: Ms. Jane Doe  
- Age: 42 years  
- Weight: 105 kg  
- BMI: 39 (obese class II)  
- Gravida: 3, Para: 2 (2 live births, 1 miscarriage at 10 weeks)  

---

**Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe presents with a 6-month history of irregular heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. She also reports a 2-week history of worsening lower abdominal swelling and discomfort.  

---

**History of Presenting Complaint:**  
Ms. Doe describes her menstrual cycles as irregular, occurring every 3-6 weeks, with heavy bleeding lasting 7-10 days. She reports passing large clots and needing to change sanitary products hourly during the heaviest days. She denies intermenstrual bleeding but reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) for the past 4 months. Over the last 2 weeks, she has noticed a gradual increase in lower abdominal swelling, accompanied by a dull, aching pain. She denies fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel or bladder habits.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago, well-controlled on medication)  
- Gestational diabetes during her second pregnancy  
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, diagnosed in her 20s)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Caesarean section x 2 (first delivery due to fetal distress, second due to breech presentation)  
- Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (10 years ago for a 7 cm dermoid cyst)  

**Gynaecological History:**  
- Menarche at age 13  
- Regular cycles until her 30s, then irregular due to PCOS  
- Last menstrual period: 3 weeks ago  
- No history of sexually transmitted infections  
- Cervical smears up to date, last smear 1 year ago (normal)  

**Drug History:**  
- Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for hypertension  
- Paracetamol as needed for pain (takes 1-2 tablets weekly)  
- No hormonal contraception (stopped combined oral contraceptive pill 2 years ago due to migraines)  

**Allergy History:**  
- No known drug allergies  

**Social History:**  
- Smoker: 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years (currently trying to cut down)  
- Alcohol: 5-6 units per week  
- Occupation: Office manager (sedentary job)  
- Lives with her husband and two children (ages 10 and 7)  
- Denies recreational drug use  

**Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations:**  
Ms. Doe is concerned that her symptoms may be due to fibroids or ovarian cysts, as she has a history of both. She is worried about the possibility of cancer, given her age and family history (mother had breast cancer at 55). She hopes to explore treatment options that do not involve surgery, as she is anxious about undergoing another operation.

**Examination Findings:**  
- General appearance: Obese, no pallor or jaundice  
- Abdominal examination: Soft, non-tender, with a palpable mass extending from the pelvis to the umbilicus. The mass is firm, smooth, and mobile. No signs of peritonitis.  
- Pelvic examination: Cervix appears normal. Bimanual palpation reveals a bulky uterus, approximately 16-week size, with no adnexal masses or tenderness.  
- Speculum examination: No visible lesions or discharge.

**Impression:**  
1. **Complex Gynaecological Issue:** Likely uterine fibroids causing heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and abdominal swelling. Differential diagnosis includes adenomyosis or ovarian pathology.  
2. **Complex Obstetric Issue:** Given her age, BMI, and history of gestational diabetes, she is at increased risk of complications in future pregnancies, including recurrent gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and fetal macrosomia.  

---

**Management Plan:**  
1. **Investigations:**  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound to assess uterine size, fibroid characteristics, and ovarian morphology.  
   - Endometrial biopsy to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy, given her age and heavy bleeding.  
   - Full blood count to check for anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding.  
   - HbA1c to assess glycemic control, given her history of gestational diabetes.  

2. **Treatment Options:**  
   - Medical management: Consider tranexamic acid for heavy bleeding and a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) to reduce bleeding and provide contraception.  
   - Surgical options: If symptoms persist or fibroids are large, consider myomectomy or hysterectomy. Discuss risks and benefits, including impact on fertility.  

3. **Lifestyle Advice:**  
   - Encourage weight loss through diet and exercise to reduce risks associated with obesity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, surgical complications).  
   - Smoking cessation counseling and referral to a smoking cessation program.  

4. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Review in 4 weeks with investigation results to discuss further management.  
   - Referral to a dietitian for weight management support.  

---

**Conclusion:**  
Ms. Doeâ€™s symptoms are likely due to uterine fibroids, but further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathology. She is keen to avoid surgery if possible, so medical management will be explored first. Her age, BMI, and obstetric history place her at higher risk for complications in future pregnancies, which will be discussed in detail at her next visit.
