    "prompt": "Read the clinical scenario below\nList the significant issues as brief, single-line statements. \nWhen multiple issues might be related by a clinical entity, combine them into one concise issue. \nEach issue must be 60 characters or fewer. \nDo not number the issues; simply list one per line.\nPlease only generate 2-3 issues for most patients.\nFor complex patients, perhaps 5 issues, for very complex patients 7. \nUse medical words where possible. \n\nClinical Scenario:\n{{text}}\n\nPlease identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:\n1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., \"Anaemia\" and \"Iron level monitoring\" should merge into \"Anaemia\")\n2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., \"Previous C-section\" and \"Potential need for C-section\" should merge)\n3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise\n4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate\n5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line\n\nClinical Summary:\nPatient: Hi, I'm here for my appointment today.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Hello, welcome. Can you please start by telling me your age?\n\nPatient: I'm 28 years old.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Great, thank you. How many pregnancies have you had before?\n\nPatient: This is my second pregnancy.\n\nHealthcare Professional: And how many deliveries have you had?\n\nPatient: I had one delivery with my first pregnancy.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Thank you for sharing that. Can you also let me know your BMI?\n\nPatient: My BMI is 25.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Perfect, thank you for providing that information. During your second pregnancy, we will need to monitor your blood pressure closely, especially since you had gestational hypertension in your first pregnancy. We will check your blood pressure twice a week starting from now until the end of your pregnancy. If your blood pressure goes above 140/90 mmHg on two separate occasions, please contact us immediately.\n\nPatient: Okay, I will make sure to monitor my blood pressure as advised.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Additionally, due to your history of gestational diabetes in your first pregnancy, we will start monitoring your blood sugar levels early on. I recommend a glucose tolerance test at 24 weeks of pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes. If your blood sugar levels are elevated, we may need to start you on insulin therapy to manage your blood sugar levels.\n\nPatient: Understood, I will schedule the glucose tolerance test at 24 weeks.\n\nHealthcare Professional: Lastly, given your previous delivery, we will discuss the option of a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) closer to your due date. We will assess your eligibility for a VBAC based on various factors. If you experience any unusual symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or decreased fetal movement, please seek urgent medical attention.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the detailed information. I will keep an eye out for those warning signs.\n\nHealthcare Professional: You're welcome. Do you have any concerns or questions regarding your pregnancy that you would like to discuss further?"
