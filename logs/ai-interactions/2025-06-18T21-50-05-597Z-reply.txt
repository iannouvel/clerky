      "newValue": "**Summary:** This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assisted vaginal births using forceps or vacuum extraction. Key points include: - **Instrument choice**: Select the most appropriate tool for first-attempt success. Vacuum extraction has lower maternal trauma risks but higher failure rates and neonatal risks (e.g., cephalohematoma). Forceps are more effective but increase maternal injury risk. - **Failure risks**: Higher with mid-cavity/rotational births, maternal obesity, fetal weight >4000g, occipito-posterior position, short stature, or large fetal head circumference. - **Pre-procedure**: Use ultrasound to confirm fetal head position if uncertain. Administer antibiotics to reduce infection risk. - **Post-birth care**: Monitor for complications, ensure bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, analgesia, and documentation. Offer midwife counseling for traumatic births but avoid single-session trauma-focused interventions. - **Safety & reporting**: Units must support patients and staff after adverse events, adhere to duty of candour, and complete incident reports. Auditable standards should be monitored per RCOG guidelines",
