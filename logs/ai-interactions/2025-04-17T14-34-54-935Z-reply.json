Has developed iron-deficiency anaemia (previously diagnosed, not on treatment). No intermenstrual bleeding.  \n- **Pelvic pain:** Dull, cramping pain radiating to lower back. No dysuria or bowel symptoms. Pain is cyclical but now persistent.  \n- **Attempted treatments:** Over-the-counter NSAIDs provide partial relief.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Iron-deficiency anaemia (secondary to HMB)  \n- Gestational diabetes (last pregnancy, resolved postpartum)  \n- Depression (well-controlled on sertraline)  \n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Appendicectomy (age 18)  \n- Two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (2018, 2020)  \n\n**Gynaecological History:**  \n- Menarche age 12, cycles previously regular (28-day cycle) now irregular (21–35 days).  \n- No history of STIs. Last cervical smear 2 years ago (normal).  \n- Contraception: Condoms (no hormonal contraception currently).  \n\n**Drug History:**  \n- Sertraline 50 mg OD  \n- Ibuprofen PRN (not daily)  \n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Works as a school teacher (moderate stress)  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol (1–2 units/week)  \n- Lives with partner and two children  \n\n**Patient’s Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations (ICE):**  \n- **Ideas:** Worried about fibroids or \"hormonal imbalance.\"  \n- **Concerns:** Fear of needing surgery or hysterectomy. Wants to preserve fertility for potential future pregnancy.  \n- **Expectations:** Requests \"a scan to see what’s wrong\" and alternatives to hormonal treatment.  \n\n**Examination Findings:**  \n- **Abdominal exam:** Soft, non-tender, no palpable masses.  \n- **Speculum exam:** Cervix appears normal, no visible lesions.  \n- **Bimanual exam:** Uterus slightly enlarged (~10-week size), non-tender. No adnexal masses.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. **Probable adenomyosis** (given HMB, dysmenorrhoea, and enlarged uterus).  \n2. **Secondary dysmenorrhoea** – ?endometriosis (given chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia).  \n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. **Investigations:**  \n   - Pelvic ultrasound (to assess for adenomyosis/fibroids).  \n   - Hb/ferritin (to quantify anaemia).  \n   - Consider CA-125 if endometriosis suspected (counselled on limitations).  \n\n2. **Treatment:**  \n   - **Medical:**  \n     - Trial of tranexamic acid + mefenamic acid for HMB.  \n     - Iron supplementation for anaemia.  \n     - Discussed LNG-IUS (Mirena) as first-line for adenomyosis (fertility-preserving).  \n   - **Surgical (if refractory):**  \n     - Hysteroscopic assessment if ultrasound inconclusive.  \n     - Laparoscopy if endometriosis suspected.  \n\n3. **Follow-up:**  \n   - Review in 6 weeks with scan results.  \n   - Referral to gynaecology clinic if symptoms persist.  \n\n**Counselling:**  \n- Reassured that fertility can be preserved with appropriate management.  \n- Advised on weight optimisation (BMI 37) to reduce surgical/anesthetic risks if needed.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Patient consented to ultrasound and blood tests.  \n- Will contact if symptoms worsen (e.g., syncope due to anaemia).  \n\n---  \n**End of Dictation**  \n*This is a fictional scenario for testing purposes only.
