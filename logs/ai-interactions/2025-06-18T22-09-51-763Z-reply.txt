Key measures include ID bands for mothers/babies, staff vigilance, and CCTV. Staff must act swiftly if abduction occurs: raise the alarm, secure ward exits, and inform relevant teams (Head of Midwifery, on-call managers, police). Ongoing actions involve supporting the mother, alerting other parents, and preserving evidence (do not touch the empty cot/clothing). Media inquiries are handled by Communications. Post-incident, complete a Datix form and notify staff when resolved. Training and audits ensure preparedness. Applicable to maternity, security, portering, and switchboard teams",
