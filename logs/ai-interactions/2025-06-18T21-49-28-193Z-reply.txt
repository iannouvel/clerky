      "newValue": "**Summary of Newborn Feeding Guideline:** - **Breastfeeding Support:** Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged, with 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. Skin-to-skin contact aids initiation. Mothers separated from babies should express milk early. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Finger feeding (syringe) for colostrum; cup/tube feeding for larger volumes. Formula supplementation should be limited and responsive. - **Formula Feeding Guidance:** Ready-made formula is preferred; parents receive instruction on preparation and responsive feeding. - **Parent-Infant Bonding:** Rooming-in encouraged; skin-to-skin contact promoted. Safe sleeping practices (cot by bed) emphasized. - **Monitoring & Support:** Weigh babies at birth, day 5, and day 10. Feeding assessments and referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory infant feeding training. Compliance audited via UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative. - **Supplementation Risks:** Formula may reduce breastmilk supply, increase infections, or cause nipple confusion. Medical supplementation should mimic breastfeeding (small amounts, cup/tube). - **Neonatal Unit Care:** Focus on parent-infant attachment, breastmilk provision, and parental partnership in care.
