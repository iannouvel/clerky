Key recommendations: - **Breastfeeding:** Encourage exclusive breastfeeding; initiate skin-to-skin contact post-birth. Support mothers in expressing milk if separated from their baby. - **Alternative Feeding Methods:** Use finger feeding (syringe) for colostrum or cup/tube feeding for larger volumes if needed. Limit supplementation and avoid teat use to prevent nipple confusion. - **Formula Feeding:** Provide guidance on safe preparation and responsive feeding. Ready-made formula is recommended for hospital use. - **Parent Support:** Promote skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, and safe sleeping practices (cot by the bed). Address feeding problems with assessments and referrals for complex issues (e.g., tongue-tie). - **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives lead breastfeeding support. All staff receive mandatory annual training. Compliance is audited via UNICEF BFI standards. - **Monitoring:** Track supplementation rates and feeding cues. Weigh newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10. The guideline prioritizes individualized care, parental education, and maintaining breastmilk supply while respecting feeding choices",
