  "response": "### Summary:  \n- 29-year-old female, G1P0.  \n- Current gestation: 30 weeks + 3 days.  \n- BMI: 24.  \n- Group B Streptococcus (GBS) positive.  \n- History of vaginal candidiasis (VVC).  \n- Low PAPP-A noted at 15 weeks.  \n- Previous consultation at 23 weeks + 1 day regarding mode of delivery.  \n- Leaning towards elective cesarean section (CS) at 31 weeks.  \n- Open to induction of labor (IOL) at 39 weeks with membrane sweep and/or artificial rupture of membranes (ARM).  \n- Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with normal growth trajectory.  \n\n### Details:  \n- Patient is GBS positive, with a history of VVC managed previously.  \n- Low PAPP-A was identified at 15 weeks, with associated risks discussed.  \n- Consultation at 23 weeks + 1 day involved discussion of mode of delivery, with no definitive decision made at that time.  \n- At 31 weeks, patient is considering elective CS but remains open to IOL at 39 weeks with membrane sweep or ARM if appropriate.  \n- Fetal growth is AGA with no concerns regarding growth restriction.  \n\n### Plan:  \n1. Continue routine antenatal care with growth monitoring.  \n2. Reassess mode of delivery preferences at 31 weeks, with emphasis on shared decision-making.  \n3. Plan for GBS prophylaxis per protocol if vaginal delivery is pursued.  \n4. Schedule membrane sweep or ARM at 39 weeks if IOL is elected.  \n5. Discuss risks/benefits of elective CS vs. IOL in subsequent consultations.  \n6. Monitor for recurrent VVC and treat as needed.",
