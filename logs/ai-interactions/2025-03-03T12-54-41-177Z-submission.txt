Please determine the significant clinical issues within this clinical scenario. 
Format each issue as a brief, clear statement.

Rules:
Each issue should be a single line
Maximum number of characters per issue is 60.
If two issues are associated, include them as a single line to avoid repetition - for example, if the patient has multiple symptoms associated with one issue (like painful, irregular heavy periods), the have that as one issue: 'Painful, irregular heavy periods' instead of 3 diferent issues
Do not list the issues with numbers, just simple text

Use the following as an exampled of the type of list I'd like to have returned:

Painful, irregular heavy periods
Subfertility
Considering diagnostic laparoscopy ?endometriosis

Clinical scenario:

Please identify and return a concise list of clinical issues, following these rules:
1. Merge any symptom/condition with its monitoring/management (e.g., "Anaemia" and "Iron level monitoring" should merge into "Anaemia")
2. Merge any related conditions (e.g., "Previous C-section" and "Potential need for C-section" should merge)
3. Keep medical terminology precise and concise
4. Include relevant context in the merged issue where appropriate
5. Return ONLY the final merged list, one issue per line

Clinical Summary:
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some irregular menstrual cycles lately. Healthcare Professional: Have you noticed any specific patterns or changes in your cycle? Patient: Yes, my periods have been heavier and more painful than usual. Healthcare Professional: Have you had any recent weight changes or changes in your exercise routine? Patient: No, nothing significant. But I have been feeling more fatigued than usual. Healthcare Professional: Have you experienced any mood changes or changes in your appetite? Patient: Yes, I've been feeling more irritable and have been craving sweets a lot. Healthcare Professional: It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a hormonal imbalance. We may need to run some tests to investigate further. Patient: Okay, that makes sense. I've also been having some pelvic pain. Could it be related? Healthcare Professional: Pelvic pain can have various causes, including gynecological issues like endometriosis or ovarian cysts. We may need to perform a pelvic exam and possibly imaging studies to determine the cause. Patient: I see. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to manage the pain and irregular periods? Healthcare Professional: In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers for the pain and consider keeping a menstrual diary to track your symptoms. We'll discuss further treatment options once we have a clearer diagnosis. Patient: Thank you for your help. I'll make sure to track my symptoms and follow up with you. Healthcare Professional: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more concerns or if your symptoms worsen. We'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you.
