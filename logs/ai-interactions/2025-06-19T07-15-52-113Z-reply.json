    "transcript": "SITUATION: 25-year-old G1P0 at 12+3 weeks gestation presenting with excessive nausea, vomiting, and suspected molar pregnancy\n\nBACKGROUND: Miss Adams has experienced severe hyperemesis since 8 weeks gestation, significantly worse than typical morning sickness described by friends. She reports vomiting 15-20 times daily, unable to keep down solid food for 2 weeks, and has lost 6kg since pregnancy confirmation. She also noticed vaginal spotting for 3 days, initially light pink but now brown discharge. Her symptoms seem disproportionately severe for gestational age. Last menstrual period was 13 weeks ago, home pregnancy tests have been consistently strongly positive. No previous pregnancies, conceived naturally after 4 months of trying. Family history includes thyroid disease (maternal). She appears significantly dehydrated and has been unable to work for 1 week due to severity of symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears dehydrated and unwell, with obvious weight loss. Vital signs: BP 108/68 mmHg, HR 102 bpm, temp 36.9°C. Weight 52kg (down from 58kg at GP booking). Thyrotoxic signs present: mild tremor, warm skin, tachycardia. Abdominal examination reveals uterine size larger than expected for dates (approximately 16-week size). Speculum shows brown discharge from cervical os, no active bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates characteristic 'snowstorm' appearance with multiple cystic spaces throughout uterine cavity, no fetal pole visible. Quantitative β-hCG markedly elevated at 186,000 mIU/mL (much higher than expected for gestational age). Thyroid function tests show suppressed TSH <0.1 mU/L, elevated free T4 28 pmol/L indicating gestational thyrotoxicosis. Chest X-ray clear, no evidence of pulmonary metastases.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Diagnosis of complete hydatidiform mole requiring urgent evacuation. Pre-operative investigations including FBC, coagulation screen, cross-match for 2 units blood. Surgical evacuation arranged urgently via suction curettage under general anesthetic. IV fluid resuscitation commenced. Antiemetics for symptom control. Propranolol considered for thyrotoxicosis symptoms. Post-evacuation histology confirmation and registration with regional trophoblastic screening center mandatory. Serial β-hCG monitoring weekly until negative then monthly for 6 months. Reliable contraception essential during follow-up period. Patient counseled regarding excellent prognosis with appropriate follow-up and monitoring.",
