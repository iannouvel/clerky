### Summary:  
- **Age**: 36 years  
- **BMI**: 56.4 kg/mÂ²  
- **Parity**: G3P2 (2 vaginal deliveries, 1 early miscarriage)  
- **Presenting complaint**: 6-week history of heavy, irregular vaginal bleeding ("flooding," clots, 7/10 pelvic pain) preceded by 4-month secondary amenorrhea.  
- **PMH**: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, PCOS, depression.  
- **Risk factors for AUB**: Obesity, PCOS, anovulation, diabetes, family history of endometrial cancer.  

### Detailed Assessment:  
1. **Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)**: Likely secondary to endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy given risk factors (obesity, PCOS, anovulation, diabetes).  
   - Heavy bleeding with clots, cramping, and prior amenorrhea.  
   - No hemodynamic instability or signs of infection.  
   - Advised tranexamic acid for acute management and urgent endometrial biopsy/TVUS for definitive diagnosis.  

2. **Chronic pelvic pain**: Possible adenomyosis suggested by bulky uterus (~12-week size) and history of D&C.  
   - No adnexal masses or tenderness on exam.  
   - Further imaging (TVUS) required to evaluate.  

3. **Counseling**: Addressed concerns regarding cancer risk, weight-related surgical risks, and smoking cessation.  
   - Emphasized weight loss for long-term symptom reduction.  

### Plan:  
1. **Investigations**:  
   - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess endometrial thickness/adnexae.  
   - Endometrial biopsy (Pipelle) to exclude hyperplasia/malignancy.  
   - HbA1c and FBC to evaluate anemia/diabetic control.  

2. **Immediate management**:  
   - Tranexamic acid 1g TDS for heavy bleeding.  
   - Weight loss counseling and smoking cessation referral.  

3. **Follow-up**:  
   - Urgent gynaecology clinic review with results.  
   - Discuss hormonal options (e.g., Mirena IUD) if benign pathology.  
   - GP to monitor BP and HbA1c.
