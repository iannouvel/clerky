## Understanding the Categories

### ‚úÖ Auto-Downloadable

**What it means:**
- NICE guideline
- Direct PDF download available
- Hash verified - definitely not in database
- Safe to add with one click

**What to do:**
1. Select checkbox
2. Click "Add Selected"
3. Done! PDF downloaded and added automatically

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Download

**What it means:**

- Need to download manually to verify

**What to do:**
1. Click the provided URL
2. Login to RCOG (if you have membership)
3. Download PDF
4. Upload via `guidelines.html` interface

- Calculated hash
- Hash matches existing file in database
- Same file, possibly different name

**What to do:**
- Nothing! Automatically excluded

## FAQs

### Q: Why do some guidelines need manual download?

A: RCOG restricts PDF access to members. We can't bypass authentication, so we provide the URL for you to download manually.

### Q: How do I know if a manual download is truly new?

A: Upload it via `guidelines.html` - it will hash-check and tell you if it's a duplicate!

### Q: Can I skip manual downloads?

A: Yes! Focus on auto-downloadable NICE guidelines first. RCOG guidelines can be added later when you have time.

### Q: Will I see duplicate entries?

A: No! Fixed with deduplication. Each guideline appears only once.

### Q: Will I see 500 errors?

A: No! RCOG guidelines now handled gracefully with manual download flag.
