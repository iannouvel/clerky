Individualised assessment of the long-term risks of caesarean section based on their individual risk profile and reproductive intentions\n3. Planned caesarean section for breech presentation in spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended\n4. Labour with a preterm breech should be managed as with a term breech\n5. Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills that are needed during vaginal breech birth by all doctors and midwives\n6. Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births\n7. Departments should consider developing a checklist to ensure comprehensive counselling of the woman regarding planned mode of delivery for babies presenting by the breech.",
