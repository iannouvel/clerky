Guideline No. 457: Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIS) Part I: Prevention, Recognition, and Immediate Management

Authors: Dobrochna Globerman, MD, Alison Carter Ramirez, MD, Maryse Larouche, MD, Dante Pascali, MD, Sinead Dufour, PT, PhD, Maria Giroux, MD

Key Recommendations:
1. Systematic rectal examination after vaginal delivery for detection of obstetrical anal sphincter injury.
2. Consider mediolateral episiotomy in primiparous patients undergoing operative vaginal delivery.
3. Repair of obstetrical anal sphincter injury can be delayed for up to 12 hours if immediate provider is unavailable.
4. Pay attention to postpartum voiding function in patients with obstetrical anal sphincter injury.

Key Messages:
1. Sultan's classification is standard for grading obstetrical anal sphincter injuries.
2. Preventive strategies include fetal head control, perineal support, warm compresses, and selective episiotomy.
3. Repair of external anal sphincter may be end-to-end or overlapping, internal anal sphincter should be repaired separately.
4. Obstetrical anal injuries can have short and long-term impacts on anal continence, urinary retention, and other pelvic floor disorders.

During vaginal delivery, a mediolateral episiotomy should strongly be considered by the obstetrical care provider, especially with forceps-assisted deliveries. Third- and fourth-degree anal sphincter injuries should be repaired by experienced care providers. A single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics should be administered immediately following repair of obstetrical anal sphincter injury. Laxatives should be prescribed following primary repair of obstetrical anal sphincter injury. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen should be used as first-line analgesics. Health care providers should pay careful attention to voiding function in patients with an obstetrical anal sphincter injury. Bladder rest via indwelling catheter for up to 24 hours following repair of obstetrical anal sphincter injury may be considered.

OASIS rate has remained very low, with a protocol consisting of 3 manoeuvres during crowning to decrease rates. Warm compress and perineal massage decrease OASIS risk. Certain delivery positions may increase OASIS risk. Episiotomy rates have been declining, with mediolateral episiotomy preferred over midline. Operative vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction carries less risk of OASIS than forceps. OASIS repair should be done by trained clinicians, with repairs typically performed in the delivery or operating room.

Rights reserved. Should be considered as they provide both analgesia and muscle relaxation. The EAS has inherent tone and, when torn, retracts within its capsular sheath. With muscle relaxation, the extent of the tear can be evaluated, and the sphincter ends can be repaired in a tension-free manner. Local anesthetic may be sufficient when only the superficial fibers of the EAS are disrupted. Experts recommend completing the repair under general or epidural anesthesia in the UK. Suture material is important, with absorbable polyglactin and delayed absorbable polydioxanone sutures commonly used. Repair of the anorectal mucosa should be done with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. Repair of the IAS is crucial to prevent anal incontinence. Repair of the EAS can be done with end-to-end or overlap repair techniques. Post-operative management includes prophylactic antibiotics and a postpartum bowel regimen. Laxative use seems beneficial, and analgesia management includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Bladder protocol postpartum is also important.

Postpartum voiding dysfunction can be caused by sphincter rupture, perineal discomfort, and impaired nerve conduction. Risk factors include nulliparity, epidural use, opioid use, cesarean delivery, episiotomy, and assisted vaginal delivery. Failure to diagnose and manage this condition can lead to irreversible bladder dysfunction. Bladder emptying should be assessed through various means, and catheterization may be necessary if spontaneous voiding does not occur within 6 hours of birth. Wound complications following OASIS repair occur in 7.3% of patients, with infection, breakdown, and operative intervention being common. Bowel function outcomes show anal incontinence rates ranging from 20% to 59% within 6 months of delivery. Urinary incontinence rates in women with OASIS range from 16% to 38%, with stress urinary incontinence being the most common type. Sexual dysfunction, including dyspareunia, can affect up to 53% of women with OASIS. Long-term impacts of OASIS on bowel, bladder, and sexual function highlight the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention. Efforts to decrease the incidence and consequences of OASIS are crucial for improving maternal health outcomes.
