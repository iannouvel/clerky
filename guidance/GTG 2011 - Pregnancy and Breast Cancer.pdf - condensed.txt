Pregnancy and Breast Cancer
Greenâ€“top Guideline No. 12
March 2011

1. Purpose and scope: Clinical guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer.

2. Background: Breast cancer is common in females, with a significant impact on young women. Treatment should be multidisciplinary.

4. Optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: Prognosis, diagnosis, consideration of termination, treatment during pregnancy, timing of delivery, and lactation should be carefully considered with a multidisciplinary team.

5. Contraceptive choices for women after breast cancer treatment: Non-hormonal methods are recommended due to contraindications for hormonal contraception.

6. Advice for women planning pregnancy after breast cancer: Consult with clinical oncologists, breast surgeons, and obstetricians. Pregnancy does not adversely affect long-term survival after breast cancer treatment.

Several studies show better survival outcome in women who conceive after treatment for breast cancer. Women who had a full-term pregnancy had a relative risk of death of 0.73. The impact of pregnancy does not seem to be modified by tumor characteristics, but there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy. Advice on postponement of pregnancy should be individualized based on treatment needs and prognosis over time. Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception. Women should be advised that the recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment is 5 years. The majority of pregnancies after breast cancer proceed to live birth, with a small increased risk of miscarriage. Women can be reassured concerning the risk of malformations in children conceived after treatment for breast cancer. Pregnancy following breast cancer should be jointly supervised by the obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon. Women can breastfeed from the unaffected breast without increasing the risk of recurrence. The effect of breast cancer treatment on fertility should be discussed with all women of reproductive age diagnosed with breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea with complete loss of germ cells. The effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy on fertility is reversible. Women are generally advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years after treatment, but age is a major determinant of fertility. Fertility preservation options should be discussed with women before treatment. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue or the whole ovary has resulted in a small number of pregnancies after regrafting. Every breast oncology service should have a designated pathway for prompt referral to a fertility specialist.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends universal access to sperm, egg, and embryo storage for people undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. Fertility treatment after chemotherapy is limited by loss of ovarian reserve. Women who have chemotherapy-induced menopause can become pregnant with donated eggs. Women for whom pregnancy is contraindicated may consider surrogacy.

Reproductive issues in young women with breast cancer are a significant concern. Various studies have been conducted to assess fertility-related concerns, needs, and preferences in this population. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea and fertility preservation strategies have been explored to address these concerns. Hormone therapies and ovarian function preservation methods have shown promise in protecting ovarian function and improving clinical outcomes in young women with breast cancer. Fertility preservation options such as embryo cryopreservation and immature oocyte retrieval have also been studied. It is important for healthcare providers to consider these factors when managing young women with breast cancer.
