Antenatal corticosteroids given within seven days prior to preterm birth reduce perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, an informed discussion should take place about the potential risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM). Birth should not be delayed for antenatal corticosteroids if the indication for birth is impacting the health of the woman or her baby. Antenatal corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when the first dose is given within 48 hours prior to birth. Benefits are also seen when the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth.

- Tolerance for up to 5 days after administration may increase the risk in diabetic women.
- Likely to reduce birthweight if birth occurs more than 7 days after steroids.
- No benefits likely if birth is more than 7 days after starting treatment.
- May increase psychiatric and behavioral diagnoses in children born at term.
- Less evidence for women with multiple pregnancies.
- Effects of unnecessary antenatal corticosteroids are not well described.
- Benefits include reducing respiratory support and increasing neonatal hypoglycemia.
- Uncertainty exists for reduction in RDS, TTN, or NNU admission overall.
- Rescue course likely to reduce need for respiratory support.
- Dose effects seen for harms.

Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM who are at increased risk of preterm birth. Limited evidence supports the use of repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if a woman remains at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after the initial administration. Corticosteroids reduce the risks of RDS and IVH in women with PPROM. The recommended dose and route of administration for antenatal corticosteroids are 24mg dexamethasone phosphate given intramuscularly in two divided doses or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix given intramuscularly in two divided doses. Antenatal corticosteroids are most effective when given within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits also seen within 24 hours of birth. They are most effective in reducing RDS when birth occurs between 24 hours and 7 days after administration.

Significant reductions in cases of RDS and cerebroventricular hemorrhage were observed with antenatal corticosteroid administration within specific timeframes. There is caution needed in interpreting the data due to limitations in subgroup analyses. Accumulated data supports the early effects of antenatal corticosteroids, with maximal effect seen between 24 hours to seven days after administration. Antenatal corticosteroids may have risks for both women and babies, including effects on fetal growth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and long-term development, particularly in term-born infants. WHO recommends offering antenatal corticosteroids only when minimum standards of care are available. Reassuringly, a large randomized control trial found a reduction in neonatal death with antenatal corticosteroid use.

- Birth should not be delayed to administer antenatal corticosteroids when there are serious concerns about maternal or fetal condition that will be alleviated by expedited birth.
- In the presence of systemic infection, the potential beneficial effects of antenatal corticosteroids intended for the baby are balanced against the effect of exacerbating the severity of systemic infection for both the woman and her baby. Corticosteroids cause immune suppression, so there is a potential risk of worsening systemic infection.
