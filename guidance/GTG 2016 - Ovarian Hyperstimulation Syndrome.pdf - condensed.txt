The Management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome 
Clinicians must remain alert to the possibility of OHSS in all women undergoing fertility treatment and women should be counselled accordingly. 
Clinicians need to be aware of the symptoms and signs of OHSS, as the diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. 
In women presenting with severe abdominal pain or pyrexia, extra care should be taken to rule out other causes of the patientâ€™s symptoms. 
The severity of OHSS should be graded according to a standardised classification scheme. 
Licensed centres should comply with regulations in reporting cases of severe or critical OHSS among their patients. 
Fertility clinics should provide information concerning OHSS to all women undergoing fertility treatment. 
Women with OHSS being managed on an outpatient basis should be monitored and reviewed regularly. 
Hospital admission should be considered for women who are unable to achieve satisfactory pain control or maintain adequate fluid intake, show signs of worsening OHSS, are unable to attend for regular outpatient follow-up, or have critical OHSS. 
Multidisciplinary assistance should be sought for the care of women with critical OHSS and severe OHSS. 
Women admitted with OHSS should be assessed at least once daily. 
Fluid replacement by the oral route is the most physiological approach to correcting intravascular dehydration. 
Paracentesis should be carried out under ultrasound guidance. 
Women with severe or critical OHSS should receive LMWH prophylaxis. 
Surgery is only indicated in patients with OHSS if there is a coincident problem. 
Pregnancies complicated by OHSS may be at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery.

Examination and investigation of women with suspected OHSS should include assessing for dehydration, oedema, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body weight. Abdominal assessment should look for ascites, palpable mass, and measure girth. Respiratory assessment should check for pleural effusion, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema. Investigations should include full blood count, haematocrit, C-reactive protein, urea and electrolytes, serum osmolality, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and hCG if appropriate. Ultrasound scan may also be needed. OHSS severity should be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical based on specific features. Clinicians should report cases of severe or critical OHSS to the appropriate authorities. Care for women at risk of OHSS should involve providing information, establishing protocols for assessment and management, and ensuring coordination between fertility clinics and acute units. Outpatient management may be appropriate for mild to moderate cases, with close monitoring and provision of information. Inpatient management may be necessary for women with worsening symptoms, critical OHSS, or complications. Multidisciplinary care is important for severe cases, with monitoring of symptoms and complications.

Abdominal girth, weight gain, oliguria with positive fluid balance, and elevated hematocrit are signs of worsening OHSS. Recovery is indicated by diuresis, normalization of hematocrit, and reduction in abdominal girth and body weight. Analgesia and antiemetics can be used for symptom relief, avoiding nonsteroidal agents and contraindicated medicines in pregnancy. Fluid replacement by the oral route is recommended for correcting intravascular dehydration. Diuretics should be avoided, but may have a role in a multidisciplinary setting if oliguria persists. Paracentesis may be necessary for managing ascites and effusions. LMWH prophylaxis should be given to women with severe or critical OHSS. Surgery is only indicated in cases of OHSS with coincident problems. Pregnancy complicated by OHSS may be at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. Further research is needed to clarify changes in the osmoregulatory system in women with severe OHSS and to evaluate the role of certain medications in managing OHSS. Auditable topics include providing information about OHSS symptoms, reporting severe and critical cases, and prescribing LMWH to all women with severe or critical OHSS.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious condition that can occur in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. It can lead to complications such as ascites and renal dysfunction. Management options include outpatient surveillance, transvaginal drainage of ascites, and dopamine treatment. Severe cases may require hospitalization and intensive care. It is important to monitor for venous thromboembolism and consider the impact on pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to improve understanding and management of OHSS.
