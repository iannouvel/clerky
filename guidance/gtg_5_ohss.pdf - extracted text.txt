The Management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome
This is the third edition of this guideline, previously published in 2006 with the same title.
Executive summary of recommendations
Incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
What is the reported incidence of OHSS?
Clinicians must remain alert to the possibility of OHSS in all women undergoing fertility treatment and
women should be counselled accordingly. [New 2016]
Diagnosis of OHSS
D
How is OHSS diagnosed and what differential diagnoses should be considered?
Clinicians need to be aware of the symptoms and signs of OHSS, as the diagnosis is based on clinical
criteria.
D
In women presenting with severe abdominal pain or pyrexia, extra care should be taken to rule out
other causes of the patient's symptoms. The input of clinicians experienced in the management of
OHSS should be obtained in such cases. [New 2016]
D
Assessing severity and reporting adverse outcomes
How is the severity of OHSS classified?
The severity of OHSS should be graded according to a standardised classification scheme.
How should OHSS be reported?
Licensed centres should comply with Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulations
in reporting cases of severe or critical OHSS among their patients.
Units that treat women with OHSS should inform the licensed centre where the fertility treatment was
carried out to promote clinical continuity and to allow the licensed centre to meet its legal obligations.
Organisation of services
How should care be delivered for women at risk of OHSS?
Fertility clinics should provide verbal and written information concerning OHSS to all women
undergoing fertility treatment, including a 24-hour contact telephone number.
All acute units where women with suspected OHSS are likely to present should establish agreed local
protocols for the assessment and management of these women and ensure they have access to
appropriately skilled clinicians with experience in the management of this condition.

Licensed centres that provide fertility treatment should ensure close liaison and coordination with
acute units where their patients may present. [New 2016]
Initial assessment
How should women suspected of suffering from OHSS be assessed?
Women presenting with symptoms suggestive of OHSS should be assessed face-to-face by a clinician
if there is any doubt about the diagnosis or if the severity is likely to be greater than mild. [New 2016]
D
Outpatient management of OHSS
Which patients with OHSS are suitable for outpatient care?
Outpatient management is appropriate for women with mild or moderate OHSS and in selected cases
with severe OHSS.
D
What management is appropriate in the outpatient setting for patients with OHSS?
Women undergoing outpatient management of OHSS should be appropriately counselled and provided
with information regarding fluid intake and output monitoring. In addition, they should be provided
with contact details to access advice.
D
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided, as they may compromise renal function.
D
Women with severe OHSS being managed on an outpatient basis should receive thromboprophylaxis
with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The duration of treatment should be individualised,
taking into account risk factors and whether or not conception occurs.
D
Paracentesis of ascitic fluid may be carried out on an outpatient basis by the abdominal or transvaginal
route under ultrasound guidance.
D
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists or
dopamine agonists in treating established OHSS. [New 2016]
D
How should women with OHSS managed on an outpatient basis be monitored?
Women with OHSS being managed on an outpatient basis should be reviewed urgently if they develop
symptoms or signs of worsening OHSS (see Section 9.3). In the absence of these, review every
2-3 days is likely to be adequate. [New 2016]
Baseline laboratory investigations should be repeated if the severity of OHSS is thought to be
worsening. Haematocrit is a useful guide to the degree of intravascular volume depletion. [New 2016]

Inpatient management
When should women with OHSS be admitted?
Hospital admission should be considered for women who:
• are unable to achieve satisfactory pain control
D
•
are unable to maintain adequate fluid intake due to nausea
⚫ show signs of worsening OHSS despite outpatient intervention
•
are unable to attend for regular outpatient follow-up
• have critical OHSS. [New 2016]
Who should provide care to women with OHSS?
Multidisciplinary assistance should be sought for the care of women with critical OHSS and severe
OHSS who have persistent haemoconcentration and dehydration.
D
Features of critical OHSS should prompt consideration of the need for intensive care.
D
A clinician experienced in the management of OHSS should remain in overall charge of the woman's
care.
How should women with OHSS be monitored?
Women admitted with OHSS should be assessed at least once daily. More frequent assessment is
appropriate for women with critical OHSS and those with complications.
D
How should the symptoms of OHSS be relieved?
Analgesia and antiemetics may be used in women with OHSS, avoiding nonsteroidal agents and
medicines contraindicated in pregnancy.
D
What is the appropriate management of fluid balance?
Fluid replacement by the oral route, guided by thirst, is the most physiological approach to correcting
intravascular dehydration.
D
Women with persistent haemoconcentration despite volume replacement with intravenous colloids
may need invasive monitoring and this should be managed with anaesthetic input.
D
Diuretics should be avoided as they further deplete intravascular volume, but they may have a role in
a multidisciplinary setting if oliguria persists despite adequate fluid replacement and drainage of
ascites.
How should ascites and effusions be managed?
Indications for paracentesis include the following:
• severe abdominal distension and abdominal pain secondary to ascites
• shortness of breath and respiratory compromise secondary to ascites and increased intra-abdominal
pressure
• oliguria despite adequate volume replacement, secondary to increased abdominal pressure causing
reduced renal perfusion.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5

Paracentesis should be carried out under ultrasound guidance and can be performed abdominally or
vaginally.
C
Intravenous colloid therapy should be considered for women who have large volumes of fluid
removed by paracentesis.
D
How should the risk of thrombosis be managed?
Women with severe or critical OHSS and those admitted with OHSS should receive LMWH prophylaxis.
C
The duration of LMWH prophylaxis should be individualised according to patient risk factors and
outcome of treatment. [New 2016]
D
Women with moderate OHSS should be evaluated for predisposing risk factors for thrombosis and
prescribed either antiembolism stockings or LMWH if indicated.
In addition to the usual symptoms and signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE), thromboembolism
should be suspected in women with OHSS who present with unusual neurological symptoms, even if
they present several weeks after apparent improvement in OHSS.
When is surgical management indicated?
D
Surgery is only indicated in patients with OHSS if there is a coincident problem such as adnexal torsion,
ovarian rupture or ectopic pregnancy and should be performed by an experienced surgeon.
D
OHSS and pregnancy
What are the risks associated with pregnancy and OHSS?
Clinicians should be aware, and women informed, that pregnancies complicated by OHSS may be at
increased risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. [New 2016]

1. Purpose and scope
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a complication of fertility treatment, which uses pharma-
cological ovarian stimulation to increase the number of oocytes and therefore embryos available during
assisted reproductive technology (ART). In a minority of women undergoing treatment, the ovarian
response exceeds that aimed for and results in a clinical condition with a specific pathophysiology. OHSS
is associated with significant physical and psychosocial morbidity and has been associated with maternal
death.¹ However, in most cases OHSS is self-limiting and requires supportive management and monitoring
while awaiting resolution. Women with more severe OHSS may require inpatient treatment to manage the
symptoms and reduce the risk of further complications. The key principles of OHSS management therefore
are early recognition and the prompt assessment and treatment of women with moderate or severe OHSS.
The mechanism whereby OHSS develops has received a lot of interest in recent years and key
proinflammatory mediators are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis. 2,3 However, translating
this basic scientific knowledge into clinical practice has so far proved difficult. There are few high quality
studies that address the management of OHSS, and the subject remains of great significance not only to
clinicians who provide assisted conception treatment, but also to those who look after affected women
in emergency and gynaecology departments distinct from the treating clinic. Very often, women with

OHSS present to clinicians who are not fertility specialists or who do not undertake assisted conception.
This guideline aims to review the literature and provide evidence-based advice to help clinicians
diagnose and manage patients with OHSS. Prevention of OHSS is outside the scope of this guideline and
is covered by guidance from the British Fertility Society.4
2.
Introduction and background epidemiology
Exposure of ovaries to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or luteinising hormone (LH) following
controlled ovarian stimulation by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) underlies most cases of OHSS.
Exposure of hyperstimulated ovaries to hCG leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators. Chief
among these is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but a variety of cytokines are likely to be
involved in the pathogenesis and clinical features of OHSS.¹ The occurrence of ovarian enlargement with
the local and systemic effects of proinflammatory mediators, including increased vascular permeability and
a prothrombotic effect, is responsible for the clinical features of OHSS.
Increased vascular permeability leads to loss of fluid into the third space, manifesting as ascites or, less
commonly, pleural and pericardial effusions. Women with severe OHSS demonstrate hypovolaemia, with
a typical loss of 20% of their calculated blood volume in the acute phase of OHSS.5. Accompanying this
hypovolaemia is reduced serum osmolality and sodium. This paradoxical combination of hypovolaemia
and hypo-osmolality has been ascribed to a 'reset' of the osmotic thresholds of vasopressin and thirst to
lower osmolality and sodium levels as these women remain able to concentrate and dilute their urine
around the new, lower, level of osmolality. The parallel resetting of the osmotic thresholds is thought to
explain the observed decreases in serum osmolality and sodium as opposed to electrolyte losses.6,7
Despite the growing number of cycles of assisted reproduction, the true incidence of OHSS remains
unknown because there is no mandatory reporting for mild and moderate cases. Furthermore, the lack of
an internationally agreed classification system makes it difficult to compare data from different units.8
3.
Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
Library were searched. The search was restricted to articles published between January 2006 and May 2015.
The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms including all
subheadings and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included ‘ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome', 'ovary hyperstimulation', ‘OHSS', ‘hyperstimulation' and 'hyper-stimulation'. The
National Guideline Clearinghouse, NICE Evidence Search,Trip and Guidelines International Network were
also searched for relevant guidelines. Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence.
Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and annotated as 'good practice points' (GPP).

Incidence of OHSS
4.1 What is the reported incidence of OHSS?
Clinicians must remain alert to the possibility of OHSS in all women undergoing fertility treatment and
women should be counselled accordingly.
D
Evidence
It is known that the incidence of OHSS varies between different types of fertility treatment,
with treatments involving greater degrees of ovarian stimulation being associated with a higher level 3
incidence. In cycles of conventional in vitro fertilisation (IVF), mild OHSS has been estimated
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
6 of 22
© Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
to affect around one-third of cycles, while the combined incidence of moderate or severe OHSS
varies from 3.1% to 8%. The 14th European IVF-Monitoring report, 10 analysing data from 25
European countries, found an incidence of hospitalisation due to OHSS of 0.3% in 2010. Data
from the USA showed OHSS to be the commonest complication of IVF treatment,¹¹ with an
incidence of moderate or severe OHSS in 2011 of 1.1%. OHSS is rare following ovulation
induction with clomifene, or monofollicular ovulation induction with gonadotropins, but it has
been reported. Very rarely, OHSS may occur spontaneously, in association with pregnancy. 12
Evidence
level 3
Evidence
Certain patient and cycle characteristics increase the risk of OHSS; women with a previous
history of OHSS, polycystic ovary syndrome, increased antral follicle count (AFC) or high levels
of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are at an increased risk of OHSS. Evidence from meta-analysis¹³
also shows a reduced risk of OHSS in IVF cycles employing gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) antagonists compared with cycles where GnRH agonists are used as part of the regimen
for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. However, OHSS still occurs despite these preventive level 2+
measures and can occur in patients and treatment cycles that do not meet any criteria that
might be considered ‘high risk' for the development of OHSS. The outcome of treatment also
influences the incidence, which is higher in cycles where conception occurs, compared with
cycles without conception, and higher still in cycles resulting in multiple pregnancy,
highlighting the important role of endogenous hCG.
5.
Diagnosis of OHSS
5.1 How is OHSS diagnosed and what differential diagnoses should be considered?
Clinicians need to be aware of the symptoms and signs of OHSS, as the diagnosis is based on clinical
criteria.
In women presenting with severe abdominal pain or pyrexia, extra care should be taken to rule out
other causes of the patient's symptoms. The input of clinicians experienced in the management of
OHSS should be obtained in such cases.
The diagnosis of OHSS is made on clinical grounds (Tables 1 and 2). The typical patient presents
with abdominal distension and discomfort following the trigger injection used to promote final
follicular maturation prior to oocyte retrieval. There may be a preceding history of an excessive
ovarian response to stimulation, but the absence of such a history does not rule out a diagnosis
of OHSS. The time of presentation following trigger injection divides patients into two groups:
early and late OHSS. 'Early' OHSS usually presents within 7 days of the hCG injection and is
usually associated with an excessive ovarian response. ‘Late' OHSS typically presents 10 or more
days after the hCG injection and is usually the result of endogenous hCG derived from an early
pregnancy. The preceding ovarian response in these women may be unremarkable. Late OHSS
tends to be more prolonged and severe than the early form.¹4
The symptoms of OHSS are not specific and there are no diagnostic tests for the condition.
Hence, care must be taken to exclude other serious conditions that may present in a similar
manner but require very different management. Careful assessment by an experienced clinician
may be needed, along with full blood count, serum electrolytes and osmolality, pelvic ultrasound
scan and, in selected cases, abdominal imaging. The combination of elevated haematocrit and
reduced serum osmolality and sodium is indicative of OHSS. It should be remembered that
OHSS by itself is not commonly associated with severe pain, pyrexia or signs of peritonism.
The presence of these features should lead to a thorough clinical review and investigation to

rule out other diagnoses. Important differential diagnoses include pelvic infection, pelvic
abscess, appendicitis, ovarian torsion or cyst rupture, bowel perforation¹ and ectopic Evidence
pregnancy. OHSS should not, therefore, be the 'default diagnosis' for women presenting with level 3
abdominal pain during fertility treatment.

Assessing severity and reporting adverse outcomes
6.1
How is the severity of OHSS classified?
The severity of OHSS should be graded according to a standardised classification scheme.
Several schemes have been developed for classifying the severity of OHSS, 16-19 with no clear
agreement between investigators. The scheme in Table 3 is based on the classification of OHSS
severity proposed in the previous edition of the RCOG guideline combined with useful features
from previous classifications.

a Ovarian size may not correlate with severity of OHSS in cases of assisted reproduction because of the effect of follicular
aspiration. Women demonstrating any feature of severe or critical OHSS should be classified in that category.
Rarely, OHSS may be associated with life-threatening complications, including renal failure,
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), haemorrhage from ovarian rupture, and
thromboembolism. 1,2,20-22 The precise risk of mortality from OHSS is unknown, because there
is no obligation to report such cases internationally. There were three deaths from OHSS
between 1984 and 2008 in the Netherlands; it is estimated that 100 000 IVF cycles were
performed during this period.¹ No deaths were reported in 209 cases of severe or critical OHSS
arising from 73 492 cycles of IVF performed between 1987 and 1996 in 16 out of 19 tertiary
centres in Israel. 23 The 2011 triennial report of the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths
in the UK24 did not identify any maternal deaths due to OHSS in the period 2006-08, during
which time approximately 119 000 IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles were
carried out in 92 813 women.

6.2 How should OHSS be reported?
Licensed centres should comply with Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulations
in reporting cases of severe or critical OHSS among their patients.
Units that treat women with OHSS should inform the licensed centre where the fertility treatment was
carried out to promote clinical continuity and to allow the licensed centre to meet its legal obligations.
Any death related to OHSS in the UK must be reported to MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies:
Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK), 25 irrespective of
whether the woman was pregnant.
Evidence
UK clinics providing licensed fertility treatment are obliged to follow relevant Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) guidelines26 for reporting severe untoward
incidents. In the context of OHSS, this may be taken to include cases of severe or critical OHSS level 4
(as per the classification above) where hospitalisation is needed. Clinicians must recognise the
importance of accurately reporting OHSS as a means of providing reliable data to help patients,
researchers and commissioners of services. The HFEA requires that all incidents be reported
verbally within 12 working hours, followed by a completed incident form within 24 working
hours of the incident being identified.
Since women with OHSS are often admitted to centres other than the treating unit, it is important for the
admitting centre to inform the originating clinic. The duty to report cases of OHSS to the HFEA, however,
lies with the Person Responsible of the licensed centre providing the fertility treatment.
7.
Organisation of services
7.1
How should care be delivered for women at risk of OHSS?
Fertility clinics should provide verbal and written information concerning OHSS to all women
undergoing fertility treatment, including a 24-hour contact telephone number.
All acute units where women with suspected OHSS are likely to present should establish agreed local
protocols for the assessment and management of these women and ensure they have access to
appropriately skilled clinicians with experience in the management of this condition.
Licensed centres that provide fertility treatment should ensure close liaison and coordination with
acute units where their patients may present.
D
OHSS results from fertility treatment carried out, in the UK, in specialist units licensed for this purpose by
the HFEA. In many cases, the treating unit is separate to, and some distance from, acute gynaecology or
emergency departments where women may present with symptoms of OHSS. As a result, in certain
situations the clinicians looking after a patient with OHSS may lack experience in managing this condition.
Efforts should be made to reduce the risk associated with this by patient empowerment and coordination
of services between licensed centres and the acute units where their patients are likely to present.
Women should be informed of the symptoms of OHSS and of the importance of reporting these.
Information concerning OHSS should be delivered face-to-face to all patients undergoing fertility
treatment, backed up with written information27 and advice including a 24-hour contact.
They should be advised to mention that they are undergoing fertility treatment even if they
present with an apparently unrelated symptom, such as headache or visual disturbance.
Evidence
level 4
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
10 of 22
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Gynaecology and emergency departments in acute hospitals should develop evidence-based local
protocols covering the assessment and management of women presenting with suspected OHSS. Input
should be available from senior clinicians with experience of managing OHSS and, as soon as practicable,
women with OHSS should be transferred to the care of such clinicians.
The licensed centre should agree referral pathways and protocols with the acute units to ensure that
specialists provide continuity of care for their patients with OHSS, particularly when women are admitted
to a centre without the required specialist expertise. Acute hospitals with assisted conception units should
ensure that 24-hour input is available from relevant senior clinicians.
8.
Initial assessment
How should women suspected of suffering from OHSS be assessed?
8.1
Women presenting with symptoms suggestive of OHSS should be assessed face-to-face by a clinician
if there is any doubt about the diagnosis or if the severity is likely to be greater than mild.
The aim of initial assessment is to establish the diagnosis (see section 5) and grade the severity
of OHSS (see section 6). Women with symptoms of OHSS may in the first instance be assessed
over the telephone. It is important for staff triaging women over the telephone to have a clear
understanding of the women who will require face-to-face clinical review. Important points to
be noted in the history are specified in Table 1. Specific enquiry should be made for significant
abdominal pain, shortness of breath or a subjective impression of reduced urine output.
These symptoms may indicate severe OHSS and the occurrence of specific respiratory, renal
or ovarian complications. 21,22,28
D
Evidence
level 3
Face-to-face clinical assessment allows examination and investigations with the aim of clarifying the
diagnosis and severity of the patient's condition (Table 2).
9.
Outpatient management of OHSS
9.1 Which patients with OHSS are suitable for outpatient care?
Outpatient management is appropriate for women with mild or moderate OHSS and in selected cases
with severe OHSS.
D
Evidence
A number of retrospective observational series 29-31 have described outpatient management of
severe OHSS. Lincoln et al.30 reported a retrospective series of 48 women with moderate to
severe OHSS managed on an outpatient basis with transvaginal paracentesis and rehydration.
The mean number of outpatient visits was 3.4 ± 0.45 (range 1-14). Hospitalisation was required
in 8.4% of women and no complications were noted. Smith et al.³¹ reported a retrospective
case series of 146 outpatient transvaginal paracenteses in 96 women with OHSS with no
procedure-related complications. A retrospective UK series of 99 women at risk of developing level 3
OHSS was reported by Shukla et al. 32 Women received a daily telephone call by a nurse and
were reviewed by a doctor where necessary. Women were followed up for a median of 8 days
(range 4-31) after egg collection and no woman had complications related to OHSS.
Paracentesis was carried out in 7.1% of women with a mean volume of fluid drained of
4543 ml (SD 2792 ml). Hospital admission was required in 4% of women, with a median length
of admission of 2 days (range 2-5 days).

9.2 What management is appropriate in the outpatient setting for patients with OHSS?
Women undergoing outpatient management of OHSS should be appropriately counselled and provided
with information regarding fluid intake and output monitoring. In addition, they should be provided
with contact details to access advice.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided, as they may compromise renal function.
Women with severe OHSS being managed on an outpatient basis should receive thromboprophylaxis
with LMWH. The duration of treatment should be individualised, taking into account risk factors and
whether or not conception occurs.
Paracentesis of ascitic fluid may be carried out on an outpatient basis by the abdominal or transvaginal
route under ultrasound guidance.
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of GnRH antagonists or dopamine agonists in treating
established OHSS.
Women with OHSS should be provided with verbal and written information about their
condition. There are no specific studies to guide advice regarding fluid intake. However, it
appears reasonable to encourage patients to drink to thirst rather than a set amount.7 Fluid
intake of at least 1 litre a day should be advised. Outpatient management may be aided if patients
are able to maintain fluid input-output charts. Urine output of less than 1000 ml per 24 hours
or a positive fluid balance of greater than 1000 ml over 24 hours should prompt medical review
to assess severity.
Paracetamol and oral opiates including codeine can be offered to women for pain relief.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided as they may compromise
renal function in women with OHSS.28
Women with severe OHSS are at increased risk of thromboembolism. Although there are no
trials on this subject, thromboprophylaxis should be provided for these women in view of the
serious nature of this complication³3 (see section 10.7).
A number of retrospective case series describe outpatient paracentesis in women with severe
OHSS.30-32
An observational study³4 has suggested that GnRH antagonist administration in women with
established severe early OHSS may result in quicker regression of the syndrome. Small
observational studies 35,36 also suggest that dopamine agonists may have a beneficial role in the
treatment of established OHSS. Further research is required to evaluate these interventions.
9.3 How should women with OHSS managed on an outpatient basis be monitored?
Women with OHSS being managed on an outpatient basis should be reviewed urgently if they develop
symptoms or signs of worsening OHSS (see below). In the absence of these, review every 2-3 days is
likely to be adequate.
Baseline laboratory investigations should be repeated if the severity of OHSS is thought to be
worsening. Haematocrit is a useful guide to the degree of intravascular volume depletion.

In the majority of women with OHSS, the condition is self-limiting. The object of monitoring is
to identify women who suffer an increasing severity of OHSS and may require further measures.
In most women, the condition resolves over a period of 7-10 days. 37 If conception occurs,
endogenous hCG can lead to a worsening of OHSS, whereas, in the absence of pregnancy,
recovery is usually complete by the time of the withdrawal bleed.
Clinicians and patients should be vigilant for signs that the severity of OHSS is worsening.
These include:38,39
• increasing abdominal distension and pain
• shortness of breath
•
tachycardia or hypotension
reduced urine output (less than 1000 ml/24 hours) or positive fluid balance (more than
1000 ml/24 hours)
• weight gain and increased abdominal girth
• increasing haematocrit (greater than 0.45).

Inpatient management
10.1 When should women with OHSS be admitted?
Hospital admission should be considered for women who:
are unable to achieve satisfactory pain control
•
are unable to maintain adequate fluid intake due to nausea
• show signs of worsening OHSS despite outpatient intervention
•
are unable to attend for regular outpatient follow-up
D
⚫ have critical OHSS.
Evidence
There is variability in the threshold for hospital admission between practitioners and it is not
possible to be categorical about criteria for admission. The value of admission lies in the
possibility of closer monitoring, ease of intervention and availability of multidisciplinary input.
This is crucial in the care of women with critical OHSS, who may be at imminent risk of
complications or who have already developed complications that may require intensive care.
However, each case should be considered on its merits with reference to the clinical features, level 4
social factors and the expertise available. Women with less severe OHSS may also benefit from
admission depending on their social situation and the availability of out-of-hours expertise. 38
The need for paracentesis is not in itself an absolute reason for admission, although it is
recognised that several hospitals may not have easy access to outpatient paracentesis and
volume replacement.
10.2 Who should provide care to women with OHSS?
Multidisciplinary assistance should be sought for the care of women with critical OHSS and severe
OHSS who have persistent haemoconcentration and dehydration.
Features of critical OHSS should prompt consideration of the need for intensive care.
A clinician experienced in the management of OHSS should remain in overall charge of the woman's
D

care.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
13 of 22
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Patients with severe OHSS where dehydration and haemoconcentration persist despite adequate
fluid replacement may need invasive haemodynamic monitoring, requiring input from
anaesthetic/intensive care colleagues. Intensive care is also likely to be needed for women with
critical OHSS, while specific complications such as thromboembolism, ARDS and renal failure
require input from relevant specialties. 38
Evidence
level 4
Assisted reproduction centres should maintain close liaison with acute gynaecology and emergency units,
so that appropriate expertise is available for the care of women admitted with OHSS.
10.3 How should women with OHSS be monitored?
Women admitted with OHSS should be assessed at least once daily. More frequent assessment is
appropriate for women with critical OHSS and those with complications.
D
Inpatient monitoring of women with OHSS aims to track changes in the severity of the disease
process and to identify any complications at an early stage. Body weight, abdominal girth, and
fluid intake and output should be measured on a daily basis, along with full blood count,
haematocrit, serum electrolytes, osmolality and liver function tests. Depending on the clinical
features, arterial blood gases, ECG, chest X-ray and other imaging may be required. Increasing Evidence
level 3
abdominal girth, weight gain, oliguria with positive fluid balance and elevated haematocrit are
signs of worsening OHSS. Conversely, recovery is signalled by a diuresis, normalisation of
haematocrit and a reduction in abdominal girth and body weight. 38,39 C-reactive protein levels
have been shown to correlate with other markers of OHSS such as abdominal girth and weight,
and may have a role in monitoring severity. 40
10.4 How should the symptoms of OHSS be relieved?
Analgesia and antiemetics may be used in women with OHSS, avoiding nonsteroidal agents and
medicines contraindicated in pregnancy.
Relief of abdominal pain and nausea forms an important part of the supportive care of women
with OHSS. Analgesia with paracetamol and opiates, if required, is appropriate, while NSAIDS
should be avoided as they may compromise renal function. 28 It should be borne in mind that
severe pain may signal a complication such as ovarian torsion or rupture, or a coincident
problem such as ectopic pregnancy or pelvic infection.
10.5 What is the appropriate management of fluid balance?
D
Evidence
level 3
Fluid replacement by the oral route, guided by thirst, is the most physiological approach to correcting
intravascular dehydration.
D
Women with persistent haemoconcentration despite volume replacement with intravenous colloids
may need invasive monitoring and this should be managed with anaesthetic input.
D
Diuretics should be avoided as they further deplete intravascular volume, but they may have a role in
a multidisciplinary setting if oliguria persists despite adequate fluid replacement and drainage of
ascites.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
14 of 22
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
There are no trials on the optimum regimen for managing fluid balance in women with OHSS.
Vigorous intravenous fluid therapy with crystalloids has the potential of worsening ascites in
the presence of increased capillary permeability. Hence, the oral route should be used for
hydration wherever practicable.7 Some patients may need effective analgesia and antiemetics
in order to be able to maintain adequate fluid balance.
Acutely dehydrated women may need intravenous fluid therapy to correct fluid balance,
followed by oral fluids to maintain hydration. Crystalloids are useful for the initial correction of
dehydration in women who are unable to maintain adequate oral intake. There are theoretical
advantages to using colloids rather than crystalloids for initial rehydration. Human albumin and
hexaethyl starch (HES) have been used for correction of dehydration in women with severe
OHSS. However, HES has been withdrawn in the UK as a result of evidence showing increased
mortality in critically ill and septic patients receiving HES compared with those receiving
crystalloids. Human albumin solution 25% may be used as a plasma volume expander in doses
of 50-100 g, infused over 4 hours and repeated 4- to 12-hourly. 38 Strict fluid balance recording
should be followed for these patients.
Persistent haemoconcentration or low urine output despite apparent adequate volume
replacement by colloids is an indication to seek multidisciplinary assistance. In these cases,
continuous urine output measurement and invasive haemodynamic monitoring may help guide
fluid management more accurately. Oliguria despite adequate fluid replacement may in some
cases respond to paracentesis. 41 Small nonrandomised studies 42,43 describe the use of dopamine
infusion or oral docarpamine in treating severe OHSS. It is not possible to be categorical about
the value of these interventions in the absence of adequate trials and they should only be
undertaken in the multidisciplinary setting under close monitoring.
Diuretics have been used in managing fluid balance in women with OHSS, but their use has not
been subjected to controlled studies. There is a risk of worsening hypovolaemia if diuretics are
administered without correcting dehydration. However, careful use of diuretics may be
appropriate in women who continue to exhibit oliguria despite adequate fluid replacement,
particularly if any tense ascites that may have been contributing to oliguria has been drained. 38,44
10.6 How should ascites and effusions be managed?
Indications for paracentesis include the following:
• severe abdominal distension and abdominal pain secondary to ascites
• shortness of breath and respiratory compromise secondary to ascites and increased intra-abdominal
pressure
. oliguria despite adequate volume replacement, secondary to increased abdominal pressure causing
reduced renal perfusion.

D
Paracentesis should be carried out under ultrasound guidance and can be performed abdominally or
vaginally.
C
Intravenous colloid therapy should be considered for women who have large volumes of fluid
removed by paracentesis.
D
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
15 of 22
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Paracentesis should be carried out under ultrasound guidance to avoid trauma to the enlarged,
vascular ovaries. Both abdominal and transvaginal routes are well described. Abdominal
paracentesis allows the insertion of an indwelling catheter and this may minimise the need for
repeat paracentesis. Raziel et al. 45 reported on the transvaginal insertion of an indwelling
catheter in an obese woman, using a guide wire and an indwelling catheter fixed to the woman's
thigh. Most other reports on transvaginal paracentesis, however, describe aspirations in a single
sitting.
46
There is little evidence to guide clinical practice regarding the optimal amount of ascitic fluid
to be removed on any one occasion, the time over which ascites should be drained or the route
of drainage. Smith et al.³¹ reported a series of 146 outpatient transvaginal paracenteses
performed to manage OHSS in 96 patients. The mean volume of fluid removed was 2155 ml
(range 500-4500 ml) with no complications reported. Ozgun et al. reported the drainage of
7.51 on one occasion over 3 hours, and a total of 45 1 by serial vaginal paracentesis with
supportive fluid replacement with no adverse outcome. Patients with OHSS are generally a
younger age group, and are likely to tolerate the removal of large volumes of ascites in a different
way to elderly patients with malignant ascites who may experience significant fluid shifts in
such situations. 38,47
Evidence
level 4
It has been suggested that early drainage of ascites to lower the intra-abdominal pressure in Evidence
patients with moderate to severe OHSS may prevent disease progression and lower the risk of level 3
severe complications associated with this condition. 48 Drainage of 2000 ml of ascitic fluid in
women with severe OHSS produced significant reductions in intra-abdominal pressure and
renal vascular resistance.41 Koike et al. 49 described autotransfusion of ultrafiltered ascitic fluid
into the venous circulation and their observational study showed reduced haemo-
concentration, improved urine output and quicker recovery following this procedure
compared with a conservative treatment regime of diuretics, fluid restriction and intravenous
albumin (without paracentesis). It is not clear to what extent the benefit of this treatment
method lies in drainage of the ascites as opposed to autotransfusion. A further study50 describes
autotransfusion of concentrated ultrafiltered ascetic fluid protein, aiming to replenish the
woman's albumin levels using her own protein, reducing the risk of infection and allergic
reaction to exogenous albumin.
10.7 How should the risk of thrombosis be managed?
Women with severe or critical OHSS and those admitted with OHSS should receive LMWH
prophylaxis.
C
The duration of LMWH prophylaxis should be individualised according to patient risk factors and
outcome of treatment.
D
Women with moderate OHSS should be evaluated for predisposing risk factors for thrombosis and
prescribed either antiembolism stockings or LMWH if indicated.
In addition to the usual symptoms and signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE), thromboembolism
should be suspected in women with OHSS who present with unusual neurological symptoms, even if
they present several weeks after apparent improvement in OHSS.
D
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 5
16 of 22
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Severe OHSS is a prothrombotic state due to haemoconcentration and vascular endothelial
dysfunction. The incidence of thrombosis been estimated to lie between 0.7% and 10% of cases
of OHSS. Rova et al.51 reported on the risk of VTE in early pregnancy in relation to IVF and OHSS.
The review included all deliveries in Sweden (n = 964 532) during the period 1999-2008. Of
these, 19 162 were IVF pregnancies compared to 935 178 non-IVF pregnancies. The incidence
of VTE in the first trimester in non-IVF pregnancies was 0.2 per 1000 women, while the
incidence in IVF pregnancies with no OHSS was 0.8 per 1000 women (OR 4.8,95% CI 2.7-8.7),
compared with 16.8 VTE events per 1000 women for those who developed OHSS (OR 99.7,
95% CI 61.6-161.1).
There are no comparative studies addressing the value of thromboprophylaxis in women with
severe OHSS. However, the incidence of this complication and its potentially life-threatening
nature mean that thromboprophylaxis should be given to women with severe OHSS and
those with risk factors such as reduced mobility, obesity or a pre-existing thrombophilia.
Antiembolism stockings should be used in patients admitted to hospital with OHSS for
whom chemical thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated, as they are likely to have reduced
mobility. 33
Evidence
level 2+
There is no agreement on the duration of thromboprophylaxis in women with OHSS. Several
case reports describe thromboembolism occurring weeks after the apparent resolution of OHSS,
particularly in association with pregnancy. The majority of delayed thromboses are reported
to have occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. Hence, in women with severe OHSS Evidence
who conceive, thromboprophylaxis should be considered at least until the end of the first level 3
trimester. 33,52 In general, the duration of thromboprophylaxis should be based on individual
risk factors and whether or not conception occurs. Liaison with a specialist haematologist may
be beneficial in individualising therapy.
Thrombosis in women with OHSS frequently affects upper body sites and frequently involves
the arterial system. Therefore clinicians should remain vigilant of patients presenting with
unusual symptoms such as dizziness, loss of vision and neck pain. Women may present with
thromboembolism several weeks after apparent resolution of OHSS. 9,52 If a thrombosis is
suspected, then therapeutic anticoagulation should be instigated, while appropriate imaging is
arranged. These patients should be managed in collaboration with colleagues in haematology
and maternal medicine.
10.8 When is surgical management indicated?
Surgery is only indicated in patients with OHSS if there is a coincident problem such as adnexal torsion,
ovarian rupture or ectopic pregnancy and should be performed by an experienced surgeon.
D
Evidence
Hyperstimulated ovaries are likely to be highly vascular and liable to damage on handling. The
risk of ovarian torsion or rupture appears to be increased in women with OHSS, particularly in
the presence of pregnancy. 22,53 Laparoscopic ‘untwisting' of torted hyperstimulated ovaries has level 4
been described. 54 The presence of ovarian enlargement and ascites should be kept in mind
when considering a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
In rare cases of critical OHSS, termination of pregnancy has been reported in the situation of progressive
thrombosis despite anticoagulation, 55 and there have been cases reported for removal of the ovaries
(bilateral oophorectomy) for intractable OHSS;56 however, this is not a recommended treatment option.57

OHSS and pregnancy
11.1 What are the risks associated with pregnancy and OHSS?
Clinicians should be aware, and women informed, that pregnancies complicated by OHSS may be at
increased risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery.
Controlled studies do not show an increase in the risk of miscarriage in pregnancies arising
from assisted reproduction cycles complicated by OHSS compared to cycles without OHSS, 58-60
although some reports have suggested an increased rate of preclinical pregnancy loss in women
with early, but not late, OHSS.59
Data concerning later gestational complications in pregnancies complicated by OHSS are
limited. Courbierre et al.60 found a higher incidence of pre-eclampsia (21.2% versus 9.2%) and
prematurity (36% versus 10.7%) in 40 OHSS pregnancies compared with a control group of 80
IVF pregnancies without OHSS. The proportions of multiple pregnancies were similar between
the two groups. A larger study by Haas et al.61 comparing the obstetric outcomes of 125
pregnancies complicated by severe OHSS with 157 IVF pregnancies without OHSS found an
increased risk of prematurity in singleton, but not multiple, pregnancies with OHSS compared
with the corresponding non-OHSS controls.

Recommendations for future research
More research is required to clarify changes in the osmoregulatory system in women at different phases
of OHSS, using well-defined cohorts of women with severe disease who are followed through the
course of the OHSS.
There is a need to compare outpatient and inpatient management of severe OHSS in terms of safety,
efficacy, patient acceptability and health economic assessment. Such a trial could compare a
'conventional' approach of inpatient management with conservative indications for abdominal
paracentesis with a more 'active' approach emphasising earlier paracentesis on an outpatient basis.
• Further research is required to evaluate the role of GnRH antagonists and dopamine agonists in the
management of women with established OHSS.
13. Auditable topics
• Proportion of women undergoing stimulated assisted reproduction treatment who are provided with
verbal and written information about symptoms of OHSS and 24-hour contact details (100%).
•
Formal agreements between licensed centres providing treatment that may lead to OHSS and acute
units in their catchment area (100%).
Reporting of cases of severe and critical OHSS admitted to hospital in accordance with HFEA
regulations (100%). Responsibility for reporting lies with the licensed centre.
Acute unit to inform licensed centre regarding all patients seen with a suspected diagnosis of OHSS
(100%).
Effectiveness of outpatient management of severe OHSS against locally agreed standard.
Women admitted to hospital should have daily clinical review with weight and abdominal girth
measurements and monitoring of intake and output of fluid (100%).
All women with severe or critical OHSS should be prescribed LMWH, unless there is a contraindication,
whether admitted to hospital or not (100%).

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in
making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically
developed using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical
Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website
at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These recommendations are not intended to dictate
an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual
patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations.
It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine
practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classification of evidence levels
1++ High-quality meta-analyses, systematic
reviews of randomised controlled trials
or randomised controlled trials with a
very low risk of bias
1+
Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic
reviews of randomised controlled trials
or randomised controlled trials with a
low risk of bias
Grades of recommendations
A
1-
Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of
B
randomised controlled trials or
At least one meta-analysis, systematic review or
randomised controlled trial rated as 1++, and
directly applicable to the target population; or
A systematic review of randomised controlled
trials or a body of evidence consisting
principally of studies rated as 1+, directly
applicable to the target population and
demonstrating overall consistency of results
A body of evidence including studies rated as
2++ directly applicable to the target
population, and demonstrating overall
consistency of results; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as
1++ or 1+
randomised controlled trials with a high
risk of bias
2++ High-quality systematic reviews of case-
control or cohort studies or high-quality
case-control or cohort studies with a
very low risk of confounding, bias or
chance and a high probability that the
relationship is causal
2+ Well-conducted case-control or cohort
2-
3
studies with a low risk of confounding,
bias or chance and a moderate
probability that the relationship is causal
Case-control or cohort studies with a
high risk of confounding, bias or chance
and a significant risk that the
relationship is not causal
Non-analytical studies, e.g. case reports,
case series
4
Expert opinion
C
A body of evidence including studies rated as
2+ directly applicable to the target population
and demonstrating overall consistency of
results; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as
2++
Evidence level 3 or 4; or
D
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical
practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for
consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement
regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light
of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
