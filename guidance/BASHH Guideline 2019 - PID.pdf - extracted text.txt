United Kingdom National Guideline for the Management of  Pelvic 
Inflammatory Disease  (2019 Interim Update)  
 
 
Guideline development group: Jonathan Ross (lead author), Michelle Cole, Ceri Evans, Deirdre 
Lyons, Gillian Dean, Darren Cousins , PPI representative  
 
What is new in the 2019 interim  update ? 
 
• the European Medicines Agency has released new guidance highlighting the potential for 
disabling and permanent side effects following the use of fluo roquinolone antibiotics. The 
guidance recommends t hat fluoroqu inolones should not be used for mild to moderate 
bacterial infections when alternative antibiotic therapy is available. The PID guideline has 
therefore been updated to move fluoroquinolones  from first to second -line use, except for  
women with  M genitalium  associated PID.  
• the UK national treatment guideline for gonorrhoea has been updated to recommend the use 
of an increased dose of 1g ceftriaxone. The PID guideline has been updated to also 
recommend this increased dose.  
• advice on the use of antibiotics in very early pregnancy (before a pregnancy test becomes 
positive) has been updated following advice from the UK Teratology Information Service . The 
benefits of therapy would outweigh the risks in this situation.  
 
 
 PID guideline V4       page 2 Introd uction and methodology  
Objectives  
This guideline offers recommendations on the diagnostic tests, treatment regimens and health 
promotion principles needed for the effective management of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) 
covering the management of the ini tial presentation, as well as how to reduce transmission , 
complications  and future repeat infection.  
It is aimed primarily at women aged 16 years or older (see specific guidelines for those under 16) 
presenting to health care professionals working in departments offering specialist  care in STI 
management within the United Kingdom.  However, the principles  of the recommendations should be 
adopted across all providers  – non-specialist  providers may need to develop local care pathways 
where appropriate.  
Included in the guideline is a patient information leaflet . 
 
Search strategy  
The following  reference sources were used to provide a comprehensive basis for the guideline:  
1. Medline Search  
Medline was searched using the search terms: (oophoritis  or salpingitis or endometritis or pelvic 
inflammatory disease or PID or adnexitis or parametritis or adnexal disease) NOT primary 
immunodeficiency; the search was limited to humans and English language papers. The search was 
from 1st January 2010 to 1st August 2017  and identified 12 947  titles. Article titles and abstracts were 
reviewed and if relevant the full text article obtained. Priority was given to randomised controlled trial 
and systematic review evidence.  
2. 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines (www.cdc.gov/std/ tg2015/default.htm ) 
3. Cochrane Collaboration Databases (www.cochrane.org)  
 
A number of limitations were recognised in the evidence base:  
• a gold standard for the accurate diagnosis of PID is not available ther efore a pragmatic 
approach to diagnosis and treatment is applied in many clinical trials  
• the evidence base for PID  treatment mostly comes from studies from several years ago 
which may not reflect recent changes in antimicrobial sensitivity patterns or new er diagnostic PID guideline V4       page 3 tests, particularly for gonorrhoea. The management recommendations have therefore been 
adapted to reflect this.  
• there are relatively less data available on the long term effectiveness of therapy compared to 
short term resolution of symptoms  
 
Methods  
Article titles and abstracts were reviewed and if relevant the full text article obtained. Priority was 
given to randomised controlled trial and systematic review evidence, and recommendations made and 
graded on the basis of best available evidenc e. The evidence was compiled by an external 
information specialist and reviewed by the authors before being incorporated into the guideline  using 
the BASHH framework for guideline development . Successive d rafts of the guideline were informed 
by feedback  from the guideline authors . The final draft guideline was used for piloting and external 
review  as outlined below . 
 
An Equality Impact Assessment was undertaken to assess the relevance of the guideline 
recommendations in relation to age, disability, gender, gender reassignment , pregnancy, race, 
religion/belief  and sexual orientation  (Appendix 1) .  
 
A lay representative reviewed the guideline and contributed to the development of a patient 
information leaflet, with the support of co -author CE. This resulted in a number of changes  to improve 
the clarity  of both documents . The guideline was also reviewed by the BASHH Public Panel.  
 
Piloting and feedback  
Health professional and patient views were further sought by piloting a  draft of the guideline with a 
sample of target users. This was coordinated by the BASHH Clinical Effectiveness Group ( CEG ) 
using health care professionals independent from the writing committee who adopt the guideline into 
their clinical practice in a vir tual fashion for a period of time and then provide an evaluation using a 
standard feedback form.  
 
 
Aetiology  PID guideline V4       page 4 • pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID) is usually the result of infection ascending from the endocervix 
causing endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo -ovarian abcess and/or pelvic 
peritonitis.  
• Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and Chlamydia trachomatis  have been identified as causative agents1-3. 
C. trachomatis is the commonest identi fied cause account ing for 14-35% of cases4,5, whilst 
Gardnerella vaginalis , anaerobes  (including Prevotella , Atopobium  and Leptotrichia ) and other 
organisms commonly found in the vagina may also be implicated.  Mycoplasma genitalium  has 
been associated with upper genital tract infection in women  and is a very likely cause of PID6-8. 
Pathogen negative PID is common9. 
• N. gonorrhoeae  and C. trachomatis  are detected less commonly in older women with PID  
• the insertion of an intrauterine device  (IUD)  increases the risk of  developing  PID but only for 4 -6 
weeks after insertion . This risk is probably highest in women with pre -existing gonor rhoea  or C. 
trachomatis . 
 
Clinical Features  
Symptoms  
The following features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID2,3,10,11 
• lower abdominal pain  which is typically bilateral  (but can be unilateral)  
• abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge which is often purulent   
• deep dyspareunia  
• abnormal vaginal bleeding , including post coital  bleeding , inter -menstrual  bleeding  and 
menorrhagia   
• secondary dysmenorrhoea  
 
Signs  
• lower abdominal tenderness which is usually bilateral  
• adnexal tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination  – a tender mass is sometimes present  
• cervical motion tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination  
• fever (>38°C)  in moderate to severe disease  PID guideline V4       page 5  
A diagnosis of PID should be considered , and usually empirical antibiotic treatment offered , in any 
sexually active woman who has recent onset, lower abdominal pain associated with local tenderness 
on bimanual vaginal examin ation, in whom pregnancy has been excluded  and no other cause for the 
pain has been identified . The risk of PID is highest in women aged under 255 not using ba rrier 
contraception and with a history of a new sexual partner.  The diagnosis of PID based only on positive 
examination findings, in the absence of lower abdominal pain, should only be made with caution12. 
 
Complications  
• women with immunosuppression secondary to HIV may have more severe symptoms associated 
with PID but respond well to standard antibiotic therapy13. No change in treatment 
recommendations compared to HIV uninfected patients is required14-16. (Grade 1B) 
• the Fitz -Hugh  Curtis syndrome comprises right upper quadrant pain associated with perihepatitis 
which occurs in some  women with PID , especially by C. trachomatis . Although laparoscopic 
division of hepatic adhesions has been performed, there is insufficient clinical tria l evidence to 
make specific recommendations for additional treatment beyond th at for uncomplicated PID. 
• a tubo-ovarian abscess should be suspected in pa tients who are  systemically unwell  and/or  have 
severe  pelvic pain. The palpation of an adnexal mass, or lack of response to therapy, should 
prompt  pelvic  imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI) . Tubo -ovarian abscess is an indication for hospital admission for par enteral 
antimicrobial therapy, with appropriate anaerobic cover, and to monitor for signs of rupture or 
sepsis.  
• the randomised controlled trial evidence for whether an intrauterine contraceptive device should be 
left in situ or removed in women presenting with PID is limited17-19. In women with mild to moderate 
PID the IUD may be left in situ but  a review should be performed after 48 -72 hours and the IUD 
removed if significant clinical improvement has not occurred. The decision to remove the IUD 
needs to be balanced against the risk of pregn ancy in those who have had otherwise unprotected 
intercourse in the preceding 7 days. Emergency hormonal contraception following removal of an 
IUD may be appropriate for some women in this situation.  
 PID guideline V4       page 6 Diagnosis  
o PID may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Even when present, clinical symptoms and signs lack 
sensitivity and specificity (the positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis is 65 -90% compared 
to laparoscopic diagnosis3,10,11) 
o Testing for gonorrhoea , C. trachomatis  and M. genitalium in the lower genital tract is 
recommended since a positive result supports the diagnosis of PID  and may alter subsequent 
therapy (Grade 1B). The absence of infection at this site does not exclude PID however3,10,11. 
o Local availability of M. genitalium  testing currently varies but implementation of testing is 
strongly recommended to guide the choice of appropriate therapy  
o An elevated ESR or C reactive protein , or high blood white cell count,  also supports the diagnosis  
but is non-specific20 and usually only abnormal in moderate or severe PID . 
o The absence  of endocervical or vaginal pus cells on Gram -stained examination of a vaginal 
smear has a good negative predictive value (95%) for a diagnosis of PID but their presence  is 
non-specific (poor positive predictive value – 17%)21. 
o Ultrasound scanning is of limited value for uncomplicated PID but is helpful  if an abscess or 
hydrosalpix is suspected22. Doppler ultrasound can detect increased blood flow associated with 
pelvic infection and may be useful , but it cannot differentiate between PID and other causes of 
increased vascularity such as endometriosis23,24. 
o MRI or CT s canning of the pelvis may be helpful in differentiating PID from alternative 
diagnoses25-27 but are not indicated routinely . MRI, when available, is preferable since it provides 
high resolution images and avoid s ionising radiation  in women of reproductive age . 
 
The differential diagnosis of lower abdominal pain in a young woman includes:  
• ectopic pregnancy – pregnancy should be excluded in all women suspected of having PID  
• acute app endicitis – nausea and vomiting occurs in most patients with appendicitis but only 50% of 
those with PID. Cervical movement pain will occur in about a quarter of women with 
appendicitis28,29. 
• endometriosis – the relationship between symptoms and the menstrual cycle may be helpful in 
establishing a diagnosis  
• complications of an ovarian cyst e.g. torsion or rupture – symptoms are often of sudden onset  PID guideline V4       page 7 • urinary tract infection  – often associated with dysuria and/or urinary frequency  
• irritable bowel syndrome – disturbance in bowel habit and persistence of symptoms over a 
prolonged time period are common . Acute bowel infection or diverticular disease can also cause 
lower abdominal pain usually in association with other gastrointestinal symptoms.  
• functional pain (pain of unknown aetiology)  – may be associated with longstanding symptoms  
 
Management  
It is likely that delaying treatment increases the risk of long term sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy, 
infertility and pelvic pain30,31. Because  of this, and the lack of definitive diagnostic criteria, a low 
threshold for empiric treatment of PID is recommended  (Grade 1B). Broad spectrum  antibiotic therapy 
is required to cover the wide range  of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated from the 
upper genital tract in women with PID2,3. 
 
Some of t he best evidence for the effe ctiveness of antibiotic treatment in preventing the long term 
complications of PID comes from the PEACH study where women were treated with cefoxitin followed 
by doxycycline – pregnancy rates after 3 years were similar or higher than those in the general 
population32,33. More recent mathematical modelling also supports a low rate of infertility and ectopic 
pregnancy following effective treatment of PID34. 
 
The choice of which of the recommended  treatment regimen s to use  may be influenced  by: 
• robust evidence on local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns  
• robust evidence on the local epidemiology of specific infections in this setting  
• cost 
• patient preference and compliance  
• severity of disease  
• patient age – sexually transmitted pathogens are less likely to be the cause of PID in older women5 
• local antibi otic stewardship guidelines  
 
General Advice  PID guideline V4       page 8 Rest is advised for those with severe disease. (Grade  1D) 
Appropriate analgesia should be provided. (Grade  1D) 
Intravenous therapy is recommended for patients with more severe clinical disease (Grade 1D) e.g. 
pyrexia > 38oC, clinical signs of tubo -ovarian ab scess, signs of pelvic peritonitis . 
To avoid reinfection , patients should be advised to avoid oral or genital intercourse until they, and 
their partner(s), have completed their treatment (Grade 1D). 
A detailed explanation of their condition with particular emphasis on the long term implications for the 
health of themselves and their partner(s) should be provided , reinforced with clear and accurate 
written information (Grade 1D). A patient information leaflet is included in Appendix 2 of this guideline.  
 
When giving information to patients, the clinician should consider the following:  
• an explanation of what treatment is being given and its possible adverse effects  
• that following treatment fertility is usually maintained but there remains a risk of future 
infertility, chronic pelvic pain or ectopic pregnancy  
• clinically more severe disease is associated with a greater risk of sequelae  
• repeat episodes of PID are associated with an exponential increase in the risk of infertility  
• the earlier treatment is given the lower the risk of future fertility problems  
• future use of barrier contraception will significantly red uce the risk of PID  
• the need to screen sexual contacts for infection to prevent re -infect ion 
 PID guideline V4       page 9 Outpatient therapy is as effective as inpatient treatment for patients with clinically mild to moderate 
PID32. Admission for parenteral therapy, observation, further investigation and/or possible surgical 
intervention should be considered in the following situations  (Grade 1D): 
• a surgical emergency cannot be excluded  
• lack of response to oral therapy  
• clinically se vere disease  
• presence of a tubo -ovarian ab scess  
• intolerance to oral therapy  
• pregnancy  
 
Further Investigation  
All sexually active women who are potentially fertile should be offered  a pregnancy test  to exclude 
ectopic pregnancy (Grade 1D). 
 
Treatment  
The following antibiotic regimens are evidence based.  
 
Recommended Regimens  
All the recommended regimens are of similar efficacy.  
 
Outpatient Regimens  
  First Line Therapy  
i.m. ceftriaxone* 1g single dose  followed by  oral doxycycline 100mg twice daily plus 
metronidazole 400mg twice daily for 14 days  
Grade 1A35-37 
 
*Clinical trial data support the use of cefoxitin for the treatment of PID but this agent is not easily 
available in the UK so ceftriaxone, which has a similar spectrum of activity, is recommended.  
 
  Second  Line Therapy  
oral ofloxacin 400mg twice  daily plus oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily for 14 days  PID guideline V4       page 10 Grade 1A37-41  
 
 
oral moxifloxacin 400mg once daily for 14 days  
Grade 1A42-44 
 
Metronidazole is included in some regimens to improve coverage for anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobes 
are of relatively greater importance in patients with severe PID and metronidazole may be 
discontinued in those patients with mild or moderate PID who are unabl e to tolerate it.  
 
Ofloxacin and moxifloxacin should be avoided in patients who are at high risk of gonococcal PID (e.g. 
when the patient’s partner has gonorrhoea, in clinically severe disease, following sexual contact 
abroad) because of high levels of  quinolone resistance 45. N. gonorrhoeae  is, however, an uncommon 
cause of PID in the UK (< 3%) and in those not at high risk of gonorrhoea q uinolones can be used  as 
second line empirical treatment , with therapy being adjusted subsequently if testing reveals  quinolone 
resistant N. gonorrhoeae . 
 
Levofloxacin is the L isomer of ofloxacin46 and has the advantage of once daily dosing (500mg OD for 
14 days). It may be used as  a more convenient alternative to ofloxacin42. 
 
Three large RCTs support the efficacy of moxifloxacin for PID. There is a potential risk of serious liver 
reactions occurring with this agent but they are uncommon  (12 cases reported in the UK from 2003 -16 
with no deaths)  and moxifloxacin is generally well tolerated47 (Grade 1D).  Of the three recommended 
PID treatment regimens, moxifloxacin provides the h ighest microbiological activity against M. 
genitalium8. 
 
Ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are effective for the treatment of C. trachomatis. Quinolones  
(ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) can cause disabling and potentially permanent side -effects 
involving tendons. muscles, joints and the nervous system48, and are therefore only recommended as 
second line therapy except for the treatment of M genitalium  associated PID where no alternative 
therapy is available.  Quinolones are also not licensed for use in patients aged under 18.  PID guideline V4       page 11  
Replacing intramuscular ceftriaxone with an oral cephalosporin (e.g. cefixime) is not recommended 
because there is no clinical trial evidence to support its use, and tissue levels are likely to be lower 
which might impact on efficacy. Reports of decreasing susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae  to 
cephalosporins also supports the use of parenteral based regimens when gonococcal PID is 
suspected (to maximise tissue levels and overcome decreased susceptibility ). 
 
Azithromycin is recommended in some guidelines as additional treatment for uncomplicated 
gonorrhoea. It is not recommended for gonococcal PID for the following reasons:  
• azithromycin is used to ‘protect’ cephalosporin therapy to try slow down the development  of 
N. gonorrhoeae resistance  but the number of cases of gonococcal PID in the UK is very small 
(2-3% of all PID) . Therefore its use is unlikely to affect the public health control of antibiotic 
resistance.  
• use of the ‘non-azithromycin  containing ’ regimen s listed above  is clinically effective  
• adherence rates for existing two week  PID treatment regimens are poor49 and the addition of 
azithromycin has the potential to cause  early discontinuation of medication due to 
gastrointestinal side effects.  
 
Ceftriaxone provides microbiological cover for N. gonorrhoeae but also other aerobic and anaerobic 
bacteria associated with PID. The use of doxycycline plus metronidazole, in the absence of 
ceftriaxone, is not recommended  because the evidence base is limit ed, previous trials have reported 
significant rates of treatment failure50,51 and the addition of ceftriaxone improve s treatment outcome52.  
 
Alternative Regimens  
intramuscular ceftriaxone 1g immediately, followed by azithromycin 1 g/week for 2 weeks  
Grade 2B53,54 
Clinical trial evidence for th is regimen is limited but it may be used when the treatments above are not 
appropriate e.g. allergy, intolerance . Single doses of azithromycin have the potential to induce 
macrolide resistance in M. genitalium  and, if possible, use should be restricted to wo men who are 
known to be M. genitalium  negative.  PID guideline V4       page 12  
 
Inpatient Regimens  
i.v. ceftriaxone 2g daily plus i.v. doxycycline 100mg twice daily (oral doxycycline  may be used 
if tolerated)  followed by  oral doxycycline 100mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole 400mg 
twice daily  for a total of 14 days  
Grade 1A36,37  
 
 
i.v. clindamycin 900mg 3 times daily  plus i.v. gentamicin (2mg/kg loading dose )  
followed by 1.5mg/kg 3 times daily [a single daily dose of 7mg/kg may be substituted])  
followed by either  oral clindamycin 450mg 4 times daily  or oral doxycycline 100mg twice daily  
plus oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily  to complete 14 days  
Grade 1A36  
Gentamicin levels should  be monitored if this regimen is used.  
 
Intravenous therapy should be continued until 24 hours after clinical improvement and then switched 
to oral  (Grade 2D) . Intravenous doxycycline is not currentl y licensed in the UK but is available from 
IDIS world medicines ( tel. 01932 824100).  
 
Alternative Regimens  
Clinical trial evidence for the following regimens is more limited but they may be used when the 
treatments above are not appropriate e.g. allergy, intolerance:  
 
i.v. ofloxacin 400mg BD plus i.v. metronidazole 500mg TID for 14 days  
Grade 1B37-39  
 
i.v. ciprofloxacin 200mg BD plus i.v. (or oral) doxycycline 100mg BD plus i.v. metronidazole 
500mg TID for 14 days   
Grade 1B38,55 
 PID guideline V4       page 13 Allergy  
There is no clear evidence of the superiority of any one of the recommended  regimens over the 
others. Therefore patients known to be allergic to one of the suggested regimens should be treated 
with an alternative.  
 
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
• PID i n pregnancy  is uncommon but  associated with an increase in both maternal and fetal  
morbidity, therefore parenteral therapy is advised although none of the suggested evidence 
based regimens are of proven safety in this situation.  
• there are insufficient data from clinical trials to recommend a specific regimen and empirical 
therapy with a gents effective against gonorrhoea, C. trachomatis  and anaerobic infections 
should be considered taking into account local antibiotic sensitivity patterns (e.g. i.v. 
ceftriaxone , i.v. erythromycin  and i.v. metronidazole switching to oral therapy following clinical 
response and completing 2 weeks of treatment ) (Grade  2D). 
• use of the recommended antibiotic regimens (listed above for non-pregnant  women) in very early 
pregnancy  (prior to a pregnancy test becoming positive)  is justified by the benefits of treatment of 
PID at any stage of pregnancy being likely to outweigh any possible risks  (personal 
communication, UK National Teratology Information Service  – 15th October 2018 ). 
 
Surgical Management  
• laparoscopy may help early resolution of severe  disease by divi ding adhesions and drain ing 
pelvic abscesses56 but ultrasound guided aspiration of p elvic fluid collections is less invasive 
and may be equally effective57,58 
• laparotomy may be required to assess and treat clinically severe pelvic infection  
• it is possible to perform adhesiolysis in cases of perihepatitis but there is no evidence on 
whether this is superior to only using antibiotic therapy  PID guideline V4       page 14   
Follow Up  
Review at 72 hours is recommended11 for those with moderate or severe symptoms or signs (Grade  
2D). Failure to improve  suggests the need for further investigation, parenteral therapy and/or surgical  
intervention.   
 
Further review , either in clinic or by phone,  2-4 weeks after therapy is recommended  (Grade 1D) to 
ensure:  
• adequate clinical response to treatment  
• compliance with oral antibiotics  
• screening and treatment of sexual contacts  
• awareness of the significance of PID and its sequelae  
• repeat pregnancy test, if clinically indicated  
 
If initial testing for gonorrhoea was positive, r epeat testing should be routinely performed after 2 to 4 
weeks . If initial testing for C. trachomatis  was positive, r epeat testing after 3 to 5 weeks is appropriate 
for women who have  persisting symptoms  or where compliance with antibiotics and/or tracing of 
sexual contacts indicate the possibility of persisting or rec urrent infection.  
 
The following are recommended if the initial test for M. genitalium  is positive:  
• treatment with moxifloxacin. This agent  currently has good microbiological  activity against M. 
genitalium  (Grade 1D)  
• repeat testing for M. genitalium  following treatment to ensure microbiological clearance. 
Treatment failure following the use of any of the recommended regimens has been reported  
but is least likely following treatment with moxifloxacin . The optimal time for testing after 
starting treatment is not known but 4 weeks is recommended based on expert opinion59,60 
(Grade 1D).  
 PID guideline V4       page 15 Partner Notification  and Treatment of Sexual Partners  
• current male partners of women with PID should be contacted and offered health advice and 
screening for gonorrhoea and C. trachomatis  (Grade 1D). Other recent sexual partners may 
also be offered screening - tracing of contacts within a 6 month period since  onset of 
symptoms is recommended but this time period may be influenced by the sexual history 
(Grade 2D). 
• gonorrhoea or C. trachomatis  diagnosed in the male partner should be treated appropriately 
and concurrently with the index patient  according to the relevant BASHH guideline at 
www.bashh.org  (Grade  1D).  
• in women with confirmed M. genitalium infection, their male partner(s) should be offered 
testing for M. genitalium  and, if positive, treated appro priately and concurrently with the index 
case ( for appropriate treatment regimens see the BASHH Non-specific Urethritis  Guideline – 
www.bashh.org)  
• because many cases of PID are not associated with gonorrhoea , C. trachomatis  or M. 
genitalium , broad spectrum e mpirical therapy should also be offered to male partners e.g. 
doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 1 week  (Grade 2D). 
• partners should be advised to avoid oral or vaginal intercourse until they and the index patient 
have completed the ir treatment cou rse (Grade 1D). 
 
Auditable Outcome Measures  
Appropriate short term audit outcomes include:  
• proportion of women receiving treatment with a recommended regimen  – target 95%  
• proportion  of women with suspected PID tested for M. genitalium  - target 90%  
• proportion of women who are reviewed (face to face, by telephone or online) within 4 weeks of 
initiating treatment  for PID – target 60%  
 
Recommendations for future research  
• assess ment of  the utility of metronidazole as an adjunctive  therapy for patients with mild to 
moderate PID  PID guideline V4       page 16 • development of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests  
• assessment of efficacy of a single dose versus multiple doses of ceftriaxone within treatment 
regimens for  the management  of PID
