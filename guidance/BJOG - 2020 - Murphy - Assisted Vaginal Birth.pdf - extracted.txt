Executive summary
Preparation for assisted vaginal birth
Can assisted vaginal birth be avoided?
Encourage women to have continuous support during labour as this can reduce the need for
assisted vaginal birth.A
Inform women that epidural analgesia may increase the need for assisted vaginal birth althoughthis is less likely with newer analgesic techniques. [New 2020]A
Inform women that administering epidural analgesia in the latent phase of labour compared to
the active phase of labour does not increase the risk of assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]A
Encourage women not using epidural analgesia to adopt upright or lateral positions in the
second stage of labour as this reduces the need for assisted vaginal birth.A
Encourage women using epidural analgesia to adopt lying down lateral positions rather thanupright positions in the second stage of labour as this increases the rate of spontaneous vaginalbirth. [New 2020]A
Recommend delayed pushing for 1 –2 hours in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia as
this may reduce the need for rotational and midpelvic assisted vaginal birth.B
Do not routinely discontinue epidural analgesia during pushing as this increases the woman ’s
pain with no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]A
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend any particular regional analgesia technique in
terms of reducing the incidence of assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]A

There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend routine oxytocin augmentation for women with
epidural analgesia as a strategy to reduce the incidence of assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]A
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend routine prophylactic manual rotation of fetal
malposition in the second stage of labour to reduce the risk of assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]B
How should assisted vaginal birth be deﬁned?
Use a standard classi ﬁcation system for assisted vaginal birth to promote safe clinical practice,
effective communication between health professionals and audit of outcomes.D
When should assisted vaginal birth be recommended/contraindicated?
Operators should be aware that no indication is absolute and that clinical judgment is requiredin all situations.D
Suspected fetal bleeding disorders or a predisposition to fracture are relative contraindicationsto assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]P
Blood borne viral infections in the woman are not an absolute contraindication to assisted
vaginal birth. [New 2020]D
The use of a vacuum is not contraindicated following a fetal blood sampling procedure or
application of a fetal scalp electrode. [New 2020]B
Operators should be aware that there is a higher risk of subgaleal haemorrhage and scalp
trauma with vacuum extraction compared with forceps at preterm gestational ages. Vacuumbirth should be avoided below 32 weeks of gestation and should be used with caution between32
+0and 36+0weeks of gestation. [New 2020]C
What are the essential conditions for safe assisted vaginal birth?
Safe assisted vaginal birth requires a careful assessment of the clinical situation, clear
communication with the woman and healthcare personnel, and expertise in the chosenprocedure (Table 3).D
Does ultrasound have a role in assessment prior to assisted vaginal birth?
Ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to assisted vaginal birth is
recommended where uncertainty exists following clinical examination. [New 2020]A

There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend the routine use of abdominal or perineal
ultrasound for assessment of the station, ﬂexion and descent of the fetal head in the second
stage of labour. [New 2020]C
What type of consent is required prior to attempting assisted vaginal birth?
Women should be informed about assisted vaginal birth in the antenatal period, especially
during their ﬁrst pregnancy. If they indicate speci ﬁc restrictions or preferences then this should
be explored with an experienced obstetrician, ideally in advance of labour.P
For birth room procedures verbal consent should be obtained prior to assisted vaginal birth andthe discussion should be documented in the notes.P
When midpelvic or rotational birth is indicated, the risks and bene ﬁts of assisted vaginal birth
should be compared with the risks and bene ﬁts of second stage caesarean birth for the given
circumstances and skills of the operator. Written consent should be obtained for a trial ofassisted vaginal birth in an operating theatre. [New 2020]P
Performing assisted vaginal birth
Who should perform assisted vaginal birth?
Assisted vaginal birth should be performed by, or in the presence of, an operator who has the
knowledge, skills and experience necessary to assess the woman, complete the procedure andmanage any complications that arise.D
Advise obstetric trainees to achieve expertise in spontaneous vaginal birth prior to commencingtraining in assisted vaginal birth.P
Ensure obstetric trainees receive appropriate training in vacuum and forceps birth, includingtheoretical knowledge, simulation training and clinical training under direct supervision. [New 2020]P
Competency should be demonstrated before conducting unsupervised births. [New 2020]P
Complex assisted vaginal births should only be performed by experienced operators or under
the direct supervision of an experienced operator.D
Who should supervise assisted vaginal birth?
An experienced operator, competent at midpelvic births, should be present from the outset tosupervise all attempts at rotational or midpelvic assisted vaginal birth.D
Where should assisted vaginal birth take place?

Non-rotational low-pelvic and lift out assisted vaginal births have a low probability of failure
and most procedures can be conducted safely in a birth room. [New 2020]C
Assisted vaginal births that have a higher risk of failure should be considered a trial and be
attempted in a place where immediate recourse to caesarean birth can be undertaken.C
What instruments should be used for assisted vaginal birth?
The operator should choose the instrument most appropriate to the clinical circumstances andtheir level of skill.P
Operators should be aware that forceps and vacuum extraction are associated with differentbeneﬁts and risks; failure to complete the birth with a single instrument is more likely with
vacuum extraction, but maternal perineal trauma is more likely with forceps. [New 2020]A
Operators should be aware that soft cup vacuum extractors have a higher rate of failure but a
lower incidence of neonatal scalp trauma. [New 2020]A
Rotational births should be performed by experienced operators; the choice of instrument
depending on the clinical circumstances and expertise of the individual. The options includeKielland ’s rotational forceps, manual rotation followed by direct traction forceps or vacuum, and
rotational vacuum extraction.C
When should vacuum-assisted birth be discontinued and how should a discontinued vacuum procedure be managed?
Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth where there is no evidence of progressive descent withmoderate traction during each pull of a correctly applied instrument by an experiencedoperator. [New 2020]P
Complete vacuum-assisted birth in the majority of cases with a maximum of three pulls to
bring the fetal head on to the perineum. Three additional gentle pulls can be used to ease the
head out of the perineum. [New 2020]P
If there is minimal descent with the ﬁrst two pulls of a vacuum, the operator should consider
whether the application is suboptimal, the fetal position has been incorrectly diagnosed orthere is cephalopelvic disproportion. Less experienced operators should stop and seek a second
opinion. Experienced operators should re-evaluate the clinical ﬁndings and either change
approach or discontinue the procedure. [New 2020]P
Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth if there have been two ‘pop-offs ’of the instrument. Less
experienced operators should seek senior support after one ‘pop-off ’to ensure the woman has
the best chance of a successful assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]P

The rapid negative pressure application for vacu um-assisted birth is recommended as it reduces
the duration of the procedure with no difference in maternal and neonatal outcomes. [New 2020]P
The use of sequential instruments is associated with an increased risk of trauma to the infant.
However, the operator needs to balance the risks of a caesarean birth following failed vacuumextraction with the risks of forceps birth following failed vacuum extraction.B
Obstetricians should be aware of the increased neonata l morbidity following failed vacuum-assisted
birth and/or sequential use of instruments, and should inform the neonatologist when this occursto ensure appropriate care of the baby.P
Obstetricians should be aware of the increased risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI)following sequential use of instruments. [New 2020]C
When should attempted forceps birth be discontinued and how should a discontinued forceps procedure be
managed?
Discontinue attempted forceps birth where the forceps cannot be applied easily, the handles do not
approximate easily or if there is a lack of progressive descent with moderate traction. [New 2020]B
Discontinue rotational forceps birth if rotatio n is not easily achieved with gentle pressure. [New 2020]B
Discontinue attempted forceps birth if birth is not imminent following three pulls of a correctly
applied instrument by an experienced operator. [New 2020]B
If there is minimal descent with the ﬁrst one or two pulls of the forceps, the operator should
consider whether the application is suboptimal, the position has been incorrectly diagnosed orthere is cephalopelvic disproportion. Less experienced operators should stop and seek a secondopinion. Experienced operators should re-evaluate the clinical ﬁndings and either change
approach or discontinue the procedure. [New 2020]P
Obstetricians should be aware of the potential neonatal morbidity following a failed attempt at
forceps birth and should inform the neonatologist when this occurs to ensure appropriatemanagement of the baby. [New 2020]P
Obstetricians should be aware of the increased risk of fetal head impaction at caesarean birth
following a failed attempt at birth via forceps and should be prepared to disimpact the fetalhead using recognised manoeuvres. [New 2020]P

What is the role of episiotomy in preventing maternal pelvic ﬂoor morbidity at assisted vaginal birth?
Mediolateral episiotomy should be discussed with the woman as part of the preparation for
assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]P
In the absence of robust evidence to support either routine or restrictive use of episiotomy at
assisted vaginal birth, the decision should be tailored to the circumstances at the time and thepreferences of the woman. The evidence to support use of mediolateral episiotomy at assistedvaginal birth in terms of preventing OASI is stronger for nulliparous women and for birth viaforceps. [New 2020]B
When performing a mediolateral episiotomy the cut should be at a 60 degree angle initiated
when the head is distending the perineum. [New 2020]B
Aftercare following assisted vaginal birth
Should prophylactic antibiotics be given?
A single prophylactic dose of intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be
recommended following assisted vaginal birth as it signi ﬁcantly reduces con ﬁrmed or suspected
maternal infection compared to placebo. [New 2020]A
Good standards of hygiene and aseptic techniques are recommended.P
Should thromboprophylaxis be given?
Reassess women after assisted vaginal birth for venous thromboembolism risk and the need for
thromboprophylaxis.D
What analgesia should be given after birth?
In the absence of contraindications, women should be offered regular nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol routinely.A
What precautions should be taken for care of the bladder after birth?
Women should be educated about the risk of urinary retention so that they are aware of the
importance of bladder emptying in the postpartum period. [New 2020]P
The timing and volume of the ﬁrst void urine should be monitored and documented.
[New 2020]C
A post void residual should be measured if urinary retention is suspected.P

Recommend that women who have received regional analgesia for a trial of assisted vaginal
birth in theatre have an indwelling catheter in situ after the birth to prevent covert urinaryretention. This should be removed according to the local protocol. [New 2020]P
Offer women physiotherapy-directed strategies to reduce the risk of urinary incontinence
at 3 months.B
How can psychological morbidity be reduced for the woman?
Shared decision making, good communication, and positive continuous support during labourand birth have the potential to reduce psychological morbidity following birth. [New 2020]P
Review women before hospital discharge to discuss the indication for assisted vaginal birth,
management of any complications and advice for future births. Best practice is where thewoman is reviewed by the obstetrician who performed the procedure.P
Offer advice and support to women who have had a traumatic birth and wish to talk abouttheir experience. The effect on the birth partner should also be considered. [New 2020]P
Do not offer single session, high-intensity psychological interventions with an explicit focus on
‘reliving ’the trauma. [New 2020]P
Offer women with persistent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at 1 month
referral to skilled professionals as per the NICE guidance on PTSD. [New 2020]D
What information should women be given for future births?
Inform women that there is a high probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent
labours following assisted vaginal birth. [New 2020]B
Individualise care for women who have sustained a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear, or
who have ongoing pelvic ﬂoor morbidity.P
Governance issues
What type of documentation should be completed for assisted vaginal birth?
Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on the
assessment, decision making and conduct of the procedure, a plan for postnatal care andsufﬁcient information for counselling in relation to subsequent pregnancies. Use of a
standardised proforma is recommended. [New 2020]P

Paired cord blood samples should be processed and recorded following all attempts at assisted
vaginal birth. [New 2020]P
Adverse outcomes, including unsuccessful assisted vaginal birth, major obstetric haemorrhage,
OASI, shoulder dystocia and signi ﬁcant neonatal complications should trigger an incident report
as part of effective risk management processes. [New 2020]P
How should serious adverse events be dealt with?
Obstetricians should ensure that the ongoing care of the woman, baby and family is
paramount. [New 2020]P
Obstetricians have a duty of candour; a professional responsibility to be honest with patients
when things go wrong. [New 2020]P
Obstetricians should contribute to adverse event reporting, con ﬁdential enquiries, and take part
in regular reviews and audits. They should respond constructively to outcomes of reviews,taking necessary steps to address any problems and carry out further retraining where needed.[New 2020]P
Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework to support women, theirfamilies and staff when serious adverse events occur. [New 2020]P
1. Purpose and scope
The aim of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of forceps and vacuum extraction
for both rotational and non-rotational assisted vaginal births. In order to provide safe care for the full range of clinicalscenarios, obstetricians should develop competency in the use of both vacuum and forceps for non-rotational birth andat least one specialist technique for rotational birth. The scope of this guideline includes indications, procedures andgovernance issues relating to assisted vaginal birth.
2. Introduction and background
Assisted vaginal birth by vacuum or forceps is used to assist birth for maternal and fetal indications. In the UK,between 10% and 15% of all women give birth by assisted vaginal birth.
1Almost one in every three nulliparous
women gives birth by vacuum or forceps, with lower rates in midwifery-led care settings.2,3There has been a rise in
the rate of caesarean births in the second stage of labour; this may reﬂect concerns about assisted vaginal birthmorbidity or a loss of clinical skills.
4
The majority of births by vacuum and forceps, when perf ormed correctly by appropriately trained personnel,
result in a safe outcome for the woman and baby.5Women who achieve an assisted vaginal birth rather than
have a caesarean birth with their ﬁrst child are far m ore likely to have an uncomplicated vaginal birth in
subsequent pregnancies.6–8However, obstetricians, midwives and neon atologists should be aware that serious
rare complications, such as subgaleal haemorrhage, intra cranial haemorrhage, skull fracture and spinal cord

injury, can result in perinatal death and that these complications are more likely to occur with midpelvic,
rotational and failed attempt s at assisted vaginal birth.5,9The alternative choice of a caesarean birth late in the
second stage of labour can be very challenging and result in signiﬁcant maternal and perinatal morbidity. As aresult, complex decision making is required when ch oosing between assisted vaginal birth and second-stage
caesarean birth.
Two new developments have occurred since the public ation of the 2011 guideline: i) the Montgomery ruling
has emphasised the importance of informed consent; and ii) a number of high proﬁle manslaughter convictions
on the grounds of gross negligence have highlighted the risk of a criminal conviction, where serious
shortcomings are identiﬁed in medical care pro vided to a patient who dies. The Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has also received reports of a number of neonatal fatalities
associated with traumatic birth-related injuries. It is i n this context that the safety aspects of this guideline
have been reviewed and updated.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodol ogy for developing RCOG Green-top Guidelines (GTGs).
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Databas e of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE,MEDLINE and Trip were searched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all relevant articles
published until May 2019. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
terms, including all subheadings and synonyms, and t his was combined with a keyword search. Search terms
included ‘obstetrical forceps’, ‘manual rotation’, ‘assisted deliver *’, ‘assisted vaginal deliver *’, ‘instrumental
deliver *’ and ‘operative birth’. The search was limited to studies on humans and papers in the English
language. Relevant guidelines were also searched for using the same criteria in the National GuidelineClearinghouse and the National Institute for Health a nd Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search. The full
search strategy is available to view online as supporting information (Appendix S1 and S2).
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix 1.
4. Preparation for assisted vaginal birth
4.1. Can assisted vaginal birth be avoided?
Encourage women to have continuous support during labour as this can reduce the need for
assisted vaginal birth.A
Inform women that epidural analgesia may increase the need for assisted vaginal birth althoughthis is less likely with newer anaesthetic techniques.A

Inform women that administering epidural analgesia in the latent phase of labour compared to
the active phase of labour does not increase the risk of assisted vaginal birth.A
Encourage women not using epidural analgesia to adopt upright or lateral positions in thesecond stage of labour as this reduces the need for assisted vaginal birth.A
Encourage women using epidural analgesia to adopt lying down lateral positions rather than uprightpositions in the second stage of labour as this increases the rate of spontaneous vaginal birth.A
Recommend delayed pushing for 1 –2 hours in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia as
this may reduce the need for rotational and midpelvic assisted vaginal birth.B
Do not routinely discontinue epidural analgesia during pushing as this increases the woman ’s
pain with no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of assisted vaginal birth.A
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend any particular regional analgesia technique in
terms of reducing the incidence of assisted vaginal birth.A
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend routine oxytocin augmentation for women with
epidural analgesia as a strategy to reduce the incidence of assisted vaginal birth.A
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend routine prophylactic manual rotation of fetal
malposition in the second stage of labour to reduce the risk of assisted vaginal birth.B
As assisted vaginal birth can be associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity, strategies that reduce
the need for intervention should be used. Continuous support for women during childbirth has been
shown to increase the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth (26 trials; n=15 858; risk ratio [RR] 1.08,
95% CI 1.04 –1.12) and reduce the likelihood of assisted vaginal birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 –0.96),
particularly when the carer is not a member of staff.10Evidence
level 1 ++
Epidural analgesia compared with non-epidural methods is associated with an increased incidence of
assisted vaginal birth (23 trials; n=7935; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28 –1.57), but provides better pain relief than
non-epidural analgesia (3 trials; n=1166; mean difference in maternal perception of pain –3.36; 95% CI –
5.41 to –1.31).2A post hoc subgroup analysis did not replicate this increase in assisted vaginal births
suggesting that approaches to epidural analgesia in labour (use of lower concentrations of local analgesicor patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA)) do not have this outcome.”Evidence
level 1 ++
Administering epidural analgesic in the latent phase of labour compared to the active phase does not
increase the risk of assisted vaginal birth in nulliparous women (6 trials; n=15 399; RR 0.96, 95% CI
0.89–1.05).11Evidence

The use of any upright or lateral position in the second stage of labour, compared with supine or
lithotomy positions, is associated with a reduction in assisted births in women not using epidural analgesia(21 trials; n=6481; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to –0.86).
12Evidence
level 1 +
A randomised trial included 3236 nulliparous women with a low-dose epidural to determine whether
being upright in the second stage of labour increases the chance of spontaneous vaginal birth comparedwith lying down. Signiﬁcantly fewer spontaneous vaginal births occurred in women in the upright group at35.2% (548/1556) compared with 41.1% (632/1537) in the lying down group (adjusted RR 0.86, 95% CI0.78–0.94). This represents a 5.9% absolute increase in the chance of spontaneous vaginal birth in the lying
down group (number needed to treat 17; 95% CI 11 –40).
13,14Evidence
level 1 +
A meta-analysis demonstrated that nulliparous women with epidurals are likely to have fewer rotational
or midpelvic operative interventions when pushing is delayed for 1 to 2 hours or until they have a strongurge to push (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 –0.98),
15although a more recent meta-analysis concluded that, when
the analysis is restricted to high-quality studies, the effect was smaller and did not reach statisticalsigniﬁcance.
16Evidence
level 1 ++
There is insufﬁcient evidence to support the hypothesis that discontinuing epidural analgesia reduces the
incidence of assisted vaginal birth (23% versus 28%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 –1.15), but there is evidence that
it increases the woman’s pain (22% versus 6%; RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.99 –6.80).17Evidence
level 1 ++
There is no difference between the rates of assisted vaginal birth for combined spinal –epidural and
standard epidural techniques (19 trials; n=2658; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 –1.00),18or patient-controlled
epidural analgesia (PCEA) and standard epidural technique. A meta-analysis of nine studies, including 641women, comparing PCEA to continuous infusion showed that obstetric outcomes were comparable in allincluded studies.
19A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 126 women comparing PCEA with continuous
epidural infusion reported similar rates of normal birth.20Evidence
level 1 +
A systematic review evaluating the use of oxytocin at 6 cm dilatation onwards did not report a signiﬁcant
reduction in assisted vaginal birth (two studies; n=319; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 –1.08). The review reported
a higher rate of uterine rupture in multiparous women where oxytocin had been commenced.21The
NICE intrapartum care guideline22has concluded that oxytocin should not be routinely started in the
second stage of labour and should be used with caution in multiparous women. An experiencedobstetrician should make a thorough assessment before considering oxytocin in the second stage oflabour for a multiparous woman.Evidence
level 1 +
Manual rotation has been explored as a strategy to correct fetal malposition and is recommended in the
guideline of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.23A retrospective cohort study
reported a reduction in caesarean birth associated with the use of manual rotation (9% versus 41%;P<0.001).
24Of the 731 women in this study who underwent manual rotation, no woman experienced an
umbilical cord prolapse, and there was no difference in birth trauma or neonatal acidaemia betweenneonates who had experienced an attempt at manual rotation and those who had not. A prospectivecohort study of 172 attempts at manual rotation reported a 90% success rate with a reduction inEvidence

operative birth (23% versus 39%; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 –0.95).25Given these data, manual rotation of the
fetal occiput for malposition in the second stage of labour warrants further evaluation as a potentialstrategy to consider before moving to assisted vaginal birth or caesarean birth. A pilot RCT of 30 womenwhere fetal malposition was corrected by manual rotation early in the second stage of labour reported asimilar rate of assisted vaginal birth.
26A second RCT including 65 women showed a reduction in the
duration of the second stage of labour (65 minutes versus 82 minutes; P=0.04).27Neither study
reported any adverse effects related to manual rotation. Larger RCTs are needed to establish ifprophylactic manual rotation early in the second stage of labour can lead to a reduction in operativebirths.

4.2. How should assisted vaginal birth be deﬁned?
Use a standard classi ﬁcation system for assisted vaginal birth to promote safe clinical practice,
effective communication between health professionals and audit of outcomes.D
Systematic abdominal and vaginal examinations are required to conﬁrm the classiﬁcation for assisted vaginal birth.
Marked caput may give the impression that the vertex is lower than it is. In the majority of cases the fetal head willnot be palpable abdominally, the exception being a deﬂexed occipito posterior position where up to one-ﬁfth of thefetal head may be palpable abdominally when the fetal skull is at station 0 cm or below. A classiﬁcation system wasdeveloped for the previous version of this guideline and was included in the ACOG guidelines (see Table 1).

4.3. When should assisted vaginal birth be recommended/contraindicated?
Operators should be aware that no indication is absolute and that clinical judgment is required
in all situations.D
Suspected fetal bleeding disorders or a predisposition to fracture are relative contraindicationsto assisted vaginal birth.PTable 1. Classi ﬁcation for assisted vaginal birth28

Blood borne viral infections in the mother are not an absolute contraindication to assisted
vaginal birth.D
Vacuum extraction is not contraindicated following a fetal blood sampling procedure orapplication of a fetal scalp electrode.B
Operators should be aware that there is a higher risk of subgaleal haemorrhage and scalptrauma with vacuum extraction compared with forceps at preterm gestational ages. Vacuumbirth should be avoided below 32 weeks of gestation and should be used with caution between32
+0and 36+0weeks of gestation.C
Operative intervention may be indicated for conditions of the fetus, the mother or both (see Table 2). The decision
requires clinical judgment based on the maternal and fetal ﬁndings, preferences of the woman and experience of theobstetrician.
29A retrospective cohort study of 15 759 nulliparous women demonstrated that maternal morbidity
increased signiﬁcantly after 3 hours of the second stage and increased further after 4 hours. There was no evidenceof neonatal morbidity increasing in this retrospective study, where fetal surveillance and timely obstetric interventionwere used.
30The time constraints listed in Table 2 are therefore provided for guidance. The question of when to
intervene should involve consideration of the risks and beneﬁts of continued pushing versus those of an assistedvaginal birth versus those of a second stage caesarean birth.
No indication is absolute and each case should be considered individually. The threshold to intervene may be lower
where several factors coexist. Medical indications include cardiac disease, hypertensive crisis, cerebral vasculardisease or malformations, myasthenia gravis and spinal cord injury. Forceps and vacuum extraction arecontraindicated before full dilatation of the cervix. Forceps can be used for the after-coming head of the breech. Thevacuum extractor is contraindicated with a face presentation.
Fetal bleeding disorders (for example, alloimmune thrombocytopenia)
31or a predisposition to fracture
(for example, osteogenesis imperfecta) are relative con traindications to assisted vaginal birth. However,
there may be considerable risks if the fetal head has to be delivered abdominally from deep in the pelvis.Experienced obstetricians should be involved in the decision-making for exceptional indication and, ideally,Evidence

Blood borne viral infections of the mother are not a contraindication to assisted vaginal birth. A
population-based surveillance study of 251 assisted vaginal births in HIV-positive women reported thatone infant had conﬁrmed infection at 18 months of age. The maternal characteristics suggested thattransmission may not have been intrapartum.

with spontaneous vaginal birth.
39A separate follow-up study reported comparable long-term neurological
outcomes for 266 babies born by vacuum extraction.40Below 32+0weeks of gestation, the use of vacuum
extraction is not recommended because of the susceptibility of the preterm infant to cephalohaematoma,intracranial haemorrhage, subgaleal haemorrhage and neonatal jaundice.Evidence

A multicentre RCT compared ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to assisted
vaginal birth with standard care to determine whether the use of ultrasound can reduce the incidence
of incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position. The incidence of incorrect diagnosis was signiﬁcantly
lower in the ultrasound group than the standard care group (4/257 [1.6%] versus 52/257 [20.2%]; OR0.06, 95% CI 0.02 –0.19; P<0.001).
41While correct diagnosis of the fetal head position is a
prerequisite for safe assisted vaginal birth, the ultrasound assessment in itself does not lead to areduction in morbidity. A further trial evaluated ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position from8 cm cervical dilatation compared with standard vaginal examination and reported a higher incidenceof caesarean birth in the ultrasound group (7.8% versus 4.9%; RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.12 –2.28), but no
signiﬁcant difference in rates of assisted vaginal birth (25.8% versus 22.2%; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 –

4.6. What type of consent is required prior to attempting assisted vaginal birth?
Women should be informed about assisted vaginal birth in the antenatal period, especially
during their ﬁrst pregnancy. If they indicate speci ﬁc restrictions or preferences then this should
be explored with an experienced obstetrician, ideally in advance of labour.P
For birth room procedures verbal consent should be obtained prior to assisted vaginal birth and
the discussion should be documented in the notes.P
When midpelvic or rotational birth is indicated, the risks and bene ﬁts of assisted vaginal birth
should be compared with the risks and bene ﬁts of second stage caesarean birth for the given
circumstances and skills of the operator. Written consent should be obtained for a trial ofassisted vaginal birth in an operating theatre.P
The 2015 Montgomery determination clariﬁed UK law and set new standards for consent, stating that
doctors have a duty to ensure that patients understand the material risks of any medical intervention andthe risks of any reasonable alternatives.
48,49The role of the obstetrician is to have a dialogue to ensure
that the patient understands the risks and beneﬁts, and can make an informed choice. By the very natureof assisted vaginal birth, consent will need to be obtained at the end of labour in an emergency setting.The situation is not always conducive to assimilation of detailed information by the woman to make aninformed choice.
50Therefore, women should be informed about assisted vaginal birth as part of routine
antenatal education, particularly when having their ﬁrst baby where the chance of requiring a forceps orvacuum birth is highest. This information should include strategies known to be effective in reducing theneed for assisted vaginal birth and an explanation of the comparative morbidities for assisted vaginal birthand second stage caesarean birth.Evidence
level 4
The woman’s birth plan, including any preferences or objections to a particular instrument, should be
taken into account and discussed.22Care needs to be taken as women may be exhausted, in pain or
affected by drugs. The principles of obtaining valid consent during labour should be followed.51,52
Information provided to women in labour should be given between contractions. The ability to presentrisk-based information in a time-sensitive manner appropriate to the clinical circumstances is essential inorder to achieve informed consent. Obstetricians must document their assessment ﬁndings, reasons forproceeding to an assisted vaginal birth and that consent has been given.Evidence
level 4
Complex decision making is required when choosing between a trial of midpelvic rotational assisted vaginal
birth in theatre and second stage caesarean birth with a deeply engaged fetal head. A multicentre prospectivecohort study in the UK of 393 women transferred to theatre in the second stage of labour reported a higherincidence of maternal haemorrhage and neonatal unit admission following caesarean birth, but a higherincidence of pelvic ﬂoor morbidity and neonatal trauma with assisted vaginal birth. The incidence of pelvicﬂoor morbidity was three-fold higher at 6 weeks, but this attenuated at 1 and 3 years. Women who gavebirth by assisted vaginal birth were far more likely to have a vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy (80%versus 30%) and there were no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 5 years.

5. Performing assisted vaginal birth
5.1. Who should perform assisted vaginal birth?
Assisted vaginal birth should be performed by, or in the presence of, an operator who has the
knowledge, skills and experience necessary to assess the woman, complete the procedure andmanage any complications that arise.D
Advise obstetric trainees to achieve expertise in spontaneous vaginal birth prior to commencingtraining in assisted vaginal birth.P
Ensure obstetric trainees receive appropriate training in vacuum and forceps birth, includingtheoretical knowledge, simulation training and clinical training under direct supervision.P
Competency should be demonstrated before conducting unsupervised births.P
Complex assisted vaginal births should only be performed by experienced operators or underthe direct supervision of an experienced operator.D
Training is central to patient safety initiatives. Systems analysis reveals inadequate training as a key
contributor to adverse outcomes.62Evidence
level 2 +
The goal of assisted vaginal birth is to mimic spontaneous vaginal birth, thereby expediting birth with a minimum
of maternal or neonatal morbidity. An understanding of the anatomy of the birth canal, the fetal head and themechanism of normal labour is a prerequisite to becoming a skilled obstetrician. It is strongly recommended thatobstetricians achieve experience in spontaneous vaginal birth before commencing training in vacuum or forcepsbirth.

Obstetric trainees should familiarise themselves with the theoretical knowledge required for the technical
and non-technical skills of assisted vaginal birth. A wide range of resources are available, including
guidelines, clinical skills taxonomy lists based on expert obstetric practice,29,63–65manuals66and online
training resources (for example, StratOG). These should be supplemented with initial training in asimulation setting. As with any operative procedure, trainees will need to be taught and observed in theclinical setting and have their technique corrected and adjusted by a senior operator until they aredeemed ready for independent practice. It should be made clear to the labouring woman that a traineeoperator is working under direct supervision of an experienced operator.Evidence
level 4
Assessment of clinical competence is a key element of core training. Competence should be assessed
ideally using the OSATS [objective structured assessment of technical skills] form designed for assistedvaginal birth by the RCOG.
67No data exist on the minimum number of supervised procedures necessary
before competence is achieved and this is likely to vary at the individual level. Each unit should ideallyhave speciﬁed trainers responsible for training and assessment.
68Local and specialist courses in labour
ward management can contribute to the development and maintenance of operative birth expertise.Evidence
level 4
Once trained, it may be useful for practitioners to audit their performance. One study has demonstrated
the potential for the monitoring of obstetricians’ performance on vacuum extraction by the use ofstatistical process control charts.
69Another study has looked at the position of the chignon as a
monitoring tool of cup application.70Further work needs to be done to develop data collection tools with
consideration for case complexity and how the results can be fed back to individuals in a constructivemanner.Evidence
level 3
The complexity of the birth is related to the type of assisted vaginal birth as classiﬁed in Table 1.
Midpelvic and rotational births, independent of the instrument used, demand a high level of clinical andtechnical skill and are associated with higher rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity. The operator mustreceive adequate training and supervision prior to embarking on independent practice. Serious neonataltrauma has been associated with initial unsuccessful attempts at assisted vaginal birth by inexperiencedoperators.
71[Appendix 3]Evidence

5.2. Who should supervise assisted vaginal birth?
An experienced operator, competent at midpelvic births, should be present from the outset to
supervise all attempts at rotational or midpelvic assisted vaginal birth.D
Where there is any uncertainty about successful assisted vaginal birth, an experienced operator should
assess the patient to ensure that the correct decision has been made to attempt assisted vaginal birth andthat this is being conducted with the most appropriate instrument in the most appropriate setting.
29For a
trial of assisted vaginal birth in theatre, an experienced operator should attend in person or should beimmediately available if the trainee on duty has not been assessed and signed-off as competent.

5.3. Where should assisted vaginal birth take place?
Non-rotational low-pelvic and lift out assisted vaginal births have a low probability of failure
and most procedures can be conducted safely in a birth room.C
Assisted vaginal births that have a higher risk of failure should be considered a trial and beattempted in a place where immediate recourse to caesarean birth can be undertaken.C
A study in Scotland of 1021 singleton term operative births for fetal distress showed that a decision
to delivery interval (DDI) of 15 minutes was an achievable target for non-rotational low-pelvicvacuum and forceps births performed in a labour room and there were no assisted vaginal birthfailures.

Higher rates of failure are associated with:

midpelvic stations, particularly station 0 or where rotation is required, the biparietal diameter is above thelevel of the ischial spines and failure rates are higher. A neonatal head circumference above the 95

Operative births that are anticipated to have a higher rate of failure should be considered a trial and
conducted in a place where immediate recourse to caesarean birth can be undertaken, such as an
operating theatre. There is little evidence of increased maternal or neonatal morbidity following failed
assisted vaginal birth compared to immediate caesarean birth where immediate recourse to caesareanbirth is available.
81A study of 3189 women in the US reported that adverse neonatal outcomes following
failed assisted vaginal birth were associated with non-reassuring fetal heart rate recordings and whenthese cases were removed, there was no association between a failed attempt at assisted vaginal birth andadverse neonatal outcomes.

The decision to transfer a woman to an operating theatre needs to take account of the time associated
with transfer which may affect the neonatal outcome. Two retrospective studies compared assisted vaginalbirth in the labour room with births in an operating theatre.
6,83A study of 229 operative births for all
indications had a DDI of 20 minutes for births in the room and 59 minutes for births in theatre.83A
study of 1021 singleton term operative births for fetal distress showed that a DDI of 15 minutes is anachievable target in the labour room, whereas 30 minutes is the average DDI in theatre.
6There were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences in the neonatal outcomes in either study in relation to short and longerDDIs. Therefore, the risks of unsuccessful assisted vaginal birth in the labour room should be balancedwith the risks associated with the transfer time for birth in an operating theatre.Evidence

5.4. What instruments should be used for assisted vaginal birth?
The operator should choose the instrument most appropriate to the clinical circumstances and
their level of skill.P
Operators should be aware that forceps and vacuum extraction are associated with differentbeneﬁts and risks; failure to complete the birth with a single instrument is more likely with
vacuum extraction, but maternal perineal trauma is more likely with forceps.A
Operators should be aware that soft cup vacuum extractors have a higher rate of failure but a
lower incidence of neonatal scalp trauma.A
Rotational births should be performed by experienced operators; the choice of instrumentdepending on the clinical circumstances and expertise of the individual. The options includeKielland ’s rotational forceps, manual rotation followed by direct traction forceps or vacuum, and
rotational vacuum extraction.C
There have been no recent RCTs comparing vacuum and forceps, but a Cochrane systematic review

compared with rigid cups are associated with a higher rate of failure (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 –2.3), but a

Birth by vacuum and forceps birth can be associated with signiﬁcant maternal complications. Two maternal
deaths have been described in association with tearing of the cervix at vacuum birth and a furthermaternal death following uterine rupture in association with forceps birth.
92,93Vacuum and forceps birth
are associated with a higher incidence of episiotomy, pelvic ﬂoor tearing, levator ani avulsion and obstetricanal sphincter injury (OASI) than spontaneous vaginal birth. Symptoms associated with pelvic ﬂoor traumainclude pain, dyspareunia, and urinary and bowel incontinence.
94–100However, a longitudinal prospective
cohort study nested with a two-centre RCT of routine versus restrictive episiotomy for assisted vaginalbirth reported that pelvic ﬂoor morbidities associated with assisted vaginal birth are often as prevalent, ifnot more prevalent, in the third trimester of pregnancy than postpartum.
101This suggests that much of
the pelvic ﬂoor morbidity reported by women in the weeks and months after an assisted vaginal birth maynot be causally related to the procedure. A follow-up study of an RCT comparing vacuum and forcepsreported no signiﬁcant differences in bowel or urinary dysfunction at 5 years.

Birth by vacuum and forceps can be associated with signiﬁcant perinatal complications. Neonatal
intracranial and subgaleal haemorrhage are life-threatening complications of particular concern.9,103In a

However, risks increased signiﬁcantly among babiesexposed to sequential instrument use with both vacuum and forceps (1 in 256).

To date, there have been no randomised trials comparing alternative techniques for rotational assisted vaginal birth.
Rotational birth with the Kielland’s forceps carries additional risks, such as cervical spine injury, and requires speciﬁcexpertise and training. Alternatives to Kielland’s rotational forceps include manual rotation followed by directtraction forceps or vacuum extraction and rotational vacuum birth.
A meta-analysis of 23 studies of rotational assisted vaginal births reported that Kielland’s forceps are less
likely to fail (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 –0.76) and less likely to cause neonatal trauma (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 –
0.85) when compared with rotational vacuum birth.
105A prospective cohort study of 381 women
undergoing rotational assisted vaginal birth compared Kielland’s forceps with manual rotation or directforceps and rotational vacuum. Maternal and perinatal outcomes are comparable with few serious adverseoutcomes, but the use of sequential instruments is less with manual rotation or direct forceps than withrotational vacuum (0.6% versus 36.9%; OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.002 –0.09).

Enhanced skills in this area may reduce the need for second stage caesarean births and training should be
encouraged for trainees, particularly those embarking on the advanced labour ward Advanced Training Skills

procedure be managed?
Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth where there is no evidence of progressive descent with
moderate traction during each pull of a correctly applied instrument by an experiencedoperator.P
Complete vacuum-assisted birth in the majority of cases with a maximum of three pulls tobring the fetal head on to the perineum. Three additional gentle pulls can be used to ease thehead out of the perineum.P
If there is minimal descent with the ﬁrst two pulls of a vacuum, the operator should consider
whether the application is suboptimal, the fetal position has been incorrectly diagnosed orthere is cephalopelvic disproportion. Less experienced operators should stop and seek a secondopinion. Experienced operators should re-evaluate the clinical ﬁndings and either change
approach or discontinue the procedure.P
Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth if there have been two ‘pop-offs ’of the instrument. Less
experienced operators should seek senior support after one ‘pop-off ’to ensure the woman has
the best chance of a successful assisted vaginal birth.P
The rapid negative pressure application for vacuum-assisted birth is recommended as it reducesthe duration of the procedure with no difference in maternal and neonatal outcomes.P
The use of sequential instruments is associated with an increased risk of trauma to the infant.However, the operator needs to balance the risks of a caesarean birth following failed vacuumextraction with the risks of forceps birth following failed vacuum extraction.B
Obstetricians should be aware of the increased neonatal morbidity following failed vacuum-assisted birth and/or sequential use of instruments and should inform the neonatologist whenthis occurs to ensure appropriate management of the baby.P
Obstetricians should be aware of the increased risk of OASI following sequential use ofinstruments.C
The procedural aspects of assisted vaginal birth are difﬁcult to research and guidance relies primarily on
expert opinion and consensus from specialists in the ﬁeld. Vacca114has emphasised the importance of
clinical training and good technique for vacuum-assisted birth. Vacca recommends up to three pulls tobring the vertex onto the pelvic ﬂoor and up to three additional pulls to ease the head over the perineumwhere most resistance is encountered.

In the absence of robust evidence to support either routine or restrictive use of episiotomy at
assisted vaginal birth, the decision should be tailored to the circumstances at the time and thepreferences of the woman. The evidence to support use of mediolateral episiotomy at assistedvaginal birth in terms of preventing OASI is stronger for nulliparous women and for birth viaforceps.B
When performing a mediolateral episiotomy the cut should be at a 60 degree angle initiatedwhen the head is distending the perineum.B
A two-centre RCT including 200 nulliparous women failed to provide conclusive evidence that a policy of
routine episiotomy is better or worse than a restrictive policy at assisted vaginal birth. The incidence ofOASI was similar in both groups (8.1% in 99 women randomised to routine episiotomy and 10.9% in 101women randomised to restrictive use; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.28 –1.87).

131There is a similar lack of evidence for the role of antibiotics at normal birth or

The ANODE trial was a multicentre, randomised, blinded, controlled trial done at 27 hospital obstetric units in the
UK.133Women who had undergone birth by forceps or vacuum at 36 weeks or greater gestation, with no indication
for ongoing prescription of antibiotics in the postpartum period and no contraindications to prophylactic amoxicillinand clavulanic acid, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of prophylactic amoxicillin andclavulanic acid or placebo. The proportion of women who had overall primary outcome events was higher thananticipated (486 [15%] of 3225). A signiﬁcantly smaller number of women allocated to the amoxicillin and clavulanicacid group had a conﬁrmed or suspected infection (180 [11%] of 1619) than women who were allocated to theplacebo group (306 [19%] of 1606; RR 0 /C158, 95% CI 0 /C149–0/C169;P<0/C10001). The ANODE trial showed that women
who received a single prophylactic dose of intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid a median of 3 hours afterassisted vaginal birth were signiﬁcantly less likely to have a conﬁrmed or suspected maternal infection than womenwho received placebo. They were also signiﬁcantly less likely to experience a range of other secondary outcomes,including perineal wound infection, perineal pain, and perineal wound breakdown. They were less likely to report anyprimary care physician or home visits or any hospital outpatient visits in relation to concerns about their perineumcompared with the placebo group. The ANODE trial therefore provides evidence of beneﬁt of prophylacticantibiotic administration after assisted vaginal birth, with few observed adverse events in relation to the intervention.

NSAIDs are effective for pain relief for perineal, vaginal and pelvic discomfort. Oral NSAIDs, such as

A post void residual should be measured if urinary retention is suspected.P
Recommend that women who have received regional analgesia for a trial of assisted vaginal
birth in theatre have an indwelling catheter in situ after the birth to prevent covert urinaryretention. This should be removed according to the local protocol.P
Offer women physiotherapy-directed strategies to reduce the risk of urinary incontinence at3 months.B
Assisted vaginal birth, prolonged labour and epidural analgesia are associated with an increased risk of
postpartum urinary retention (PUR), which can be associated with long-term bladder dysfunction.136
There is considerable variation in practice in postpartum bladder management in the UK.137However, at
a minimum, the ﬁrst void should be measured and if retention is a possibility, a post void residual shouldbe measured to ensure that retention does not go unrecognised.

Women who have had regional analgesia for a trial of assisted vaginal birth should be offered
an indwelling catheter for 6 –12 hours after birth (in keeping with the local protocol) to prevent
asymptomatic bladder over ﬁlling, followed by ﬂuid balance charts to ensure good voiding
volumes.P
Further good quality studies are required to evaluate strategies for the prevention and management of PUR.
Urinary incontinence is common in late pregnancy and after birth. A Cochrane review of pelvic ﬂoor
muscle exercise in antenatal and postnatal women concluded that there is uncertainty about the beneﬁt ofpelvic ﬂoor muscle exercise to treat urinary incontinence in postnatal women.
141However, one trial that
involved women with assisted vaginal birth demonstrated that a physiotherapist delivering interventiondesigned to prevent urinary incontinence, reduced incontinence at 3 months from 38.4% to 31.0% in agroup of women that had had assisted vaginal birth and/or a baby over 4 kg.
142The effect was reduced at
12 months.Evidence

6.5. How can psychological morbidity be reduced for the woman?
Shared decision making, good communication, and positive continuous support during labour
and birth have the potential to reduce psychological morbidity following birth.P
Review women before hospital discharge to discuss the indication for assisted vaginal birth,management of any complications and advice for future births. Best practice is where thewoman is reviewed by the obstetrician who performed the procedure.P
Offer advice and support to women who have had a traumatic birth and wish to talk abouttheir experience. The effect on the birth partner should also be considered.P
Do not offer single session, high-intensity psychological interventions with an explicit focus on‘reliving ’the trauma.P
Offer women with persistent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at 1 month
referral to skilled professionals as per the NICE guidance on PTSD.D
Factors that inﬂuence the ongoing psychological wellbeing of a woman after assisted vaginal birth are
complex. A large prospective study from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study reported thatmode of birth was not signiﬁcantly associated with a change in emotional distress (as measured by theeight-item dichotomised version of the Symptoms Check List) from 30 weeks of gestation to 6 monthspostpartum or with the presence of emotional distress at 6 months. The biggest predictor of emotionaldistress postnatally was antenatal emotional distress.

However, in the UK national maternity survey in 2010, the risk of reduced postnatal health wellbeing was
higher in women who gave birth with the aid of forceps compared with an unassisted birth; with a higher rate
of women reporting two or more PTSD-type symptoms at 3 months (25/359 [7%] versus 93/3275 [3%]; OR
4.89, 95% CI 2.68 –8.9). The survey also concluded that 42% of women that had an assisted vaginal birth did
not talk to a healthcare professional about their birth and 43% of these women would have liked to.144Evidence
level 2 +
Follow-up of a cohort at 3 years following operative birth reported that 50% of women did not plan on
having a further child and almost one-half of these women reported fear of childbirth as the main reasonfor avoiding pregnancy.
8Evidence
level 2 +
The association between assisted vaginal birth and PTSD is complex and studies have had conﬂicting
results. A systematic review concluded that assisted vaginal birth is one of a number of risk factors forPTSD and proposes a model for consideration that includes predisposing risk factors, triggering factorsand coping factors.
145Evidence
level 2 +
A further cohort study suggested that the key associations with a traumatic birth are lack of control and
lack of choice for pain relief. This highlights the importance of shared decision making, consideration forpain relief, and the value of non-technical skills in conducting an operative birth and in reducing the impactof the birth on the psychological wellbeing of the woman and her family.
146Evidence
level 2 +
Several studies have looked at debrieﬁng approaches to reducing psychological morbidity following
childbirth. A Cochrane review concluded that there is little or no evidence to support either a positive oradverse effect of psychological debrieﬁng for the prevention of psychological trauma in women followingchildbirth.
147Nonetheless, women report the need for a review following birth to discuss the
management of any complications and the implications for future births.144Evidence
level 2 –
The optimal timing, setting and healthcare professional for post-birth review require further evaluation.
The obstetrician should refer to the NICE guideline on postnatal mental health and PTSD, and referwomen with continuing severe symptoms to relevant expertise, such as psychology, as recommended inthe guideline.

6.6. What information should women be given for future births?
Inform women that there is a high probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent
labours following assisted vaginal birth.B
Individualise care for women who have sustained a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear, orwho have ongoing pelvic ﬂoor morbidity.P

Women who have experienced an uncomplicated assisted vaginal birth should be encouraged to aim for a
spontaneous vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy as there is a high chance of success. A population-
based register study from Sweden found that 90% of women who had a ventouse-assisted birth with their
ﬁrst baby had a spontaneous or unassisted birth with their second baby.7Although the risk of a further
operative birth is higher than for women who had an unassisted birth in their ﬁrst pregnancy, the absoluterisk is low. The likelihood of achieving a spontaneous vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy isapproximately 80% for women who have required more complex assisted vaginal births in theatre.
8This
discussion should take place at the earliest opportunity as there is evidence to suggest that women decidesoon after birth.
148Evidence
level 2 +
The future plan of care should be reviewed carefully with women who have experienced a third- or
fourth-degree tear, particularly if they are symptomatic, as they may be at increased risk of furtheranorectal damage with a subsequent birth. Women should be counselled regarding the risk of recurrenceand implications for future childbirth as per the RCOG guideline.

7. Governance issues
7.1. What type of documentation should be completed for assisted vaginal birth?
Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on the
assessment, decision making and conduct of the procedure, a plan for postnatal care andsufﬁcient information for counselling in relation to subsequent pregnancies. Use of a
standardised proforma is recommended.P
Paired cord blood samples should be processed and recorded following all attempts at assistedvaginal birth.P
Adverse outcomes, including failed assisted vaginal birth, major obstetric haemorrhage, OASI,shoulder dystocia and signi ﬁcant neonatal complications should trigger an incident report as
part of effective risk management processes.P
Like any clinical documentation, the documentation of the decision making and the conduct of the operative birth
needs to include the key information to inform ongoing medical care of the woman and baby in the postnatal period,to enable debrieﬁng, inform local audits and to inform decision making in subsequent births. An accurate record ofthe procedure must be completed including critical time points in the decision making, conduct and completion ofthe procedure. This is aided by standardised documentation, an example of which can be found in Appendix 2.
7.2. How should serious adverse events be dealt with?
Obstetricians should ensure that the ongoing care of the woman, baby and family are
paramount.P

Obstetricians have a duty of candour; a professional responsibility to be honest with patients
when things go wrong.P
Obstetricians should contribute to adverse event reporting, con ﬁdential enquiries, and take part
in regular reviews and audits. They should respond constructively to outcomes of reviews,taking necessary steps to address any problems and carry out further retraining where needed.P
Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework to support women, theirfamilies and staff when serious adverse events occur.P
Like all health professionals, obstetricians have a duty of candour; a professional responsibility to be open and honest
with patients when things go wrong. This is described in the joint statement from eight regulators in the UK.149
Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive environment in which learning can take place from seriousadverse events. Highly complex human factors are involved in assisted vaginal birth (and attempted assisted vaginalbirth). An understanding of the interplay of these in adverse events is important. Not all serious adverse events arecaused by failures in care.

Appendix 1 Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guide
lines/clinical-governance-advice-1a/). These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course ofmanagement or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources andlimitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of localownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinicaluncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

Appendix 3 Decision making for assisted vaginal birth
Safety criteria for Opera/g415ve Vaginal Birth (OVB) met
Consider Trial in Theatre if
• Head 1/5thpalpable abdominally
• Head is in mid-pelvis • Rota/g415on required
• Features suspicious of CPD Con/g415nue in the Labour Room if
• Head is low-pelvic/outlet
• No rota/g415on or rotates easily 
• No features of CPD 
Select op/g415mal 
instrumentSelect op/g415mal place 
for birth
• Select instrument most competent at using  (operator or supervising operator)
• Select instrument least likely to fail, avoiding sequen/g415al use of instruments
• Avoid vacuum assisted birth at < 32 weeks gesta/g415on; cau/g415on at 32–36 weeks
Correct applica/g415on 
of instrumentIf unable to achieve correct applica/g415on:
• Reassess engagement, posi/g415on, sta/g415on and asyncli/g415sm• Seek second opinion if less experienced 
• Experienced operator  to reassess and consider reapplica/g415on, change of instrument or 
discon/g415nue procedure
• Discon/g415nue  procedure if not achieved co rrect applica/g415on with above measures
A/g425empt trac/g415onIf progressive descent not observed with appropriate trac/g415on:
• Check if the instrument is applied correctly
• Reassess for features of cephalo-pelvic dispropor/g415on
• Seek second opinion if less experienced 
• Experienced operator may revise approach (c hange instrument, alter direc/g415on of 
trac/g415on)
• Discon/g415nue procedure if descent not achieved with above measures
• Discon/g415nue vacuum assisted birth if two ‘pop oﬀs’ of the instrumentA/g425empt rota/g415on (if 
indicated)If unable to achieve rota/g415on easily:
• Senior obstetrician to check for correc t applica/g415on and correct rota/g415on technique
• Discon/g415nue procedure if rota/g415on not achieved with above measures 
Note: birth in direct OP posi/g415on may occur with vacuum or at low sta/g415on forceps
•
Reassess a/g332er 3 
pullsConsider discon/g415nuing the procedure:
• If in vacuum-assisted birth the head is no t on the pelvic ﬂoor (and birth an/g415cipated 
with maximum 3 gentle pulls to ease over perineum)
• If forceps birth and the head is not crowning with birth imminent
Failed a/g425empt at 
OVBConsider the consequences of failed a/g425empt at OVB
• Consider forceps followed by failed vacuum only with vertex at low sta/g415on
• Increased risk of trauma to the fetus an d OASI with sequen/g415al instrument use
• Increased morbidity for the mother with a caesarean birth in second stage
• Increased risk of fetal head impac/g415on at caesarean birth 
Inform neonatologist of 
increased risk of neonatal 
morbidity •Complete the OVB proforma

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
