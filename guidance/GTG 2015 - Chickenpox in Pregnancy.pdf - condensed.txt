Condensed version:

- Varicella vaccination should be considered for non-immune women prior to or post-pregnancy.
- Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles.
- If exposed, pregnant women should be tested for VZV immunity and offered VZIG if non-immune.
- Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their doctor immediately.
- Treatment with aciclovir is recommended for pregnant women with chickenpox.
- Hospital referral is necessary for severe cases.
- Risks to fetus and newborn should be considered.
- Varicella vaccine is safe for postpartum women.
- Contact with potentially susceptible individuals should be avoided until lesions crust over.
- Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox.

Pregnant women with shingles or chickenpox should notify their doctor early if a rash develops. Isolation is necessary for pregnant women with chickenpox when seeking medical assessment. VZIG may be needed for further exposure to VZV. Chickenpox is infectious before and during the illness, while shingles poses a risk in certain situations. Susceptibility to VZV should be determined, and VZIG offered if needed. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their GP and avoid contact until lesions crust over. Aciclovir may be prescribed for treatment. Hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. Fetal risks of varicella infection should be discussed with pregnant women. Prenatal diagnosis of FVS is possible with ultrasound. Amniocentesis should be considered cautiously.

Amniotic fluid PCR for VZV DNA has high sensitivity but low specificity for FVS. Ultrasound abnormalities may be present in cases with positive VZV PCR. Maternal varicella infection in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy poses a significant risk to the newborn. Delayed delivery after maternal rash onset allows for passive antibody transfer. Neonatologists should be informed of newborns born to women with chickenpox. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox. Neonatal varicella infection can result from maternal infection near delivery. Prophylaxis with VZIG is recommended for newborns born to mothers with recent chickenpox. Further research is needed on varicella screening and treatment in pregnancy. Auditable topics include VZIG administration and referral to specialists for pregnant women with chickenpox. Helpful links and support groups are available for more information.

An important advance, but more are needed. JAMA 2010;304:905–6.
Varicella-zoster contact – clarify significance of the contact
Presents with chickenpox – initial contact should be with the woman’s GP
Uncertain or no past history of chickenpox, or woman from a tropical or subtropical country
Check blood for VZV IgG
No action needed. Reassure and return to normal antenatal care
VZV IgG present VZV IgG not present
Past history of chickenpox
• Give VZIG if less than 10 days since contact or, for continuous exposure, less than 10 days since the appearance of the rash in the index case
• Advise the woman that she is potentially infectious from 8–28 days after contact
• Discuss postpartum varicella immunisation
• Women who develop severe infection and women at high risk of complicated chickenpox should be referred to hospital
• Intravenous aciclovir should be given
• Inform women that infection at < 28+0 weeks is associated with a small (~1%) risk of FVS
• Refer to a fetal medicine specialist at 16–20 weeks or 5 weeks after infection
• Amniocentesis to detect varicella DNA may be considered
• Avoid contact with potentially susceptible individuals (e.g. neonates and other pregnant women)
• Symptomatic treatment and hygiene should be advised
• If the woman presents < 24 hours of the appearance of the rash and she is ≥ 20+0 weeks of gestation, prescribe aciclovir
• If the woman presents < 24 hours of the appearance of the rash and she is < 20+0 weeks of gestation, consider aciclovir
• Avoid delivery of the baby until at least 7 days since the rash appeared
