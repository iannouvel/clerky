Preface: Designed to assist clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes, the guideline is the result of collaboration with healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients internationally.

The guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was developed with input from healthcare professionals and consumers worldwide. It provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of PCOS to improve patient outcomes. PCOS should be diagnosed using specific criteria, and once diagnosed, management should address various health risks associated with PCOS. The guideline emphasizes the importance of education, shared decision making, and prevention of complications. It also recommends specific treatments for PCOS, including lifestyle interventions, medications, and fertility treatments. More research is needed in the future to strengthen the evidence base. The guideline will be translated into multiple languages to reach a global audience and improve the health of individuals with PCOS.

The purpose of this international evidence-based guideline is to provide healthcare professionals, consumers, and policy makers with guidance on timely diagnosis, accurate assessment, and optimal treatment of PCOS. The guideline aims to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care by engaging multidisciplinary international experts, including consumer and primary care representatives, following rigorous evidence-based guideline processes, and providing a single source of international recommendations to guide clinical practice. The guideline is relevant to adolescents, those of reproductive age, and postmenopausal women with PCOS, encompassing all relevant complications and comorbidities. It is designed for a broad audience in various healthcare settings and includes principles of inclusiveness and stigma reduction. Governance processes and guideline development methods align with international best practices.

The 2018 International PCOS guideline was funded by the Australian NHMRC and aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome. The guideline is editorially independent and includes recommendations for the diagnosis of PCOS in adults and adolescents. It emphasizes the importance of education, timely diagnosis, and personalized care for women with PCOS. The guideline also outlines categories of recommendations, terms used, and the quality of evidence to assist in interpreting the recommendations. Recommendations are presented by category, terms used, GRADE, and quality of evidence, with a focus on evidence-based and consensus recommendations. Recommendations are based on a structured evaluation of evidence, expert input, and consumer perspectives. The guideline is a living document, with plans for annual updates to incorporate new evidence and ensure relevance.

1.2.4 EBR Laboratories should use LC-MS/MS assays over direct immunoassays for assessing total or free testosterone. 
1.2.5 PP For the detection of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is of greatest value in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. 
1.2.6 PP It is difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the combined oral contraceptive pill. 
1.2.7 PP Repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role. 
1.2.8 PP In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age. 
1.2.9 PP If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS should be considered. 
1.3.1 EBR The presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults. 
1.3.2 EBR Female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation are weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism. 
1.3.3 CR A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism. 
1.3.5 CR A modified Ferriman Gallwey score of 4–6 should be used to detect hirsutism. 
1.3.6 CR Healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity. 
1.3.7 PP Healthcare professionals should use standardised visual scales when assessing hirsutism. 
1.4.1 EBR Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) should be considered the most effective ultrasound marker to detect polycystic ovarian morphology in adults. 
1.4.2 EBR Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), follicle number per cross-section (FNPS), and ovarian volume (OV) should be considered accurate ultrasound markers for PCOM in adults. 
1.4.3 CR PCOM criteria should be based on follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement. 
1.4.4 CR Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) ≥ 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults. 
1.4.5 CR Ovarian volume (OV) ≥ 10 ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold for PCOM. 
1.5.1 EBR Serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) could be used for defining PCOM in adults. 
1.5.2 EBR Serum AMH should only be used in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm. 
1.5.5 PP Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM. 
1.6.1 EBR Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of PCOS in all ethnicities. 
1.6.2 EBR PCOS prevalence is similar across world regions and ethnicities. 
1.6.3 PP Healthcare professionals should be aware that the presentation of PCOS may vary across ethnic groups. 
1.7.1 CR A diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring/lifelong. 
1.7.2 CR Both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS. 
1.7.3 CR PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM. 
1.8.1 EBR Women with PCOS should be considered at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
1.8.2 EBR All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
1.8.3 CR All women with PCOS should have a lipid profile at diagnosis. 
1.8.4 CR All women with PCOS should have blood pressure measured annually. 
1.8.8 PP Consideration should be given to the differences in cardiovascular risk factors and disease across ethnicities and age. 
1.9.1 EBR Women with PCOS have an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. 
1.9.2 EBR Glycaemic status should be assessed at diagnosis in all adults and adolescents with PCOS. 
1.9.3 CR Glycaemic status should be reassessed every one to three years.

Recommendation: Healthcare professionals should recognize that PCOS is highly prevalent and has a significantly higher risk for diabetes, therefore funding bodies should fund PCOS accordingly. PCOS should be considered as an independent risk factor for diabetes in general population guidelines. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of diabetes in individuals with PCOS and their relatives. Women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of PCOS and should be screened. An OGTT is recommended for assessing glycaemic status in PCOS. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in women with PCOS and screen for symptoms. Women with PCOS have a higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer and should be informed about preventative strategies. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the psychological features of PCOS and provide tailored information and resources. Lifestyle interventions, including healthy eating and physical activity, should be recommended for all women with PCOS to improve metabolic health. Behavioral strategies should be included in lifestyle interventions to optimize weight management and emotional wellbeing.

Comprehensive healthy behavioral interventions may be considered to support healthy lifestyle changes in women with PCOS. When it comes to dietary interventions, there is no specific diet composition recommended, but following general healthy eating guidelines is beneficial. Tailoring dietary changes to individual preferences and goals is important, as well as addressing barriers to adherence. In terms of exercise, following population guidelines for physical activity is recommended, with a focus on aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening exercises. Weight gain in PCOS may be influenced by various factors, and weight stigma should be addressed in healthcare settings. Pharmacological treatments, such as oral contraceptives and metformin, may be considered for managing symptoms of PCOS. Anti-obesity medications and anti-androgen agents can also be options for weight management and hirsutism treatment in women with PCOS.

Given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed. Whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses when anti-androgens are used. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism, with certain considerations for different types of anti-androgens. Inositol could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values. Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism in women with PCOS. Bariatric/metabolic surgery could be considered to improve various health outcomes in women with PCOS. Healthcare professionals should ensure appropriate monitoring and support for pregnant women with PCOS due to higher risk pregnancies. Metformin in pregnancy may have some benefits in certain circumstances. Fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility management algorithm, and women should be counseled on preconception risk factors. Letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS. Metformin could be used alone to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility. Clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than clomiphene citrate alone to improve ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility. Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than metformin alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve live birth rates. Letrozole should be used rather than clomiphene citrate in certain circumstances.

Iphene citrate in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Gonadotrophins alone could be considered rather than clomiphene citrate in therapy-naïve women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Gonadotrophins alone could be used over gonadotrophins combined with clomiphene citrate in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile with clomiphene citrate resistance or failure, and no other infertility factors. Gonadotrophins could be considered rather than the combination of clomiphene citrate and metformin in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate-resistance and no other infertility factors. Either gonadotrophins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be used in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate-resistance and no other infertility factors, following counseling on higher live birth rate and higher multiple pregnancy rates with gonadotrophins. Gonadotrophins could be second-line pharmacological therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with no other infertility factors and who have failed first-line oral ovulation induction. When using gonadotrophins, best clinical practice is to avoid multiple pregnancies. Live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate per patient, and ovulation rate per cycle are higher with gonadotrophins than with clomiphene citrate. A low dose gonadotrophin protocol should be used to optimize the chance of monofollicular growth and minimize multiple pregnancies. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be second-line therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate resistance and no other infertility factors. In the absence of an absolute indication for in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), IVF could be offered in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility if first- or second-line ovulation induction therapies have failed. Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing all suitable embryos is recommended in an IVF/ICSI cycle with a GnRH antagonist protocol, where a fresh embryo transfer is not intended or where there is an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Either urinary or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) could be used in women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper)stimulation for IVF/ICSI, with insufficient evidence to recommend a particular type of FSH preparation. Exogenous recombinant luteinizing hormone treatment should not be routinely used in combination with follicle stimulating hormone therapy in women with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI. Adjunct metformin therapy could be used before and/or during FSH ovarian stimulation in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with GnRH agonist long protocol, to reduce the risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and miscarriage. Inositol in any form alone, or in combination with other therapies, should be considered experimental therapy in women with PCOS with infertility, with benefits and risks currently too uncertain to recommend the use of these agents as fertility therapies. Anti-obesity agents in PCOS for reproductive outcomes should be used only in research settings to establish the efficacy and safety.

-menarche, 80% of cycles fall within 21-45 days. By the third post-menarcheal year, 95% of cycles fall within this range, but cycles can remain irregular until the fifth year. There is controversy surrounding the use of 95th centiles to define abnormal cycle duration, especially in populations with PCOS. It is recommended to use the 85th to 90th percentile pending further analysis. Irregular cycles post-menarche may indicate ovulatory dysfunction, with specific criteria outlined for diagnosis. Assessment and diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents with irregular cycles should be carefully considered. Biochemical hyperandrogenism should be assessed using total and free testosterone, with validated assays recommended. Clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS should be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of androgen excess. 

Recommendations include using total and free testosterone for assessing biochemical hyperandrogenism, considering other androgens if needed, and using accurate assays for measurements. It is important to consider age, ethnicity, and clinical signs when assessing hyperandrogenism in PCOS. 

Seven studies reported hirsutism, acne, and female pattern hair loss in patients with PCOS. Hirsutism was associated with higher biochemical hyperandrogenism levels in those with PCOS. Clinical hyperandrogenism should be assessed with a comprehensive history and physical examination, with hirsutism alone predictive of PCOS. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the psychosocial impact and consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and female pattern hair loss important. A modified Ferriman Gallwey score should be used to detect hirsutism. The severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity, but the prevalence is similar across ethnicities. Healthcare professionals should use standardized visual scales when assessing hirsutism and female pattern hair loss. Self-assessment of unwanted excess hair growth, acne, and female pattern hair loss is valid and should be evaluated. Monitoring of clinical signs of hyperandrogenism is necessary for treatment adjustment. 

Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) criteria should be based on follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement. Follicle number per ovary, follicle number per cross-section, and ovarian volume are accurate ultrasound markers for PCOM in adults. A follicle number per ovary of at least 20 should be considered the threshold for PCOM. Ultrasound is not recommended for PCOS diagnosis in adolescents. The transvaginal approach is the most accurate for diagnosing PCOM. Training in follicle counting and standardized protocols for ultrasound reporting are recommended. 

Serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) has been proposed as an alternative marker for PCOM. AMH levels are higher in women with PCOS, with strong correlations to antral follicle count on ultrasound. The diagnostic value of serum AMH for PCOS diagnosis is unclear and controversial.

Pooled sensitivity and specificity for AMH in PCOS diagnosis were 0.79 and 0.87, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy did not change when excluding studies with a high risk of bias. Different AMH assays showed varying sensitivity and specificity. Recommendations include using serum AMH for defining PCOM in adults and not using it as a single test for PCOS diagnosis. Ethnic variation in PCOS prevalence was found to be similar across world regions and ethnicities, with a prevalence of 10-13% globally. In postmenopausal women with PCOS, both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism may persist. Further investigations are recommended to rule out other diagnoses in cases of severe hyperandrogenism. The risk of cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS remains uncertain, but metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors are increased. Healthcare professionals should consider cardiovascular health in PCOS management.

Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and potentially cardiovascular mortality. All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors, have a lipid profile at diagnosis, and have blood pressure measured annually. Consideration should be given to including PCOS as a cardiovascular risk factor in general population guidelines. Healthcare professionals and stakeholders should prioritize preventative strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS.

PCOS. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea in women with PCOS, and screening with simple questionnaires is recommended. Women with PCOS should also be informed about the higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and preventative strategies should be discussed. Additionally, fathers and brothers of women with PCOS may have an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The risk in female first-degree relatives remains inconclusive.

PCOS can impact quality of life and mental health, with high rates of depression and anxiety. Healthcare professionals should screen for these symptoms and offer appropriate support and treatment. Screening tools should be regionally validated, and screening intervals should be based on clinical judgement and risk factors. It is important to address the psychological impact of PCOS to improve wellbeing and quality of life for affected individuals.

A pragmatic approach is recommended to screen all women and adolescents at the time of PCOS diagnosis and to use clinical judgment considering individual risk factors and life events for additional screening. Targeted screening during antenatal and postnatal periods in PCOS is aligned with general population recommendations. Psychosexual dysfunction and body image distress should be considered in PCOS, with healthcare professionals assessing factors that can influence these issues. Eating disorders and disordered eating should also be considered in PCOS, regardless of weight. Information, education, and resources that are high-quality, culturally appropriate, and inclusive should be provided to all individuals with PCOS. Healthcare professionals should ensure that information and education on PCOS are embedded in all levels of training to address knowledge gaps. Women should be counseled on the risk of misinformation and guided to evidence-based resources.

Strong recommendations were made to enhance awareness, education, and information provision for healthcare professionals and those with PCOS. Models of care should prioritize equitable access to evidence-based primary care with pathways for escalation to specialist and multidisciplinary services. Public health actors should consider increasing societal awareness and education on PCOS to reduce stigma and marginalization. Healthcare professionals should employ shared decision-making and support patient agency in managing their health. Psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, has been shown to be effective in improving mental health conditions in women with PCOS.

3.1 Effectiveness of lifestyle interventions

3.1.1 EBR Lifestyle intervention should be recommended for all women with PCOS, for improving metabolic health including central adiposity and lipid profile.
3.1.2 CR Healthy lifestyle behaviors encompassing healthy eating and/or physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS to optimize general health, quality of life, body composition, and weight management.
3.1.3 PP Healthcare professionals should be aware that lifestyle management is a core focus in PCOS management.
3.1.4 PP Lifestyle management goals and priorities should be co-developed in partnership with women with PCOS, and value women’s individualized preferences.
3.1.5 PP There are benefits to a healthy lifestyle even in the absence of weight loss.
3.1.6 PP In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered.
3.1.7 PP Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS.
3.1.8 PP Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population.
3.1.9 PP In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain.
3.1.10 PP Insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, however, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

3.2.1 CR Lifestyle interventions could include strategies such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem solving, assertiveness training, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention to optimize weight management, healthy lifestyle, and emotional well-being in women with PCOS. 
3.2.2 PP Behavioral support could include goal-setting, problem-solving, self-monitoring, and reviewing, or SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely). 
3.2.3 PP Comprehensive healthy behavioral or cognitive behavioral interventions could be considered to increase support, engagement, retention, adherence, and maintenance of healthy lifestyle and improve health outcomes in women with PCOS. 

3.3 Dietary Interventions 
3.3.1 EBR Healthcare professionals and women should consider that there is no evidence to support any one type of diet composition over another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, or psychological outcomes. 
3.3.2 CR Any diet composition consistent with population guidelines for healthy eating will have health benefits, and within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable healthy eating tailored to individual preferences and goals. 
3.3.3 PP Tailoring of dietary changes to food preferences, allowing for a flexible, individual, and co-developed approach to achieving nutritional goals and avoiding unduly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced diets, are important, as per general population guidelines. 
3.3.4 PP Barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to dietary change should be discussed, including psychological factors, physical limitations, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors, as well as personal motivators for change. The value of broader family engagement should be considered. Referral to suitably trained allied healthcare professionals needs to be considered when women with PCOS need support with optimizing their diet. 

3.4 Exercise Interventions 
3.4.1 EBR Healthcare professionals and women could consider that there is a lack of evidence supporting any one type and intensity of exercise being better than another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive, or psychological outcomes. 
3.4.2 CR Any physical activity consistent with population guidelines will have health benefits, and within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable physical activity based on individual preferences and goals. 
3.4.3 CR Healthcare professionals should encourage and advise the following in concordance with general population physical activity guidelines: 
- All adults should undertake physical activity as doing some physical activity is better than none. 
- Adults should limit the amount of time spent being sedentary as replacing sedentary time with physical activity of any intensity provides health benefits. 
- For the prevention of weight gain and maintenance of health, adults should aim for a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activities or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on two non-consecutive days per week. 
- For promotion of greater health benefits including modest weight loss and prevention of weight regain, adults should aim for a minimum of 250 min/week of moderate-intensity activities or 150 min/week of vigorous intensities or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthening activities ideally on two non-consecutive days per week. 
- Adolescents should aim for at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per day including activities that strengthen muscle and bone at least three times per week. 
3.4.4 PP Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. It includes leisure time physical activity, transportation, occupational, household chores, playing games, sports, planned exercise, or activities in the context of daily, family, and community activities. 
3.4.5 PP Aerobic activity is best performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration, aiming to achieve at least 30 minutes daily on most days. 
3.4.6 PP Barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to physical activity should be discussed, including psychological factors, personal safety concerns, environmental factors, physical limitations, socioeconomic factors, sociocultural factors, and personal motivators for change. The value of broader family engagement should be considered. Referral to suitably trained allied healthcare professionals needs to be considered for optimizing physical activity in women with PCOS. 
3.4.7 PP Self-monitoring including with fitness tracking devices and technologies for step count and exercise intensity could be considered as an adjunct to support and promote active lifestyles and minimize sedentary behaviors.

PCOS puts women at increased risk of weight gain due to factors such as excess body weight and body fat distribution. Excess weight exacerbates insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in PCOS, leading to increased prevalence and clinical features. Women with PCOS commonly struggle with weight management, with a higher prevalence of excess weight compared to those without PCOS. Factors contributing to weight gain in PCOS include suboptimal diet, physical activity, and hormonal abnormalities. More research is needed to understand these mechanisms and guide realistic weight management goals. Weight stigma is a significant issue for women with PCOS, with negative attitudes and discrimination prevalent in various settings. Addressing weight management challenges and stigma is crucial for healthcare professionals and patients.

50% of participants reported weight stigma. Given the studies included here, weight stigma is pervasive and detrimental to mental health. It is associated with negative outcomes such as exercise avoidance and increased food consumption. Weight stigma is also linked to adverse mental health correlates like depression and anxiety. Recommendations include promoting awareness of weight stigma, educating healthcare professionals, and offering weight-inclusive care to all individuals regardless of weight. Weight stigma should be recognized and addressed in healthcare settings to improve overall outcomes for individuals with PCOS.

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) could be recommended in reproductive age adults with PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. The COCP could be considered in adolescents at risk or with a clear diagnosis of PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. Health professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (≥ 30 μg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30 μg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS. General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended. The 35 μg ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate preparations should be considered as second-line therapy over other COCPs, balancing benefits and adverse effects, including venous thromboembolic risks. Progestin-only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited. When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS, it is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies. Shared decision making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence. Natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses (such as 20-30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent) need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side-effects, cost and availability. The relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines. The relative and absolute contraindications and side-effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion. PCOS specific features such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors need to be considered.

In adults with PCOS, COCP treatment resulted in lower total testosterone levels with moderate certainty of evidence. Free testosterone levels did not differ significantly between treatments. Metformin treatment led to lower insulin and HOMA-IR levels overall and in adults with low to very low certainty of evidence. Cholesterol levels were lower after metformin treatment. CRP levels were also lower after metformin treatment. In adolescents, lower LDL levels were seen after metformin treatment. There were no differences in HDL, triglyceride levels, or glucose levels. Combined therapy of COCP and metformin in adults with PCOS resulted in lower FAI levels, higher SHBG levels, and lower DHEAS levels. The combination therapy also reduced insulin and HOMA-IR levels. Recommendations include using COCP over metformin for managing hirsutism in irregular menstrual cycles in PCOS, using metformin over COCP for metabolic indications in PCOS, and considering the combination of COCP and metformin for little additional clinical benefit over COCP or metformin alone in adults with PCOS with a BMI ≤30 kg/m2. Anti-obesity pharmacological agents could be considered for managing higher weight in adults with PCOS. The role of anti-androgen pharmacological agents remains controversial.

Anti-androgen versus metformin: One study showed improvements in fasting glucose with both treatments but no significant difference at 12 months. The finasteride group had higher SHBG concentrations at 12 months. 

Anti-androgen + COCP versus COCP +/- placebo: Meta-analysis showed lower cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides with COCP. No differences in weight, BMI, testosterone, SHBG, HDL, and adverse events were noted. 

Anti-androgen + metformin versus COCP: Higher SHBG levels with COCP treatment. Anti-androgen + metformin lowered triglycerides and LDL. 

Anti-androgen + COCP versus metformin: No significant differences in BMI or HDL. Lower FAI and androstenedione levels with anti-androgen + COCP. Fasting glucose levels were lower with metformin. 

Anti-androgen + lifestyle versus anti-androgen + metformin + lifestyle: No differences in BMI, hirsutism, total testosterone, or insulin resistance. Fasting glucose was lower with metformin, while the other combination was better for triglycerides. 

Anti-androgen + metformin + lifestyle versus metformin + lifestyle: No differences in weight, BMI, WHR, hirsutism, SHBG, DHEAS, lipids, testosterone, and markers of insulin resistance. 

Recommendations: Anti-androgens could be considered for hirsutism in women with PCOS. Anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed for female pattern hair loss. Healthcare professionals should educate women about the risks of using anti-androgens during pregnancy. Spironolactone is recommended at doses of 25-100 mg/day, while cyproterone acetate at doses ≥10 mg is not advised. Finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity, and flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity.

4.10 Pregnancy outcomes

Are women with PCOS at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes?

Clinical need for the question

PCOS-related comorbidities such as high BMI, metabolic disturbances, hyperandrogenism, and infertility would all presume a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a lack of quality evidence on pre-pregnancy management of women with PCOS.

Summary of systematic review evidence

One hundred and nine studies were identified, exploring outcomes such as miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, and more. Sensitivity analyses were performed in various subgroups.

Miscarriage: PCOS pregnancies had a higher risk of miscarriage compared to non-PCOS pregnancies.

Gestational diabetes: PCOS pregnancies had a higher risk of gestational diabetes compared to non-PCOS pregnancies.

Pregnancy-induced hypertension: PCOS pregnancies had a higher risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension compared to non-PCOS pregnancies.

Pre-eclampsia: PCOS pregnancies had a higher risk of pre-eclampsia compared to non-PCOS pregnancies.

In PCOS pregnancies, women have a higher risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, and caesarean section. They also have higher gestational weight gain and BMI, but lower birthweight. Eclampsia, small for gestational age, macrosomia, large for gestational age, instrumental delivery, and perinatal depression did not show significant differences. Metformin in pregnancy may reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain in some cases. Side effects of metformin are mild and not worsened in pregnancy.

High certainty for benefits of metformin in pregnancy in PCOS. Studies did not focus on women at high risk of preterm delivery. Subgroup analysis based on pre-pregnancy weight may help account for confounding effects of gestational weight gain. Further research needed on metformin's role in glycaemic control among women with PCOS and established GDM diagnosis. Recommendations unlikely to change clinical practice but provide reassurance for decision-making based on evidence. Conditional recommendation given for prenatal metformin exposure due to uncertainty of longer-term offspring health effects. 

Fertility treatment in PCOS should follow a management algorithm. Pregnancy can be achieved naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamin supplementation should align with preconception care. Ovulation induction agents should be monitored for adverse effects and reported in studies. 

Preconception care for women with PCOS should include optimizing weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet, and nutritional status. Routine screening for chronic conditions like diabetes and mental health issues is recommended. Healthcare professionals should discuss weight and lifestyle importance before pregnancy, considering cultural and social factors. 

Consider tubal patency testing in women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis on an individual basis. Risks, benefits, costs, and timing should be considered based on personal history and population prevalence. 

Aromatase inhibitors like letrozole are effective for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS. Letrozole's efficacy compared to other agents should be further studied.

Meta-analysis showed that letrozole was superior for ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate per patient compared to clomiphene citrate. Letrozole + metformin was also more effective than clomiphene citrate + metformin in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates. Letrozole should be the first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility in PCOS. The evidence supports the use of letrozole over other ovulation induction agents. Letrozole should not be given in cases of pre-existing pregnancy, but there is no evidence of increased teratogenicity compared to other agents.

In women with PCOS, gonadotrophins are effective for improving fertility outcomes. Gonadotrophins alone could be considered over clomiphene citrate in therapy-naive women with PCOS. Gonadotrophins could be used as second-line therapy for women with PCOS who have failed first-line oral ovulation induction. When using gonadotrophins, considerations should include cost, expertise required, ultrasound monitoring, and potential multiple pregnancies. Live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and ovulation rate are higher with gonadotrophins compared to clomiphene citrate. Gonadotrophin therapy is effective but requires adequate resources and monitoring. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be considered as second-line therapy for women with PCOS who have clomiphene citrate resistance and no other infertility factors. Studies show no significant differences in outcomes between unilateral and bilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Observational data supports long-term benefits of ovarian wedge resection.

PP When using laparoscopic ovarian surgery, consider the comparative cost, expertise required, and risks for women above a healthy weight.

In women with PCOS, IVF/ICSI can be effective for improving fertility outcomes when ovulation induction therapies have failed. Consider the risks, costs, and benefits of IVF in these cases.

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone protocols do not show a significant difference in improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI.

Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing embryos is recommended for women with PCOS at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

The choice of follicle-stimulating hormone, whether urinary or recombinant, does not show a significant difference in fertility outcomes for women with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI.

Exogenous luteinising hormone treatment during IVF/ICSI is being explored to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with PCOS.

Increased LH secretion or elevated LH/FSH ratio in PCOS may influence fertility, with potential negative effects on oocyte maturation, granulosa cell steroidogenesis, endometrial receptivity, and early pregnancy loss. Exogenous LH supplementation in IVF/ICSI protocols has shown no significant impact on fertility outcomes. Therefore, the routine use of exogenous LH therapy in combination with follicle stimulating hormone therapy for women with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI is not recommended. Metformin therapy could be considered before and/or during FSH ovarian stimulation in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with a GnRH agonist long protocol to reduce the risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and miscarriage. In vitro maturation (IVM) and ICSI could be considered as an alternative to stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles in women with PCOS to avoid the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although it may result in a lower cumulative live birth rate. The use of inositol alone or in combination with other therapies is considered experimental in women with PCOS with infertility, as the benefits and risks are uncertain. Anti-obesity pharmacological agents should only be used in research settings to establish their efficacy and safety for reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS.

This guideline was developed according to NHMRC standards and procedures and GRADE approach. It builds on previous guidelines and aims to improve health outcomes for women with PCOS. The guideline development involved international health professionals and consumers to address gaps and priorities in PCOS management. Consumer engagement was a key focus, with representation in all levels of governance. The guideline also considered gender inclusiveness, weight stigma, and conflicts of interest. Clinical questions were developed and prioritized by expert groups to address key areas in PCOS management.

Key questions for women with PCOS: impact on family and relationships, challenges with healthcare professionals, effectiveness of psychological therapy and medication, lifestyle interventions, management of non-fertility features, screening and management of infertility. Prioritization of outcomes using the GRADE method, adaptation of existing guidelines, systematic search for evidence, inclusion of studies, appraisal of methodological quality, and data extraction.

Information was collected on general details (title, authors, reference/source, country, year of publication, setting), participants (age, sex, inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawals/losses to follow-up, subgroups), results/outcomes, and validity results. Data synthesis was done qualitatively and quantitatively using statistical methods such as meta-analyses. High-quality trials were used for meta-analyses. Research integrity assessments are important to ensure trustworthy results. The RIGID framework was developed to identify and manage problematic studies. The GRADE evidence profile was prepared for each comparison within each clinical question. Recommendations were formulated using the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework. Public consultation was conducted for a period of thirty days.

The guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome was developed through a public consultation strategy and external review process. Research priorities include studying irregular cycles, biochemical hyperandrogenism, clinical hyperandrogenism, ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology, anti-mullerian hormone, ethnic variation, menopause life stage, cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose tolerance, obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, risks in relatives, psychosexual function, body image, lifestyle interventions, behavioural interventions, dietary interventions, exercise interventions, weight gain, and weight stigma. The guideline will be updated every five years based on new evidence.

Algorithm 1: Screening, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment, and life stage

Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism = diagnosis
Step 2: Test for biochemical hyperandrogenism if no clinical hyperandrogenism = diagnosis
Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later

Exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH
Irregular menstrual cycles:
- Normal in the first year post menarche = pubertal transition
- > 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days
- > 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year
- > 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle

Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche
Consider PCOS with irregular cycles and assess accordingly
Biochemical hyperandrogenism:
Use total testosterone and free testosterone for diagnosis
Highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays recommended

Clinical hyperandrogenism:
Comprehensive history and physical examination needed
Standardised visual scales preferred for assessment
Ultrasound and polycystic ovary morphology:
Ultrasound not necessary for diagnosis in adults with irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism
Serum AMH could be used for defining PCOM in adults as an alternative to pelvic ultrasound

Ethnic variation and prevalence:
PCOS prevalence similar across ethnicities globally

Menopause life stage:
Postmenopausal women with new-onset severe hyperandrogenism require further investigation

Cardiovascular disease risk:
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS
Assess for individual cardiovascular risk factors and global CVD risk

Impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes:
Increased risk regardless of age and BMI
Assess glycaemic status regularly based on risk factors

Obstructive sleep apnea:
Higher prevalence in women with PCOS
Screen with validated tools if symptoms present

Endometrial cancer:
Increased risk in premenopausal women with PCOS
Assess with ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy if risk factors present

Risk of PCOS and cardiometabolic risk in first-degree relatives:
Increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in relatives

Algorithm 2: Prevalence, screening, diagnostic assessment, and treatment of emotional wellbeing

Psychological domains:
Screening protocol/tools
Intervention for quality of life, anxiety, depressive symptoms, psychosexual dysfunction, body image, eating disorders, and information needs

Algorithm 3: Lifestyle

Weight stigma:
Recognize weight stigma in women with PCOS and its impacts
Factors affecting weight gain in PCOS

Obesity and weight assessment:
Consider related stigma and negative body image when addressing weight

Prevention of weight gain:
Encourage evidence-based healthy lifestyle from adolescence

Effectiveness of lifestyle interventions:
Recommend healthy eating and regular physical activity for all women with PCOS

Behavioural strategies:
Include goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem-solving in lifestyle interventions

Dietary intervention:
Follow healthy eating principles with no specific diet composition recommended

Exercise intervention:
Encourage 150-300 min/week moderate-intensity physical activity for adults 18-64 years

Adolescents with PCOS should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily, including muscle and bone-strengthening exercises. Physical activity should be done in bouts of at least 10 minutes, aiming for 30 minutes daily. Pharmacological treatments for non-fertility indications in PCOS, such as COCPs and metformin, are generally off-label but evidence-based. COCP is first-line for hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles, with consideration for additional therapy based on individual factors. Combination therapies with COCP and metformin or anti-androgens may be considered for certain symptoms. Lifestyle interventions, metformin, and anti-obesity medications are also options for managing PCOS symptoms. Laser treatments can be effective for reducing hirsutism, especially when combined with other therapies. Additional treatment options, such as clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins, may be considered for infertility in PCOS. Baseline investigations and healthy lifestyle recommendations are essential for managing PCOS and optimizing fertility outcomes. Letrozole, metformin, and gonadotrophins are alternative first-line choices for informed women. In vitro fertilization should be considered as a third-line option for infertility in PCOS, with specific protocols to minimize risks.
