The Management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome: Clinicians must remain alert to the possibility of OHSS in all women undergoing fertility treatment. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. Severe cases may require hospital admission. Women with OHSS should be monitored closely for worsening symptoms. Treatment includes fluid management, pain relief, and thromboprophylaxis. Surgery is only indicated for specific complications. Pregnancies complicated by OHSS may be at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery.

Examination and investigation of women with suspected OHSS should include assessing for dehydration, oedema, and ascites, as well as measuring girth and conducting various blood tests. The severity of OHSS should be classified based on specific features, with critical cases potentially leading to life-threatening complications. Clinicians should report severe or critical OHSS cases to the appropriate authorities and ensure close coordination between fertility clinics and acute units. Outpatient management may be suitable for mild to moderate cases, with careful monitoring and appropriate counseling. Hospital admission should be considered for women with worsening symptoms or critical OHSS, with multidisciplinary care provided as needed. Women with OHSS should be monitored regularly to track changes in severity and identify complications early.

Abdominal girth, weight gain, oliguria with positive fluid balance, and elevated hematocrit are signs of worsening OHSS. Recovery is indicated by diuresis, normalization of hematocrit, and reduction in abdominal girth and body weight. C-reactive protein levels may correlate with other OHSS markers. Analgesia and antiemetics can be used for symptom relief, avoiding certain medications. Fluid replacement orally is preferred, diuretics should be avoided. Paracentesis may be needed for ascites and effusions. LMWH prophylaxis is recommended for severe OHSS to manage the risk of thrombosis. Surgery is only indicated for complications such as adnexal torsion, ovarian rupture, or ectopic pregnancy. Pregnancies complicated by OHSS may have increased risks of pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. Further research is needed to clarify changes in the osmoregulatory system in severe OHSS and evaluate different management approaches. Auditable topics include providing information about OHSS symptoms, reporting severe cases, and prescribing LMWH for all severe or critical OHSS cases.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious condition that can occur in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. It can lead to complications such as ascites and renal dysfunction. Management strategies include outpatient surveillance, transvaginal paracentesis, and dopamine agonists. Severe cases may require aggressive treatment such as ascites drainage or peritoneovenous shunting. OHSS is associated with a poor obstetric outcome and should be carefully monitored during pregnancy. Further research is needed to improve management strategies for this condition.
