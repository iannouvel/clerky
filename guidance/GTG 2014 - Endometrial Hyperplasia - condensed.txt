Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia
Endometrial hyperplasia should be classified into two groups based on the presence of cytological atypia: hyperplasia without atypia and atypical hyperplasia. Diagnosis requires histological examination and surveillance should include endometrial sampling. Treatment for hyperplasia without atypia includes progestogen therapy, with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) recommended as first-line. Continuous progestogens should be used for at least 6 months, with follow-up endometrial biopsies. Hysterectomy is indicated if there is no regression or relapse. Atypical hyperplasia should undergo total hysterectomy, with consideration for bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Women wishing to preserve fertility can consider LNG-IUS or oral progestogens. Endometrial surveillance is essential, with routine endometrial biopsy recommended. Hormone replacement therapy should be carefully managed, especially in women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Women on tamoxifen should be monitored for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, with consideration for prophylactic progestogen therapy. Surgical management is appropriate for endometrial hyperplasia confined to an endometrial polyp.

The 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia. Diagnosis requires histological examination. Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy may be needed for further assessment. CT and MRI are not routinely recommended. Biomarkers have not shown accurate prediction. Management of hyperplasia without atypia includes addressing reversible risk factors and considering progestogen treatment. Observation with follow-up biopsies is an option, with progestogens indicated for non-regressing cases. Weight loss and hormone therapy adjustments may be beneficial. Anovulatory cycles in PCOS can lead to regression. Progestogen treatment may have higher regression rates and reduce cancer risk. No clear evidence supports medical management over observation alone.

Many women with endometrial hyperplasia may require treatment due to the risk of progression to cancer. First-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia should be the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens. Treatment should last for at least 6 months to induce histological regression, with follow-up biopsies every 6 months. Hysterectomy should only be considered if there is no regression after 12 months of treatment or if there is relapse. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred. Endometrial ablation is not recommended. In cases where hyperplasia persists or relapses, a multidisciplinary opinion should be sought to consider further treatment options. Total hysterectomy may be necessary in cases where progestogen treatment fails to induce regression.

Endometrial ablation is not recommended for atypical hyperplasia due to incomplete destruction of endometrial tissue and potential complications. Total hysterectomy is advised for women with atypical hyperplasia to reduce the risk of underlying malignancy. In cases where fertility preservation is desired, hormonal therapy with LNG-IUS or progestogens can be considered, with close monitoring for disease progression. Women who wish to conceive should achieve disease regression before attempting pregnancy, with assisted reproduction potentially offering higher success rates. Regular follow-up and surveillance are essential for all women with atypical hyperplasia.

A small trial showed LNG-IUS treatment for hyperplasia with PCOS improved regression rates and IVF outcomes. Hysterectomy is recommended for atypical hyperplasia. Systemic estrogen-only HRT should be avoided in women with a uterus. Progestogen intake is recommended for women with hyperplasia on HRT. Tamoxifen users should be monitored for endometrial hyperplasia. Aromatase inhibitors do not increase risk of endometrial pathology. LNG-IUS may prevent polyp formation in tamoxifen users. Removal of endometrial polyps is recommended. Future research is needed on biomarkers and treatment options for endometrial hyperplasia. Recommendations for weight loss and surveillance regimens are provided. Links to support groups are included.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. The guidelines are based on published evidence and aim to incorporate them into routine practice, taking into account individual patient needs, resources, and limitations unique to the institution. The guidelines are not prescriptive directions but rather recommendations to be evaluated with reference to the patient's specific situation. Areas of clinical uncertainty are highlighted for further research.

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2019.
