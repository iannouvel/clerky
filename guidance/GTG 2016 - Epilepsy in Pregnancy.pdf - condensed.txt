Epilepsy review services and engagement with women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy are crucial for providing evidence-based information on risks and benefits of treatment. Diagnosis of epilepsy in pregnancy should consider seizure history, type, and impact on the mother. Classifying seizure type and epilepsy syndrome helps in choosing appropriate treatment and assessing risks. Differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnancy includes eclampsia, cardiac, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Prepregnancy counseling for WWE should address risks of congenital malformations with and without antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Folic acid supplementation and minimizing AED exposure can help reduce risks of congenital abnormalities. Studies show varied results on the effectiveness of folic acid in reducing malformations, but it is advised for WWE to take high-dose folic acid before and during pregnancy.

AED polytherapy in pregnancy should be carefully considered with the epilepsy specialist to weigh the risks and benefits. It is important to avoid sodium valproate if possible, but if changing medications poses a high risk of seizure deterioration, continuing with the current treatment may be necessary. Pregnant women with epilepsy should be closely monitored, as two-thirds do not experience seizure worsening during pregnancy. It is essential to provide women with information on prenatal screening, AED risks, and effects on the fetus. Healthcare professionals should address concerns and provide support to ensure adherence to treatment. Collaboration between obstetricians, midwives, and epilepsy specialists is crucial for the management of pregnant women with epilepsy. Regular monitoring and individualized management plans are recommended to minimize risks and ensure optimal care for both the mother and the baby.

Giving vitamin K to WWE to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Enzyme-inducing AEDs can increase the risk of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. It is reasonable to offer parenteral vitamin K supplementation to babies born to mothers on enzyme-inducing AEDs. WWE with well-controlled seizures do not require early delivery, but elective caesarean section may be considered in cases of significant deterioration of seizures. Non-epileptic attack disorder should be managed with specialist psychiatric or psychological services. Doubling the antenatal corticosteroid dose for WWE on enzyme-inducing AEDs is not recommended. Intrapartum care should focus on minimising risk factors for seizures in labour. Analgesia options for WWE include TENS, Entonox, and regional analgesia. Induction of labour is not contraindicated in WWE taking AEDs. Delivery for WWE at risk of seizures should be in a consultant-led unit. Postpartum management should focus on minimizing triggers of seizure deterioration and continuing AEDs postnatally. Monitoring of neonates born to WWE taking AEDs is important for adverse effects. Breastfeeding is encouraged for WWE taking AEDs.

Breastfeeding is safe for children exposed to AEDs in utero. Safety strategies for postpartum care should be discussed with mothers, including continuous observation for those at risk of seizures. Effective contraception is important for stabilizing epilepsy and planning pregnancy. Enzyme-inducing AEDs can affect the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Lamotrigine levels may decrease with oral contraceptives containing estrogen. Women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should use barrier contraception in addition to hormonal methods. The preferred methods of contraception for women taking AEDs are outlined. It is important to inform women about the risks of contraceptive failure and adverse effects. Pregnant women with epilepsy should be informed about the impact of changing AED doses on driving privileges. Healthcare providers should be aware of disability legislation protecting individuals with epilepsy. Future research recommendations include studying the long-term effects of AED exposure on offspring and optimizing monitoring strategies for pregnant women with epilepsy.

This guideline provides information on the management of epilepsy during pregnancy, including the risks of antiepileptic drugs on fetal development, seizure control, and the importance of monitoring drug levels. It also discusses the impact of epilepsy on pregnancy outcomes and the need for pre-conception counseling.
