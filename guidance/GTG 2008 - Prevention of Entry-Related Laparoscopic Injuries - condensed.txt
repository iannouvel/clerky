RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 - Preventing Entry-Related Gynaecological Laparoscopic Injuries

Approximately 250,000 women undergo laparoscopic surgery in the UK each year, with serious complications occurring in about one in 1000 cases. Laparoscopic injuries often happen during the blind insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae through the abdominal wall. This guideline aims to reduce these complications by highlighting strategies to improve entry techniques.

Developments in laparoscopic surgery over the past 50 years have made it possible to perform many gynaecological operations laparoscopically. Bowel or vascular injuries are common during laparoscopic procedures, with varying complication rates reported in different studies. The risk of major complications, including intestinal, urological, and vascular injuries, is highest during the entry phase of the procedure.

Women undergoing laparoscopic surgery should be informed of the risks and potential complications, including injury to the bowel, urinary tract, major blood vessels, and later complications such as hernia formation. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques and be familiar with the equipment and instruments used.

The most effective way to reduce complications during laparoscopic entry is to optimize the insertion of the primary trocar and cannula. The closed (Veress needle) and open (Hasson) entry techniques are commonly used, with varying risks of bowel and vessel injuries associated with each method. Surgeons should be trained in both techniques and be aware of the potential risks and benefits of each.

Alternative entry techniques, such as direct trocar insertion and alternative entry devices, are available and may be considered in certain cases. It is important to follow safe surgical techniques and training protocols to minimize the risk of complications during laparoscopic surgery.

Alternative sites for primary trocar or Veress needle insertion include Palmer's point, especially in cases of previous surgery in the area or splenomegaly. Adhesion formation at the umbilicus may make it an inappropriate site for insertion following previous abdominal surgery. The left upper quadrant is another option, with the preferred entry point being 3 cm below the left costal margin in the mid-clavicular line. Secondary ports should be inserted under direct vision perpendicular to the skin, with care taken to avoid the inferior epigastric vessels. In obese women, the open (Hasson) technique or entry at Palmer's point is recommended. For very thin women, the same techniques are advised. Care should be taken in all cases to avoid vascular injury. Documentation of appropriate counseling and reporting of adverse events are essential auditable standards.
