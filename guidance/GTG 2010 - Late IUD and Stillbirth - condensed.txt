Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth
Purpose and scope:
To identify evidence-based options for women who have experienced a late intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) of a singleton fetus after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy. The guidance includes information on general care before, during, and after birth, as well as care in future pregnancies.
Background:
Stillbirth is common, with 1 in 200 babies born dead. The stillbirth rate has remained constant since 2000, with rising obesity rates and maternal age as prevalent risk factors. Stillbirth can have profound emotional, psychiatric, and social effects on parents.
Diagnosis:
Real-time ultrasonography is essential for diagnosing late IUFD. Auscultation and cardiotocography are not accurate methods. Discussions about the diagnosis and care should support maternal/parental choice and offer written information. Investigation of the cause of late IUFD should include clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and identification of contributing factors.
Special recommendations:
Women who are RhD-negative should undergo a Kleihauer test to detect feto-maternal hemorrhage. Anti-RhD gammaglobulin should be administered promptly. Tests should aim to identify scientifically proven causes of late IUFD, including congenital malformations, infections, and maternal diseases.
Tests recommended:
Maternal standard hematology and biochemistry, coagulation times, plasma fibrinogen, Kleihauer test, and maternal bacteriology tests are recommended to identify the cause of late IUFD. Abnormal results may not always be linked to the IUFD.

Tests recommended for women with a late IUFD:
- Maternal serology for viral infections, syphilis, parvovirus B19, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex, Toxoplasma gondii
- Maternal random blood glucose for occult diabetes mellitus
- Maternal HbA1c for gestational diabetes mellitus
- Maternal thyroid function for occult thyroid disease
- Maternal thrombophilia if evidence of fetal growth restriction or placental disease
- Anti-red cell antibody serology if fetal hydrops evident
- Maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies if evidence of specific conditions present
- Maternal alloimmune antiplatelet antibodies if fetal intracranial hemorrhage found
- Parental bloods for karyotype if fetal abnormalities suspected
- Maternal urine for cocaine metabolites if history suggestive
- Fetal and placental microbiology for fetal infections
- Fetal and placental tissues for karyotype and possible single gene disorders
- Postmortem examination for external, autopsy, and microscopic analysis
- Labour and birth recommendations should consider mother's preferences and medical condition
- Induction of labour for unscarred uterus using mifepristone and prostaglandin preparation

randomised controlled trials compared oral and vaginal misoprostol. In the first study, vaginal use resulted in a shorter induction to birth interval and reduced need for oxytocin augmentation. The second study showed no difference in induction to birth interval for gestations over 28 weeks. Systemic adverse effects were more common with oral misoprostol. Mifepristone can be used alone to increase the chance of labor within 72 hours. Mechanical methods for induction of labor in women with an IUFD should be used only in a clinical trial. Misoprostol can be safely used for induction of labor in women with a single previous LSCS and an IUFD with lower doses. No studies were found on the safety of induction of labor in women with two or more caesarean births and IUFD. Women should be advised to labor in an environment with appropriate facilities for emergency care. Women with sepsis should be treated with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Diamorphine should be used in preference to pethidine for pain relief in labor. Women undergoing VBAC should be closely monitored for scar rupture features. Women should receive care in an environment that provides adequate safety before returning home. Women should be routinely assessed for thromboprophylaxis, but IUFD is not a risk factor. Women should be advised about options for suppression of lactation. Carers must be alert to psychological problems that can follow late IUFD and offer counseling to women and their partners. Bereavement officers should be appointed to coordinate services for parents experiencing stillbirth.

Guilt is common but not always expressed. Carers should help parents identify false assumptions and support family members affected by loss. Maternity units should offer debriefing services for traumatic events. Support groups like Sands can help partners cope. Carers should respect parents' wishes for mementos and naming their baby. Legal requirements for stillbirth certification should be followed. Maternity units should provide spiritual guidance, burial, cremation options. Fertility information should be offered, and follow-up appointments should include discussing future pregnancies and prepregnancy advice. Women with unexplained stillbirth should receive antenatal care and screening in subsequent pregnancies.

- Increased risk of ischaemic placental disease, fetal distress, chorioamnionitis, extreme preterm birth, and early neonatal mortality in pregnancies after stillbirth
- Rate of gestational diabetes four times higher in women with a history of unexplained stillbirth
- Unexplained IUFDs may be reclassified as fetal growth restriction with different classification systems
- Maternal request for scheduled birth should consider previous IUFD gestational age and intrapartum history
- History of stillbirth increases risk of subsequent early IUFDs
- Higher rates of induction of labor, instrumental delivery, and emergency caesarean deliveries in pregnancies following unexplained stillbirth
- Carers should be vigilant for postpartum depression and adverse effects on maternal bonding
- Maternity units should adhere to specific standards for IUFD and stillbirth
- Importance of standardized documentation and checklists for care options and postmortem consent
- Offer information leaflets on various topics to women and partners
- System in place for clinical and psychological support for staff involved with IUFD
- Auditable standards for stillbirth care and training recommendations
- Future research recommendations include optimal system for classification of stillbirth and safety of induction of labor with previous caesarean section

Guidelines are intended as an educational aid to good clinical practice and should be adapted to individual patient needs. Local ownership is encouraged to incorporate guidelines into routine practice. Clinicians should use clinical judgment when making decisions, considering patient data and available treatment options.
