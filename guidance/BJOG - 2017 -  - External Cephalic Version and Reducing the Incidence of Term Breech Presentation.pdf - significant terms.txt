Diagnosis:
- Term Breech Presentation
- Noncephalic birth

Investigation:
- External Cephalic Version (ECV)
- ECV success prediction models
- Use of tocolysis with betamimetics
- Use of regional analgesia or neuraxial blockade
- Testing for fetomaternal haemorrhage

Management:
- ECV should be offered at term from 37+0 weeks of gestation
- In nulliparous women, ECV may be offered from 36+0 weeks of gestation
- ECV should only be performed by a trained practitioner or by a trainee working under direct supervision
- ECV should be performed where facilities for monitoring and surgical delivery are available
- Following ECV, Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) is recommended
- Women undergoing ECV who are D negative should be offered anti-D
- Consideration of the use of moxibustion for breech presentation at 33 â€“35 weeks of gestation, under the guidance of a trained practitioner
- No evidence that postural management alone promotes spontaneous version to cephalic presentation.
