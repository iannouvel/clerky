Maternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium
Identifying women at risk of impending collapse is crucial. A systematic approach should be taken to identify the cause of maternal collapse. Physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy affect resuscitation and must be considered. Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow standard guidelines with modifications for maternal physiology. Manual displacement of the uterus and left lateral tilt are effective in relieving aortocaval compression. In cases of major trauma, protect the spine before applying a tilt. Intubation and supplemental oxygen should be administered promptly. Volume replacement should be aggressive, with caution in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Perimortem caesarean section should be considered if CPR is unsuccessful. Ongoing management involves a multidisciplinary team and prompt delivery in certain cases. Various treatments and interventions are outlined for specific causes of collapse. Maternal and neonatal outcomes depend on prompt and effective resuscitation. Training, documentation, and incident reporting are essential for clinical governance. Lessons can be learned from severe morbidity cases and near misses. Maternal collapse is rare but potentially devastating, emphasizing the importance of skilled resuscitation and timely management.

Areas of substandard care continue to be identified, including poor resuscitation skills. Death and disability may result despite excellent care. Vasovagal attacks and epileptic seizures are the most common causes of maternal collapse and are not covered by this guideline. An obstetric modified early warning score chart should be used for all women to allow early recognition of critical illness. Maternal collapse can result from various causes, such as haemorrhage, thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, cardiac disease, sepsis, drug toxicity, eclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage, and anaphylaxis. A systematic approach should be taken to identify the cause of collapse, as early intervention can improve survival rates. It is important for healthcare providers to be familiar with managing maternal collapse in different settings.

4.2.10. Other causes
Hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances can cause maternal collapse. Other causes include airway obstruction, air embolism, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and hypothermia. Local anaesthetic toxicity or failed tracheal intubation are main causes of collapse from an anaesthetic perspective.

4.3. What are the physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy that affect resuscitation?
Pregnant women undergo physiological changes that can accelerate hypoxia and acidosis, making ventilation more difficult. Aortocaval compression reduces cardiac output from 20 weeks of gestation onwards, affecting chest compressions during resuscitation.

4.4. What is the optimal initial management of maternal collapse?
Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the standard ABCDE approach, with modifications for maternal physiology, particularly relief of aortocaval compression. Manual displacement of the uterus to the left is effective in relieving aortocaval compression in pregnant women above 20 weeks' gestation. Intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube should be performed immediately by an experienced anaesthetist. Supplemental high-flow oxygen should be administered to counteract rapid deoxygenation. Chest compressions should be commenced immediately if the airway is clear and there is no breathing. Wide-bore cannulae should be inserted for volume replacement, and abdominal ultrasound can assist in the diagnosis of concealed haemorrhage. Defibrillation energy levels should be the same as in a nonpregnant woman.

Immediate and competent chest compressions have a direct impact on maternal outcome. In total, 30 chest compressions should be performed for every two ventilation breaths initially. If there are two rescuers, one should be responsible for chest compressions and ventilation breaths, whilst the other should ensure aortocaval decompression with manual uterine displacement. Once intubation is performed, the ratio of chest compressions to ventilation breaths should be desynchronised. Ventilation should be at a rate of 10 breaths per minute with continuous chest compressions at 100 –120 per minute. Delivery of the fetus and placenta should be considered early if CPR is not effective. In women with a very high BMI, chest compressions can be performed over the head of the woman if there is sub-optimal rescuer positioning. Ideally, early vascular access should be obtained with wide-bore intravenous cannulae. Haemorrhage is the most common cause of maternal collapse, and caution must be exercised in cases of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. If defibrillation is required, the same settings should be used as in the nonpregnant adult. PMCS should be performed within 5 minutes of maternal collapse to assist maternal resuscitation. Ongoing management should involve senior staff with appropriate experience. In cases of haemorrhage, delivery of the fetus and placenta should be prompt. In cases of venous thromboembolism, treatment should follow specific guidelines. Amniotic fluid embolism requires supportive management. Cardiac disease should be managed by an expert cardiology team after successful resuscitation. Septic shock should be managed according to specific guidelines.

4 mmol/l:
Begin rapid administration of an initial minimum of 30 ml/kg of crystalloid to be completed within 3 hours of diagnosis. Once adequate volume replacement has been achieved, a vasopressor and/or inotrope may be used to maintain mean arterial pressure more than 65 mmHg. In the event of hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate more than 4 mmol/l, consider dynamic variables of fluid status and steroids. Maintain oxygen saturation at more than 94% with facial oxygen. Consider transfusion if hemoglobin less than 70 g/l. Ongoing management involves continued supportive therapy, removing the septic focus, administration of blood products if required, and thromboprophylaxis.

Drug overdose and toxicity:
For magnesium sulfate toxicity, administer 10 ml 10% calcium gluconate or calcium chloride by slow intravenous injection. For local anesthetic toxicity, stop injecting immediately and consider lipid rescue. Lipid emulsion can be used for cardiac arrest treatment.

Eclampsia:
Manage eclampsia in accordance with NICE Clinical Guideline 107 Hypertension in Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management.

Intracranial hemorrhage:
Involve neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons in the care of pregnant women with intracranial hemorrhage. Expert neuroradiology is required for accurate diagnosis, and management is similar to nonpregnant women.

Anaphylaxis:
Remove potential causative agents, follow the ABCDE approach, and administer 1:1000 adrenaline intramuscularly. Adjuvant therapy consists of chlorphenamine and hydrocortisone.

Clinical governance:
Accurate documentation and incident reporting are essential in all cases of maternal collapse. All cases of maternal collapse should generate a clinical incident form and be reviewed through the clinical governance process. Training in generic life support and the management of maternal collapse is recommended for all maternity staff. Small group multidisciplinary interactive practical training is recommended to improve the management of maternal collapse.

Debriefing is recommended for the woman, the family, and the staff involved in the event of maternal collapse. This can help prevent post-traumatic stress disorder, postnatal depression, and tocophobia. Debriefing should be offered by a competent professional to support ongoing mental health.
