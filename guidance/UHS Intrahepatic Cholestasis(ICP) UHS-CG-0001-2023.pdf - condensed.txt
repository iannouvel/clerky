This is a UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline developed by the Leads for Maternity Risk Management, Labour Ward Leads, and the Joint Obstetric Guidelines Group. It is intended for use by obstetric medical staff and midwives and provides clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of ICP. It supports the RCOG 2022 Green top guideline No 43 and relates to the UH Sussex: Labour and Antenatal Risk Assessments and the UH Sussex: Patient Information: Obstetric Cholestasis. The guideline was approved by the JOGG on 18th October 2023 and by the Medicines Governance Committee on 11th July 2023.

The guideline provides evidence-based guidance for staff in the diagnosis and management of ICP. It covers the aim, scope, responsibilities, abbreviations used, introduction, diagnosis, history and examination, investigations, discussion of maternal and perinatal risks, management of ICP (including antenatal care, drug treatment, timing of birth/induction of labour, intrapartum care, postnatal care, and subsequent pregnancies), audit, and useful links.

ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and 1.2% –1.5% of women/people of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian origin. The prevalence is affected by genetics, racial background, and environmental factors. The aetiology is still unknown and is likely to be multifactorial. There is a high recurrence rate in future pregnancies of between 45 -90%. 

The diagnosis of ICP should be considered in pregnant women/people who have itching in skin of normal appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more. The diagnosis is more likely if it is confirmed that itching and raised bile acids resolve after birth.

Liver function tests and bile acid measurement should be conducted in women with persistent itching and no other apparent cause. If itching resolves with normalisation of bile acids and liver function tests during pregnancy, Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) is unlikely. 

A structured history and examination should be carried out if ICP is suspected, to exclude other causes of itching and liver dysfunction. The presence of a skin rash may indicate Polymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy (PEP) or Pemphigoid Gestationis, requiring appropriate referral or treatment. 

Raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more is indicative of ICP. However, additional investigations should be considered in cases with an atypical or uncertain picture of ICP. 

ICP diagnosis should be confirmed in the postnatal period, with resolution of itching and liver function tests returning to normal. 

Women with ICP may have a higher chance of developing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, requiring regular monitoring. The risk of stillbirth in ICP cases only increases once serum bile acid concentration is 100 micromol/L or more. 

Management of ICP includes consultant led care, weekly BA & LFTs measurements, and regular checks for other conditions that may alter LFTs. Drug treatment includes topical emollient for relief of pruritus and antihistamine agents. Ursodeoxycholic acid should not be prescribed routinely. 

Timing of birth should be planned by a Consultant obstetrician, considering co-morbidities and peak BA concentration. Birth at 38–39 weeks' gestation should be considered in moderate ICP cases, and at 35–36 weeks' gestation in severe ICP cases.

Pregnant women with late preterm gestation should expect a minimum hospital stay of 3 days for baby monitoring. Co-morbidities like gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and multifetal pregnancy may increase stillbirth risk. 

Intrapartum care: ICP does not impact birth mode choice. Pregnant women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more should have continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM). For those with peak bile acids below 100 micromol/L, decision on CEFM can be made based on co-morbidities and preferences. Risk factors like gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and multi-fetal pregnancy may increase adverse perinatal outcomes risk. 

Postnatal care: Itch usually stops after birth and LFTs and B As should return to normal within a few weeks. BAs and LFTs should be checked at 4 weeks post birth. On-going abnormalities indicate that the individual does not have ICP and should be investigated for other causes of abnormal liver function. 

Subsequent pregnancies: Pregnant women should be advised about the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. A baseline liver function test and bile acid concentration should be performed. 

Audit: RCOG suggested audit questions include proportion of pregnant women with raised bile acid concentrations offered timing of birth, having additional investigations, offered ursodeoxycholic acid, and offered CEFM during labour.
