Cervical Cerclage
Green-top Guideline No. 75
June 2022

1. Key recommendations
- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage.
- Women with a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may benefit from ultrasound-indicated cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less.
- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women with a short cervix incidentally identified on a late second trimester ultrasound scan.
- In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be considered.
- Emergency cerclage may delay birth and reduce the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation.

2. Background and scope
Cerclage is used for women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss. The procedure aims to prevent recurrent loss.

5. History-indicated cerclage
- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cerclage.
- History-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with less than three previous preterm births.
- Specific characteristics of previous adverse events may not inform the decision for history-indicated cerclage.

6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage
- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended for women with a short cervix incidentally identified on a late second trimester ultrasound scan.
- Women with a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may benefit from cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less before 24 weeks.

An ultrasound-indicated cerclage is recommended for cervical shortening (less than 25 mm) in women with a history of spontaneous second trimester losses or preterm births to reduce preterm birth before 35 weeks gestation. Cerclage is not recommended for funnelling of the cervix without cervical shortening. Serial sonographic surveillance may help identify women who may benefit from cerclage. Women with multiple pregnancies or other high-risk factors may not benefit from cerclage. Further research is needed in these areas.

- Authors caution interpreting results due to small numbers of women
- Cerclage not significantly different in women with history of cone biopsy or cervical amputation
- Cerclage effective in women with raised BMI
- Transabdominal cerclage may be considered after unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage
- Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy
- Care for delayed miscarriage or fetal death with abdominal cerclage can be difficult
- Individualized decision for emergency cerclage based on risks and benefits
- Contraindications to cerclage insertion
- Information to be given to women before cerclage insertion

Women should be informed of potential complications associated with cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labor, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage. Complications such as bladder damage, cervical trauma, membrane rupture, and bleeding are rare. Cerclage insertion is associated with an increased risk of maternal pyrexia but not chorioamnionitis, PPROM, or induction of labor. Prior to insertion, women should be given appropriate verbal and written information. Investigations before insertion should include a first-trimester ultrasound and screening for aneuploidy. Routine amniocentesis before rescue or ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not recommended. Perioperative tocolysis, antibiotics, and anesthesia should be considered on an individual basis. Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure, and the choice of suture material and technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon. Additional cervical occlusion sutures are not routinely recommended.

pregnancy and cervical length less than 25mm between 16 and 23 weeks were randomized to McDonaldcerclage or no cerclage. Outcomes of women who underwent cerclage were analysed by the type ofsuture material comparing polyester braided thread to mersilene tape. Rates of preterm birth less than 35 weeks were similar between polyester braided thread and mersilene tape. Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efﬁcacy of single versus double cerclage. Both concluded there was no signiﬁcance in preterm birth rates. Limited data exists to support the use of bed rest but individualisation of care should be considered. Abstinence from sexual intercourse following cerclage insertion should not be routinely recommended. Routine fetal ﬁbronectin testing is not recommended post-cerclage. Routine use of progesterone supplementation following cerclage is not recommended. There is no evidence that either progesterone or Arabin pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical cerclage. A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before labour, usually between 36+1and 37+0weeks of gestation. In women with PPROM between 24 and 28 weeks, the cerclage should be removed.

Delayed removal of cerclage until labor or birth is indicated is not recommended due to increased risk of maternal/fetal sepsis. There is no benefit in delaying suture removal in cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes before 23 or after 34 weeks of gestation. Studies suggest that leaving the cerclage in place may be associated with higher rates of chorioamnionitis. Future research should focus on combination therapies for women at high risk of preterm delivery and the role of cerclage in women with cervical damage.
