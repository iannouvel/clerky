Assisted Vaginal Birth
Preparation for assisted vaginal birth
- Continuous support during labour can reduce the need for assisted vaginal birth.
- Epidural analgesia may increase the need for assisted vaginal birth.
- Upright or lateral positions in the second stage of labour can reduce the need for assisted vaginal birth.
- Delayed pushing for 1-2 hours in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia may reduce the need for assisted vaginal birth.
- Routine discontinuation of epidural analgesia during pushing is not recommended.
- There is no specific regional analgesia technique recommended to reduce the incidence of assisted vaginal birth.
- Routine oxytocin augmentation for women with epidural analgesia is not recommended to reduce the incidence of assisted vaginal birth.
- Routine prophylactic manual rotation of fetal malposition in the second stage of labour is not recommended to reduce the risk of assisted vaginal birth.

How should assisted vaginal birth be defined?
- Use a standard classification system for assisted vaginal birth.

When should assisted vaginal birth be recommended/contraindicated?
- Clinical judgment is required in all situations.
- Suspected fetal bleeding disorders or a predisposition to fracture are relative contraindications to assisted vaginal birth.
- Blood borne viral infections in the woman are not an absolute contraindication to assisted vaginal birth.
- Vacuum birth should be avoided below 32 weeks of gestation and used with caution between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation.

What are the essential conditions for safe assisted vaginal birth?
- Safe assisted vaginal birth requires a careful assessment of the clinical situation, clear communication, and expertise in the chosen procedure.

Does ultrasound have a role in assessment prior to assisted vaginal birth?
- Ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to assisted vaginal birth is recommended where uncertainty exists.

What type of consent is required prior to attempting assisted vaginal birth?
- Women should be informed about assisted vaginal birth in the antenatal period.
- Verbal consent should be obtained prior to assisted vaginal birth.

Performing assisted vaginal birth
- Assisted vaginal birth should be performed by an operator with the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience.
- Obstetric trainees should achieve expertise in spontaneous vaginal birth before training in assisted vaginal birth.
- Complex assisted vaginal births should be performed by experienced operators or under supervision.
- An experienced operator should be present to supervise all attempts at rotational or midpelvic assisted vaginal birth.
- Assisted vaginal births with a higher risk of failure should be considered a trial and attempted where immediate recourse to caesarean birth can be undertaken.
- The instrument used should be chosen based on the clinical circumstances and skill level of the operator.

Aftercare following assisted vaginal birth
- A single prophylactic dose of antibiotics should be given following assisted vaginal birth.
- Regular NSAIDs and paracetamol should be offered for pain relief.
- Women should be educated about the risk of urinary retention and monitored postpartum.
- Psychological support and follow-up should be offered to women who have had a traumatic birth.
- Inform women about the probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent labours following assisted vaginal birth.

who have ongoing pelvic floor morbidity. 

Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on the assessment, decision making and conduct of the procedure, a plan for postnatal care and sufficient information for counselling in relation to subsequent pregnancies. Use of a standardised proforma is recommended. 

Paired cord blood samples should be processed and recorded following all attempts at assisted vaginal birth. 

Adverse outcomes, including unsuccessful assisted vaginal birth, major obstetric haemorrhage, OASI, shoulder dystocia and significant neonatal complications should trigger an incident report as part of effective risk management processes. 

Obstetricians should ensure that the ongoing care of the woman, baby and family is paramount. Obstetricians have a duty of candour; a professional responsibility to be honest with patients when things go wrong. Obstetricians should contribute to adverse event reporting, confidential enquiries, and take part in regular reviews and audits. They should respond constructively to outcomes of reviews, taking necessary steps to address any problems and carry out further retraining where needed. Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework to support women, their families and staff when serious adverse events occur. 

The aim of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of forceps and vacuum extraction for both rotational and non-rotational assisted vaginal births. In order to provide safe care for the full range of clinical scenarios, obstetricians should develop competency in the use of both vacuum and forceps for non-rotational birth and at least one specialist technique for rotational birth. The scope of this guideline includes indications, procedures and governance issues relating to assisted vaginal birth. 

Assisted vaginal birth by vacuum or forceps is used to assist birth for maternal and fetal indications. In the UK, between 10% and 15% of all women give birth by assisted vaginal birth. Almost one in every three nulliparous women gives birth by vacuum or forceps, with lower rates in midwifery-led care settings. There has been a rise in the rate of caesarean births in the second stage of labour; this may reflect concerns about assisted vaginal birth morbidity or a loss of clinical skills. The majority of births by vacuum and forceps, when performed correctly by appropriately trained personnel, result in a safe outcome for the woman and baby. Women who achieve an assisted vaginal birth rather than have a caesarean birth with their first child are far more likely to have an uncomplicated vaginal birth in subsequent pregnancies. However, obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists should be aware that serious rare complications can result in perinatal death and that these complications are more likely to occur with midpelvic, rotational and failed attempts at assisted vaginal birth. The alternative choice of a caesarean birth late in the second stage of labour can be very challenging and result in significant maternal and perinatal morbidity. As a result, complex decision making is required when choosing between assisted vaginal birth and second-stage caesarean birth. 

Two new developments have occurred since the publication of the 2011 guideline: i) the Montgomery ruling has emphasised the importance of informed consent; and ii) a number of high profile manslaughter convictions on the grounds of gross negligence have highlighted the risk of a criminal conviction, where serious shortcomings are identified in medical care provided to a patient who dies. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has also received reports of a number of neonatal fatalities associated with traumatic birth-related injuries. It is in this context that the safety aspects of this guideline have been reviewed and updated.

Assess and manage complications during assisted vaginal birth. Trainees should be proficient in spontaneous vaginal birth before training in assisted birth. Competency must be demonstrated before unsupervised births. Complex assisted births should be done by experienced operators or under supervision. Training is crucial for patient safety. Familiarize with theoretical knowledge and skills for assisted birth. Competence assessment is essential. Higher failure rates for certain factors in assisted birth. Considerations for where assisted birth should take place. Choose appropriate instrument based on circumstances and skill level. Vacuum and forceps births have different risks and benefits. Maternal and neonatal complications associated with assisted birth. Maternal outcomes include episiotomy, tears, OASI, postpartum hemorrhage, and incontinence. Neonatal complications include intracranial and subgaleal hemorrhage.

Perinatal outcomes:
- Cephalhaematoma, facial or scalp lacerations, retinal haemorrhage, jaundice, subgaleal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, cervical spine injury, skull fracture, facial nerve palsy, fetal death are all potential risks associated with assisted vaginal birth.
- The 'Od on' device is not recommended for routine use until fully evaluated.
- Rotational assisted vaginal birth with Kielland's forceps has been reported to have lower failure rates and less neonatal trauma compared to rotational vacuum birth.
- Training and expertise are crucial for safe assisted vaginal births.
- Operator should discontinue vacuum-assisted birth if there is no evidence of progressive descent, and manage discontinued procedures carefully.
- Sequential use of instruments carries risks of neonatal trauma and should be done cautiously.
- Episiotomy should be discussed with the woman before assisted vaginal birth.

The evidence supports the use of mediolateral episiotomy at assisted vaginal birth, especially for nulliparous women and forceps births. A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to reduce maternal infection. Regular NSAIDs and paracetamol should be offered for pain relief. Women should be educated about the risk of urinary retention and monitored postpartum. Psychological support and follow-up are important after assisted vaginal birth. Women should be informed that subsequent labors following assisted vaginal birth have a high probability of spontaneous vaginal birth.

Women who have required more complex assisted vaginal births in theatre have an approximately 80% likelihood of achieving a spontaneous vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Careful review of the future plan of care is recommended for women who have experienced a third- or fourth-degree tear, as they may be at increased risk of further anorectal damage with a subsequent birth. Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on assessment, decision making, and procedure conduct, as well as plans for postnatal care and counseling for subsequent pregnancies. Adverse outcomes during assisted vaginal birth should trigger incident reports for effective risk management. Obstetricians have a duty of candor and should participate in adverse event reporting and reviews to address any problems. Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive environment for women, families, and staff during serious adverse events.
