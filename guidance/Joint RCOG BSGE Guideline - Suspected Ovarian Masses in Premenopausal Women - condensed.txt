Green-top Guideline No. 62 Management of Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women
This guideline provides information for clinicians on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary. 
Up to 10% of women may undergo surgery for ovarian masses, with most being benign in premenopausal women. Differentiating between benign and malignant masses can be challenging. 
Conservative management is recommended for many ovarian masses, with laparoscopic surgery considered the gold standard for benign masses. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised for suspicious masses. 
Ultrasound is the preferred imaging method, with additional tests like CA-125, LDH, and hCG recommended for specific cases. The Risk of Malignancy Index is used to estimate the risk of malignancy. 
Simple ultrasound rules can also help classify masses as benign or malignant. Suspicious features warrant referral to a gynaecological oncologist. Other guidelines from the US and Canada provide similar recommendations.

Women with simple ovarian cysts less than 50 mm do not require follow-up as they are likely to resolve within 3 menstrual cycles. Cysts between 50-70 mm should have yearly ultrasound follow-up, while larger cysts may need further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or growing cysts may require surgical management, especially for mature cystic teratomas. The use of oral contraceptives does not aid in the resolution of functional ovarian cysts. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred for benign ovarian masses, with lower morbidity and quicker recovery compared to laparotomy. Aspiration of cysts is less effective and may lead to high recurrence rates. It is important to avoid unplanned rupture of cysts to prevent spillage of potentially malignant contents. The decision to perform oophorectomy should be discussed with the woman preoperatively. Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes. Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons with appropriate equipment.
