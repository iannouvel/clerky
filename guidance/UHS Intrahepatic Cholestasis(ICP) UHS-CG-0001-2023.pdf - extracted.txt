5.0 Introduction  
 
In the UK, Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)  affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi -
ethnic populations, and 1.2% –1.5% of women /people  of Indian -Asian or Pakistani -Asian  
UHS -CG-0001 -2023  UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy v1.1 Oct 2023  Page 5 of 12

origin.  The prevalence is affected by many variables including genetics, racial background 
and environmental factors.  
 
The aetiology is still unknown and is likely to be multifactorial.  There is a high recurrence 
rate in future pregnancies of between 45 -90%.  
 
Characteristics of ICP include pruritus  (itching) in the absence of a rash, and deranged liver 
function tests (LFTs) and/or raised bile acids  (BA), which resolve spontaneously after birth 
and which have no alternative cause .  
 
In a meta -analysis of adverse perinatal outcomes of ICP with biochemical markers ,  
in singleton pregnancies, stillbirth was associated with maximum total bile acid concentration, 
especially over 100 micromol/L. In pregnancies with co -morbidities that thems elves may 
impact on pregnancy outcome (such as multifetal, diabetic, pre -eclamptic pregnancies), 
these must be taken into account when considering risks and care options.  
 
Bile acid concentrations are not associated with intensity of itching.  Other liver b lood tests, 
such as alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase are not associated with pregnancy 
outcome.  In light of this, the consensus is now that the diagnosis of ICP requires elevated 
maternal bile acid  concentrations, and that pregnant women  and people with itching and 
isolated raised transaminases alone (with normal bile acid concentrations) should not be 
given a diagnosis of ICP. This is supported by the recent systematic review described above, 
in which there was no association between abnorma l maternal  and birthing parent  
transaminase concentrations and stillbirth.  
 
 
6.0 Diagnosis  
 
The diagnosis of ICP should be considered in pregnant women  and people  who have itching 
in skin of normal appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentr ation of 
19 micromol/L or more . The diagnosis is more likely if it is confirmed that itching and raised 
bile acids resolve after birth . 
 
Offer repeat liver function tests and bile acid measurement (depending on gestation and 
clinical context) in women /people  with normal blood results whose itch persists, and no other 
cause is apparent . 
 
If resolution of itching is associated with normalisation of bile acids and liver function tests 
during pregnancy, the diagnosis of ICP is unlikely to be correct . 
 
 
7.0 History  and examination  
 
If a diagnosis of ICP is suspected, carry out a structured history and examination, so that 
other causes of itching and liver dysfunction can be excluded .

Presence of a skin rash may be diagnostic of Polymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy (PEP) or 
Pemphigoid Gestationis, and these women /people  should be referred or treated as 
appropriate.  
 
 
8.0 Investigations  
 
Bile acid (BA) measurement: raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 
19 micromol/L or more  is indicative of ICP . 
 
Women  and people with a typical picture of ICP do not need to routinely undergo the 
investigations (hepatitis serology and liver ultrasound) for other causes o f liver disease.   
 
However , these additional investigations (including viral and autoimmune screen and liver 
ultrasound) , should  be considered in women  and people  and pregnant people with an 
atypical or uncertain picture of ICP. This may include women  and people  with markedly 
elevated transaminases, early onset of ICP in the first or second trimester, a rapidly 
progressive biochemical picture, any features of liver failure or evidence of acute infection, or 
if resolution does not occur after birth.  Consider  discussing the care of women  and people  
with severe, very early or atypical presentation of what appears to be ICP with a 
hepatologist . 
 
Confirm the diagnosis of ICP in the postnatal period at least 4 weeks after birth, with 
resolution of itching and live r function tests returning to normal (including bile acids) . 
 
 
9.0  Discussion of m aternal and perinatal risks  
 
Maternal  and birthing parent :  
 Advise women  and people  with ICP that the predominant symptom is itching. This 
can be severe, may fluctuate and may markedly affect sleep . 
 Women  and people  with ICP may have a higher chance of developing pre -
eclampsia (OR 3.7) or gestational diabetes  (OR 2.4) . They should have b lood 
pressure and urine monitoring, and testing for gestational diabetes according to 
national guidance . 
 
Fetal:  
 Stillbirth:  
Advise pregnant women  and people  with isolated ICP and a singleton pregnancy 
that the risk of stillbirth only increases above population rate once their serum bile 
acid concentration is 100 micromol/L or more:   
o In women  and people  with peak bile acids 19 –39 micromol/L and no other 
risk f actors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background 
risk. 
o In women  and people  with peak bile acids 40 –99 micromol/L and no other 
risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background 
risk until 38 –39 we eks' gestation.

Please check against the intranet  that this printout is the most recent version of this document . 
o In women  and people  with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more, advise 
them that the risk of stillbirth is higher than the background risk . 
 Advise pregnant women  and people  with ICP that the presence of risk factors or 
co-morbidities (such as gestational diabetes and/or pre -eclampsia and/or multi -
fetal pregnancy) appear to increase the risk of stillbirth and may influence decision -
making around timing of planned birth . 
 Advis e pregnant women  and people  with moderate or severe ICP that they have a 
higher chance of both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth . 
 Advise pregnant women  and people with moderate or severe ICP that they have 
an increased chance of having meconium stai ned amniotic fluid during labour and 
birth. 
 Advise women  and people pregnant  with moderate or severe ICP that their baby is 
more likely to receive neonatal care . 
 
 
10.0 Management of ICP  
10.1 Antenatal Care  
 
 Pregnant w omen  and people  with ICP should receive the  RCOG patient 
information leaflet: obstetric cholestasis / ICP  once the diagnosis has been made . 
 Pregnant women  and people with ICP should be under consultant led care  and 
should be managed within the Day Assessment Unit (DAU) . 
 BA & LFTs should be measured weekly  in the majority  until birth. 
 Pregnant women  and people should be checked regularly for other conditions that 
may alter LFTs such as pre -eclampsia, with on -going management dependent on 
the diagnosis . 
 Ultrasound and regular antenatal CTG monitoring are not routinely indicated in 
pregnant women  and people  with ICP alone and are not reliable pr edictors of fetal 
morbidity.  
 Advise women  and people with ICP alone to monitor fetal movements and present 
for immediate assessment if they have concerns . 
 
 
10.2 Drug treatment  
 
 Advise pregnant women  and people that there are no treatments that improve 
pregnancy outcome (or reduce BA concentration) and treatments to improve 
maternal itching are of limited benefit . 
 Topical emollient, Aqueous Cream with menthol 1% (RSCH &PRH) or Levomethol 
1% in Aqueous Cream (SRH & WH),  for relief of pruritus  may benefit some 
pregnant women  and people . 
 Antihistamine agents such as chlorphenamine may be considered . 
 Ursodeoxycholic acid  (URSO ) has been shown not to improve symptomatic 
pruritus  and should not be prescribed routinely. It may have a place in 
management of pregnant women  and people with severe , very  early onset ICP 
and individualised decision made for its use by senior obstetrician  in discussion 
with maternal and birthing medicine.  (The c ommonly used dosage is 250mg four 
times a day  orally ).

Please check against the intranet  that this printout is the most recent version of this document . 
 In pregnant women  and people with BA >40 micromol/L who are 34 -36 weeks’ 
gestation, URSO may offer some benefit in reducing late preterm birth but it is not 
clear that this reduction results in any benefit to the baby and nor prevent stillbirth . 
 Other agents should no t be offered for treatment of ICP outside of a research 
study or individualised specialist treatment . 
 If the prothrombin time is elevated  or if evidence of reduced absorption of dietary 
fats (eg steatorrhoea) , consider 10mg water soluble vitamin K (menadio l sodium 
phosphate). Routine use of vitamin K is not indicated because most pregnant  
women  and people  with ICP will not have evidence of reduced fat absorption . 
 Any pregnant women  and people  with total bile acids >100  micromol/l  should have 
an urgent  consultant review and a discussion regarding on-going management.  
 Pregnant women  and people with bile acids <100 micromol/l but are rapidly rising 
should also be discussed with a consultant.   
 
 
10.3 Timing of birth / Induction of Labour  (IOL)  
 
 Timing of birth should be planned by (or after discussion with) Consultant 
obstetrician taking into account co -morbidities and peak BA concentration.  
 Consider planned birth at 38 –39 weeks' gestation in women  and people  with 
moderate ICP with peak bile acids 40 –99 mi cromol/L and no other risk factors; 
advise them that the overall risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk until 
38–39 weeks' gestation . 
 Consider planned birth at 35 –36 weeks' gestation in women  and people  with 
severe ICP  with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more; advise them that the risk 
of stillbirth is higher than the background risk. Advise pregnant women  and people 
that giving birth at a late preterm gestation will require their hospital stay to be 
lengthened to 3 days minimum to monitor their baby  (WH&SRH see  CG21010 
Care of the late preterm newborn guideline ). 
 Advise pregn ant women  and people  that the presence of co -morbidities (such as 
gestational diabetes, pre -eclampsia, multifetal pregnancy) appear to increase the 
risk of stillbirth and may influence decision -making around timing of planned birth . 
 
 
10.4 Intrapartum care 
 
 Advise pregnant women /people  that ICP in itself does not impact their choice 
around mode of birth and that these decisions should be based on usual obstetric 
practice for that woman /person . 
 Offer continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) to  pregnant  women /people  
with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more.  
 There is insufficient evidence for or against CEFM in pregnant  women /people  with 
peak bile acids below 100 micromol/L. A shared decision can be made based on 
co-morbidities and preferences.  
 Advise pregnant  women /people  that the presence of risk factors (such as 
gestational diabetes, pre -eclampsia, multi -fetal pregnancy) appear to increase the 
risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and that these conditions themselves may

necessitate monitoring during bir th or in conjunction with ICP may influence 
decision -making around monitoring in labour.  
 Advise pregnant  women  and people  that meconium -stained liquor is more 
common in moderate and severe ICP, and that this will influence decision -making 
around CEFM . 
 Offer pregnant  women  and people  with uncomplicated ICP standard analgesia 
and anaesthesia options for birth . 
 Advise pregnant  women  and people  that there is no evidence of an increased risk 
of postpartum haemorrhage if they have uncomplicated ICP . 
 
 
10.5 Postnatal care 
 
 Inform women  and people with ICP that the itch  usually stops after birth and LFTs 
and B As should return to normal within a few weeks.  
 BAs and LFTs should be checked at 4 weeks post birth and the woman  and 
people reviewed in a postnatal follow up appointment to ensure resolution of the 
symptoms and normalisation of blood results and hence confirmation of the 
diagnosis .  
 Pregnant women  and people  with on -going abnormalities do not have ICP and 
should be investigated via the primary care practitioner for other causes of 
abnormal liver function . 
 Pregnant women  and people with previous ICP should be advised that ICP does 
not influence choice of contraception unless they have previously experienced 
cholestasis secondary to the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) - they 
should consider progesterone -only or non -hormonal methods.  
 Women  and people  with previous ICP may have HRT if there are no other 
contraindications.  
 
10.6 Subsequent pregnancies  
 
 Pregnant women  and people  should be advised about the risk of recurrence in 
future preg nancies . Referral should be made for consultant led care if symptoms 
develop in subsequent pregnancies.  
 Perform a baseline liver function test and bile acid concentration with 
booking blood inve stigations  in order to establish that these are normal .
