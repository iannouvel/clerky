Diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)

Key Principles:
- Guidelines are not prescriptive and should be used in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues
- Evidence used is drawn from national/RCOG guidelines
- Reviewed by all clinicians involved in early pregnancy care

Introduction:
- GTD is a group of pregnancy-related tumors characterized by proliferation of trophoblastic tissue
- Rare condition with high cure rate
- Clinical features include irregular uterine bleeding, hyperemesis, and early pregnancy failure

Ultrasound examination:
- Helpful in making pre-evacuation diagnosis

Complete Moles:
- Diploid and androgenic in origin, with no evidence of fetal tissue

Partial Moles:
- Usually triploid in origin, with two sets of paternal haploid genes and one set of maternal haploid genes

Histology:
- Histological assessment of failed pregnancies is recommended to exclude trophoblastic disease

Evacuation of molar pregnancy:
- Suction curettage is the method of choice for complete and partial molar pregnancies
- Anti-D prophylaxis advised after evacuation of partial molar pregnancy if Rh Negative

Follow up:
- Women diagnosed with GTD are informed about their diagnosis and referred for follow-up testing

Future Pregnancy and contraceptive advice:
- Women advised not to conceive until follow-up is complete
- Barrier methods of contraception recommended until hCG levels revert to normal

Future pregnancies:
- Risk of further molar pregnancy is low
- Women should be monitored for recurrence by repeating hCG values following completion of pregnancy

Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN):
- Persistent elevation of Î²hCG indicates GTN

Twin Pregnancy:
- Seek advice from regional Fetal medicine Centre in case of combined molar pregnancy with viable twin pregnancy
