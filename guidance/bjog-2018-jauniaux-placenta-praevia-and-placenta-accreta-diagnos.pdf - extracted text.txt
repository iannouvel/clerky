Executive summary
Antenatal diagnosis and care of women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
What are the risk factors for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta?
Caesarean delivery is associated with an increased risk of placenta praevia in subsequent
pregnancies. This risk rises as the number of prior caesarean sections increases. [New 2018]
B
Assisted reproductive technology and maternal smoking increase the risk of placenta praevia.
[New 2018]
B
Should we screen women for placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta, if so, at what gestation and with what follow-up?
The midpregnancy routine fetal anomaly scan should include placental localisation thereby
identifying women at risk of persisting placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta. [New 2018]
The term placenta praevia should be used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os.
For pregnancies at more than 16 weeks of gestation the term low-lying placenta should be
used when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os on transabdominal or
transvaginal scanning (TVS). [New 2018]
If the placenta is thought to be low lying (less than 20 mm from the internal os) or praevia
(covering the os) at the routine fetal anomaly scan, a follow-up ultrasound examination
including a TVS is recommended at 32 weeks of gestation to diagnose persistent low-lying
placenta and/or placenta praevia.

What is the role and what are the risks of TVS?
Clinicians should be aware that TVS for the diagnosis of placenta praevia or a low-lying
placenta is superior to transabdominal and transperineal approaches, and is safe. [New 2018]
In women with a persistent low-lying placenta or placenta praevia at 32 weeks of gestation
who remain asymptomatic, an additional TVS is recommended at around 36 weeks of gestation
to inform discussion about mode of delivery. [New 2018]
Cervical length measurement may help facilitate management decisions in asymptomatic women
with placenta praevia. A short cervical length on TVS before 34 weeks of gestation increases the
risk of preterm emergency delivery and massive haemorrhage at caesarean section. [New 2018]
Where should women with a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia be cared for in the third trimester?
Women with recurrent bleeding (low-lying placenta or placenta praevia)
Tailor antenatal care, including hospitalisation, to individual woman's needs and social
circumstances, e.g. distance between home and hospital and availability of transportation,
previous bleeding episodes, haematology laboratory results, and acceptance of receiving donor
blood or blood products. [New 2018]
Where hospital admission has been decided, an assessment of risk factors for venous
thromboembolism in pregnancy should be performed as outlined in the Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists Green-top Guideline No. 37a. This will need to balance the risk of developing a
venous thromboembolism against the risk of bleeding from a placenta praevia or low lying placenta.
It should be made clear to any woman being treated at home in the third trimester that she
should attend the hospital immediately if she experiences any bleeding, including spotting,
contractions or pain (including vague suprapubic period-like aches).
Asymptomatic women (low-lying placenta or placenta praevia)
Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta in the third trimester
should be counselled about the risks of preterm delivery and obstetric haemorrhage, and their
care should be tailored to their individual needs.
Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia confirmed at the 32-week follow-up scan and
managed at home should be encouraged to ensure they have safety precautions in place,
including having someone available to help them as necessary and ready access to the hospital.
Is there a place for cervical cerclage in women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta?
The use of cervical cerclage to reduce bleeding and prolong pregnancy is not supported by
sufficient evidence to recommend its use outside of a clinical trial.

In what circumstances, and at what gestation, should women be offered antenatal corticosteroids?
A single course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended between 34+0 and
35+6 weeks of gestation for pregnant women with a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia and
is appropriate prior to 34 +0 weeks of gestation in women at higher risk of preterm birth.
[New 2018]
Is there a place for the use of tocolytics in women presenting with symptomatic low-lying placenta or placenta
praevia, who are in suspected preterm labour?
Tocolysis for women presenting with symptomatic placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta may
be considered for 48 hours to facilitate administration of antenatal corticosteroids. [New 2018]
C
If delivery is indicated based on maternal or fetal concerns, tocolysis should not be used in an
attempt to prolong gestation. [New 2018]
C
At what gestation should planned delivery occur?
Late preterm (34 +0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation) delivery should be considered for women
presenting with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta and a history of vaginal bleeding or
other associated risk factors for preterm delivery. [New 2018]
C
Delivery timing should be tailored according to antenatal symptoms and, for women presenting
with uncomplicated placenta praevia, delivery should be considered between 36+0 and
37+0 weeks of gestation. [New 2018]
In what situations is vaginal delivery appropriate for women with a low-lying placenta?
In women with a third trimester asymptomatic low-lying placenta the mode of delivery should
be based on the clinical background, the woman's preferences, and supplemented by
ultrasound findings, including the distance between the placental edge and the fetal head
position relative to the leading edge of the placenta on TVS. [New 2018]
Optimising the delivery of women with placenta praevia
Prior to delivery, all women with placenta praevia and their partners should have a discussion
regarding delivery. Indications for blood transfusion and hysterectomy should be reviewed and
any plans to decline blood or blood products should be discussed openly and documented.
Placenta praevia and anterior low-lying placenta carry a higher risk of massive obstetric
haemorrhage and hysterectomy. Delivery should be arranged in a maternity unit with on-site
blood transfusion services and access to critical care.

Women with atypical antibodies form a particularly high-risk group and the care of these
women should involve discussions with the local haematologist and blood bank.
D
Prevention and treatment of anaemia during the antenatal period is recommended for women
with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta as for any pregnant woman.
D
Delivery for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
What grade of obstetrician and anaesthetist should attend the caesarean delivery of a woman with placenta praevia?
As a minimum requirement for a planned caesarean section for a woman with placenta
praevia, the surgical procedure should be carried out by an appropriately experienced operator.
[New 2018]
In cases of planned caesarean section for placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta, a senior
obstetrician (usually a consultant) and senior anaesthetist (usually a consultant) should be
present within the delivery or theatre suite where the surgery is occurring.
When an emergency arises, the senior obstetrician and senior anaesthetist should be alerted
immediately and attend urgently.
What anaesthetic procedure is most appropriate for women having a caesarean section for placenta praevia?
Regional anaesthesia is considered safe and is associated with lower risks of haemorrhage than
general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery in women with placenta praevia or a low-lying
placenta. Women with anterior placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta should be advised that it
may be necessary to convert to general anaesthesia if required and asked to consent. [New 2018]
What blood products should be available?
Close liaison with the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential for women presenting with
placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta. [New 2018]
Rapid infusion and fluid warming devices should be immediately available. [New 2018]
Cell salvage is recommended for women where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to
induce anaemia, in particular, in women who would decline blood products.
D
D
What surgical approach should be used for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta?
Consider vertical skin and/or uterine incisions when the fetus is in a transverse lie to avoid the
placenta, particularly below 28 weeks of gestation. [New 2018]
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126
e5 of e48
© 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Consider using preoperative and/or intraoperative ultrasonography to precisely determine
placental location and the optimal place for uterine incision. [New 2018]
D
If the placenta is transected during the uterine incision, immediately clamp the umbilical cord
after fetal delivery to avoid excessive fetal blood loss. [New 2018]
D
If pharmacological measures fail to control haemorrhage, initiate intrauterine tamponade and/or
surgical haemostatic techniques sooner rather than later. Interventional radiological techniques
should also be urgently employed where possible. [New 2018]
C
Early recourse to hysterectomy is recommended if conservative medical and surgical
interventions prove ineffective. [New 2018]
D
Antenatal diagnosis and outcome of women with placenta accreta spectrum
What are the risk factors for women with placenta accreta spectrum?
The major risk factors for placenta accreta spectrum are history of accreta in a previous
pregnancy, previous caesarean delivery and other uterine surgery, including repeated endometrial
curettage. This risk rises as the number of prior caesarean sections increases. [New 2018]
B
Women requesting elective caesarean delivery for non-medical indications should be informed
of the risk of placenta accreta spectrum and its consequences for subsequent pregnancies.
[New 2018]
How can placenta accreta spectrum be suspected and diagnosed antenatally?
Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is crucial in planning its management and has
been shown to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. [New 2018]
D
Previous caesarean delivery and the presence of an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta
praevia should alert the antenatal care team of the higher risk of placenta accreta spectrum.
D
Ultrasound screening and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum
Ultrasound imaging is highly accurate when performed by a skilled operator with experience in
diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum. [New 2018]
C
Refer women with any ultrasound features suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum to a
specialist unit with imaging expertise. [New 2018]
B
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126
e6 of e48
© 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Women with a history of previous caesarean section seen to have an anterior low-lying
placenta or placenta praevia at the routine fetal anomaly scan should be specifically screened
for placenta accreta spectrum. [New 2018]
Is there a role for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum?
D
Clinicians should be aware that the diagnostic value of MRI and ultrasound imaging in detecting
placenta accreta spectrum is similar when performed by experts. [New 2018]
C
MRI may be used to complement ultrasound imaging to assess the depth of invasion and
lateral extension of myometrial invasion, especially with posterior placentation and/or in
women with ultrasound signs suggesting parametrial invasion.
Where should women with placenta accreta spectrum be cared for?
Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum should be cared for by a multidisciplinary
team in a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and managing invasive placentation.
[New 2018]
Delivery for women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum should take place in a specialist
centre with logistic support for immediate access to blood products, adult intensive care unit
and neonatal intensive care unit by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in complex pelvic
surgery. [New 2018]
When should delivery be planned for women with placenta accreta spectrum?
In the absence of risk factors for preterm delivery in women with placenta accreta spectrum,
planned delivery at 35+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation provides the best balance between fetal
maturity and the risk of unscheduled delivery. [New 2018]
Planning delivery of women with suspected placenta accreta spectrum
Once the diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is made, a contingency plan for emergency
delivery should be developed in partnership with the woman, including the use of an
institutional protocol for the management of maternal haemorrhage. [New 2018]
D
What should be included in the consent form for caesarean section in women with suspected placenta accreta
spectrum?
Any woman giving consent for caesarean section should understand the risks associated with
caesarean section in general, and the specific risks of placenta accreta spectrum in terms of
massive obstetric haemorrhage, increased risk of lower urinary tract damage, the need for
blood transfusion and the risk of hysterectomy.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126
e7 of e48
© 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Additional possible interventions in the case of massive haemorrhage should also be discussed,
including cell salvage and interventional radiology where available. [New 2018]
What healthcare professionals should be involved?
The elective delivery of women with placenta accreta spectrum should be managed by a
multidisciplinary team, which should include senior anaesthetists, obstetricians and
gynaecologists with appropriate experience in managing the condition and other surgical
specialties if indicated. In an emergency, the most senior clinicians available should be involved.
What anaesthetic is most appropriate for delivery?
The choice of anaesthetic technique for caesarean section for women with placenta accreta
spectrum should be made by the anaesthetist conducting the procedure in consultation with
the woman prior to surgery.
The woman should be informed that the surgical procedure can be performed safely with
regional anaesthesia but should be advised that it may be necessary to convert to general
anaesthesia if required and asked to consent to this. [New 2018]
Optimising the delivery of women with placenta accreta spectrum
What surgical approach should be used for women with placenta accreta spectrum?
D
D
Caesarean section hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ is preferable to attempting to
separate it from the uterine wall.
C
When the extent of the placenta accreta is limited in depth and surface area, and the entire
placental implantation area is accessible and visualised (i.e. completely anterior, fundal or
posterior without deep pelvic invasion), uterus preserving surgery may be appropriate, including
partial myometrial resection. [New 2018]
Uterus preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by surgeons working in teams
with appropriate expertise to manage such cases and after appropriate counselling regarding
risks and with informed consent. [New 2018]
D
There are currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of ureteric stents in
placenta accreta spectrum. The use of stents may have a role when the urinary bladder is
invaded by placental tissue (see section 8.4.2). [New 2018]
C
What surgical approach should be used for women with placenta percreta?
There is limited evidence to support uterus preserving surgery in placenta percreta and women
should be informed of the high risk of peripartum and secondary complications, including the
need for secondary hysterectomy. [New 2018]
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126

Expectant management (leaving the placenta in situ)
Elective peripartum hysterectomy may be unacceptable to women desiring uterine preservation
or considered inappropriate by the surgical team. In such cases, leaving the placenta in situ
should be considered. [New 2018]
D
When the placenta is left in situ, local arrangements need to be made to ensure regular
review, ultrasound examination and access to emergency care should the woman experience
complications, such as bleeding or infection. [New 2018]
D
Methotrexate adjuvant therapy should not be used for expectant management as it is of unproven
benefit and has significant adverse effects. [New 2018]
C
When is interventional radiology indicated?
Larger studies are necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of interventional radiology
before this technique can be advised in the routine management of placenta accreta spectrum.
[New 2018]
D
Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum who decline donor blood transfusion should
be cared for in a unit with an interventional radiology service.
D
How are women with undiagnosed or unsuspected placenta accreta spectrum best managed at delivery?
If at the time of an elective repeat caesarean section, where both mother and baby are stable,
it is immediately apparent that placenta percreta is present on opening the abdomen, the
caesarean section should be delayed until the appropriate staff and resources have been
assembled and adequate blood products are available. This may involve closure of the maternal
abdomen and urgent transfer to a specialist unit for delivery. [New 2018]
In case of unsuspected placenta accreta spectrum diagnosed after the birth of the baby, the
placenta should be left in situ and an emergency hysterectomy performed. [New 2018]

rates of placenta praevia and accreta have increased and will continue to do so as a result of rising rates of
caesarean deliveries, increased maternal age and use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), placing greater

demands on maternity-related resources. The highest rates of complication for both mother and newborn are
observed when these conditions are only diagnosed at delivery.
2.1
Placenta praevia
6,7
Determining placental location is one of the first aims of routine midpregnancy (18+6 to 21 +6 weeks of gestation)
transabdominal obstetric ultrasound examination. Placenta praevia was originally defined using transabdominal scan
(TAS) as a placenta developing within the lower uterine segment and graded according to the relationship and/or the
distance between the lower placental edge and the internal os of the uterine cervix. Grade 1 or minor praevia is
defined as a lower edge inside the lower uterine segment; grade II or marginal praevia as a lower edge reaching the
internal os; grade III or partial praevia when the placenta partially covers the cervix; and grade IV or complete praevia
when the placenta completely covers the cervix. Grades I and II are also often defined as 'minor' placenta praevia
whereas grades III and IV are referred to as 'major' placenta praevia.
The introduction of transvaginal scanning (TVS) in obstetrics in the 1980s has allowed for a more precise evaluation of
the distance between the placental edge and the internal os. A recent multidisciplinary workshop of the American
Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) ³ has recommended discontinuing the use of the terms 'partial' and
'marginal', suggesting that the term 'placenta praevia' is used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os. For
pregnancies greater than 16 weeks of gestation, the placenta should be reported as ‘low lying' when the placental edge
is less than 20 mm from the internal os, and as normal when the placental edge is 20 mm or more from the internal
os on TAS or TVS. This new classification could better define the risks of perinatal complications, such as antepartum
haemorrhage and major postpartum haemorrhage (PPH),⁹, and has the potential of improving the obstetric
management of placenta praevia. Recent articles reviewed in this guideline refer to the AIUM classification.
9,10
5,9
The estimated incidence of placenta praevia at term is I in 200 pregnancies. However, this is dependent on the
definition used and is likely to change with the introduction of the AIUM classification described above and with the
rising incidence of the main risk factors, i.e. prior caesarean delivery and pregnancies resulting from ART. The
relationship between a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia and a velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord is
presented and discussed in the sister Green-top Guideline No. 27b: Vasa Praevia: Diagnosis and Management.
2.2
Placenta accreta
Placenta accreta is a histopathological term first defined by Irving and Hertig in 1937, as the "abnormal adherence of the
afterbirth in whole or in parts to the underlying uterine wall in the partial or complete absence of decidua”.'' Irving and
Hertig did not include abnormally invasive placentation in their series and thus, their description was limited to abnormally
adherent placenta. Depending on the depth of villous tissue invasiveness, placenta accreta was subsequently subdivided by
modern pathologists into ‘creta' or ‘adherenta' where the villi adheres superficially to the myometrium without interposing
decidua; 'increta' where the villi penetrate deeply into the uterine myometrium down to the serosa; and 'percreta' where
the villous tissue perforates through the entire uterine wall and may invade the surrounding pelvic organs, such as the
bladder. Cases of placenta accreta are also often subdivided into total, partial or focal according to the amount of
placental tissue involved and the different depths of accreta placentation have been found to co-exist in the same case.
Thus, placenta accreta is a spectrum disorder ranging from abnormally adherent to deeply invasive placental tissue.
12-14
12,15
Detailed data on clinical findings and, where possible, on histopathological examination are essential when describing
different diagnostic or management techniques. 16,17 The diagnostic conundrum is obvious at the abnormally adherent

1-5
end of the spectrum where the differential diagnosis between a difficult manual removal and an abnormally adherent
or placenta accreta may be impossible in the absence of histopathological confirmation. These diagnostic difficulties
probably explain the current wide variation in reported prevalence of placenta accreta ranging between | in 300 and
in 2000 pregnancies,' and highlight the need for a standardised approach to imaging, clinical and histopathological
descriptions. In the last decade, even the condition itself has begun to be known by many different names, with
'morbidly adherent placenta' becoming particularly popular. This terminology was originally used in the 19th century
to describe the clinical complications associated with a retained placenta. This terminology is misleading as 'morbidly
adherent' does not encompass the abnormally invasive end of the accreta spectrum (increta and percreta), which
usually have the worst clinical outcomes. In order to overcome these difficulties, the terms 'placenta accreta
spectrum' or ‘abnormally adherent and invasive placenta' should be used to include both the abnormally adherent
and invasive forms of accreta placentation. In this guideline, the term placenta accreta spectrum will be used.
16,17
18
19
In the 1990s, the maternal mortality of placenta percreta was reported to be as high as 7% of cases. More recent
large series have reported lower rates of maternal death and this is likely to be further improved by screening for
placenta accreta spectrum in women at high risk and in planning the delivery in specialist centres.

Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and
PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT), systematic reviews
and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published between May 2009 and July 2016 (the search for
the previous guideline was up to May 2009). A top-up literature search was performed in March 2018. The
databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings, and
this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included ‘placenta praevia', 'low lying placenta', 'placenta
accreta', 'placenta increta' 'placenta percreta', 'abnormally adherent placenta' and 'abnormally invasive placenta'. The
search was restricted to humans and the English language. The National Library for Health and the National
Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. In the absence of published evidence, these have
been annotated as 'good practice points'. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of
recommendations may be found in Appendix I.

Antenatal diagnosis and care of women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
4.1 What are the risk factors for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta?
Caesarean delivery is associated with an increased risk of placenta praevia in subsequent
pregnancies. This risk rises as the number of prior caesarean sections increases. [New 2018]
ART and maternal smoking increase the risk of placenta praevia. [New 2018]

In 1997, a meta-analysis of the association of placenta praevia with history of caesarean delivery found a
dose-response pattern for the relative risk (RR) of placenta praevia of 4.5 (95% CI 3.6-5.5) for one, 7.4
(95% CI 7.1-7.7) for two, 6.5 (95% CI 3.6–11.6) for three, and 44.9 (95% CI 13.5–149.5) for four or more
prior caesarean deliveries compared with vaginal delivery.2
23
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies including over 2 million deliveries indicated that the
incidence of placenta praevia increases from 10 in 1000 deliveries with one previous caesarean delivery to
28 in 1000 with three or more caesarean deliveries.24 A 2014 meta-analysis confirmed these findings and
reported an overall odds ratio (OR) of 1.47 (95% CI 1.44–1.51) for placenta praevia after caesarean
section.

Cohort studies have also reported that a second pregnancy within I year of a caesarean section is
associated with an increased risk of placenta praevia (RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9–3.1).26 Compared with vaginal Evidence
birth, a previous prelabour caesarean section is associated with an increased risk of placenta praevia in the

Evidence
There have been contradictory reports regarding the incidence of placenta praevia in multiple pregnancies.
A retrospective cohort study of 1 172 405 twin live births and stillbirths in the USA between 1989 and
1998 found no increased risk in twins. A retrospective cohort of 67 895 singleton and twin pregnancies level 2+
found that dichorionic (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.15-2.06) and monochorionic (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.32-8.21)
twin pregnancies have an increased risk of placenta praevia compared with singletons.
30,31
29
Evidence
ART is associated with a higher incidence of placenta praevia independent of the high rate of multiple
pregnancies generated by the technique used. A 2016 meta-analysis of ART singleton pregnancies
reported a RR of 3.71 (95% CI 2.67-5.16) for placenta praevia ³2 that was confirmed by a 2017 meta-
analysis (OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.01-3.34). Furthermore, a 2017 meta-analysis of the impact of maternal level 1+
smoking on placental position 34 (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.30–1.50) has found an increased risk of placenta
praevia.
33
Advanced maternal age has been also associated with a slight increase in the risk of placenta praevia | Evidence
(OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07–1.09) but this effect may be due to parity.³

Should we screen women for placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta, if so, at what
gestation and with what follow-up?
The midpregnancy routine fetal anomaly scan should include placental localisation thereby
identifying women at risk of persisting placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta. [New 2018]
The term placenta praevia should be used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os.
For pregnancies at more than 16 weeks of gestation the term low-lying placenta should be
used when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os on TAS or TVS.
[New 2018]

If the placenta is thought to be low lying (less than 20 mm from the internal os) or praevia
(covering the os) at the routine fetal anomaly scan, a follow-up ultrasound examination
including a TVS is recommended at 32 weeks of gestation to diagnose persistent low-lying
placenta and/or placenta praevia.
4-9
Placenta praevia is a well-established complication of pregnancy associated with high maternal and
perinatal complication rates." The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) does not recommend a
national screening program for placenta praevia, but it has supported current local practices of identifying
it at the routine midpregnancy (18+6 to 21 +6 weeks of gestation) antenatal screening ultrasound examination
in women whose placenta extends onto the internal cervical os (www.screening.nhs.uk/policies).36 An update
published in 2014 that included a literature search covering the period between January 2008 and
November 2012 concluded that this practice is not supported by new evidence, but that the placental site is
routinely reported at the time of the routine fetal anomaly scan. In turn, this routine study has become the
main screening test for placenta praevia. 37
Apparent placental ‘migration' following the development of the lower uterine segment during the third
trimester of pregnancy results in the resolution of the low-lying placenta in 90% of the cases before
term. This is less likely to occur in women with a previous caesarean delivery. 39
38-46
In twin pregnancies, the likelihood of persistence of placenta praevia is also dependent on the gestational
age at sonographic detection. Among those with placenta praevia diagnosed in the second trimester the
majority of cases resolve by 32 weeks of gestation. After 32 weeks of gestation around 50% of the
remaining placenta praevia will resolve, with no further changes after 36 weeks of gestation.29

The timing of a confirmatory ultrasound examination in the third trimester has varied between 32 and
36 weeks of gestation depending on the extent of the placenta praevia over the internal cervical os. It is
based on the perceived risk of antenatal haemorrhage, but there is no strong evidence that it makes a
difference in the care of asymptomatic women. 37 The timing of the follow-up ultrasound examination level 4
should also be tailored according to a previous history of caesarean delivery to exclude an associated
placenta accreta spectrum.
4.3 What is the role and what are the risks of TVS?
Clinicians should be aware that TVS for the diagnosis of placenta praevia or a low-lying
placenta is superior to transabdominal and transperineal approaches, and is safe. [New 2018]
In women with a persistent low-lying placenta or placenta praevia at 32 weeks of gestation
who remain asymptomatic, an additional TVS is recommended at around 36 weeks of gestation
to inform discussion about mode of delivery. [New 2018]

Cervical length measurement may help facilitate management decisions in asymptomatic
women with placenta praevia. A short cervical length on TVS before 34 weeks of gestation
increases the risk of preterm emergency delivery and massive haemorrhage at caesarean
section. [New 2018]

TVS improves the accuracy of placental localisation particularly when the placenta is posterior or if the | Evidence

If the distance between the internal os and the placental edge is 20 mm or more on TVS, the placental
location should be recorded as normal and managed as per routine. Studies have not demonstrated an
increased risk for caesarean section due to haemorrhage in these cases. By contrast, if the placenta
extends beyond the internal os on TVS during the second trimester, it is likely to be confirmed as
placenta praevia at 32 weeks of gestation." However, 'migration' is still possible after 32 weeks of
gestation.

TVS will reclassify 26-60% of placentas diagnosed as low lying at the routine fetal anomaly scan.
Overall, TVS has a high accuracy (positive predictive value of 93.3%, negative predictive value of 97.6% and
false-negative rate of 2.33%) in predicting placenta praevia in women suspected of having a low-lying
placenta on TAS in the second and early third trimester, with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of
98.8%.5
55
57-60
TVS has also been used to measure the cervical length to predict preterm birth 5 and cohort studies with
low risks of confounding bias have shown that cervical length is a predictor of antepartum bleeding and
emergency preterm caesarean section in placenta praevia." A prospective cohort study of 59 women
presenting with placenta praevia covering the internal os has shown that the best cut-off point for the
identification of women at risk of haemorrhage requiring a caesarean delivery before 34 weeks of
gestation is a cervical length of 31 mm or less (sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 76.6%). Women with
a cervical length of less than 31 mm have a 16 times (OR 16.4, 95% CI 3.4–75.9) higher risk of emergency
caesarean section due to massive haemorrhage. 57 Similarly, a prospective cohort study of 54 women with
placenta praevia covering the internal os has shown that combining a cervical length of less than 30 mm
and measurement of the lower placental edge thickness of more than 10 mm has a sensitivity of 83.3%
and a specificity of 78.4%.58 More prospective studies using a standardised ultrasound definition of
placental edge thickness are required before this sign can be used in clinical practice.
Compared with women with a long cervical length, women with a short cervical length (less than 25 mm)
have a RR of 7.2 (95% CI 2.3-22.3) for massive haemorrhage during caesarean section for placenta
praevia.59

Where should women with a low-lying placenta or placenta praevia be cared for in the third
trimester?
Women with recurrent bleeding (low-lying placenta or placenta praevia)
Tailor antenatal care, including hospitalisation, to individual woman's needs and social
circumstances, e.g. distance between home and hospital and availability of transportation,
previous bleeding episodes, haematology laboratory results, and acceptance of receiving donor
blood or blood products. [New 2018]
Where hospital admission has been decided, an assessment of risk factors for venous
thromboembolism in pregnancy should be performed as outlined in RCOG Green-top Guideline
No. 37a. This will need to balance the risk of developing a venous thromboembolism against
the risk of bleeding from a placenta praevia or low lying placenta.
It should be made clear to any woman being treated at home in the third trimester that she
should attend the hospital immediately if she experiences any bleeding, including spotting,
contractions or pain (including vague suprapubic period-like aches).
D
Evidence
The Cochrane systematic review by Nielson on the impact of an intervention in women diagnosed as
having, or being likely to have a placenta praevia, which has not been updated since October 2002,
includes only one small RCT (n = 53) comparing hospital versus home care for symptomatic placenta level |-
praevia.6 This trial found little evidence of any clear advantage or disadvantage to a policy of home versus
hospital care, and the only significant difference was a reduction in length of hospital stay.6
62
Two large retrospective studies of women presenting with placenta praevia at the routine fetal anomaly
scan have proposed scores to predict the risk of emergency caesarean section. The first study (n = 250)
found that the risk is increased if the first (sentinel) vaginal bleeding episode occurs before 29 weeks of
gestation (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.17–5.98), and with the occurrence of three or more episodes of antepartum
haemorrhage (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.1–5.86).63 The second (n = 214) found that independent predictors for
emergency delivery are a history of caesarean section (OR 4.7, 95 CI 1.2-12); antepartum haemorrhage
on one (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.5–23), two (OR 14, 95% CI 4.3–47), and three or more occasions (OR 27, Evidence
95% CI 8.3-90); and need for antenatal blood transfusion (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.7-23). 10 A retrospective level 2-
study of 214 women with singleton pregnancies found that the risk of preterm emergency caesarean
delivery increases with the number of antepartum bleeding episodes with one (OR 7.5, 95% C, 2.5–23),
two (OR 14, 95% CI 4.3–47), and three or more (OR 27, 95% CI 8.3–90), as well as need for blood
transfusion (OR 6.4, 95% C, 1.7-23). The results of these studies suggest that predictors for emergency
delivery in women with placenta praevia can be used for individualised antenatal care regarding need for
hospital admission, corticosteroid administration and timing of delivery.

4.4.2 Asymptomatic women (low-lying placenta or placenta praevia)
Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta in the third trimester
should be counselled about the risks of preterm delivery and obstetric haemorrhage, and their
care should be tailored to their individual needs.
Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia confirmed at the 32-week follow-up scan and
managed at home should be encouraged to ensure they have safety precautions in place,
including having someone available to help them as necessary and ready access to the hospital.
Evidence
Most women with asymptomatic placenta praevia (no bleeding or contractions) can be cared for as
outpatients with similar outcomes compared to hospitalisation, and at lower cost. 5 Numerous factors
influence the chances of low-lying placenta or placenta praevia persisting until delivery, such as prior level 4
caesarean section, the distance between the placental edge and the internal os, and the thickness of the
placental edge. These parameters can be useful in tailoring individual woman's needs.

4.5 Is there a place for cervical cerclage in women with placenta praevia or a low-lying
placenta?
The use of cervical cerclage to reduce bleeding and prolong pregnancy is not supported by
sufficient evidence to recommend its use outside of a clinical trial.
61
Evidence
The Cochrane systematic review by Nielson on the impact of cerclage in women diagnosed as having,
or being likely to have, placenta praevia included two small RCTs (n = 25 and 36) comparing cervical
cerclage versus no cerclage. There may be a reduction in preterm births before 34 weeks of gestation level 1-
(RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.87), but this evidence is not robust enough to recommend its use outside of
clinical trials.
There have been no new trials looking at this issue since the last update of this guideline.
4.6 In what circumstances, and at what gestation, should women be offered antenatal
corticosteroids?
A single course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended between 34 +0 and

and is appropriate prior to 34+0 weeks of gestation in women at higher risk of preterm birth.

A large case-control study found that neonatal morbidities in women with placenta praevia include an
increased risk of lower 5-minute Apgar scores, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, anaemia,
respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation and intraventricular haemorrhage.
There is no
evidence, however, that neonates born after pregnancies with placenta praevia are more likely to be small
for gestational age when compared to non-praevia controls.65
Compared with placebo or no treatment with antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone, dexamethasone
or hydrocortisone), antenatal corticosteroids are associated with a reduction in the most serious adverse
outcomes related to prematurity, including perinatal death (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.89), respiratory
distress syndrome (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56–0.77), intraventricular haemorrhage (average RR 0.55,

C
If delivery is indicated based on maternal or fetal concerns, tocolysis should not be used in an
attempt to prolong gestation. [New 2018]
C
A systematic review to determine if the prolonged (48 hours or more) use of tocolytics in women with
symptomatic preterm placenta praevia improves perinatal outcome identified two retrospective studies
(total, n = 217) and one RCT (n = 60).69 The results of the RCT showed that pregnancy can be prolonged Evidence

At what gestation should planned delivery occur?
Late preterm (34+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation) delivery should be considered for women
presenting with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta and a history of vaginal bleeding or
other associated risk factors for preterm delivery. [New 2018]
C
Delivery timing should be tailored according to antenatal symptoms and, for women presenting
with uncomplicated placenta praevia, delivery should be considered between 36 +0 and
37+0 weeks of gestation. [New 2018]
As the risk of major haemorrhage increases rapidly after 36 weeks of gestation, expert opinions have
highlighted that decisions regarding timing of delivery must be individualised and suggest that on the basis
of the limited data available, women with uncomplicated placenta praevia should undergo scheduled birth
by caesarean section between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation.

In what situations is vaginal delivery appropriate for women with a low-lying placenta?
In women with a third trimester asymptomatic low-lying placenta the mode of delivery should
be based on the clinical background, the woman's preferences, and supplemented by
ultrasound findings, including the distance between the placental edge and the fetal head
position relative to the leading edge of the placenta on TVS. [New 2018]
D
Evidence
Women presenting with a placental edge less than 20 mm from the internal os in the third trimester are
more likely to need delivery by caesarean section when the placental edge is thicker (over 10 mm) 75,76
and/or contains a sponge-like echo" or marginal ‘sinus'. 78 These additional ultrasound features are poorly
defined, not routinely assessed in UK practice and the success rates of vaginal delivery when the placental level 2-
edge is between 10 and 20 mm from the internal os vary widely (56% and 93%, respectively).
corresponding studies are small, observational and retrospective, making a recommendation for a specific
mode of delivery based on ultrasound findings difficult.

Optimising the delivery of women with placenta praevia
Prior to delivery, all women with placenta praevia and their partners should have a discussion
regarding delivery. Indications for blood transfusion and hysterectomy should be reviewed and
any plans to decline blood or blood products should be discussed openly and documented.
Placenta praevia and anterior low-lying placenta carry a higher risk of massive obstetric
haemorrhage and hysterectomy. Delivery should be arranged in a maternity unit with on-site
blood transfusion services and access to critical care.
D
Women with atypical antibodies form a particularly high-risk group and the care of these
women should involve discussions with the local haematologist and blood bank.
D
Prevention and treatment of anaemia during the antenatal period is recommended for women

Women having a caesarean section for placenta praevia are at increased risk of blood loss of more than
1000 ml compared with women having a caesarean section for other indications (RR 3.97, 95% CI 3.244.85).84
Women with anterior placenta are at increased risk of blood loss. Placenta praevia covering the internal
cervical os and anterior placentation are independent risk factors (OR 4.1 and OR 3.5, respectively) for
massive haemorrhage during caesarean section. A US case-control study from the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network Cesarean
Section Registry has shown that maternal haemorrhagic morbidity is more common in women with praevia
(19% versus 7%, adjusted RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9–3.5) and the main factors associated with maternal
haemorrhage include pre-delivery anaemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes and magnesium use.
87,88
86
The risk of massive haemorrhage together with the possibility of needing a blood transfusion has been
estimated to be approximately 12 times more likely in caesarean section for placenta praevia than in
caesarean delivery for other indications. Similarly to uncomplicated pregnancies, women with placenta
praevia should be screened for anaemia and investigated if their haemoglobin levels are outside the normal
UK range (110 g/l at first visit and 105 g/l at 28 weeks of gestation). 36 Iron supplementation should be
implemented if indicated.
For women at high risk of emergency transfusion, such as those presenting with placenta praevia and with
no clinically significant alloantibodies, it has been recommended that group and screen samples should be
sent once a week to exclude or identify any new antibody formation and to keep blood available if
necessary for delivery. However, this should be at the discretion of the team responsible and managed
according to local facilitites.88

What grade of obstetrician and anaesthetist should attend the caesarean delivery of a woman
with placenta praevia?
As a minimum requirement for a planned caesarean section for a woman with placenta
praevia, the surgical procedure should be carried out by an appropriately experienced operator.
[New 2018]
In cases of planned caesarean section for placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta, a senior

present within the delivery or theatre suite where the surgery is occurring.
When an emergency arises, the senior obstetrician and senior anaesthetist should be alerted
immediately and attend urgently.
89
Maternal complications at caesarean section increase when the primary surgeon is a trainee rather than an

What blood products should be available?
Close liaison with the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential for women presenting with
placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta. [New 2018]
Rapid infusion and fluid warming devices should be immediately available. [New 2018]
Cell salvage is recommended for women where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to
induce anaemia, in particular, in women who would decline blood products.
Red cells, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate are all kept by blood banks
supplying obstetric units. If the haemoglobin is less than 70 g/l in the postoperative period, where there is
no ongoing or threat of bleeding, the decision to transfuse should be made on an informed individual
basis. In an extreme situation and when the blood group is unknown, group O rhesus D-negative red
cells should be given.88 Further recommendations are provided in RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52
Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage.Ⓡ
88
87
There is no evidence to support the use of autologous blood transfusion for placenta praevia.89
Cell salvage was not often used previously in obstetrics because of the perceived risk of amniotic fluid

been reported so far and the risks of cell salvage in the obstetric population parallel those in the
nonpregnant population.”

In cases of anterior placenta praevia, cutting through the placenta is often associated with increased
maternal bleeding. A retrospective cohort study found that avoiding incision of the anterior placenta
praevia after 24 weeks of gestation reduces the need for maternal blood transfusion during or after
caesarean delivery."
95
A ‘J'-shaped uterine incision has been evaluated in women presenting with placenta praevia in a small
retrospective study and shown to decrease intraoperative blood loss and facilitate the delivery of the
fetus.⁹
Intrauterine balloon tamponade, different types of compression sutures and uterine artery occlusion
techniques have been increasingly used since the previous version of the guideline in women with placenta
praevia to control, reduce or stop intraoperative bleeding and PPH. Case series on the use of intrauterine
hydrostatic balloon catheters, including the Bakri balloon, 97-101 the BT-CathⓇ balloon
or the
Sengstaken-Blakemore tube," in women with placenta praevia have reported success in controlling PPH
ranging from 75% to 88%.
103
102
Factors associated with the failure of Bakri balloon tamponade for placenta praevia include prior caesarean
section, anterior placentation, thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy at the time of insertion, and a PPH
volume of more than 500 ml within the first I hour of placement."

Uterine compressive and endouterine sutures are well established techniques for the control of
haemorrhage following atonic PPH. The best known suture technique was described by B-Lynch in

caesarean deliveries and the incidence of placenta accreta spectrum (abnormally adherent and invasive

placenta accreta spectrum in a subsequent pregnancy ranges between 8.6 (95% CI 3.536-21.078)''' and
17.4 (95% CI 9.0–31.4) for two previous caesarean sections, and 55.9 (95% CI 25.0–110.3) for three or
more caesarean sections.

Placenta praevia is another important risk factor for placenta accreta spectrum (see Appendix II). A large
multicentre US cohort study noted that for women presenting with placenta praevia and prior caesarean
section the risk of accreta placentation is 3%, 11%, 40%, 61% and 67% for one, two, three, four, and five
or more caesarean deliveries, respectively."
.112 The national case-control study using the UK Obstetric
Surveillance System found that the incidence of placenta accreta spectrum increases from 1.7 per 10 000
women overall to 577 per 10 000 in women with both a previous caesarean section and placenta
praevia.

Other additional risk factors include maternal age

Placenta accreta spectrum is not exclusively a consequence of caesarean delivery. Other surgical trauma
to the integrity of the uterine endometrium and/or superficial myometrium, such as those following
uterine curettage, manual removal of the placenta, postpartum endometritis or myomectomy, has been
associated with accreta placentation in subsequent pregnancies. 1,12,13 Overall, the aOR for placenta
accreta spectrum after previous uterine surgery is 3.40 (95% CI 1.30–8.91).''

The development of placenta accreta spectrum has also been reported in women with no surgical history
but presenting with a uterine pathology, such as bicornuate uterus, adenomyosis, submucous fibroids and
myotonic dystrophy.

More recently, there has been an increase in reports describing implantation into deficient caesarean
section scars and mounting evidence that a caesarean scar pregnancy diagnosed in early pregnancy can
evolve into an abnormally adherent or invasive placenta in the second half of pregnancy.
A
caesarean scar pregnancy can be diagnosed using TVS from the second month of pregnancy using specific
ultrasound criteria. In the last decade, the number of reported cases of caesarean scar pregnancy Evidence
has increased due to improved awareness of the condition, widespread use of ultrasound scanning in early level 3
pregnancy and an increase in the number of prior caesarean sections. The outcome of caesarean scar
pregnancy depends on the amount of definitive placenta developing inside the scar and depth of villous
invasion. Further data are required to establish the relationship between a first trimester scar pregnancy
and the development of invasive placentation.
7.2 How can placenta accreta spectrum be suspected and diagnosed antenatally?
Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is crucial in planning its management and has
been shown to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. [New 2018]
Previous caesarean delivery and the presence of an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta
praevia should alert the antenatal care team of the higher risk of placenta accreta spectrum.
D

Maternal complications in placenta accreta spectrum are primarily the result of massive haemorrhage.5
Median estimated blood loss in cohorts of placenta accreta spectrum ranges from 2000 to 7800 ml and Evidence
the median number of units of blood transfused is 5 units. Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta
spectrum reduces maternal peripartum haemorrhage and morbidity.2
131
20,132-135
Population studies have shown that placenta accreta spectrum remains undiagnosed before delivery in
one-half 36 to two-thirds of cases. 120 In a series from specialist centres, approximately one-third of cases
of placenta accreta were not diagnosed during pregnancy."
137
21,22,135,138
Multidisciplinary management in a maternity unit with access to maternal and neonatal intensive care is
often required for women with placenta accreta spectrum.
For such care to be organised, the
diagnosis must be made antenatally.

Numerous ultrasound imaging techniques have been reported over the years, including greyscale imaging
and colour Doppler imaging (CDI), and/or three-dimensional power Doppler sonography.
2016, the European Working Group on Abnormally Invasive Placenta proposed a standardised description Evidence
of ultrasound signs (see Appendix III) used for the prenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta"
and the
International Abnormally Invasive Placenta Expert Group produced a proforma protocol for the
ultrasound assessment.
141
140
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 ultrasound studies including 3707 pregnancies at risk of
placenta accreta found that the overall performance of ultrasound when performed by skilled operators
was very good with a sensitivity of 90.72% (95% CI 87.2–93.6), specificity of 96.94% (95% CI 96.3–97.5)
and diagnostic OR of 98.59 (95%CI 48.8–199.0). Among the different ultrasound signs, abnormality of the
uterus-bladder interface had the best specificity of 99.75% (95% CI 99.5–99.9) for the prediction of
placenta accreta. Abnormal vasculature on CDI had the best predictive accuracy with a sensitivity of
90.74% (95% CI 85.2-94.7), specificity of 87.68% (95% CI 84.6-90.4) and diagnostic OR of 69.02
(95% CI 22.8-208.9). 14
142
A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis using the standardised ultrasound signs (see Appendix III) has
shown that in women presenting with placenta praevia and history of prior caesarean section, the
performance of ultrasound for the antenatal detection of placenta accreta spectrum is even higher with a
sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI 93.0–99.0), specificity of 97.0% (95% CI 97.0–98.0) and diagnostic OR of
228.5 (95% CI 67.2-776.9) in prospective studies. 143 Placental lacunae give the placenta a 'moth-eaten'
appearance on greyscale imaging and the increased vascularity of the placental bed with large feeder
vessels entering the lacunae are the most common ultrasound signs associated with placenta accreta
spectrum.

Determining the depth and lateral extension of placental invasion is helpful for planning the individual care
of women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum.
No ultrasound sign or a combination of
ultrasound signs have so far been found to be specific to the depth of placenta accreta spectrum to
provide an accurate differential diagnosis between adherent and invasive accreta placentation. This may
be due to the wide heterogeneity in terminology used to describe the grades of placenta accreta
spectrum, differences in study design with most studies not reporting detailed data on clinical diagnosis at
birth and/or on histopathology examination, and many studies having included cases of placental retention
in their cohort with no evidence of abnormal villous adherence or invasion.
As the vast majority of placenta accreta spectrum are now the consequence of low placentation into a
previous caesarean section scar, TVS has an important role in the early diagnosis, follow-up, differential
diagnosis between adherent and invasive accreta placentation, and management of placenta accreta
spectrum.

7.2.2 Is there a role for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum?
Clinicians should be aware that the diagnostic value of MRI and ultrasound imaging in detecting
placenta accreta spectrum is similar when performed by experts. [New 2018]
MRI may be used to complement ultrasound imaging to assess the depth of invasion and
lateral extension of myometrial invasion, especially with posterior placentation and/or in
women with ultrasound signs suggesting parametrial invasion.
C
145-149
MRI has been increasingly used for the prenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta.
The main MRI
features of placenta accreta include abnormal uterine bulging, dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted
imaging, heterogeneous signal intensity within the placenta, disorganised vasculature of placenta and
disruption of the uteroplacental zone. A systematic review has found that most studies are of a small
sample size and thus, sensitivity and specificity of MRI in diagnosing placenta accreta varies widely between
75% and 100%, and 65% and 100%, respectively."
148
Evidence
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that the diagnostic value of ultrasound imaging and level 2++
MRI in detecting placenta accreta spectrum is similar. The first review 147 included 13 studies and reported
a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 77-88), specificity of 95% (95% CI 93–96) and detection OR of 63.41
(95% CI 29.04-138.48) for ultrasound, compared with a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 72-90), specificity of
88% (95% CI 81-94) and detection OR of 22.95 (95% CI 3.19-165.11) for MRI. The second review
(2014)148
included 18 studies and found that the overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI has a sensitivity
of 94.4% (95% CI 86.0–97.9), specificity of 84.0% (95% CI 76.0–89.8) and diagnostic OR of 89.0
(95% CI 22.8-348.1). The latter review also found that MRI has high predictive accuracy in assessing both
the depth and topography of placental invasion.
The use of intravenous gadolinium injection may increase the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in the
149
diagnosis of the invasive forms of placenta accreta spectrum but the evidence on long-term fetal safety is Evidence
limited. Furthermore, the experience of the radiologists remains an independent factor in the diagnostic level 4
accuracy of MRI.
7.3 Where should women with placenta accreta spectrum be cared for?
Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum should be cared for by a multidisciplinary
team in a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and managing invasive placentation.

More data have become available since the last version of this guideline on the specific management of
placenta accreta spectrum. Overall, women with accreta placentation should be cared for according to the
risks of severe maternal bleeding and premature delivery. Placenta percreta can be associated with major
prenatal complications from early in pregnancy, such as uterine rupture'
150-152 and bladder involvement
with associated life-threatening haemorrhage. 153-155
A 2015 expert review has suggested that caesarean delivery of women at high risk and/or diagnosed
prenatally with placenta accreta spectrum, in particular its invasive forms, should occur in a specialist
centre with multidisciplinary expertise and experience in managing complex pelvic surgery, and with
access to an adult intensive care unit and NICU. 135
20
A retrospective cohort study of 77 women with suspected placenta accreta found that women who
delivered prior to a planned delivery date were significantly more likely to have had vaginal bleeding and
uterine activity when compared with women who had a scheduled delivery. Each episode of antenatal
vaginal bleeding is associated with an increased risk of unscheduled delivery (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8-7.8) and
the risk increases when associated with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.

Considering the higher frequency of placenta praevia in the accreta group,
143,156 these results are likely to
be influenced by the perinatal complications of placenta praevia. Surveys of healthcare providers in the US

accreta spectrum. Similarly, a recent online survey completed by members of the expert panel for
the perinatal management of placenta accreta spectrum disorders for the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has found wide variation in global practices.

There is increasing evidence from retrospective cohort studies from the USA that women with placenta
accreta spectrum diagnosed prenatally, cared for by a specialist multidisciplinary team, are less likely to
require large volume blood transfusion and reoperation within 7 days of delivery for bleeding complications
compared with women cared for by non-multidisciplinary standard obstetric care without a specific
protocol.2
Women admitted at 34 weeks of gestation and delivered between 34 and
35 weeks of gestation by a specialist multidisciplinary team have a significantly lower emergency surgery Evidence
rate than those not cared for by such a team (23% versus 64%; P = 0.001) despite a similar median | level 2-
gestational age at delivery [34 (16–39) weeks versus 34 (19-40) weeks; P = 0.50, respectively].2 In addition,
maternal outcomes are improved over time with increasing experience within a well-established
multidisciplinary team performing two to three cases per month.22 Very few of these studies provide data
on the differential clinical diagnosis between abnormally adherent and abnormally invasive accreta, or
detailed pathologic confirmation of the depth and lateral extension of villous myometrial invasion.
21
7.4 When should delivery be planned for women with placenta accreta spectrum?
In the absence of risk factors for preterm delivery in women with placenta accreta spectrum,
planned delivery at 35+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation provides the best balance between fetal
maturity and the risk of unscheduled delivery. [New 2018]

Similarly to placenta praevia, clinical factors should be considered when determining the timing of
administration of antenatal corticosteroids and the optimal gestational age for delivery in women with
placental accreta. There are currently no RCTs or well-controlled observational studies to guide
164,165
best practice in delivery timing of placenta accreta spectrum.
164,166
In cases of suspected placenta accreta spectrum, where significant blood loss and caesarean hysterectomy
is anticipated, delivery at between 34 and 35 weeks of gestation has been proposed in order to avoid
emergency delivery, which still occurs about 20% of the time even in scheduled cases. A 2010
decision analysis supports this approach based on the increasing likelihood of emergency delivery as
pregnancy goes beyond 34 weeks of gestation.'
167
Evidence
level 4
Evidence
The data of three recent single institution retrospective cohort studies of women with prior caesarean
delivery diagnosed prenatally with placenta accreta have indicated that in the absence of risk factors for
preterm delivery, it is safe to plan the delivery at 36 weeks of gestation. The first study included 103 women
delivered between 1982 and 2002 and found that the mean gestational age at delivery is 33+5 weeks of
gestation in cases of deep placental invasion (increta and percreta) compared with 35+2 weeks of gestation in
the superficial adherent group." The second study of 216 women found that urgent delivery for bleeding level 2+
decreased significantly with advancing gestation. 169 Most women were delivered at 36 weeks of gestation or
greater, with nearly 90% in the absence of bleeding complications. The third study of 84 women who had
reached 34+0 weeks of gestation with a suspected praevia accreta found that those with no risk factors for
preterm birth are at low risk for an unscheduled delivery prior to 36 weeks of gestation.
168

8.
Planning delivery of women with suspected placenta accreta spectrum
Once the diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is made, a contingency plan for emergency
delivery should be developed in partnership with the woman, including the use of an
institutional protocol for the management of maternal haemorrhage. [New 2018]
Due to a lack of RCTs or well-controlled observational studies, the optimal management of placenta accreta
spectrum remains undefined and is determined by the expertise available, the depth and lateral extension of the
accreta portion of the placenta, the presence of an associated placenta praevia, radiological findings, the medical and
surgical comorbidities, and finally, the accessibility of a regional team focused on these patients.
Evidence
The main risk associated with the delivery of placenta accreta spectrum is massive haemorrhage and its
associated complications, such as coagulopathy, multisystem organ failure and death. Many women with
placenta accreta spectrum require massive blood transfusion (8 units or more) and their median platelet level 2+
count is lowest compared with other causes of massive PPH. 171,172
A review of 34 studies published between 1977 and 2012, including a total number of 508 617 deliveries
and 865 cases of confirmed placenta accreta, found that the most significant maternal risks associated with
delivery are the need for postpartum transfusion due to haemorrhage and peripartum hysterectomy.
Maternal mortality remains rare, but significantly higher than among matched postpartum controls.
Transfusions in placenta accreta spectrum should be guided by a national and/or institutional protocol for
the management of PPH.8

What should be included in the consent form for caesarean section in women with suspected
placenta accreta spectrum?
Any woman giving consent for caesarean section should understand the risks associated with
caesarean section in general, and the specific risks of placenta accreta spectrum in terms of
massive obstetric haemorrhage, increased risk of lower urinary tract damage, the need for
blood transfusion and the risk of hysterectomy.
Additional possible interventions in the case of massive haemorrhage should also be discussed,
including cell salvage and interventional radiology where available. [New 2018]
D
Any woman with suspected placenta accreta spectrum should meet with a senior obstetrician in the
antenatal period. The different risks and treatment options should have been discussed and a plan agreed,
which should be reflected clearly in the consent form and medical record. This should include standard
discussion for the caesarean section procedure³³ and whether conservative management of the placenta
or proceeding straight to hysterectomy is preferred in the situation where increta or percreta is
confirmed at surgery.
83
Where available, cell salvage should be considered. If the woman refuses donor blood transfusion, it is
recommended 88 that she be transferred to a unit with a cell saver.
8.2
What healthcare professionals should be involved?
The elective delivery of women with placenta accreta spectrum should be managed by a
multidisciplinary team, which should include senior anaesthetists, obstetricians and gynaecologists
with appropriate experience in managing the condition and other surgical specialties if indicated. In
an emergency, the most senior clinicians available should be involved.

Following the previous version of the guideline, the National Patient Safety Agency in collaboration with
the RCOG and the Royal College of Midwives set up an expert working group to develop a care bundle
for placenta accreta. Six elements of good care were agreed upon. The care bundle was then tested in
six units over a 5-month pilot study period and it was found to be both achievable and practical. Clinical
outcomes were monitored, confirming the high morbidity associated with this condition.

Consultant anaesthetist planning and directly supervising anaesthesia at delivery.
• Blood and blood products available.
•
Multidisciplinary involvement in preoperative planning.

The 2015 MBRRACE report from the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK has indicated
that despite increasing numbers of women at risk from placenta accreta spectrum following previous
caesarean section, only one death occurred in a woman who had a placenta praevia percreta and history Evidence
of two previous caesarean sections. There were no deaths from unexpected placenta accreta found at
caesarean section, suggesting that previous recommendations regarding imaging and preparations for
women with placenta praevia and a previous caesarean section have been followed. 175
174
A 2015 single centre retrospective cohort study of the effectiveness of a standardised operative approach
level 2++
in 98 cases of histologically confirmed placenta accreta supports the early presence of a gynaecological Evidence
surgeon and oncologist at delivery and demonstrates that a 'call if needed' approach is not acceptable for level 2+
these complex cases.
176
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines highlight that to enhance
patient safety, it is important that the delivery be performed by an experienced obstetric team that
includes an obstetric surgeon, with other surgical specialists, such as urologists, general surgeons, and
gynaecological surgeons and oncologists, available if necessary.
165
8.3 What anaesthetic is most appropriate for delivery?
The choice of anaesthetic technique for caesarean section for women with placenta accreta
spectrum should be made by the anaesthetist conducting the procedure in consultation with
the woman prior to surgery.
The woman should be informed that the surgical procedure can be performed safely with
regional anaesthesia but should be advised that it may be necessary to convert to general
anaesthesia if required and asked to consent to this. [New 2018]

Optimising the delivery of women with placenta accreta spectrum
Evidence
There are no RCTs comparing different surgical approaches for placenta accreta spectrum suspected
antenatally. Both conservative and radical surgical approaches can be associated with a high maternal morbidity level 4
although the value of an experienced team in a specialist centre decreases the risk significantly.2
,21,22,135,138,162,163
8.4.1 What surgical approach should be used for women with placenta accreta spectrum?
Caesarean section hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ is preferable to attempting to
separate it from the uterine wall.
When the extent of the placenta accreta is limited in depth and surface area, and the entire
placental implantation area is accessible and visualised (i.e. completely anterior, fundal or
posterior without deep pelvic invasion), uterus preserving surgery may be appropriate, including
partial myometrial resection. [New 2018]
Uterus preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by surgeons working in teams
with appropriate expertise to manage such cases and after appropriate counselling regarding
risks and with informed consent. [New 2018]
C
D
There are currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of ureteric stents in
placenta accreta spectrum. The use of stents may have a role when the urinary bladder is
invaded by placental tissue (see section 8.4.2). [New 2018]
C
The choice of surgical technique will depend on the position of the placenta, the depth of invasion, and
the parametrial extension of the placenta accreta spectrum as assessed by ultrasound and/or MRI before
delivery, the visual assessment of the uterus at the time of surgery and the presenting clinical symptoms,
i.e. bleeding or no bleeding.5
165
The ACOG recommends planned, preterm caesarean section hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ
as removal of a placenta accreta spectrum is associated with significant haemorrhagic morbidity. In
cases of high suspicion for accreta during caesarean delivery, the majority of members of the US Society
of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and FIGO expert panel proceed with hysterectomy."
157-161
Similarly, in a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnosis and outcome of placenta accreta,
an elective or emergency caesarean hysterectomy was performed in 208 out of 232 (89.7%) cases.

increase operative time or complication rates.

Evidence
A small cohort study has shown that the introduction of the Triple-P procedure [perioperative placental
localisation, pelvic devascularisation and placental non-separation] involving delivery of the fetus via
transverse uterine incision above the upper border of the placenta, myometrial excision and
reconstruction of the uterine wall reduces the rate of hysterectomy, PPH and duration of hospital stay in
women with placenta accreta. The incidence of postoperative complications of the Triple-P procedure level 3
depends on comorbidities and in particular, the placental position and the depth of villous invasion.
Small case series have also reported on the successful use of compression sutures and on using the cervix
as a natural tamponade by inverting it into the uterine cavity, and suturing the anterior and/or the
posterior cervical lips into the anterior and/or posterior walls of the lower uterine segment."
184-187
183
A systematic review of peripartum surgical techniques used in placenta accreta spectrum has found that
methotrexate (MTX) and uterus preserving surgical techniques are associated with a 16% unintentional
urinary tract injury rate as opposed to 57% for standard hysterectomy and that use of ureteric stents
reduces the risk of urologic injury."
188

There are no RCTs on the use of ureteric stents in placenta accreta spectrum. Ureteric stents or
catheters are more commonly used preoperatively in the USA where around 26% of the members of Evidence

What surgical approach should be used for women with placenta percreta?
There is limited evidence to support uterus preserving surgery in placenta percreta and women
should be informed of the high risk of peripartum and secondary complications, including the
need for secondary hysterectomy. [New 2018]
The following four approaches have been described.
136,158-160, 164, 166, 189
I. Primary hysterectomy following delivery of the fetus, without attempting placental separation.
D
2. Delivery of the fetus avoiding the placenta, with repair of the incision leaving the placenta in situ (see
section 8.5).

3. Delivery of the fetus without disturbing the placenta, followed by partial excision of the uterine wall (placental
implantation site) and repair of the uterus.
4. Delivery of the fetus without disturbing the placenta, and leaving it in situ, followed by elective secondary
hysterectomy 3-7 days following the primary procedure.
There are no well-controlled observational studies, and therefore, no firm recommendations can be made.
189
Women with placenta percreta are more likely to require additional blood products and intensive care
admission than women with placenta creta or increta. The incidence of urological complications is also
increased, including cystotomy and ureteric injury.
190
level 4
When the urinary bladder is invaded by placental tissue, preoperative cystoscopy and the placement of Evidence
ureteric stents have been recommended. Planned cystotomy can prevent extensive muscularis
damage and bleeding from attempts at dissection.
160,191

Filling the bladder to identify the bladder separation site, opening the bladder to identify percreta villous

Uterus preserving surgery is possible in placenta percreta as demonstrated in a cohort study of
71 women. A multidisciplinary stepwise surgical approach, including bilateral ligations of the anterior
division of the iliac arteries before removing the placenta, was shown to be successful in controlling the
bleeding and preserving the woman's uterus in around 90% of the cases, with 14% of urinary tract
complications, most of which can be identified and repaired during caesarean section.'

Evidence
A review of 119 placenta percreta cases published in the international literature has shown that expectant
management with the placenta left in situ is associated with severe long-term complications of
haemorrhage and infections, including a 58% risk of secondary hysterectomy up to 9 months after the
birth. Local resection appears to be associated with fewer complications within 24 hours postoperatively level 4
compared with hysterectomy or leaving the placenta in situ. However, a selection bias in the direction of
less severe cases for the local resection technique may in part explain the lower complication rates with
that approach.

8.5 Expectant management (leaving the placenta in situ)
Elective peripartum hysterectomy may be unacceptable to women desiring uterine preservation
or considered inappropriate by the surgical team. In such cases, leaving the placenta in situ
should be considered. [New 2018]

When the placenta is left in situ, local arrangements need to be made to ensure regular
review, ultrasound examination and access to emergency care should the woman experience
complications, such as bleeding or infection. [New 2018]

MTX adjuvant therapy should not be used for expectant management as it is of unproven
benefit and has significant adverse effects. [New 2018]

Conservative management in placenta accreta spectrum, including in cases of placenta increta and
percreta, is an option for women who desire to preserve their fertility. However, it is not recommended Evidence
in women presenting with major bleeding as it is unlikely to be successful and risks delaying definitive
treatment and increasing morbidity.

A retrospective multicentre study examined 167 women treated conservatively for placenta accreta in
tertiary university hospital centres in France between 1993 and 2007. Conservative expectant
management with part of the placenta left in situ was successful in 131 out of 167 cases (78.4%; Evidence
95% CI 71.4-84.4).' One woman died of myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity related to MTX level 2+
administration through the umbilical cord. Spontaneous placental resorption occurred in 87 out of 116
cases (75.0%; 95% CI 66.1-82.6), with a median delay from delivery of 13.5 weeks (range 4–60 weeks). 19

Women should be warned of the risks of chronic bleeding, sepsis, septic shock, peritonitis, uterine
necrosis, fistula, injury to adjacent organs, acute pulmonary oedema, acute renal failure, deep venous
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic antibiotics may be helpful in the immediate
postpartum period to reduce the risk of infective complications.

196
An observational case series, including 24 women with placenta accreta left in situ after delivery and
treated with MTX, reported placental delivery in 33.3% of the cases (spontaneously in 55%, and in 45%
following dilatation and surgical evacuation). There was no control group of women who did not
receive MTX and so it is unknown whether or not the MTX was clinically helpful. One woman did suffer
liver damage and the risks of this therapy must be balanced against the unproven benefit.
The pattern of follow-up for the conservative management of placenta accreta spectrum is not supported
by RCTs and is not stratified according to the depth and lateral extension of villous myometrial invasion.
Some authors have reported cases where retained villous tissues have been removed after conservative
management using hysteroscopic resection 198,199 or high-intensity focused ultrasound. 200 In rare cases, a
disseminated intravascular coagulation may develop requiring a secondary hysterectomy.?

When is interventional radiology indicated?
Larger studies are necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of interventional radiology

Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum who decline donor blood transfusion should
be cared for in a unit with an interventional radiology service.

Since the publication of the last version of this guideline there have been several cohort studies describing
the use of interventional radiology in assisting surgical and conservative management of placenta accreta with
variable success. The main aim of this procedure is to reduce the risks of intraoperative haemorrhage during
the caesarean delivery of pregnancies diagnosed antenatally with placenta accreta spectrum. Various
combinations have been proposed, including intraoperative internal iliac artery and/or postoperative uterine
artery embolisation
and internal iliac artery
or abdominal balloon occlusion.
The latter
technique has been increasingly used in China. However, the methodology of these studies is very
heterogeneous with no data on the diagnosis of the different grades of villous invasion and variable
confounding factors, such as placental position and number of previous caesarean deliveries. Small cohort
studies have also been published on the use of a tourniquet and of surgical artery ligation.

A single institution observational cohort study of 45 cases of placenta accreta describes the use of
prophylactic lower abdominal aorta balloon occlusion and found a reduced need for blood transfusion.²
One of the cases was complicated by lower extremity arterial thrombosis and another by ischaemic injury Evidence
to the femoral nerve. A comparative study of abdominal aortic occlusion versus internal iliac level 2-
artery occlusion found that aortic balloon occlusion resulted in better clinical outcomes with less blood
loss, blood transfusion, balloon insertion time, fluoroscopy time and fetal radiation dose.2
212
A systematic review reported success rates of 159/177 (89.8%) for arterial embolisation, with secondary
hysterectomy being necessary in 20/177 (11.3%) and subsequent menstruation occurring in 74/85 (87.1%). In Evidence
3/10 women (30%) a subsequent pregnancy occurred. Arterial balloon occlusion catheters have been
associated with a success rate of 33/42 (78.6%) and the need for a secondary hysterectomy in 8/42 (19%). 181
The value of prophylactic placement of balloon catheters in the iliac arteries in cases of placenta accreta
has been more controversial. This is mainly because of the higher risks of complications than
embolisation, including iliac artery thrombus or rupture, and ischaemic nerve injury. 216-219

Evidence
A small RCT of women presenting with a prenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta was published in 2015.2
The women were randomised to either preoperative prophylactic balloon catheters (n = 13) or to a
control group (n = 14). No difference was observed for the number of women with blood loss greater
than 2500 ml, number of plasma products transfused, duration of surgery, peripartum complications and level 1+
hospitalisation length. Reversible adverse effects related to prophylactic balloon catheter insertion were
noted in 2/13 (15.4%) cases.
8.7
How are women with undiagnosed or unsuspected placenta accreta spectrum best managed
at delivery?
If at the time of an elective repeat caesarean section, where both mother and baby are stable,
it is immediately apparent that placenta percreta is present on opening the abdomen, the
caesarean section should be delayed until the appropriate staff and resources have been
assembled and adequate blood products are available. This may involve closure of the maternal
abdomen and urgent transfer to a specialist unit for delivery. [New 2018]
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126
e35 of e48
© 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
In case of unsuspected placenta accreta spectrum diagnosed after the birth of the baby, the
placenta should be left in situ and an emergency hysterectomy performed. [New 2018]
If the placenta fails to separate with the usual measures, leaving it in place and closing, or leaving it in
place, closing the uterus and proceeding to a hysterectomy are both associated with less blood loss than
trying to separate it. Attempts at removing placenta accreta at caesarean section can lead to massive
haemorrhage, high maternal morbidity and possible maternal death. These risks are particularly high when
the caesarean section takes place in an environment with no emergency access to blood bank products
and expertise in managing placenta accreta.

Clinical governance
9.1
Debriefing
Postnatal follow-up should include debriefing with an explanation of what happened, why it happened and any
implications for future pregnancy or fertility. In particular, women where conservative treatment of placenta accreta
spectrum has been successful should be informed of the risk of recurrence.
9.2
Training
Raising the awareness about the clinical risk factors of placenta accreta spectrum should be pursued locally, including
organising policies or guidelines for flagging up women at risk and arranging for them to see a specialist consultant
when suspected.
There should be appropriate training for ultrasound staff in the antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum.
9.3
Clinical incident reporting
Any lack of compliance with the care bundle by the clinical team for a woman with either placenta praevia or accreta
should be investigated.
There should be written protocols for the identification of and planning further care of women suspected to have
placenta accreta spectrum.
10.
Recommendations for future research
A large prospective study comparing the impact on the management of the use of the 'low-lying placenta or
placenta praevia' classification with the traditional classification grades of I-IV at different gestations is
needed.
Prospective studies are needed to assess the role of third trimester ultrasound in evaluating the risks of haemorrhage
and emergency caesarean section in low-lying placenta and determining the mode of delivery.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 126

. Large prospective population-based studies are needed to assess whether ultrasound is a cost-effective
screening tool for placenta accreta spectrum in women with a history of caesarean section(s) presenting with a
low-lying placenta or placenta praevia in the second trimester of pregnancy.
• Prospective comparative studies of ultrasound imaging, including transvaginal ultrasound and MRI, are needed to
evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for evaluation of the depth and topography of villous invasion in adjacent
organs.
• RCTs of optimal timing of delivery for both conditions (placenta praevia and placenta accreta) are needed.
RCTs of surgical and nonsurgical management strategies for placenta accreta spectrum (including interventional
radiology) and comparing conventional versus conservative management, stratified according to the depth and
lateral extension of villous myometrial invasion, are needed.
• Future studies on the diagnosis and management of placenta accreta spectrum should use a standardised
evidence-based approach, including systematic correlation between ultrasound signs and detailed clinical
diagnosis at delivery, and pathologic confirmation of grades of villous invasiveness where possible.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be
evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations
in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into
routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classification of evidence levels
1++ High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews
of randomised controlled trials or randomised
controlled trials with a very low risk of bias
Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic
reviews of randomised controlled trials or
randomised controlled trials with a low risk
of bias
|+
Grades of recommendation
A

B
2++ High-quality systematic reviews of case-control
or cohort studies or high-quality case-control
or cohort studies with a very low risk of
confounding, bias or chance and a high
probability that the relationship is causal
2+
Well-conducted case-control or cohort
studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or
chance and a moderate probability that the
relationship is causal
2-
Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk
of confounding, bias or chance and a significant
risk that the relationship is not causal
Non-analytical studies, e.g. case reports, case
C
At least one meta-analysis, systematic review or
RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the
target population; or
A systematic review of RCTs or a body of
evidence consisting principally of studies rated as
I+, directly applicable to the target population
and demonstrating overall consistency of results
A body of evidence including studies rated as 2++
directly applicable to the target population, and
demonstrating overall consistency of results; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++
or I+
A body of evidence including studies
rated as 2+ directly applicable to the target

Description
Loss or irregularity of the hypoechoic plane in the myometrium underneath
the placental bed (the 'clear zone').
Presence of numerous lacunae, including some that are large and irregular
(Finberg grade 3), often containing turbulent flow visible in greyscale
imaging.
Loss or interruption of the bright bladder wall (the hyperechoic band or
'line' between the uterine serosa and the bladder lumen).
Thinning of the myometrium overlying the placenta to less than 1 mm or
undetectable.
Deviation of the uterine serosa away from the expected plane, caused by an
abnormal bulge of placental tissue into a neighboring organ, typically the
bladder. The uterine serosa appears intact but the outline shape is distorted.
Placental tissue seen breaking through the uterine serosa and extending
beyond it. Most often seen inside a filled urinary bladder.
Striking amount of colour Doppler signal seen between the myometrium
and the posterior wall of the bladder. This sign probably indicates numerous,
closely packed, tortuous vessels in that region (demonstrating
multidirectional flow and aliasing artifact).
Striking amount of colour Doppler signal seen in the placental bed. This sign
probably indicates numerous, closely packed, tortuous vessels in that region
(demonstrating multidirectional flow and aliasing artifact).
Vessels appearing to extend from the placenta, across the myometrium and
beyond the serosa into the bladder or other organs. Often running
perpendicular to the myometrium.
Placental lacunae feeder vessels Vessels with high velocity blood flow leading from the myometrium into the
placental lacunae, causing turbulence upon entry.
3D colour Doppler signs
Intraplacental hypervascularity
(power Doppler)
Complex, irregular arrangement of numerous placental vessels, exhibiting
tortuous courses and varying calibers.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
