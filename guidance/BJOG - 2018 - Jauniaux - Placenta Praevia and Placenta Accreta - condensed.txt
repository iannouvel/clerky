- Transvaginal scanning is superior for diagnosis.
- Cervical length measurement may help in management decisions.
- Tailor antenatal care based on individual needs.
- Women should be educated on symptoms and when to seek medical help.
- No evidence supports the use of cervical cerclage.
- Antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended in certain cases.
- Tocolysis may be considered for 48 hours in certain situations.
- Delivery timing should be based on symptoms and risks.
- Vaginal delivery may be appropriate in certain cases.

Optimizing the delivery of women with placenta praevia
- Discussion regarding delivery should occur before delivery.
- Delivery should occur in a unit with blood transfusion services and critical care.
- Atypical antibodies increase risk and should involve discussions with hematologist.
- Prevention and treatment of anemia is recommended.

Delivery for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
- Experienced obstetrician and anaesthetist should be present for caesarean delivery.
- Regional anesthesia is preferred.
- Close liaison with transfusion laboratory is essential.
- Consider vertical incisions to avoid placenta.
- Hysterectomy may be necessary in certain cases.

Antenatal diagnosis and outcome of women with placenta accreta spectrum
- Major risk factors include previous accreta, caesarean delivery, and uterine surgery.
- Antenatal diagnosis is crucial for management.
- Ultrasound imaging is accurate and should be performed by a skilled operator.
- MRI may complement ultrasound imaging.
- Women with suspected accreta should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team.
- Planned delivery at 35+0 to 36+6 weeks is recommended.

Optimizing the delivery of women with placenta accreta spectrum
- Contingency plan for emergency delivery should be developed.
- Consent form should include specific risks associated with accreta.
- Elective delivery should be managed by a multidisciplinary team.
- Choice of anesthesia should be made in consultation with the woman.
- Caesarean section hysterectomy is preferable in certain cases.

Uterus preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by surgeons working in teams with appropriate expertise and after counseling regarding risks. There are currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of ureteric stents in placenta accreta spectrum. Limited evidence supports uterus preserving surgery in placenta percreta, with a high risk of complications. Leaving the placenta in situ may be considered if hysterectomy is not an option. Regular monitoring and access to emergency care are necessary if the placenta is left in situ. Methotrexate adjuvant therapy should not be used. Interventional radiology should only be considered after larger studies determine safety and efficacy. Women with placenta accreta spectrum who decline blood transfusion should be in a unit with interventional radiology. In cases of undiagnosed placenta accreta spectrum, emergency hysterectomy may be necessary if placenta is left in situ. At delivery, delay caesarean section if placenta percreta is discovered and transfer to a specialist unit for delivery. Placenta praevia and accreta are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, with increasing incidence due to caesarean deliveries, maternal age, and assisted reproductive technology. Placenta praevia is diagnosed through ultrasound examination, with risk factors including caesarean delivery, ART, and maternal smoking. Screening for placenta praevia should be done at midpregnancy and follow-up ultrasounds are recommended. Apparent placental 'migration' can resolve low-lying placenta before term in most cases.

Timing of ultrasound examinations in the third trimester should be tailored based on the extent of placenta praevia and previous history of caesarean delivery. Transvaginal ultrasound is recommended for diagnosis and management, especially in cases of persistent low-lying placenta. Cervical length measurement can help predict preterm delivery and massive hemorrhage. Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia can be managed as outpatients with similar outcomes compared to hospitalization. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended between 34+0 and 35+6 weeks of gestation to reduce adverse outcomes related to prematurity. Tocolysis may be considered for 48 hours to facilitate corticosteroid administration in symptomatic cases, but should not be used to prolong gestation if delivery is indicated. Planned delivery should be considered between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation for women with uncomplicated placenta praevia, as the risk of major hemorrhage increases rapidly after 36 weeks.

Women with a low-lying placenta should consider mode of delivery based on clinical background, ultrasound findings, and distance between placental edge and fetal head position. Women with anterior placenta praevia are at higher risk for massive obstetric hemorrhage and hysterectomy. Delivery should be arranged in a unit with blood transfusion services. Women with placenta praevia are at increased risk of blood loss during cesarean section. Regional anesthesia is preferred over general anesthesia for cesarean delivery in these cases. Close liaison with the hospital transfusion lab is essential. Consider vertical incisions when fetus is in transverse lie to avoid placenta. Placenta accreta spectrum risk factors include previous caesarean delivery, uterine surgery, and placenta praevia. Other risk factors include maternal age and ART. Placenta accreta spectrum can also occur in women with uterine pathologies. Caesarean scar pregnancies can lead to invasive placenta.

The number of reported cases of caesarean scar pregnancy has increased in the last decade, with outcomes dependent on placental development and invasion depth. Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is crucial for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in cases of massive haemorrhage. Ultrasound imaging is accurate in diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum, and MRI may be used to complement ultrasound findings. Women with placenta accreta spectrum should be cared for in specialist centers with expertise in managing invasive placentation. Delivery for these women should take place in centers with immediate access to blood products and intensive care. Planning delivery at 35+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation is recommended, with a contingency plan for emergency delivery. Consent for caesarean section should include risks of massive obstetric hemorrhage, urinary tract damage, blood transfusion, and hysterectomy.

Women with suspected placenta accreta spectrum should meet with a senior obstetrician in the antenatal period to discuss risks and treatment options. A multidisciplinary team should manage the delivery, including senior anaesthetists, obstetricians, and gynaecologists. The ACOG guidelines recommend experienced obstetric teams for delivery. The choice of anaesthetic technique should be made in consultation with the woman. Caesarean section hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ is preferable, and uterus-preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by experienced surgeons. Leaving the placenta in situ may be considered for women desiring uterine preservation. Interventional radiology may be used to assist in management, but further studies are needed to determine its safety and efficacy.

Diagnosis of different grades of villous invasion and confounding factors such as placental position and previous caesarean deliveries. Studies on the use of a tourniquet and surgical artery ligation have been published. A study on placenta accreta found reduced blood transfusion need with lower abdominal aorta balloon occlusion. Prophylactic placement of balloon catheters in iliac arteries for placenta accreta is controversial due to higher risks of complications. In cases of undiagnosed placenta accreta spectrum at delivery, immediate action should be taken to ensure appropriate staff and resources are available. Leaving the placenta in situ and performing an emergency hysterectomy is recommended if placenta accreta is diagnosed after birth. Attempts to remove placenta accreta at caesarean section can lead to high maternal morbidity and possible death. Postnatal debriefing and training on clinical risk factors for placenta accreta spectrum are recommended. Clinical incident reporting and protocols for further care of suspected cases are essential. Future research recommendations include prospective studies on management impact and diagnostic accuracy, as well as RCTs on optimal timing and management strategies for placenta accreta spectrum. Antenatal detection and treatment of placenta praevia and placenta accreta, as well as appropriate delivery planning, are crucial for audit topics.

Placenta previa is associated with various risk factors and outcomes, including the need for emergency cesarean delivery. The distance between the placental edge and the internal os can impact the mode of delivery and the amount of hemorrhage during delivery. Transvaginal ultrasound can help predict outcomes and guide management decisions. In cases of low-lying placenta, repeat ultrasound scans may be necessary to monitor placental migration. Maintenance tocolytics may be used for preterm symptomatic placenta previa, and planned delivery timing should be carefully considered. Various techniques, such as the Bakri balloon and different types of uterine incisions, can be utilized to manage postpartum hemorrhage in cases of placenta previa.

Intrauterine balloon tamponade is effective in managing postpartum hemorrhage in placenta previa during cesarean section. Various studies have shown the success of balloon tamponade in controlling severe bleeding and reducing maternal morbidity. Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta can lead to reduced blood loss and better maternal outcomes. Ultrasound and MRI are valuable tools in diagnosing and managing abnormal placentation. Placenta percreta can lead to life-threatening complications such as uterine rupture and bladder invasion. Placenta accreta is associated with an increased risk of late pre-term birth and perinatal mortality.

Group of Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System (Public Health Agency of Canada) conducted research on the contribution of placenta accreta to postpartum hemorrhage. Management of placenta accreta is crucial for maternal and fetal outcomes. Various studies have highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary care teams in managing placenta accreta. Different strategies, such as timing strategies for delivery and uterus-preserving treatment modalities, have been explored. Interventional radiology plays a significant role in reducing hemorrhage and hysterectomy in cases of placenta accreta. Prophylactic measures, such as balloon occlusion of arteries, have been effective in controlling blood loss during cesarean sections for placenta accreta. It is essential to consider the potential complications and limitations of these interventions to ensure optimal outcomes for both the mother and baby.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment and should be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs and resources. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using a standardized scheme.
