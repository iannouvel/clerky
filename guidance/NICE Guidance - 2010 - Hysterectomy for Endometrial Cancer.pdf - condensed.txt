Laparoscopic hysterectomy (including laparoscopic total hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy) for endometrial cancer is safe and effective. Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, and clinicians should undergo special training. The procedure aims to provide a less invasive option with shorter recovery periods compared to open surgery. Efficacy data shows similar overall survival rates between laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy. Hospital stay after laparoscopic hysterectomy is significantly shorter. Rates of conversion to laparotomy and postoperative complications are reported. Bladder dysfunction and intra-abdominal abscess are potential adverse events.
