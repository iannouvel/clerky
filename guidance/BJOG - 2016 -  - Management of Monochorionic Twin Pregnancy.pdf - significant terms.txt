Diagnosis: 
- Monochorionic Twin Pregnancy
- Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)
- Twin anaemia-polycythaemia sequence (TAPS)
- Selective growth restriction (sGR)
- Single twin demise
- Fetal anaemia
- Fetal death
- Neurological abnormality
- Discordant abnormalities

Investigation: 
- Prenatal ultrasound
- Ultrasound examination between 11+0weeks and 13+6weeks of gestation
- Chorionicity determination
- Photographic record of ultrasound
- Neuploidy screening
- Nuchal translucency measurements
- First trimester serum markers
- Second trimester screening by the quadruple test
- Noninvasive prenatal testing
- Detailed ultrasound scan between 18 and 20+6weeks of gestation
- Fetal ultrasound assessment every 2 weeks from 16+0weeks onwards
- Liquor volume assessment
- Umbilical artery pulsatility index (UAPI) measurement
- Fetal biometry
- Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) measurement
- Umbilical artery Doppler evaluation
- Fetal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

Management: 
- Regular ultrasound examinations
- Referral to a specialist in case of doubt in chorionicity diagnosis
- Fetoscopic laser ablation for TTTS
- Regular ultrasound assessment post TTTS treatment
- Delivery of monochorionic twin pregnancies between 34+0and 36+6weeks of gestation
- Selective reduction in cases of early-onset sGR
- Fetal Doppler assessment in sGR
- Delivery planning in sGR
- Informing parents about potential adverse perinatal outcomes
- Assessment in a fetal medicine centre in case of single fetal death
- Measurement of fetal MCA PSV in case of fetal anaemia
- Elective delivery from 36+0weeks with the administration of antenatal steroids
- Vaginal birth of monochorionic diamniotic twins
- Caesarean section between 32+0and 34+0weeks for MCMA twins
- Selective reduction in higher order pregnancies
- Increased ultrasound surveillance in higher order pregnancies
- Referral for assessment and counselling in a fetal medicine centre in case of discordant abnormalities
- Karyotyping of monochorionic twins.
