Induction of Labour at Term in Older Mothers

The average age of childbirth is rising, with older mothers facing increased risks for both mother and baby. Advanced maternal age is associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and adverse outcomes. Stillbirth rates increase with maternal age, especially in women aged 40 years and older. Offering induction of labour earlier in older mothers may be justifiable to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Induction of labour has been shown to improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the caesarean section rate. Women aged 40 years and older may benefit from induction of labour at 39-40 weeks of gestation to prevent late stillbirths and maternal risks associated with ongoing pregnancy.

Insufficient data on the effect of a policy on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Potential increase in intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths, but overall improvement in perinatal outcomes. Older women may opt for elective caesarean section over induction of labor. Urgent need for research on induction of labor in advanced maternal age. National Institute for Health Research-funded study on induction of labor in nulliparous women over 35 years old. Recommendations for recruitment.
