This guideline focuses on laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, acute gall bladder disease, and symptomatic benign adnexal tumors. It is important for obstetricians, gynecologists, general surgeons, and anesthetists to consider laparoscopy in pregnant women, but only if the laparoscopist has specialized skills and performs complex laparoscopic surgery regularly. Laparoscopy is considered safe for both the mother and fetus, with no increased risk of fetal malformation or stillbirth compared to non-surgical pregnant women. Experienced laparoscopists should perform these procedures to ensure optimal outcomes.

Comparison of laparoscopic to open appendectomy in pregnant women has shown a higher incidence of spontaneous miscarriage with laparoscopy. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower wound infection rates. Maternal benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter operation time, hospital stay, and fewer postoperative complications. Risks of laparoscopy in pregnancy include haemorrhage, organ trauma, and uterine perforation. Anaesthetic risks should be carefully managed, with early involvement of an obstetric anaesthetist and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. General anaesthesia is recommended for most cases. Fetal risks of anaesthesia include maintaining utero-placental blood flow and avoiding maternal hypotension. General anaesthesia is preferred to reduce the risk of aspiration and provide optimal surgical conditions.

Pregnant women may experience complications during laparoscopic surgery for non-obstetric conditions. Recent studies show good outcomes for laparoscopic surgery up to 34 weeks gestation. The second trimester is generally recommended for non-urgent laparoscopic surgery. A multi-disciplinary team should be involved in the care of pregnant women undergoing laparoscopy. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally satisfactory for both laparoscopic and open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed by experienced surgeons. Intraoperative monitoring may be necessary in selected cases. Antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium may be used in cases of preterm delivery risk. Routine tocolysis is not recommended. Laparoscopic surgery should be conducted in facilities with appropriate expertise and monitoring. Placement of surgical ports should be carefully planned based on uterine size and pathology. The choice of primary and secondary port placement should be tailored to individual cases. Uterine manipulation should be avoided during laparoscopy in pregnancy.

Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended for gas insufflation in laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy, while operating pressures of 12 mmHg are supported. The choice of laparoscope diameter and degree should be based on surgical requirements and surgeon preference. Energy modalities such as ultrasound, bipolar, and monopolar are safe to use, with careful consideration of technique to avoid complications. Extraction methods for surgical specimens should be based on surgeon preference, with the use of a tissue bag recommended to prevent spillage. Post-operative care should include fetal monitoring, wound closure techniques to prevent hernia formation, and selective use of drains based on individual cases. In cases of appendicitis in pregnancy, timely surgical intervention is preferred to avoid adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Delay in surgery for suspected appendicitis can lead to increased complications, including perforation. Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process, and postoperative care should focus on pain management, hydration, and prevention of nausea and vomiting.

Should the laparoscopic approach to appendicectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? Controversy exists regarding the association of laparoscopic appendicectomy and miscarriage, and further research is needed to distinguish between association and causality. It is not possible to recommend one approach over the other due to the over-representation of first trimester pregnancies in the laparoscopy group.

Is there a role for expectant management of cholecystitis in pregnancy? A conservative approach to gallbladder disease in pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity than surgery. Complicated gallstone disease requires a more proactive approach.

Should the laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be associated with better composite maternal and fetal outcomes than the open approach, with fewer surgical complications and a shorter hospital stay.

Should surgery for ovarian cysts be preferred over the conservative approach in pregnancy? Women with asymptomatic simple cysts may be managed conservatively in pregnancy, while women with large, non-torted symptomatic cysts may be offered aspiration under ultrasound guidance. The risk of torsion of ovarian cysts requiring emergency surgery in pregnancy is low.

Should the laparoscopic approach to ovarian cysts be preferred over the open approach in pregnancy? Laparoscopic cystectomy is associated with better maternal outcomes than laparotomy in the second trimester, with similarly good fetal outcomes. More research is needed to prove the superiority of one approach over the other outside the second trimester. Choice of approach should be decided based on local circumstances and expertise.

Adnexal masses in pregnancy can be safely managed laparoscopically. Adequately trained laparoscopists should carry out these procedures with proper peri-operative preparations. More high-grade evidence is needed, and the creation and analysis of national large databases may be beneficial.
