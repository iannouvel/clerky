Unexplained Infertility Guideline 2023

This guideline provides evidence-based information on the optimal diagnostic work-up and treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making for appropriate and effective management. The guideline focuses on outcomes such as live birth rates, safety, patient compliance, and individualization. The target users include general practitioners, gynaecologists, and infertility specialists. The guideline is focused on couples with unexplained infertility and does not address single women, same-sex couples, or individuals who do not menstruate. Terminology and definitions follow international guidelines on infertility and fertility care. Key recommendations include not routinely measuring midluteal serum progesterone levels and not recommending endometrial biopsy for histological examination in the absence of other indications. Tests for confirmation of ovulation, ovarian reserve testing, and uterine factor evaluation are also discussed. Routine diagnostic laparoscopy and post-coital tests are not recommended for couples with unexplained infertility.

Vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting. Testicular imaging is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies, sperm DNA fragmentation, sperm chromatin condensation, sperm aneuploidy, serum hormonal levels, HPV, and microbiology in semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum, coeliac disease, thyroid antibodies, thrombophilia, oxidative stress in women, genetic or genomic tests, vitamin D deficiency, and prolactin in women is not recommended. Expectant management with IUI and ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation. ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF. Hysteroscopy for intrauterine abnormalities and endometrial scratching should not be offered. Psychological support, healthy diet, and regular exercise are recommended. Healthcare professionals should be aware of quality of life differences in couples with unexplained infertility. Couples should have at least 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse before fertility interventions may be initiated. Regular sexual intercourse frequency should be individualized. Female or male partner's age should not affect the definition of unexplained infertility. The definition of unexplained infertility includes normal ovarian function, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and pelvis, age ≤ 40 years, and adequate coital frequency. At least one basic semen examination according to WHO criteria is recommended for male fertility evaluation. Mild male factor infertility is excluded from the diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Female factors exclude the diagnosis of unexplained infertility.

II. Diagnosis

II.1 Confirmation of ovulation

In women with regular menstrual cycles, tests such as urinary LH measurements, ultrasound monitoring, or mid-luteal progesterone measurement can be used to confirm ovulation.

II.2 Oocyte/corpus luteum quality

It is suggested not to routinely measure midluteal serum progesterone levels in women with regular menstrual cycles.

II.3 Ovarian reserve

Lower anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly associated with unexplained infertility, while antral follicle count (AFC) was not found to be associated with UI. Women with low AMH values had a similar predicted probability of conceiving compared to women with normal values. Women with high serum FSH values also had similar predicted probabilities of conceiving compared to those with normal values.

Findings suggest that ovarian reserve testing is not necessary for women with regular menstrual cycles to determine the cause of infertility or predict spontaneous conception over 6 to 12 months. Studies consistently show that ovarian reserve status is not predictive of spontaneous conception in this timeframe. Therefore, ovarian reserve tests are not needed for diagnostic purposes.

Hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) is a sensitive and specific test for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for 2D-HyCoSy were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, while for 3D/4D-HyCoSy, they were 0.95 and 0.89. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) also showed high sensitivity and specificity for tubal pathology, with pooled estimates of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively. These tests are valuable in diagnosing tubal issues in patients with unexplained infertility.

Hystero salpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are valid tests for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. Selection of the technique depends on the preference of the clinician and the patient. High risk for tubal occlusion includes past chlamydia infection, PID, peritonitis, known endometriosis, and/or pelvic surgery including salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy. HyCoSy and HSG are comparable in diagnostic capacity. Chlamydia antibody testing could be considered a non-invasive test to differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. Visual demonstration of tubal patency is necessary in high-risk patients. Antibodies against Chlamydia Trachomatis can be maintained in sera for at least 10 years after infection and are the only available means for determining prior CT infection. CAT could be considered a non-invasive test to differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. Additional tests like HyCoSy, HSG, or laparoscopy may be needed for confirmation.

Ultrasound, preferably 3D, is recommended to exclude uterine anomalies in women with unexplained infertility.

Routine post-coital testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Strong

Justification
Post-coital testing has been shown to have varying predictive values and does not significantly impact pregnancy rates. There is no clear benefit to routine testing in the evaluation of unexplained infertility.

Recommendation  
Anti-sperm antibody testing is not recommended in men with normal WHO semen analysis. Strong  ⊕

Justification  
While anti-sperm antibodies have been found to be associated with infertility in some studies, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend routine testing in men with normal semen analysis. Further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of anti-sperm antibodies in male infertility. 

Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 6 and Annex 7 (question II.9).

In couples with unexplained infertility, testing for anti-sperm antibodies in the semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. There is insufficient evidence to support the benefit of these tests, as the quality of data is low and cut-off values are inconsistent. Similarly, testing for sperm DNA fragmentation and sperm chromatin condensation is not recommended in the initial evaluation of males with unexplained infertility and normal semen parameters. There is not enough strong evidence to suggest that these tests can reliably predict reproductive outcomes. Additionally, testing for sperm aneuploidy, hormonal levels, human papillomavirus, and microbiology in semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. The clinical significance of these tests in couples with unexplained infertility is questionable, and there is a lack of evidence to support their routine use.

Time has come to include Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing in sperm donor banks.

Additional tests for systemic conditions: Should there be additional evaluations of possible systemic cause of unexplained infertility in the couple? Anti-sperm antibodies in serum. Female celiac disease. Thyroid antibodies.

In a study on unexplained infertility, testing for anti-sperm antibodies is not recommended. Testing for coeliac disease can be considered, but testing for thyroid antibodies and other autoimmune conditions is not recommended. Testing for thrombophilia in women with unexplained infertility is also not recommended. 

Thyroid hormones should be measured in pre-conception care, but no additional thyroid evaluation is needed if TSH levels are normal. 

Oxidative stress in males with unexplained infertility has been found to be significantly higher, with markers such as DNA fragmentation and ROS levels elevated. These factors may negatively impact fertility outcomes.

- Levels were found in semen of UI patients compared to controls. In a case-control study, DNA damage and oxidative stress measured by Comet assay in semen of males with UI and fertile donors was investigated. No significant differences were found between UI and control males for TAS, TOS, OSI, or sperm DNA damage. In a case-control study, metabolomic analysis was performed on the urine of UI and fertile males, distinguishing significant differences between the two groups with respect to a number of purported biomarkers.

- In a prospective cohort study, oxidative stress markers were evaluated in the serum and follicular fluid of women with UI and compared to women with male factor infertility. Levels were found to be significantly lower in women with UI compared to controls. Serum and follicular fluid superoxide dismutase levels were found to be significantly higher in women with UI compared to controls. In a case-control study, oxidant status in follicular fluid of UI patients was statistically higher than the control group. No significant difference in implantation, clinical PR, or LBR.

- In a case-control study, including women with UI and controls undergoing ICSI for male-factor infertility, the association between oxidant status and infertility and outcomes after ICSI was investigated. TOS and OSI in follicular fluid of the UI patients were statistically higher than the control group. The systemic TOS and OSI were also significantly increased in the UI group compared to the control group.

- In a case-control study, oxidative stress was evaluated in women with UI and compared to fertile controls. Serum nitrite was lower in UI compared to controls. Serum MDA levels were significantly higher in UI compared to controls.

- In a case-control study, the role of superoxide dismutase 2 and nitric oxide synthase polymorphisms in UI was evaluated. Homozygosity for specific alleles was associated with a significant increased risk of infertility.

- Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with unexplained infertility should only be considered in the context of research. Measurement of oxidative stress in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended.

- Genetic or genomic tests are currently not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility.

- Testing for vitamin D deficiency is not recommended for the diagnosis of unexplained infertility.

- Prolactin testing in women is not recommended.

- In an epidemiologic survey study, the association of dietary status and UI was evaluated. There was a significant difference in caloric intake between women with UI and controls, with a lower intake of carbohydrates and vitamins and higher intake of fats in women with UI. Additionally, the effect of body weight on the success rate of IVF in women with UI was studied. A significantly higher live birth rate per cycle was found in women with normal weight and slight overweight compared with women with a higher BMI.

BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. Although there is little evidence of a specific association between BMI and UI, reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. The standard advice and medical interventions apply equally to patients with UI as to any other causes of infertility. Patients generally value advice about lifestyle and healthy alternatives to maximize fertility. While healthy lifestyle intervention may improve spontaneous conception, active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not yet shown a benefit in getting pregnant.

Association of common thrombophilias and antiphospholipid antibodies with success rate of in vitro fertilisation. The most important prognostic factors for spontaneous pregnancy in couples with unexplained infertility are age, duration of infertility, previous treatment, and previous pregnancy. Treatment decisions should be based on prognosis and patient preferences. IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. IVF may be considered based on patient characteristics and preferences.

Active treatment for unexplained infertility includes timed intercourse with clomiphene citrate or letrozole, IUI in a natural cycle, and ovarian stimulation with IUI. IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment to avoid multiple pregnancies and OHSS. IVF is not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation, with individualized decisions based on patient characteristics. ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF for couples with unexplained infertility. Mechanical-surgical procedures like resection of polyps or fibroids may improve spontaneous conception rates.

Patients with fibroids identified on transvaginal ultrasound were assigned to have the fibroids removed or not. Surgical removal of fibroids did not show a significant improvement in clinical pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates. Hysteroscopy for detecting and correcting intrauterine abnormalities not seen on routine imaging is not recommended due to insufficient evidence on its effectiveness in women with unexplained infertility.

Tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media is preferred over water-soluble contrast media, as it may increase the odds of live birth and clinical pregnancy. There are no significant differences in infection or adverse events between the two methods. Endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility as it does not show better pregnancy outcomes in couples with unexplained infertility.

If incidentally minimal to mild endometriosis is found during laparoscopy, it is not further considered unexplained infertility. The role of laparoscopic surgery in women with minimal or mild endometriosis has shown an improvement in clinical pregnancy rates.

- Antioxidants: Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to women and men undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended.
- Acupuncture: Acupuncture in women is probably not recommended.
- Nutraceuticals (Inositol): Inositol supplementation in women is probably not recommended.
- Psychotherapy: Psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed.
- Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): Limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Korean medicine for treating women with unexplained infertility.
- Diet, Exercise, Behavioral Therapy: A healthy diet and regular exercise, supported by behavioral therapy when necessary, are recommended.
- Quality of Life: There is probably no difference in QoL between women with unexplained infertility versus women in couples with known causes of infertility, except when the cause of infertility is PCOS. QoL is probably higher in men from a couple with unexplained infertility compared to men from a couple with known causes of infertility, except when the cause of infertility is men with a partner with PCOS.

Members of the guideline development group from various institutions around the world were involved in the development of the unexplained infertility guideline. Declarations of interest were made by all members to disclose any conflicts of interest. The top research recommendations include developing a predictive model for comparing management strategies for unexplained infertility, determining the optimal assisted reproduction technology, and assessing the value of sperm DNA integrity tests in predicting outcomes for couples with unexplained infertility. Additionally, the importance of researching male infertility and its impact on overall health was highlighted. Other research gaps identified include the role of vaginal microbiota, the development of predictive models for fertility based on ovarian reserve tests, and the impact of lifestyle interventions on unexplained infertility. Further research is needed to address these gaps and improve treatment options for couples experiencing infertility.

NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health organized online meetings to develop a guideline on Unexplained Infertility. A final list of 21 key questions was defined and literature searches were conducted. The quality of selected papers was assessed using a checklist and evidence was summarized in tables. Recommendations were formulated and labeled as 'strong' or 'conditional'. The guideline was open for review and will be considered for revision in 2027. Implementation strategies include dissemination and development of patient versions. Stakeholder consultation was conducted, and the guideline will be updated as needed.
