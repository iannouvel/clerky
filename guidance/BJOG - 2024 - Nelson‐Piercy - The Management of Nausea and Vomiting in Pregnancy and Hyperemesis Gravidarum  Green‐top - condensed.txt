The Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum (Green-top Guideline No. 69)

Key recommendations:
- An objective index such as the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and HyperEmesis Level Prediction (HELP) tools can classify the severity of NVP and HG.
- Ketonuria should not be used to assess severity.
- First-line antiemetics like anti (H1) histamines, phenothiazines, and doxylamine/pyridoxine should be prescribed initially for NVP and HG.
- Ondansetron is safe and effective as a second-line antiemetic.
- Metoclopramide is safe and effective and can be used alone or in combination with other antiemetics.
- Thiamine supplementation should be given to all women admitted with vomiting.
- All therapeutic measures should be tried before considering termination of pregnancy.

Purpose and Scope:
This guideline provides updated information on the diagnosis and management of NVP and HG for healthcare professionals caring for women.

Introduction and Background Epidemiology:
NVP affects up to 90% of pregnant women and is a common reason for hospital admission. HG is a severe form of NVP that affects 0.3-3.6% of pregnant women.

Identification and Assessment of Evidence:
The Cochrane Library and electronic databases were searched for evidence. NVP is diagnosed before 16 weeks of gestation, while HG is diagnosed when symptoms severely limit daily activities.

How are NVP and HG Defined and Diagnosed?
NVP typically starts between the fourth and seventh weeks of gestation and resolves by the 20th week in 90% of women. HG is diagnosed when symptoms severely limit daily activities and signs of dehydration are present. An objective index like PUQE and HELP can classify severity.

Clinical Assessment:
Clinical assessment with the HELP or PUQE scores is better for assessing severity than urinary ketosis. Severe malnutrition can be assessed with anthropometric measures and nutrition screening tools.

Investigation:
- Urinalysis: Nitrites may indicate infection. 
- MSU (if dipstick indicates signs of UTI)
- Urea and electrolytes: to guide intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement
- Full blood count: to assess infection and anaemia
- Blood glucose level: to diagnose diabetes
- Ultrasound scan: to assess pregnancy viability
- In refractory cases or history of previous admissions, check TFTs, LFTs, calcium, phosphate, amylase, and VBG

Clinical Assessment and Baseline Investigations:
- Women with mild NVP can be managed in the community with antiemetics
- Ambulatory day care can be used if community measures fail
- Inpatient care should be considered for continued nausea and vomiting, dehydration, or comorbidities
- Ultrasound scan should be scheduled for inpatients
- Pharmacological therapeutic options may include combinations of different drugs for severe cases of NVP and HG
- Corticosteroids can be used in refractory cases after standard therapies have been ineffective
- Safety data supports the use of antiemetics as first-line treatment for NVP and HG

C Dystonic reactions have been shown to be significantly less common in non-pregnant patients receiving a slow infusion as opposed to a bolus injection of 10 mg of metoclopramide. Women should be asked about previous adverse reactions to antiemetic therapies. If adverse reactions occur, there should be prompt cessation of the medications. Women should not be prescribed medications that have caused previous adverse reactions. All the antiemetics discussed above can and should be used with confidence in primary and secondary care to manage women's symptoms. Use of ondansetron for NVP/HG is increasing, with conflicting findings on its safety during pregnancy. Due to the risk of extrapyramidal effects with metoclopramide, it should be used as second-line therapy. Corticosteroid use in the first trimester is not associated with an increase in the risk of congenital malformations. Urea and serum electrolyte levels should be checked daily in women requiring intravenous fluids. Histamine type-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors may be used for women developing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Thiamine supplementation should be given to all women admitted with vomiting or severely reduced dietary intake. Women with HG should be offered thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. Women with previous or current NVP or HG should consider avoiding iron-containing preparations if these exacerbate symptoms. Women should be questioned about their bowel habits and offered laxatives if constipated, particularly if ondansetron is used. Women should be offered treatment with proton pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Women should only be discharged once appropriate antiemetic therapy has been tolerated, adequate oral nutrition and hydration have been tolerated, and management of concurrent conditions is completed. Women with severe NVP or HG who have continued symptoms into the late second or the third trimester should be offered serial scans to monitor fetal growth. Normal saline with additional potassium chloride in each bag, with administration guided by daily monitoring of electrolytes, is the most appropriate intravenous hydration.

The use of dextrose infusions for fluid replacement in NVP and HG is not recommended. IV fluids have been shown to reduce vomiting and are valuable for managing symptoms. Dextrose-containing solutions can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy in thiamine-deficient states. Fluid management guidance can be found in NICE Clinical Guideline 174. IV fluids are important for both outpatient and inpatient management of HG and severe NVP. NVP and HG can impact a woman's quality of life and mental health, requiring assessment and support. Support groups can be helpful for women experiencing NVP and HG. In severe cases, input from allied professionals and mental health teams may be necessary. Dieticians should be consulted for nutritional support. Enteral and parenteral nutrition may be considered when other treatments fail. Termination of pregnancy should be discussed after all other therapeutic measures have been offered. HG is not associated with long-term all-cause mortality but can increase the risk of postpartum mental health issues.

Women with HG are at an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder postpartum. There is a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies, with rates varying from 15% to 81%. Lifestyle modifications and antiemetics can help reduce the risk of HG in current pregnancies. Early use of antiemetics before symptoms begin can lower the recurrence risk. A study showed that pre-emptive treatment with antiemetics resulted in fewer cases of moderate to severe NVP. Earlier use of antiemetics in subsequent pregnancies reduced the number of hospital admissions for women with HG in two or more pregnancies.

Clinical guidelines for the management of hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy include various treatment options such as corticosteroids, ondansetron, and pyridoxine. Assessing nutritional status using markers like mid-upper arm circumference and dietary diversity score is important in pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum. Management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy may involve outpatient care, day care, or inpatient treatment. Different medications like doxylamine, metoclopramide, and granisetron have been studied for their efficacy in treating hyperemesis gravidarum. It is important to consider the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the use of ginger for hyperemesis gravidarum. Surgical repair may be required for trocar-site hernias after laparoscopy. A systematic review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy has been conducted to guide clinical practice.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy can have a significant impact on quality of life and mental health, with women experiencing severe impacts on daily functioning and willingness to become pregnant again. Studies have shown associations between nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and health-related quality of life in early pregnancy, as well as links to anxiety, depression, and stress. Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting, has been associated with psychological morbidity and can have lasting effects on maternal mental health and maternal-fetal attachment. Despite historical stigma, it is important to address the physical and psychological burden of hyperemesis gravidarum to provide appropriate care and support for affected women.
