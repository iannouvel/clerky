The purpose of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based summary for the generalist to facilitate appropriate investigation and management of women presenting for the first time with chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain can significantly impact a woman's ability to function and may require accurate diagnosis and effective management from the first presentation. Various factors, including central and peripheral nervous system changes, endometriosis, adhesions, IBS, interstitial cystitis, musculoskeletal issues, nerve entrapment, and psychological and social issues, can contribute to chronic pelvic pain. Adequate time should be allowed for the initial assessment, and a multidisciplinary approach may be effective in managing chronic pelvic pain. The initial history should include questions about the pattern of pain, associated symptoms, and any 'red flag' symptoms that may require further investigation.

It may be helpful to establish the womanâ€™s level of function at the start of treatment, both to monitor progress and to emphasize the value of functional goals. Asking about previous drug use and effectiveness can aid in diagnosis and management. Symptom-based tools can be used to diagnose IBS with confidence. Referral to relevant healthcare professionals should be considered if a non-gynecological component to the pain is suspected. Examination should include abdominal and pelvic examination for tenderness, enlargement, or prolapse. Screening for infections like Chlamydia and gonorrhea is recommended. TVS and MRI can be useful for diagnosing conditions like adenomyosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered as a second-line investigation. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatment for cyclical pain and other treatments for specific conditions like IBS. Self-management techniques and support organizations can also be beneficial for patients with chronic pelvic pain.

Clinical guideline on chronic pelvic pain evaluation and management. Various studies on endometriosis, adenomyosis, and pelvic pain have been conducted. Adhesiolysis and laparoscopic adhesiolysis have been studied for chronic pelvic pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms may vary with the menstrual cycle. Interstitial cystitis and myofascial pain syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain. Physical therapy and botulinum toxin type A have been studied for pelvic pain management. Childhood abuse history may be associated with chronic pelvic pain. Multidisciplinary pain treatment centers and psychosomatic group treatment have shown efficacy in managing chronic pelvic pain. Ultrasound and MRI are used for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. Laparoscopy is a diagnostic tool for chronic pelvic pain. Laparoscopic complications and prevention of entry-related injuries have been studied. Microlaparoscopy and conscious pain mapping are used for diagnosis and management of pelvic pain. Psychological effects of laparoscopy on women with chronic pelvic pain have been studied. Quality of life and counseling after laparoscopy are important in managing chronic pelvic pain. Ovarian cancer recognition and management are essential.

The text contains information on various studies and guidelines related to the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and neuropathic pain. It also includes criteria for the diagnosis of IBS, 'red flag' symptoms and signs, and classifications of evidence levels.
