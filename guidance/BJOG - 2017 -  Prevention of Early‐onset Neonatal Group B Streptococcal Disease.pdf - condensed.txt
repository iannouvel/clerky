Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease
All pregnant women should be provided with appropriate information about GBS colonisation and the risk of neonatal infection. Universal bacteriological screening for GBS is not recommended. Clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease. IAP should be offered to women with GBS bacteriuria. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for planned caesarean sections without labor. Women known to be GBS carriers should receive immediate IAP and induction of labor. Babies with signs of infection should be treated promptly with penicillin and gentamicin. Breastfeeding should be encouraged regardless of GBS status. Parents should seek medical advice if their baby shows abnormal behavior or symptoms. Term babies of mothers who received IAP do not require special observation at birth. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. Women with known GBS colonisation who decline IAP should closely monitor their baby for 12 hours after birth. Vaginal cleansing in labor does not reduce the risk of neonatal GBS disease.

- Routine screening for GBS in pregnancy is not recommended in the UK due to lack of clear evidence of benefits outweighing risks.
- Clinical risk factors for EOGBS disease include previous baby with GBS, maternal GBS carriage, preterm birth, prolonged rupture of membranes, suspected maternal intrapartum infection.
- Women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy should receive appropriate treatment and IAP.
- IAP should be offered to women with a previous baby affected by EOGBS.
- Maternal request is not an indication for bacteriological screening for GBS.
- Antenatal treatment is not recommended for GBS colonisation detected incidentally earlier in pregnancy.
- Women with known GBS carrier status should receive immediate IAP and induction of labour at term.
- Intrapartum pyrexia in labour should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics covering GBS.

IAP is recommended for women in confirmed preterm labor. IAP is not recommended for women not in labor and having a preterm planned caesarean section with intact membranes. The risk of EOGBS disease in infants of women who deliver preterm is higher, justifying the use of IAP in all cases of preterm labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at the onset of labor is not recommended. Water birth is not contraindicated for GBS-positive women if appropriate IAP is offered. Bacteriological testing for GBS carriage is not recommended for women with preterm rupture of membranes. Swabs for GBS testing should be transported and processed promptly. Enriched culture medium tests are recommended for GBS testing. Benzylpenicillin is the antibiotic of choice for IAP. Cephalosporins should be used in women with known or suspected penicillin allergy. Women with known GBS colonization who decline IAP should have their baby closely monitored after birth. Vaginal cleansing in labor does not reduce the risk of neonatal GBS disease. Parents and carers should seek medical advice if a newborn shows abnormal behavior or symptoms. Term babies whose mothers received adequate IAP do not require special observation. Well babies at risk of EOGBS disease should be monitored closely after birth. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies.

The incidence of EOGBS disease in asymptomatic term infants without known antenatal risk factors in the UK is estimated at 0.2 cases/1000 births. Routine postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated with penicillin and gentamicin within an hour of the decision to treat. Breastfeeding should be encouraged irrespective of GBS status. Babies of mothers who have had a previous baby with GBS disease should be monitored closely for at least 12 hours. No evidence supports obtaining blood cultures and treating with intravenous penicillin if cultures are negative.
