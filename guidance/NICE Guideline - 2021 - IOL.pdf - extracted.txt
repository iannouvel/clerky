that options f or bir th can include: 
• expectant management , or 
• induction of labour , or 
• planned caesar ean bir th (see t he NICE guideline on caesar ean bir th). 
Record these discussions and t he w oman's pr eferences in her not es. [2008 , 
amended 2021] 
1.1.2 Confirm a w oman's pr eferences f or bir th at ant enatal visit s towards the

other definitions see t he NICE glossar y and t he Think Local, Act P ersonal Car e and 
Suppor t Jargon Bust er. 
Bishop sc ore 
The Bishop scor e is a numerical v alue obtained b y doing a v aginal e xamination, and is 
based on t he dilation, eff acement ( or lengt h), position and consist ency of t he cer vix and 
the station of t he head wit h respect t o the ischial spines of t he pelvis. A scor e of 8 or mor e 
generally indicat es that t he cer vix is r eady t o dilat e, (pr eviously t he terms 'ripe' or 
'favourable' w ere widely used) and when t here is a high chance of spontaneous labour , or 
response t o interventions made t o induce labour . For the purposes of t his guideline, a 
Bishop scor e of less t han or equal t o 6, or a scor e greater than 6 , was used t o help 
determine choice of pharmacological or mechanical met hods t o induce labour . 
Dinopr ostone 
Dinopr ostone is t he int ernational non-pr oprietar y name f or pr ostaglandin E2. Pr evious 
versions of t his guideline r eferred to prostaglandin E2, or PGE2, but in or der t o ensur e 
uniformity wit h the naming con ventions in t he BNF , this v ersion r efers t o this medication as 
dinopr ostone. 
Expe ctant manag emen t 
A management appr oach, also called 'wat ch and wait' , when no medical or sur gical 
treatment is giv en. The aim is t o allo w labour t o begin naturally . 
Hyper stim ulation 
This is o veractivity of t he ut erus as a r esult of induction of labour . It is v ariously defined as 
uterine tach ysyst ole (mor e than 5 contractions per 10  minut es for at least 20  minut es) and 
uterine h ypersyst ole/h yper tonicity (a contraction lasting at least 2  minut es). These ma y or 
may not be associat ed wit h changes in t he fetal hear t rate patt ern (persist ent 
decelerations, tach ycardia or incr eased/decr eased shor t term v ariability). Inducing labour (NG20 7)

What ar e the relativ e risks and benefit s of induced labour v ersus e xpectant management 
in women whose membranes ha ve ruptur ed spontaneously betw een 34 and 37  weeks? 
[2008] 
Why this is im portant 
Intraut erine sepsis is mor e likely to develop in pr egnancies t hat continue aft er the 
membranes ha ve ruptur ed, putting bot h the w oman and t he bab y at risk. In some such 
pregnancies, labour begins spontaneously at a v ariable int erval aft er the membranes ha ve 
ruptur ed, a voiding t he need f or induction. The v alue of antibiotic t herap y and t he 
administration of cor ticost eroids t o the w oman is unclear in t his situation. A randomised 
study of activ e versus e xpectant management, taking account of time since membrane 
ruptur e, gestational age and mat ernal t herap y, would be v aluable.

depending on parity 
• membrane sw eeping v ersus cer vical massage? [2008] Inducing labour (NG20 7)

of 41Why this is im portant 
Membrane sw eeping is consider ed to be a r elativ ely simple int ervention t hat ma y 
positiv ely influence t he transition fr om maint enance of pr egnancy t o the onset of labour , 
reducing t he need f or formal induction of labour . However, there are disadv antages, such 
as possible v aginal bleeding and discomf ort. Resear ch int o when and ho w frequent ly 
membrane sw eeping should be carried out t o maximise it s effectiv eness and acceptability 
would be of v alue. 
6 Vaginal dinopr ostone 
What ar e the eff ectiv eness, saf ety and mat ernal acceptability of: 
• different r egimens of v aginal dinopr ostone, stratified b y: clinical indications; cer vical 
and membrane status; parity; and pr evious caesar ean bir th 
• different management policies f or unsuccessful induction of labour wit h vaginal 
dinopr ostone (additional dinopr ostone, o xytocin, electiv e caesar ean bir th or dela y of 
induction, if appr opriat e). [2008] 
Why this is im portant 
Despit e extensiv e studies carried out o ver the past 30 y ears t o det ermine t he most 
effectiv e wa ys of inducing labour wit h vaginal dinopr ostone, uncer tainties r emain about 
how best t o apply t hese agent s in t erms of t heir dosage and timing. It w ould be 
particularly useful t o understand mor e clearly wh y vaginal dinopr ostone is unsuccessful in 
inducing labour in some w omen. 
7 Setting f or induc tion o f labour 
Is it saf e, eff ectiv e and cost eff ectiv e to carr y out induction of labour in an outpatient 
setting? What ar e the adv antages and disadv antages of such an appr oach, taking int o 
account w omen's views? [2008] 
Why this is im portant

Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience of t he risks of gr oup B str eptococcal inf ection t o

The committ ee agr eed t hat, in t heir e xperience, w omen v alue being inf ormed about t he

the possible met hods f or induction of labour will depend primarily on t he readiness of t heir 
cervix, which is assessed wit h a v aginal e xamination and r ecorded as t he Bishop scor e. 
Ther e was good e vidence t hat v aginal dinopr ostone was eff ectiv e at pr omoting v aginal 
birth wit hin 2 4 hours f or women wit h a Bishop scor e of 6 or less, wit hout significant ly 
increasing t he risk of adv erse out comes f or the w oman or her bab y. When t he diff erent 
preparations of v aginal dinopr ostone w ere compar ed, t here was litt le evidence t o 
demonstrat e that one pr eparation was superior t o anot her. Ther efore, the committ ee 
agreed t hat it was appr opriat e to off er a choice of pr eparation, depending on a vailability 
and t he w oman's pr eference. Ther e was some e vidence t hat dinopr ostone pr eparations 
could lead t o hyperstimulation wit h fetal hear t rate changes. 
Misopr ostol was as eff ectiv e as dinopr ostone at pr omoting v aginal bir th wit hin 2 4 hours. 
Ther e was e vidence sho wing a risk of h yperstimulation wit h misopr ostol, alt hough t his was 
predominant ly wit h higher doses and v aginal pr eparations, and t he committ ee took int o 
consideration pr evious MHRA warnings r elating t o the misopr ostol vaginal inser t about t his 
risk. The committ ee not ed that, f or the lo w dose oral pr eparations of misopr ostol, the risk 
of hyperstimulation appear ed to be t he same or lo wer than wit h the dinopr ostone v aginal 
preparations. Ther efore, the committ ee agr eed t hat misopr ostol could be an alt ernativ e to 
dinopr ostone f or induction of labour , par ticularly f or women who w ould pr efer an oral 
preparation. 
Ther e was e vidence t hat t here was no incr eased risk of h yperstimulation when using

of 41Context 
Induced labour ma y be r ecommended in cir cumstances when it appears t hat t he benefit s 
outw eigh t he risks f or the mot her and bab y of continuing wit h the pr egnancy , but wit h the 
aim of still enabling a v aginal bir th. Ho wever, induction has an impact on t he bir th 
experience of w omen as it: 
• removes the satisf action of achie ving t he mor e natural bir th that man y woman hope 
for 
• is generally mor e painful t han spontaneous labour 
• is mor e likely to lead t o additional int erventions such as assist ed or operativ e bir th, 
including caesar ean bir th, and 
• is mor e likely to need epidural analgesia. 
Induction of labour is a common pr ocedur e, wit h appr oximat ely a t hird of all w omen in t he 
UK under going induction, and t here are a v ariety of met hods a vailable using bot h 
pharmacological tr eatment s and mechanical met hods. The choice of met hod depends on 
the readiness of t he w oman's cer vix (assessed using a v aginal e xamination, and 
categorised using t he Bishop scor e), whet her t he membranes ha ve ruptur ed, and t he 
woman's pr eferences. The options a vailable should be discussed and t his discussion 
should include: 
• an awar eness of t he efficacy and possible adv erse eff ects for the w oman and her 
baby associat ed wit h each met hod, and 
• the lik elihood t hat additional int erventions (such as emer gency caesar ean bir th) might 
be needed if t he induction is not successful. 
Women can choose not t o have induction of labour , and appr opriat e car e should t hen be 
offered to optimise t he out come of t he pr egnancy while r especting t he w oman's wishes. 
The aim of t his guideline is t o giv e advice t o healt hcare professionals pr oviding obst etric 
services, and t o pregnant w omen, on t he inf ormation and suppor t women and t heir 
families and bir th par tners should be off ered when making decisions about induction of 
labour . It also aims t o define t he cir cumstances when induction of labour ma y be
