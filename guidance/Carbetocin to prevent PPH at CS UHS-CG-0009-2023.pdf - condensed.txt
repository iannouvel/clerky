This document provides guidelines for the use of Carbetocin to prevent postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in caesarean birth. Carbetocin, a synthetic analogue of oxytocin, is recommended for use in specialist obstetric units by experienced staff. It should be offered to all patients undergoing caesarean birth unless contraindicated. 

The guideline details responsibilities of the theatre/ODP team, anaesthetist, obstetrician, and midwife. It also provides instructions on how to administer Carbetocin, which must only be given after the birth of the baby and as soon as possible after umbilical cord clamping. The dose is 100â€¯micrograms to be given over 1 minute, diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride. 

Contraindications include pregnancy and labour before birth of the baby, hypersensitivity to Carbetocin or oxytocin, hepatic or renal disease, serious cardiovascular disorders, epilepsy, and severe eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Cautions for use include cardiovascular disease, severe hypotension, hyponatraemia or water intoxication, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, general anaesthesia, hyponatraemia, migraine, and asthma. 

The guideline also states that the elimination half-life of Carbetocin is >40 minutes, with clinical effect apparent for up to 4 hours. If uterine tone remains inadequate following administration of 100mcgs, a 2nd line agent should be considered.

Carbetocin is used to prevent postpartum haemorrhage in caesarean birth. Initial studies excluded women and people under GA, thus its license does not include GA. Oxytocin has been linked to water intoxication and hyponatraemia. Although this risk could theoretically exist for Carbetocin, no cases have been reported. Carbetocin should not be used before birth due to its long-lasting uterotonic activity. If persistent bleeding occurs after Carbetocin administration, causes such as retained placental fragments or blood coagulation disorders should be considered. Carbetocin is for single administration only, either intramuscular or intravenous, and should be administered slowly over 1 minute. Additional therapy with uterotonics should be considered for persisting uterine hypotonia or atonia and excessive bleeding. Carbetocin has some antidiuretic activity, so hyponatraemia cannot be excluded, especially in patients receiving large volumes of intravenous fluids. Carbetocin should be used cautiously in patients with migraine, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Interactions with other drugs have not been identified, but cannot be excluded due to its structural similarity to oxytocin. Adverse effects include anaemia, headache, tremor, nausea, hypotension, flushing, chest pain, dyspnoea, pruritis, back pain, and general discomfort. Monitoring and review of compliance with guidelines and review of incident cases are necessary.
