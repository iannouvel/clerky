Consent Advice No. 2
December 2008
DIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY
This is the second edition of this guidance, which was previously published in October 2004 under the
same title.
This paper provides advice for clinicians in obtaining the consent of women undergoing diagnostic
laparoscopy. It follows the structure of Consent Form 1 of the Department of Health, England/Welsh
Assembly Government/Scottish Government/Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,
Northern Ireland. It should be used in conjunction with RCOG Clinical Governance Advice, Obtaining
Valid Consent .1Please refer to RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49, Preventing Entry-related Gynae-
cological Laparoscopic Injuries .2
The aim of this advice is to ensure that all women are given consistent and adequate information for
consent; it is intended to be used together with dedicated patient information.  After discharge, all
women should have clear direction to obtaining help if there are unforeseen problems.
Clinicians should be prepared to discuss with the woman any of the points listed on the following
pages.
The above descriptors are based on the RCOG Clinical Governance Advice, Presenting Information on Risk .3  They 
are used throughout this document.
To assist clinicians at a local level, we have included at the end of this document a fully printable page
2 of the Department of Health, England/Welsh Assembly Government/Scottish Government/Depart-
ment of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland, Consent Form 1. This page can be
incorporated into local trust documents, subject to local trust governance approval.Presenting information on risk

Consent Advice 2 © RCOG 2009CONSENT FORM
1. Name of proposed procedure or course of treatment
Diagnostic laparoscopy.
2. The proposed procedure
Describe the nature of laparoscopy.  Explain the procedure as described in the patient information.
Note: If other procedures are anticipated (such as hydrotubation, tissue biopsy, ovarian cyst aspiration, treat-
ment of endometriosis or division of adhesions) these must be discussed and a separate consent obtained.
3. Intended benefits
To find the cause of symptoms. As this is a diagnostic procedure, it is unlikely to alter symptoms. Occasionally,
a minor laparoscopic procedure is appropriate to treat some of the identified causes or relieve the symptoms.
4. Serious and frequently occurring risks4,5,6
It is recommended that clinicians make every effort to separate serious from frequently occurring risks. Women
who are obese, who have significant pathology, who have had previous surgery or who have pre-existing
medical conditions must understand that the quoted risks for serious or frequent complications will be
increased. The risk of serious complications at laparoscopy also increases if an additional therapeutic procedure
is performed. Women should be advised that laparoscopy may not identify an obvious cause for presenting
complaint.
4.1 Serious risks
Serious risks include:
●the overall risk of serious complications from diagnostic laparoscopy, approximately two women in every 1 000
(uncommon)
●damage to bowel, bladder, uterus or major blood vessels which would require immediate repair by laparoscopy
or laparotomy (uncommon). However, up to 15% of bowel injuries might not be diagnosed at the time of
laparoscopy
●failure to gain entry to abdominal cavity and to complete intended procedure
●hernia at site of entry
●death; three to eight women in every 100 000 undergoing laparoscopy die as a result of complications (very
rare).
4.2 Frequent risks
Frequent risks include:
●wound bruising
●shoulder-tip pain
●wound gaping
●wound infection.
5. Any extra procedures which may become necessary during the procedure
●Laparotomy
●Repair of damage to bowel, bladder, uterus or blood vessels
●Blood transfusion.
6. What the procedure is likely to involve; the benefits and risks of any available alternative
treatments, including no treatment
Insertion of a laparoscope through a small incision to identify the problem. The role of prior diagnostic imaging
must be discussed, together with the option of no investigation.
Consent Advice 2 2of47. Statement of patient: procedures which should not be carried out without further
discussion
Other procedures which may be appropriate but not essential at the time should be discussed and the woman’s
wishes recorded.
8. Preoperative information
A record should be made of any sources of information (such as RCOG or locally produced information
leaflets/tapes) given to the woman prior to surgery.  The RCOG produces patient information on pelvic
inflammatory disease, pelvic pain and endometriosis.7,8,9
9. Anaesthesia
Where possible, the woman must be aware of the form of anaesthesia planned and be given an opportunity to
discuss this in detail with the anaesthetist before surgery.  It should be noted that with obesity there are
increased risks, both surgical and anaesthetic.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces consent advice as an aid to good clinical practice. The
ultimate implementation of a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other
attendant after the valid consent of the patient in the light of clinical data and the diagnostic and treatment options
available. The responsibility for clinical management rests with the practitioner and their employing authority and should
satisfy local clinical governance probity.Patient identifier/label
