Guideline for the use of Carbetocin to prevent postpartum haemorrhage in caesarean birth v1. 1

Carbetocin is recommended to prevent post-partum haemorrhage following caesarean birth in theatre. It may be used instead of, not in addition to, oxytocin. Carbetocin should be offered to all patients undergoing caesarean birth, unless contra-indicated. It is licensed in the UK for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony in patients having a caesarean birth under epidural or spinal anaesthesia.

Carbetocin must only be administered after the birth of the baby and as soon as possible after umbilical cord clamping. The dose is 100 micrograms to be given over 1 minute. Do not exceed 100 micrograms dose. Contraindications include pregnancy and labour before the birth of the baby, hypersensitivity to Carbetocin, and serious cardiovascular disorders. Cautions for use include cardiovascular disease, severe hypotension, and pre-eclampsia.

Carbetocin should be used cautiously in the presence of migraine, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Common adverse effects may include nausea, headache, and hypotension. Training implications include using resources like the BNF and SPC Carbetocin. Monitoring arrangements should include compliance with the guidelines and reviewing cases of incidents.
