Key recommendations:
- Diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of membranes is made by maternal history followed by a sterile speculum examination.
- Consider performing an IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test of vaginal fluid if no amniotic fluid is observed on examination.
- Antibiotic (preferably erythromycin) should be given for 10 days or until the woman is in established labor.
- Corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks' gestation.
- Diagnosis of chorioamnionitis in women with PPROM should be based on a combination of clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate.
- Expectant management until 37+0 weeks should be offered to women with PPROM after 24+0 weeks' gestation.
- Intravenous magnesium sulfate should be offered to women with PPROM and in established labor between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks' gestation.

Background and scope:
- PPROM complicates up to 3% of pregnancies and is associated with preterm births.
- Median latency after PPROM is 7 days.
- Guidelines cover the diagnosis, assessment, care, and timing of birth for women with suspected PPROM from 24+0 to 36+6 weeks' gestation.

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis of PPROM is made by maternal history and sterile speculum examination.
- Testing for IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 may guide further management.
- Ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume is unclear.
- Vaginal swab for microbiological testing is routine practice.

Assessment:
- Clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate should be used to diagnose chorioamnionitis.
- Women should be advised and observed for symptoms of clinical chorioamnionitis.
- Neonatologists should be informed when delivery is anticipated.

Management:
- Erythromycin should be given for 10 days or until the woman is in established labor.
- Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered based on gestational age.
- Consideration of corticosteroid administration should be evaluated on an individual basis.

NG25 recommends corticosteroids between 24+0 and 25+6 weeks' gestation for women at risk of preterm birth. Repeat courses should be considered based on interval since last course, gestational age, and likelihood of birth in the next 48 hours. Magnesium sulfate should be offered between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks for neuroprotection of the baby. Tocolytic agents are not recommended for PPROM. Women can be monitored at home based on individual factors. Amnioinfusion is not recommended routinely. Emotional support should be offered to women with PPROM. Delivery should be considered after 24+0 weeks' gestation, with expectant management until 37+0 weeks. In subsequent pregnancies following PPROM, care should be provided by an obstetrician with an interest in preterm birth. Further research is needed on various aspects of PPROM management. Auditable topics include offering antibiotics, corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, discussions with a neonatologist, and birthing in a suitable facility.
