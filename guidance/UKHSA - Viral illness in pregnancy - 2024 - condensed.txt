Guidance on the investigation, diagnosis and management of viral illness in pregnancy, including syphilis and exposure to viral rash illness. This guidance aims to assist in decision making for pregnant women with rash illness or exposure to rash illness. It covers laboratory investigation, management of different types of rashes in pregnancy, and considerations for pregnant women in contact with rash illnesses. It also includes information on occupational exposure, antibody screening, and inadvertent immunization during pregnancy. This guidance does not cover HIV or HSV infection in pregnancy.

Maternal shingles on the chest, abdomen, or exposed areas pose a risk of natal transmission to the baby. Rubella is rare in the UK, with potential risks to the fetus if contracted during pregnancy. Primary rubella in the first 16 weeks of gestation is associated with major congenital abnormalities. Maternal reinfection with rubella poses a minimal risk to the fetus. Enterovirus infections may have various manifestations, including vertical transmission in pregnancy. Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnant women does not have adverse consequences for the fetus. Primary EBV infection in pregnancy does not pose a specific risk to the fetus. CMV infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital infection in the fetus. COVID-19 infection is not discussed further, but pregnant women are recommended to be vaccinated. Syphilis in pregnancy can lead to transmission to the fetus, with potential severe outcomes. Pregnant women with rash illness should be referred for medical management and laboratory investigation. Laboratory investigation and management should be tailored to pregnant women, with clear communication and documentation. Maculopapular rashes in pregnancy should be investigated after 20 weeks gestation to manage potential risks to contacts and confirm the date of infection.

Guidance on the investigation, diagnosis, and management of viral illness in pregnancy includes specific laboratory investigations for rubella, parvovirus B19, syphilis, and measles based on clinical suspicion. Management of confirmed infections, such as parvovirus B19, involves specialist advice and monitoring to prevent complications. Neonates born to mothers with measles should receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Rubella and syphilis are notifiable diseases and require specific laboratory testing for confirmation. Management of confirmed rubella and syphilis infections in pregnancy depends on individual circumstances and gestation. Chickenpox in pregnancy requires urgent clinical assessment and may necessitate antiviral treatment depending on the onset of rash and severity of symptoms. Delivery by caesarean section may be considered in severe cases. Management of proven chickenpox exposure in utero is uncertain, and termination is not recommended without prenatal diagnosis.

Fetal varicella syndrome can be diagnosed through sonographic testing, with the option of abortion available. Neonates exposed to chickenpox should receive VZIG prophylaxis, with consideration for intravenous aciclovir in high-risk cases. Breastfeeding is safe for mothers with chickenpox or shingles. Pregnant women in contact with rash illnesses should be promptly assessed for post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibody screening is recommended for women planning pregnancy to ensure immunity to certain illnesses. Universal screening for past infections in pregnant women is not recommended.

Rubella immunity should be established at booking by checking for documented evidence of 2 doses of a rubella-containing vaccine. All those without such evidence should be offered MMR vaccination post-partum. It is good practice to establish and record whether there is a firm history of chickenpox or shingles at booking. Live shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is not recommended during pregnancy. Surveillance of inadvertent administration of MMR, chickenpox, and shingles vaccine is being conducted by the UKHSA.
