Guideline for use of Carbetocin  to prevent  
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in caesarean birth  
 
 
 
1.0  Introduction    
  
Carbetocin is a synthetic analogue of oxytocin, with a significantly longer duration of action.  Carbetocin is 
intended for use only in well -equipped specialist obstetric units with experienced and qualified staff avail a-
ble.  
 
2.0  Purpose    
  
Carbetocin is recommended to prevent post -partum haemorrhage following caesarean birth in theatre. It 
may be used  instead of, not in addition to, oxytocin.  Carbetocin should be offered to all patients undergoing 
caesarean birth, unless contra -indicated (see section 5.1 ).  
  
It is licensed in the uk for prevention of postpartu m haemorrhage due to uterine atony in patients having a 
caesarean birth under  epidural or spinal anaesthesia.  
 
3.0 Definitions   
  
PPH postpartum haemorrhage   
ED90 Effective dose in 90% of people   
 
4.0 Responsibilities, accountabilities and duties     
  
  
 Theatre/ODP team – maintenance of stock levels and storage .  
 
 Anaesthetist – appropriate preparation, administration and documentation on anaesthetic and 
drug charts when used. Further management of uterine atony/post partum haemorrhage if appl i-
cable .  
 
 Obstetrician – management of 3rd stage of birth, monitoring uterine tone, management of uterine 
atony/post partum haemorrhage if applicable, documentation of findings and plan.   
 
 Midwife – monitoring uterine tone and lochia, escalation of concerns, initial m anagement of ute r-
ine atony/post partum haemorrhage if applicable. Documentation of findings .  
 
 
5.0  How to give Carbetocin   
  
Carbetocin must only be administered after the birth  of the baby  and as soon as possible after umbilical 
cord clamping.

Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
  
Dose is 100 micrograms to be given over 1 minute.   It is recommended to dilute 1 ml Carbetocin with 9 mls 
0.9% sodium chloride making it up to 10mls total volume for administration; flush cannula after administr a-
tion.   
 
Caesarean following labour augmente d with oxytocin infusion:   Ensure any intrapartum oxytocin inf u-
sion has been discontinued then give 100 microgram dose as above.   
 
Low risk elective caesarean only:   Consider dose reduction to 20 -50 micrograms  (2-5 mls)   
 (ED90 ≤ 20 mcgs  if not in labour with low risk of PPH)   
 May still give up to 100mcgs if required.   
  
  
DO NOT exceed 100mcgs dose, if further uterotonic required use second  agent .  
DO NOT give oxytocin bolus or infusion within 4 hours of Carbetocin administration.   
DO NOT give Carbetocin prior to the birth of the baby.   
 
5.1 Contraindications   
 
 During pregnancy and labour before birth of the baby .  
 Carbetocin must not be used for the induction of labour.   
 Hypersensitivity to Carbetocin, oxytocin or to any of the exci pients .  
 Hepatic or renal disease   
 Serious cardiovascular disorders   
 Epilepsy   
 Severe e clampsia , pre-eclampsia  (where concern for cardiovascular stability exists)  
 
  
5.2 Cautions for use  
 
 Cardiovascular disease (avoid if severe)    
 Severe hypotension    
 Hyponatraemia or water intoxication*   
 Pre-eclampsia or eclampsia*    
 General Anaesthesia   
 Hyponatraemia   
 Migraine   
 Asthma   
 
Elimination half -life of Carbetocin is >40 minutes ( compared with  1-6 minutes for oxytocin), clinical effect 
apparent for up to 4 hou rs, therefore no need for bolus or infusion of oxytocin and if uterine tone remains 
inadequate following administration of 100mcgs, 2nd line agent should be used.  
 
Initial studies for the efficacy of Carbetocin excluded women and people under GA and therefore its license 
does not include GA .

* Oxytocin use has been linked to water intoxication and hyponatraemia. This may manifest with neurolog i-
cal symptoms including seizures hence the cautions in these groups of women  and people .  Although this 
risk could theoretically exist for Carbetocin, its in vitro affinity for the human vasopressin V2 receptor is 
much lower than that of oxytocin, and to date there have been no cases in the literature linking Carbetocin 
with hyponatraemia and water intoxication.   
 
The use of Carbetocin at any stage before birth of the baby is not appropriate because its uterotonic activity 
persists for several hours. This is in marked contrast to the rapid reduction of effect observed after disco n-
tinuation of an oxytocin infusion .  
 
In case of persistent vaginal or uterine bleeding after administration of Carbetocin the cause must be d e-
termined. Consideration should be given to causes such as retained placental fragments, perineal, vaginal 
and cervix lacerations, inadequate repair  of the uterus, or disorders of blood coagulation.   
 
Carbetocin is intended for single  administration only, intramuscular or intravenous. In case of intravenous 
administration, it must be administered slowly over 1 minute. In case of persisting uterine hyp otonia or at o-
nia and the consequent excessive bleeding, additional therapy with uterotonic should be considered.  
 
Animal studies have shown carbetocin to possess some antidiuretic activity (vasopressin activity: <0,025 
IU/vial) and therefore the possibility of hyponatraemia cannot be excluded, particularly in patients also r e-
ceiving large volumes of intravenous fluids. The early signs of drowsiness, listlessness and headache 
should be recognised to prevent convulsions and coma.   
 
In general, Carbetocin should be used cautiously in the presence of migraine, asthma and cardiovascular 
disease or any state in which a rapid addition to extracellular water may produce hazard for an already 
overburdened system.    
 
5.3 Drug  interactions   
 
During clinical trials, Carbetocin has been administered in association with a number of analgesics, spa s-
molytics and agents used for epidural or spinal anaesthesia, and no drug interactions have been identified. 
However specific interaction studies have n ot been undertaken.  
  
Since Carbetocin is closely related in structure to oxytocin, the occurrence of interactions known to be a s-
sociated with oxytocin cannot be excluded. Severe hypertension has been reported when oxytocin was 
given 3 to 4 hours following  prophylactic administration of a vasoconstrictor in conjunction with caudal -block 
anaesthesia.   
 
During combination with ergot -alkaloids, such as methylergometrine, oxytocin and Carbetocin may e n-
hance the blood pressure enhancing effect of these agents. I f oxytocin or methylergometrine are admini s-
tered after Carbetocin there may be a risk of cumulative exposure.   
 
Since it has been found that prostaglandins potentiate the effect of oxytocin, it is expected that this can also 
occur with Carbetocin. Therefore, it is not recommended that prostaglandins and Carbetocin be used t o-
gether. If they are concomitantly administered, the patient should be carefully monitored.

Some inhalation -anaesthetics , such as halothane and cyclopropane may enhan ce the hypotensive effect 
and weaken the effect of Carbetocin on the uterus. Arrhythmias have been reported for oxytocin during 
concomitant use.    
 
 
5.4 Common adverse effects  
  
System   Very Common   
1/10  Common   
>1/100 and < 1/10   
Blood/lymphatic system     Anaemia   
CNS   Headache, tremor   Dizziness   
GI  nausea     
Vascular disorders   Hypotension, flushing     
Respiratory     Chest pain, dyspnoea   
Skin/subcutaneous   Pruritis     
Musculoskeletal     Back pain   
General   Feeling of warmth   Chills, pain   
  
Carbetocin has some antidiuretic action so could lead to hyponatraemia in patients receiving large 
volumes of fluid. Watch for signs of drowsiness, headache which are early warning signs of  
potential convulsion or coma.
