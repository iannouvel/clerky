The UH Sussex Perinatal Mental Health Guideline provides guidance for maternity staff on detecting and managing perinatal mental health risks and care pathways. It was developed by senior midwifery staff, obstetric consultants, and obstetric anaesthetists. The guideline is intended for use by all obstetric and midwifery staff. It supports the CNST Maternity Standards, Care Quality Commission, NICE 2020 Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health, and CEMACE Saving Mothers Lives 2006 – 2008. The document was approved in March 2023, uploaded on 4th May 2023, and will be reviewed in September 2025. The guideline applies to any woman and birthing person requiring mental health support. It includes protocols for midwives and obstetricians to follow and responsibilities of management to ensure the protocol is reviewed, accessible, and available for service users on request. Key definitions include anxiety disorders, baby, perinatal, postpartum psychosis, psychotropic medication, severe mental illness, and traumatic birth.

This clinical guideline advises healthcare providers on managing mental health problems in pregnant individuals and women during pregnancy and the immediate postnatal period. The aim is to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality using evidence-based practice and multidisciplinary collaboration. It emphasizes that poor mental health is a leading cause of maternal death during the perinatal period and highlights the need for effective identification and management of mental health problems. 

The guideline states that the level of care for pregnant individuals with mental health problems should be the same as for anyone with a mental health problem. It also recommends the prediction, detection, and management of mental health problems for these individuals. 

Increased contact with health services during pregnancy provides an opportunity for identifying those with mental illness or at an increased risk of developing one. Risk factors include past psychiatric history and current mental disorder or symptoms. 

The guideline highlights the importance of asking about any current or previous mental health issues during the booking stage. It also provides a list of questions to determine current depression and anxiety. If the pregnant individual answers 'yes' to one or more detection questions and would like help, they should be directed to the maternal mental health antenatal care pathway. 

All healthcare professionals should follow the antenatal care pathway and the urgent review pathway. If a woman or pregnant person's mental health problem is mild to moderate, a referral to NHS Talking Therapy should be considered.

The Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service (SPMHS) is a community-based service for pregnant women and people with severe mental health difficulties during pregnancy and up to a year after birth. Referrals should include those prescribed mood stabilising or antipsychotic medication seeking preconception advice, those with a fear of childbirth not linked to previous traumatic birth, those with a past or current history of severe mental illness, and those with personal or family history of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis or severe postnatal depression. 

The Healthy Futures Team is a Specialist Public Health Nursing Service that improves health outcomes for disadvantaged families in Brighton & Hove. The team delivers the Healthy Child Programme to families meeting certain criteria including antenatal mothers and pregnant people under 18 at conception, those subject to a pre-birth child protection conference, parents with a history of being looked after, and refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants and Travellers who are pregnant or with a child under 19. 

The Perinatal Bereavement Service is available to anyone who has experienced a stillbirth or neonatal loss within the last year. 

To maintain maternal emotional wellbeing, measures include encouraging skin-to-skin contact, prevention of separation from the family unit, regular pain assessment and management, good diet and rest, awareness of support services, appropriate communication with healthcare professionals, and use of trauma-informed care by staff. 

High risk women and pregnant people should be referred to the SPMHS in early pregnancy and should have a 32 week pre-birth planning meeting. A perinatal mental health care plan should be drawn up after this meeting. 

In a psychiatric emergency, the Hospital Mental Health Liaison Team must be contacted to conduct an assessment and plan ongoing care. The woman/person must not be left unattended and their family must be kept informed. The needs of the baby must be safeguarded and documentation should be detailed and concise. Admission to a psychiatric unit may be arranged either with the woman/person’s consent, or if severely ill and unwilling to be admitted, may be admitted involuntarily under the Mental Health Act (1983).

Mother and Baby Unit (MBU) should be the first consideration for admission. If suspected psychosis occurs in the community, follow the Urgent Review Pathway and notify relevant healthcare professionals. If support services are delayed, consider transfer to Accident & Emergency for assessment by the Hospital Mental Health Liaison Team. Admission to a psychiatric unit may be arranged either with the patient's consent or involuntarily under the Mental Health Act (1983) if they are severely ill. The patient and their family must be kept informed. Safeguard the baby's needs. Documentation should be detailed and concise. 

Patients with tocophobia should be referred for further assessment. High risk patients should have all teams informed of discharge. Patients should always have the opportunity of being seen alone, and professional interpreters should be used when there are language barriers. 

Healthcare staff must ensure that patients have the mental capacity to make decisions regarding their care. When giving advice about medication in pregnancy and breastfeeding, the risks and benefits should be considered based on the best available evidence. Decisions on medication should be made after careful review of the benefits and risks to both mother and infant. Patients who are prescribed multiple medications and already under the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service need no further action. 

For guidelines regarding specific medication see the Perinatal Mental Health: Prescribing Guidance for Trust Prescribers and GPs.

Medicines in pregnancy should be carefully assessed for risk versus benefit. Both pre-existing and new conditions need careful management during pregnancy, with resources available on the Specialist Pharmacy Service website. 

Specific medications with cautions include: 

- Carbamazepine, which is not routinely prescribed during pregnancy due to risk of neural tube defects and other malformations. If continued, a growth scan at 32 weeks is advised.
- Lamotrigine, which is not routinely prescribed during pregnancy due to risk of oral cleft, and is not recommended for breastfeeding due to risk of dermatological problems in the infant.
- Lithium, which should be avoided, especially in the first trimester. If continued, it must be under secondary care supervision with regular serum level checks. Women taking lithium should have a growth scan at 32 weeks and plan for delivery in a hospital.
- Paroxetine, which should be stopped if planning a pregnancy or if an unplanned pregnancy occurs, as it is associated with foetal heart defects.
- Sodium Valproate, which is contraindicated in pregnancy due to high risk of neural tube defects and potential for affecting intellectual development.
- Olanzapine and Quetiapine, which are associated with weight gain and gestational diabetes, requiring close monitoring during pregnancy.
- Venlafaxine, which is used in treatment-resistant patients, but requires close monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy.

When discussing medication in pregnancy, acknowledge uncertainty, explain risks of treating versus not treating mental health conditions, discuss risk of relapse, risks of stopping medication suddenly, and the importance of attachment and bonding. Respect the patient's decision to make an informed choice.

Research suggests that SSRIs are safe to take during pregnancy and do not increase the risk of behavioural problems in children. Women and birthing people prescribed single SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline) and where no other medications are prescribed should be advised that Sertraline, Citalopram and Fluoxetine are the preferred antidepressants for pregnancy and breastfeeding. If discontinuation is advised, contact SPMH Midwife. If further reassurance is needed, consider referral to SPMHT for medication review. 

Sources of information for medication in pregnancy include BUMPS, TOXBASE, LACTMED, and UK DRUGS IN LACTATION ADVISORY SERVICE (UKDILAS). Useful contacts include Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Midwife, Safeguarding Midwives, Counselling Midwife, Obstetric Mental Health Lead, Psychiatric Liaison Team, and Perinatal Mental Health Team. 

Areas for audit include ensuring appropriate action is taken for women/people with positive response to Whooley questions antenatally and postnatally, and that those with identified mental health concerns have a documented individual management plan of care during pregnancy/birth/postnatal period.

The clinical guideline includes references to various studies and resources related to perinatal mental health. It also outlines the antenatal care pathway for maternal/birthing parent mental health. Those with no previous mental health illness and no concerns at booking are given routine antenatal care with mental health monitoring at each contact. If mental health concerns are identified, referral to Time to Talk and GP contact is recommended. For cases with moderate to severe mental health issues, the guideline recommends referral to the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Team (SPMHT) and informing the GP. This includes those prescribed mood-stabilising or anti-psychotic medication, those with primary tocophobia, past or current severe mental illness, personal/family history of postnatal psychosis or severe postnatal depression. The guideline also provides a plan of care for ongoing mood monitoring and safeguarding alerts. For mild to moderate mental health issues, the guideline advises the person to see their GP in the first instance and continue monitoring mood at each antenatal contact.

The guideline outlines the antenatal care pathway for maternal/birthing parent mental health. If no mental health illness or concerns are present at booking, consider early referral for enhanced health visiting support and signpost to local social support. For moderate to severe cases, if any of the following are present: prescribed mood stabilising or antipsychotic medication, fear of childbirth not linked to previous traumatic birth, past or current symptoms of severe mental illness, or history of postnatal psychosis or severe depression, gain consent to refer to Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service (SPMHS). Document plan of care for on-going monitoring of mood and emotional wellbeing and consider any safeguarding or child protection issues.

For mild to moderate depression or anxiety, advise woman/birthing person to see her GP in the first instance and consider a referral to IAPT services. If prescribed antidepressant medication in pregnancy, continue to be monitored by their GP. Advise not to stop their medication without consulting their GP first and continue to monitor mood at each antenatal contact.

In urgent cases where a woman/person shows signs of severe mental illness, psychosis or risky behaviours, notify the appropriate healthcare professionals and refer to the relevant mental health teams. If there is immediate risk to self or others, call police/ambulance to escort to A&E for urgent review. Document all clinical care and actions taken and notify the GP and Health Visitor.

Call the GP or go to A&E if you believe the mother/birthing parent is in crisis. Alternatively, call the Sussex Mental Healthline. In Brighton & Hove, the Mental Health Rapid Response Service (MHRRS) is available for those at risk of harming themselves or others. For inpatient care, notify the Obstetric Consultant on-call, Specialist Mental Health Midwife, Safeguarding Midwife, Shift Coordinator and Manager on-call. Ensure both Obstetrician and Perinatal Psychiatrist are involved in patient’s care. PRH and RSCH have Adult Mental Health Liaison Services available. 

Appendix 3 provides a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess the patient's mental health. 

Appendix 4 is a Hospital Mental Health Liaison Referral Form, which includes sections for referrer details, patient details, admission details, reasons for referral, and a risk screening checklist.

Appendix 5 introduces the Healthy Futures Team, a 0-19 Specialist Public Health Nursing Service in Brighton & Hove.

The team will deliver the Healthy Child Programme (0 -19) to families meeting the following criteria:
