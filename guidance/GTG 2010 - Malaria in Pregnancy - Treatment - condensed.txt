The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based information on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy is detrimental to the woman and her fetus, with risks including maternal and fetal mortality, miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, and maternal and fetal anaemia. Prompt treatment is necessary, with intravenous artesunate recommended for severe falciparum malaria, quinine and clindamycin for uncomplicated falciparum or mixed infections, and chloroquine for other species. Primaquine should not be used in pregnancy. Treatment should be prescribed by physicians, with hospitalization recommended for pregnant women with falciparum malaria due to the potential for rapid deterioration. Expert advice should be sought for severe or recurrent cases.

Blood films monitored every 24 hours, repeat if clinical deterioration. Severe malaria treated with IV artesunate or quinine. Uncomplicated malaria with oral quinine or Riamet®. For non-falciparum malaria, use oral chloroquine. Prevent relapse with chloroquine or primaquine. Weekly blood film screening recommended. Recurrent malaria treated with artemisinin derivatives. Monitor for hypoglycaemia, pulmonary oedema, anaemia, and bacterial infection. Severe malaria managed in high-dependency unit. Obstetric management includes monitoring fetal distress and preventing preterm labor. Placental histology and blood films for congenital malaria. Prompt and effective treatment reduces adverse effects on fetus. Maternal hypoglycemia should be excluded as cause of fetal distress. High fetal loss rate with malaria in pregnancy. Abnormalities in fetal and placental circulation noted.

In women with severe malaria, obstetric advice should be sought at an early stage. Fetal distress is common and can be related to malaria fever. Standard obstetric principles apply, with the life of the woman taking precedence. Acute malaria can cause thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Maternal malaria close to delivery can result in congenital malaria, which may present in the first weeks to months of life. Health authorities must be notified of malaria in pregnancy cases in the UK for further evaluation.

Summary:
- Early diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of malaria in pregnant women is vital to avoid malaria deaths.
- Symptoms of malaria in pregnancy include flu-like illness with fever/chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise.
- Urgent investigations include thick and thin blood films, malaria rapid antigen tests, and other laboratory tests.
- Treatment for non-falciparum malaria includes chloroquine, while for falciparum malaria, IV artesunate or IV quinine is recommended.
- IV artesunate is preferred over IV quinine for severe malaria in pregnancy, as it has shown a significant reduction in mortality rates.
- Treatment should not be delayed, and efforts should be made to obtain IV artesunate promptly.
- Clindamycin is not recommended as a standalone treatment for malaria in pregnancy.
- Quinine monotherapy is no longer recommended due to high failure rates.

Clindamycin should not be used in pregnancy. Patients may deteriorate under treatment, at which point, management should be upgraded to account for severity. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters ahead of quinine and clindamycin due to adverse effects and risk of non-compliance with the 7-day regimen. Artemisinins have been shown to be effective in pregnancy. Atovaquone-proguanil has been found to be safe and efficacious for uncomplicated P. falciparum in the second and third trimesters. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy. Weekly chloroquine can be given to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale before delivery. Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax should be treated similarly to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs are often reduced in late pregnancy, leading to under-dosing and poor therapeutic responses.

The persistence of Plasmodium falciparum in the placenta after apparently adequate therapy with quinine has been described. This phenomenon is described in the placenta of a 19-year-old woman with falciparum malaria, who was treated with a combination of quinidine and clindamycin. Although this therapy was effective and diminished her peripheral blood parasitemia, vast numbers of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were present in the maternal sinuses of the placenta. Additionally, rare Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes were also seen in the fetal blood of the placenta. Malaria in pregnancy and parasitic involvement of the placenta are reviewed, emphasizing that Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes may persist in the placenta even after clearance of parasites from the peripheral blood.
