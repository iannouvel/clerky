The UH Sussex Perinatal Mental Health Guideline provides guidance for staff within maternity on detection and identification of perinatal mental health risk and subsequent care pathways. It applies to any woman and birthing person requiring support with their mental health. Pregnant women and people have increased contact with health services, providing an opportunity for identification of mental illness or those at risk. It is important to ask about mental health history at booking, including past or present severe mental illness, postnatal mental health problems, and family history. Referrals to the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service should be documented and uploaded. NHS Talking Therapy is available for mild to moderate mental health problems. Women can self-refer or seek support in doing so.
