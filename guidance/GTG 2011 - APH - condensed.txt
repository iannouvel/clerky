Antepartum Haemorrhage
Bleeding from or in to the genital tract occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. Most important causes are placenta praevia and placental abruption. Complicates 3-5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Known association with cerebral palsy can be explained by preterm delivery. No consistent definitions of severity. Definitions used: Spotting, Minor haemorrhage, Major haemorrhage, Massive haemorrhage. Recurrent APH is when there are episodes on more than one occasion. No reliable prediction of APH. Risk factors for placental abruption and placenta praevia. Domestic violence in pregnancy may result in APH. Associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pregnancies with unexplained APH at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Women presenting with APH should be managed in a hospital maternity unit with resuscitation and emergency delivery capabilities.

Women presenting with APH should undergo clinical assessment to determine the need for urgent intervention to manage maternal or fetal compromise. Triage should include history-taking, assessment of vaginal bleeding, maternal cardiovascular condition, and fetal wellbeing. If major haemorrhage persists or the woman is unable to provide a history, immediate assessment and resuscitation of the mother should be prioritized. A full history should be taken to identify potential causes of bleeding. Abdominal and speculum examinations may be performed to assess the cause of bleeding. Maternal investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be conducted based on the severity of bleeding. Fetal investigations, including monitoring fetal heart rate and ultrasound scans, should be carried out to assess fetal wellbeing. Hospitalization and duration of stay should be determined based on the severity of bleeding. Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth. Tocolytic therapy should not be used in cases of major APH, and decisions regarding its use should be made by a senior obstetrician. Antenatal care should be altered following APH based on the cause of bleeding. Delivery should be considered based on the presence of maternal or fetal compromise.

In women with APH secondary to placenta praevia, management should include maternal resuscitation and delivery of the fetus to control bleeding. Delivery is usually by caesarean section, unless the woman is in established labor. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended for women in labor with active vaginal bleeding. Regional anesthesia is recommended for operative delivery, unless contraindicated. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated and active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Anti-D Ig should be given to all non-sensitized RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH. Management of massive APH should follow locally devised protocols and involve a multidisciplinary team. Fluid replacement and administration of blood products should follow guidelines for PPH. In cases of coagulopathy, clotting studies should be done and FFP and cryoprecipitate may be given. Women on anticoagulant therapy should have treatment reviewed urgently if they develop a hemorrhagic problem. Neonates should be assessed by a senior pediatrician/neonatologist in cases of major APH. In extremely preterm pregnancies with APH, conservative management is usually appropriate. Postnatal management should include thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, and clinical incident reporting. Obstetric skill drills should include management of major APH.

21. Suggested audit topics 
1. The administration of corticosteroids to women presenting with APH less than 34+6weeks of gestation.
2. Administration of anti-D Ig to non-sensitised RhD-negative women presenting with APH.
3. Percentage of women with APH referred for serial growth scans.
4. Management of the third stage of labour in women who had a major APH.
5. Appropriate training of the multidisciplinary team.

Initial management should follow the ABCD pathway. A high concentration of oxygen should be administered. Establish two intravenous lines and take a blood sample for diagnostic tests. The four pillars of management include communication, resuscitation, monitoring, and delivery of the fetus. Delivery of the fetus and placenta can control bleeding and remove placental tissue. Personnel required for management of massive APH include experienced midwives, obstetricians, anesthetists, and clinical hematologists. Fluid replacement and blood product administration should be based on the severity of hemorrhage. The main therapeutic goal is to maintain specific levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and clotting factors. Good practice points are recommended based on clinical experience. Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist in decision-making for specific conditions. The ultimate judgment for clinical procedures must be made by the attending healthcare provider.
