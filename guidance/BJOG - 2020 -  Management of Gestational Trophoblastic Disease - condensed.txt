Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease

How do molar pregnancies present?
The most common presentation is irregular vaginal bleeding, positive pregnancy test, and ultrasonographic evidence. Less common symptoms include hyperemesis, excessive uterine enlargement, hyperthyroidism, early-onset pre-eclampsia, and abdominal distension. Rarely, women may present with haemoptysis or seizures due to metastatic disease affecting the lungs or brain.

How are molar pregnancies diagnosed?
The definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination.

Removal of a molar pregnancy
Suction curettage is the preferred method for complete molar pregnancies. Ultrasound guidance is recommended. For partial molar pregnancies, suction curettage is preferred unless fetal parts are present, then medical removal can be considered.

Anti-D prophylaxis is recommended post-removal.

Preparation of the cervix and oxytocic infusions during removal should be done cautiously to avoid complications.

Repeat surgical removal may be necessary in cases of acute bleeding or retained pregnancy tissue.

Histological examination of pregnancy tissue is recommended for all miscarriages to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.

Elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin after a pregnancy event should prompt referral to a GTD center.

Investigation for GTN after non-molar pregnancies is necessary for persistent vaginal bleeding.

Management of suspected ectopic molar pregnancies should follow standard ectopic pregnancy protocols.

Women with combined molar pregnancies and viable twins should be referred to specialized centers.

Follow-up and treatment for GTN are based on specific scoring systems.

Contraception and fertility treatments should be approached cautiously post-treatment.

Long-term outcomes for women treated for GTN are generally positive.

Individualized support is available for women and families through GTD centers.

Women from Asia have a higher incidence of GTD compared to non-Asian women. The incidence of GTD is associated with age at conception, with extremes of age having higher rates. GTN may develop after a molar pregnancy, a non-molar pregnancy, or a live birth. In the UK, there is an effective registration and treatment program with high cure rates. Clinicians should be aware that outcomes for women with GTN and GTD are better with ongoing management from GTD centers. Molar pregnancies typically present with irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and supporting ultrasonographic evidence. The use of ultrasound in early pregnancy has led to earlier diagnosis of molar pregnancy. The definitive diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is made by histological examination. Suction curettage is the preferred method for removal of molar pregnancies. Preparation of the cervix prior to surgical removal is safe. Oxytocic infusions should be used cautiously during surgical removal. Repeat surgical removal may be indicated in cases of heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding. Histological examination of pregnancy tissue from all miscarriages is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.

- Pregnancy tissue does not need to be routinely sent for histological examination after therapeutic abortion if fetal parts have been identified.
- Women who undergo medical abortion should do a urinary pregnancy test 3 weeks after the procedure.
- Referral to a GTD center should be considered for women with persistently elevated hCG after pregnancy events.
- Any woman with persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding lasting more than 8 weeks after a pregnancy event should have a urine hCG test.
- Women with elevated hCG levels after a possible pregnancy event should be managed at a GTD center.
- Women with suspected ectopic molar pregnancy should be managed like any other ectopic pregnancy.
- Women with twin pregnancy of a viable fetus and presumptive coexistent molar pregnancy should be referred to a fetal medicine center and GTD center.
- Women with placental site trophoblastic tumor or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor should be registered and cared for at a GTD center.
- Women with atypical placental site nodule should have their histology reviewed centrally.
- All women diagnosed with GTD should be registered at GTD centers.
- Follow-up for GTD depends on the type of pregnancy event and hCG levels.
- Treatment for GTN may involve single-agent or multi-agent chemotherapy, based on the FIGO scoring system.
- Surgery may be an option for PSTT and ETT due to their characteristics.
- The interval between a complete or partial molar pregnancy and trying for another pregnancy should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Women following a successful pregnancy after a previous molar pregnancy are advised not to conceive until their follow-up is complete. Chemotherapy patients should wait 1 year after treatment before conceiving. Women with a pregnancy following a previous molar pregnancy that did not require treatment for GTN do not need to send a post-pregnancy hCG sample. The risk of another molar pregnancy is low, and women with a history of molar pregnancy are not at increased risk of maternal complications. However, they may have an increased risk of preterm birth, large-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. The long-term outcome for women treated for GTN is generally excellent, with an overall cure rate close to 100%. Further pregnancies are achieved in approximately 80% of women following treatment for GTN. Women treated with combination agent chemotherapy may have an increased risk of premature menopause. It is important for women to avoid pregnancy until hCG levels return to normal. Exogenous estrogens, fertility drugs, and hormone replacement therapy may be used once hCG levels have returned to normal. GTD centres provide individualized support to women and their families throughout their GTD journey.

Management or treatment guidelines should be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources, and limitations unique to the institution and local populations. Areas of clinical uncertainty may require further research. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using a standardized scheme. Recommendations were formulated based on the quality of evidence. Good Practice Points and Expert opinion were also considered in the development of this guideline.
