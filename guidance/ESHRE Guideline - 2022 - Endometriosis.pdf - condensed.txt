The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline for endometriosis to aid healthcare professionals in making appropriate and effective care decisions for patients. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age, with symptoms including pain and infertility. The guideline provides recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, including hormonal therapies, surgical options, and non-medical management strategies. There is a significant diagnostic void between symptom onset and diagnosis, with therapeutic options aimed at improving pain symptoms and fertility prospects. The guideline is the second update of the ESHRE Guidelines on Endometriosis, with some significant changes in clinical practice expected.

Treatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments such as combined hormonal contraceptives or progestogens, and surgical options. GnRH agonists and antagonists can also be considered as second-line treatments. Surgery, such as excision instead of ablation, cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma, and removal of deep endometriosis, may be recommended to reduce pain. Patients should be informed of potential risks and benefits before undergoing surgery.

33 Consider long-term consequences of early menopause when deciding on ovary removal. 
34 Total hysterectomy is preferred when performing hysterectomy. 
35 Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended for pain in endometriosis. 
36 Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered for pain in endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. 
37 Consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone and surgical treatments for endometriosis pain. 
39 Do not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility in infertile women with endometriosis. 
40 Postoperative hormone suppression should not be prescribed solely to enhance future pregnancy rates in women seeking pregnancy. 
41 Hormone therapy may be offered to infertile women with endometriosis who cannot or choose not to conceive immediately after surgery. 
42 Do not prescribe pentoxifylline or other anti-inflammatory drugs to improve natural pregnancy rates in infertile women with endometriosis. 
43 Consider operative laparoscopy for endometriosis-associated infertility in certain cases. 
44 Consider operative laparoscopy for endometrioma-associated infertility to increase chances of natural pregnancy. 
45 Consider operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. 
46 Factors to consider before surgery include pain symptoms, patient age, history of previous surgery, infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and Endometriosis Fertility Index. 
47 Intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation may increase pregnancy rates in infertile women with stage I/II endometriosis. 
48 Consider using IUI with ovarian stimulation in women with stage III/IV endometriosis with tubal patency. 
49 ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis in certain cases. 
50 GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols can be offered for ART based on patient and physician preferences. 
51 ART is safe for women with endometriosis and does not increase recurrence rates. 
52 Consider antibiotic prophylaxis during oocyte retrieval in women with endometrioma. 
53 Extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART is not recommended. 
54 Prolonged administration of COC/progestogens before ART is not recommended. 
55 Surgery before ART is not recommended for women with stage I/II endometriosis. 
56 Surgery for ovarian endometrioma before ART is not recommended. 
57 Surgery for endometrioma before ART can be considered for pain relief or accessibility of follicles. 
58 Consider surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions before ART for pain relief. 
59 Discuss fertility preservation with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. 
60 Pregnancy does not always lead to improvement of endometriosis symptoms. 
61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma in pregnancy to a specialized center. 
62 Be aware of increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. 
63 Be aware of endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy, although rare. 
64 Perform ovarian cystectomy for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain. 
65 Consider postoperative use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptive for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain. 
66 Offer long-term hormone treatment after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma in women not seeking immediate conception. 
67 Consider long-term administration of postoperative hormone treatment for prevention of deep endometriosis recurrence.

The guideline recommends treating women with a history of endometriosis after surgical menopause with combined estrogen-progestogen until natural menopause. Women with endometriosis who have undergone early surgical menopause are at increased risk of bone density loss, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Extrapelvic endometriosis symptoms include cyclical shoulder pain and cough. Surgical removal is preferred for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, while hormone treatment may be an option for thoracic endometriosis. Asymptomatic endometriosis should not be surgically treated or medically treated. Routine ultrasound monitoring can be considered. Lifestyle changes may help prevent endometriosis. Endometriosis does not significantly increase the risk of cancer overall, but it is associated with a higher risk of specific cancers. Women with endometriosis should not be overly concerned about cancer risk and should focus on general cancer prevention measures.

Individuals presenting with cyclical and non-cyclical signs and symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, haematuria, shoulder tip pain, catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough/haemoptysis/chest pain, cyclical scar swelling and pain, fatigue, and infertility should be considered for a diagnosis of endometriosis. Symptoms such as abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, dyspareunia, postcoital bleeding, and a history of ovarian cyst, irritable bowel syndrome, or pelvic inflammatory disease increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea has been found to be predictive of endometriosis in infertile women. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, may help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in patients with suspected endometriosis, but further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be considered even if the clinical examination is normal.

The guideline recommends clinical examination for the diagnosis of endometriosis and further diagnostic steps using medical technologies. Vaginal and/or rectovaginal examination may be inappropriate in certain situations and painful for some women. Biomarkers and imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI can be used for diagnosis, with laparoscopy considered the gold standard. Clinicians should consider laparoscopy if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful. Histology should confirm endometriotic lesions identified during laparoscopy.

The guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis, with a suggestion for comprehensive consensus criteria for diagnosis. Laparoscopy is the standard but costly and invasive, and empirical treatment with imaging can also be considered. Long-term monitoring may not be beneficial for preventing adverse outcomes, but individualized follow-up and psychological support are recommended. Research is needed for long-term management approaches for endometriosis.

In many cases, endometriosis can have a detrimental effect on the lives of affected women, their partners, and families. The negative impact of endometriosis-associated symptoms is complex and multidimensional. A retrospective study showed that women with surgically confirmed endometriosis reported a negative impact on different aspects of their life. Early diagnosis, followed by early treatment, may reduce pain, infertility risk, and provide an explanation for symptoms. Qualitative studies have shown that a diagnosis of endometriosis can lead to feelings of relief, empowerment, and understanding. Although studies on the benefits of early diagnosis are lacking, symptomatic women should receive treatment to relieve symptoms. Research is recommended to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on the quality of life of women with endometriosis.

Based on clinical trials, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have shown improvements in self-reported pain, dysmenorrhea, cyclical non-menstrual pain, dyspareunia, and dyschezia. Continuous use of OCP has been suggested as an effective treatment for endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea. A systematic review reported that continuous OCP use may be more efficacious for dysmenorrhea recurrence. Continuous OCP use is considered safe and can be offered to patients with endometriosis. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have also been found to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems or etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implants is recommended to reduce endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol should not be used due to its severe side effects. GnRH agonists have been found to be effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain symptoms. Different doses and regimens of GnRH agonists have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in treating endometriosis.

Summary:
- GnRH agonists have a poor side effect profile, including vaginal dryness, hot flushes, headaches, weight gain, and acne.
- Bone mineral density decreases with GnRH agonist treatment, but add-back therapy can prevent bone loss.
- GnRH antagonists, such as elagolix, relugolix, and linzagolix, are effective in reducing endometriosis-associated pain.
- Aromatase inhibitors, like letrozole and anastrozole, can reduce endometriosis-associated pain but have severe side effects.
- It is recommended to prescribe GnRH agonists as second-line treatment after hormonal contraceptives, and to consider add-back therapy to prevent bone loss.
- GnRH antagonists and aromatase inhibitors can be considered for women with endometriosis-associated pain refractory to other treatments.

Surgical treatment is recommended to reduce endometriosis-associated pain. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is superior to ablation for treating endometriosis. Superficial peritoneal endometriosis may be different from other forms and requires further study.

Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea was analyzed in a Cochrane review, showing that laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) did not offer additional benefits. Presacral neurectomy (PSN) showed significant benefits in improving dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain. However, PSN is associated with increased risk of adverse effects. 

For ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy is recommended over drainage and coagulation as it reduces recurrence of endometrioma and associated pain. Both cystectomy and CO2 laser vaporization have similar recurrence rates beyond the first year. Specific caution should be used to minimize ovarian damage during surgery. 

For deep endometriosis involving the bowel, treatment approaches include superficial shaving, discoid resection, and segmental resection of the bowel. Studies have shown improvement in pain and quality of life after surgery for colorectal endometriosis, with segmental bowel resection being a widely acceptable option. Standardized reporting methods are recommended for surgical trials for deep endometriosis.

Studies have shown significant improvements in pain and quality of life in women undergoing surgical removal of deep endometriosis. Complications are possible but can be managed. It is recommended to refer patients to a center of expertise and inform them of the potential risks and benefits of surgery. Different surgical approaches, such as shaving, discoid excision, and segmental resection, have been compared, with varying outcomes. Overall, surgery can improve outcomes for women with deep endometriosis, but careful consideration of the surgical approach is important.

The reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed significant improvement in pain symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder endometriosis and ureteral lesions resulted in significant improvement of pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy was found to be beneficial in reducing urinary retention. Hysterectomy with removal of all visible endometriosis lesions can be considered for women who no longer wish to conceive and have not responded to conservative treatments. Studies should evaluate factors that predict a meaningful improvement in pain symptoms after surgery.

Resection for colorectal endometriosis: correlation between histological pattern and clinical outcomes. Various studies on surgical treatment and outcomes of endometriosis. Studies on laparoscopic surgery, hysterectomy, and other surgical techniques for endometriosis. Long-term outcomes, quality of life, and pain relief after different surgical procedures for endometriosis. Randomized controlled trials comparing surgical techniques for endometriosis. Recommendations for the surgical treatment of endometriosis.

The guideline recommends that clinicians distinguish between short-term and long-term hormone treatment after surgery for endometriosis. Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended to improve surgical outcomes for pain. Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve surgical outcomes for pain in women not desiring immediate pregnancy. Clinicians should consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. Non-medical management strategies, such as acupuncture, are considered as complementary treatments but lack sufficient high-quality evidence to recommend for patients with endometriosis. More research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-medical management strategies for endometriosis.

A study comparing acupuncture for endometriosis found that verum acupuncture was more effective in reducing pain and improving psychological well-being compared to 'sham' acupuncture. However, overall evidence on acupuncture for endometriosis is limited and inconclusive. Physiotherapy, massage, and trigger point release therapy may be beneficial for pelvic floor dysfunction, but evidence is lacking for their effectiveness in endometriosis. Exercise may provide some relief for menstrual pain, but more research is needed on its effects for endometriosis-related pain. Electrotherapy and psychological interventions also show potential benefits, but more high-quality studies are needed to make recommendations for endometriosis treatment.

Participants were included up to 5 years after their laparoscopic diagnosis, with the majority indicating their post-endometriosis-treatment condition as "recovered" and no current symptoms collected. No recommendations can be made regarding the effectiveness of psychological approaches to improve pain and quality of life in women with endometriosis. Overall, reviews and studies on psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Nutrition and Traditional Chinese Medicine have limited evidence for improving quality of life and reducing pain in women with endometriosis. Recommendations suggest discussing non-medical strategies to address quality of life and psychological well-being in women with endometriosis, but no specific interventions are recommended due to unclear benefits and harms. Adequately designed trials are needed to define the potential benefits of non-medical interventions in endometriosis.

Women with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis associated pain, infertility, or both. For clarity, the GDG decided to separately discuss the evidence on pain as the outcome in chapter II; infertility as an outcome is addressed in this chapter. The first part of this chapter deals with treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility, that is, treatments that improve the spontaneous pregnancy rate. In the last part of the chapter, the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcome is discussed, as well as indications for ART after surgery, and indications for fertility preservation.

III.1. Medical treatment
PICO QUESTION: ARE HORMONE/MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIOSIS-ASSOCIATED INFERTILITY?
The question as to whether hormone therapy has any role in the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility has been thoroughly evaluated. The review does not evaluate individual hormone treatments used in the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis but considers as a group all therapies that result in ovarian suppression. In the analysis evaluating the effect on pregnancy rate after the use of any ovulation suppression agent versus placebo or no treatment, the review reported no evidence of benefit on pregnancy outcomes. Thus, it is clear that as sole treatment for endometriosis-associated infertility, recognized therapies that suppress ovulation in general are ineffective and should not be used.

Recommendation (39)
In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility.

III.1.b. Hormone or medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy
Although ovarian suppression in general does not appear to have an advantage on subsequent fertility, it is still of interest to evaluate whether in the perioperative period ovarian suppression may have an added benefit. The effectiveness of medical therapies for hormone suppression before, after, or both before and after therapeutic surgery for endometriosis for increasing pregnancy rates has been assessed. The review concludes that surgery plus postsurgical medical therapy probably increases pregnancy rate compared to surgery plus placebo or no medical therapy. Women seeking pregnancy should not be prescribed postoperative hormone suppression with the sole purpose to enhance future pregnancy rates. Those women who cannot attempt to or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery may be offered hormone therapy as it does not negatively impact their fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain.

In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions in improving pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Surgical treatment, specifically laparoscopic surgery, could be considered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in certain cases to improve the rate of ongoing pregnancy. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age, previous surgeries, and ovarian reserve. Research is needed to evaluate the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis in improving natural pregnancy rates. Before and after surgery, patients should be counseled on their chances of achieving pregnancy, and the Endometriosis Fertility Index can be used to predict non-ART pregnancy rates after surgery.

The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their postoperative non-ART pregnancy rates. It is reproducible and cost-effective, and can help reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, ART, or other fertility management options for women with endometriosis-related infertility. It is recommended to use the EFI for better patient phenotyping in studies on surgical treatment and/or the place of medically assisted reproduction in endometriosis-related infertility. Studies should clarify whether IUI with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women with endometriosis. In women with AFS/ASRM stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may consider performing intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation to increase pregnancy rates. In patients with moderate to severe endometriosis, the benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI is unclear. Studies should further investigate the value of EFI to predict the relevance of IUI in women with endometriosis.

be recommended. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous combined oral contraceptive/progestogens as a pre-treatment to ART to increase live birth rates. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medical therapies in improving outcomes for women with endometriosis undergoing ART.

The use of OC P or progestogens as a pre-treatment before ART for improving ART outcomes is limited. However, it can still be used for planning purposes. Surgery for endometriosis prior to ART may improve reproductive outcomes, but more data is needed to confirm its benefits. Surgical therapies for peritoneal, ovarian, and deep endometriosis prior to ART may not significantly improve live birth rates and could have negative impacts on ovarian reserve. Surgery for endometrioma can be considered for pain relief or improved accessibility of follicles. The decision to offer surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART should be guided by pain symptoms and patient preference.

Symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis may consider surgical removal of lesions. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery, and complication rates are discussed in detail. Non-medical interventions for infertility in endometriosis have unclear benefits. Fertility preservation should be discussed with women with severe endometriosis. Pregnancy can have a positive effect on symptoms of endometriosis.

Endometriotic lesions in pregnancy may present changes in appearance, ranging from complete disappearance to increased growth. Decidualization of endometriotic lesions can occur during pregnancy, but atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis are also possible. Management includes serial monitoring and expectant management, with surgery recommended if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy may not always result in benefits for women with endometriosis. Endometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, and referral to a specialized center is recommended if atypical findings are observed. Complications from pre-existing endometriosis lesions during pregnancy are rare but may require surgical management. There is an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms suggestive of these complications in the first trimester. Larger studies are needed to assess the impact of surgery on pregnancy outcomes in women with endometriosis. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy associated with endometriosis, such as gestational diabetes and preterm birth, are reported but findings are conflicting. Placenta praevia and hypertensive disorders may be more common in women with endometriosis during pregnancy. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes.

Women with endometriosis may have higher odds of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, stillbirth, and Caesarean section. They may also be more likely to have babies small for gestational age and experience obstetric hemorrhages. However, the association between endometriosis and these complications is not definitive. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, but they do not currently warrant increased antenatal monitoring. Further research is needed to better define obstetric risks for women with endometriosis. Recurrence rates of endometriosis vary widely, and risk factors include surgery-associated variables and patient-related factors. Surgical techniques for prevention of recurrence include ovarian cystectomy for endometrioma.

Cystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma in women with a strong recommendation for cystectomy. Hormone treatment after surgery can prevent recurrence of endometriosis-associated pain and endometrioma. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptives are recommended for at least 18-24 months for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea. Long-term hormone treatment can also be considered for the prevention of endometrioma and endometriosis-associated symptoms. ART in women with deep endometriosis does not increase recurrence and can be performed to achieve pregnancy. The choice of treatment should consider patient preferences, costs, risks, and side effects.

IV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis:
Medical treatment options for recurrent endometriosis after surgery include dienogest, depot leuprolide acetate, desogestrel, OCP, cyproterone acetate, and nafarelin. Studies have shown varying efficacy and side effects for these treatments, with some showing improvements in symptoms and disease progression. Surgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis is less studied, with limited evidence on its efficacy and safety. Hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis.

V. Endometriosis and adolescence:
Endometriosis in adolescents is challenging to diagnose, with a delay in diagnosis compared to adults. Risk factors for adolescent endometriosis include family history, genital malformations, early menarche, and short menstrual cycles. Clinicians should consider these risk factors and take a careful history when evaluating adolescents for endometriosis.

In adolescents, a careful history should be taken to consider symptoms such as chronic or acyclical pelvic pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dysuria, and dyspareunia as suggestive of endometriosis. Diagnosis in adolescents may differ from adults, with a more varied pain pattern. Imaging with transvaginal ultrasound is recommended, but alternatives may be considered based on cultural background. Serum biomarkers are not recommended for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. Diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered in adolescents with negative imaging and unsuccessful medical treatments. Biopsies should be taken during laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis histologically, as negative histology does not rule out the disease entirely.

In adolescents with endometriosis-related pain, hormonal contraceptives or progestogens are recommended as first-line therapy. NSAIDs can be considered if hormonal treatment is not an option. GnRH agonists may be used if initial hormone therapy fails. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions can be considered for symptom management, but recurrence rates may be significant. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended by experienced surgeons. Long-term treatment with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery may also be effective.

In adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians should consider postoperative hormone therapy to suppress recurrence of symptoms. Combined surgical and hormone treatment may retard disease progression in adolescents, but a second laparoscopy may be needed due to increasing pain symptoms. Fertility preservation options should be discussed with adolescents with endometriosis, although the true benefit and safety remain unknown. Clinicians should be aware that endometriosis can still be active after menopause, and treatment in postmenopausal women should consider the potential risk of underlying malignancy. Surgical treatment may be effective and safe in women with a history of endometriosis.

2007, Pavone and Bulun, 2012). Limited options are available for medical treatment in postmenopausal women with endometriosis, including analgesics or aromatase inhibitors.

Surgical treatment for postmenopausal women with endometriosis has shown improvement in pain symptoms, with some cases of malignancy found. Consideration of malignancy should be taken in postmenopausal women with endometriosis.

Aromatase inhibitors may be considered as a treatment option for postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain if surgery is not feasible.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis is not well studied, but MHT is considered effective for vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy.

There is a small association between MHT and recurrence of endometriosis in postmenopausal women, with some cases of malignancy reported. Continuous combined estrogen-progestogen or tibolone regimes may be preferable over unopposed estrogen.

Limited evidence suggests that continuous estrogen-progestogen may be beneficial in limiting abnormal estrogen-induced endometriosis proliferation in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Tibolone could be a safe alternative for combined MHT.

Abdominal wall endometriosis is commonly associated with prior gynecologic surgeries and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These imaging modalities are also useful for diagnosing umbilical endometriosis. For thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES), diagnosis is typically based on clinical symptoms with a cyclical pattern.

Catamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. Pneumothorax is mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in a high percentage of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain, with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, with hormone treatment as an option. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis, with surgery performed in a multidisciplinary manner.

Women with incidental findings of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment unless there is evidence of disease progression. Surgical treatment is not recommended due to associated risks, and medical treatment is not advised in the absence of disease progression. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical excision/ablation. Routine monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis with ultrasound can be considered. 

For primary prevention of endometriosis, women can be advised to aim for a healthy lifestyle and diet, with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity. The use of hormonal contraceptives for primary prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk should only be done in a research setting. Further research is needed to understand the genetic background of endometriosis and develop validated tests for diagnosis and prevention.

Endometriosis shares features with cancer, but the overall risk of cancer in patients with endometriosis is not significantly higher. There is a slightly increased risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer, but the absolute risk increase is low. Clinicians should reassure patients about their low cancer risk and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Research is needed to explore the association between endometriosis and cancer further.

Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy could be performed, but the data show only a small increased risk compared to the general population. Regular screening for other types of malignancy is not justified. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis for guidance on monitoring.

Surgery for endometriosis may reduce the future risk of ovarian cancer, especially with complete excision of visible endometriosis. Excision of affected ovaries may have a greater risk reduction effect. Consideration should be given to bilateral oophorectomy if endometriosis involves both ovaries.

The guideline for Endometriosis in 2022 provides recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Recommendations are labeled as either strong or weak, and considerations for evidence, acceptability, cost, benefits vs harms, and patient values are discussed. Good practice points are based on expert opinions. The guideline underwent a review process and will be disseminated through various channels. Updates to the guideline will be considered in 2025. The guideline also includes flowcharts for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. Pregnancy and endometriosis are discussed, with considerations for monitoring and risks. Stakeholder reviews were conducted, and the guideline is copyrighted by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.
