Antenatal diagnosis and care of women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
- Risk factors for placenta praevia include caesarean delivery, assisted reproductive technology, and maternal smoking.
- Midpregnancy fetal anomaly scan should include placental localization.
- Transvaginal scanning is superior for diagnosis.
- Cervical length measurement can aid in management decisions.
- Tailor antenatal care for women with recurrent bleeding.
- Hospital admission should consider risk factors for venous thromboembolism.
- Women should be informed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience bleeding.
- Asymptomatic women should be counseled on risks and have safety precautions in place.
- Cervical cerclage is not recommended.
- Antenatal corticosteroids may be offered at certain gestational ages.
- Tocolytics may be considered to facilitate corticosteroid administration.
- Delivery timing should be based on individual circumstances and symptoms.
- Vaginal delivery may be appropriate in certain cases.
- Discussion on delivery plans and potential complications should occur prior to delivery.
- Delivery should be arranged in a unit with blood transfusion services and critical care.
- Care for women with atypical antibodies should involve discussions with a hematologist.
- Prevention and treatment of anemia is recommended.
Delivery for women with placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta
- Planned caesarean section should be performed by an experienced operator.
- Senior obstetrician and anaesthetist should be present for planned caesarean section.
- Regional anesthesia is preferred for caesarean delivery.
- Close liaison with the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential.
- Cell salvage may be used for women at risk of significant blood loss.
- Consider vertical incisions for cesarean delivery to avoid the placenta.
- Use ultrasound to determine placental location and uterine incision.
- Hysterectomy may be necessary if conservative measures fail to control bleeding.
- Immediate access to blood products and fluid warming devices is recommended.

Uterus preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by surgeons working in teams with appropriate expertise to manage such cases and after appropriate counselling regarding risks and with informed consent. There are currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of ureteric stents in placenta accreta spectrum. The use of stents may have a role when the urinary bladder is invaded by placental tissue. Women with placenta percreta should be informed of the high risk of complications, including the need for secondary hysterectomy. Leaving the placenta in situ should be considered if elective peripartum hysterectomy is unacceptable. Regular review, ultrasound examination, and access to emergency care should be arranged when the placenta is left in situ. Methotrexate adjuvant therapy should not be used for expectant management. Interventional radiology should only be considered when larger studies determine its safety and efficacy. Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum who decline blood transfusion should be cared for in a unit with interventional radiology services. In cases of unsuspected placenta accreta spectrum, emergency hysterectomy should be performed if the placenta is left in situ. If placenta percreta is discovered during an elective repeat caesarean section, the procedure should be delayed until appropriate resources are available. Placenta praevia and placenta accreta are associated with high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of placenta praevia is influenced by factors such as prior caesarean deliveries, ART, and maternal smoking. Screening for placenta praevia or a low-lying placenta should be done during routine fetal anomaly scans, with follow-up ultrasound examinations if necessary. Placental "migration" can result in the resolution of low-lying placenta in most cases before term. Twin pregnancies with placenta praevia diagnosed in the second trimester may resolve by 32 weeks of gestation.

In the third trimester, ultrasound examinations for placenta praevia should be tailored based on risk factors. Transvaginal ultrasound is superior for diagnosis and should be used for women with persistent low-lying placenta. Cervical length measurement can help predict preterm delivery and hemorrhage. Women with asymptomatic placenta praevia can be managed as outpatients. Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended between 34-36 weeks of gestation. Tocolysis may be considered to facilitate corticosteroid administration, but should not be used to prolong gestation. Delivery should be considered between 36-37 weeks for women with uncomplicated placenta praevia. The risk of hemorrhage increases with advancing gestational age. Neonatal outcomes are not significantly impacted by early delivery.

Women with a low-lying placenta should consider mode of delivery based on clinical background, preferences, and ultrasound findings. Delivery for women with placenta praevia should be discussed prior to delivery, with consideration for blood transfusion and hysterectomy. Women with placenta praevia are at increased risk of massive obstetric hemorrhage and hysterectomy. Regional anesthesia is preferred over general anesthesia for cesarean delivery in women with placenta praevia. Close liaison with the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential for women with placenta praevia. Vertical skin and/or uterine incisions should be considered when the fetus is in a transverse lie to avoid the placenta. Risk factors for women with placenta accreta spectrum include history of accreta in a previous pregnancy, previous cesarean delivery, and other uterine surgery. Other surgical trauma to the integrity of the uterine endometrium and/or superficial myometrium can also lead to placenta accreta spectrum.

In the last decade, the number of reported cases of caesarean scar pregnancy has increased due to improved awareness of the condition, widespread use of ultrasound scanning in early pregnancy, and an increase in the number of prior caesarean sections. The outcome of caesarean scar pregnancy depends on the amount of definitive placenta developing inside the scar and depth of villous invasion. Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum is crucial in planning its management and has been shown to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. Previous caesarean delivery and the presence of an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta praevia should alert the antenatal care team of the higher risk of placenta accreta spectrum. Ultrasound imaging is highly accurate when performed by a skilled operator with experience in diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum. Refer women with any ultrasound features suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum to a specialist unit with imaging expertise. Women diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team in a specialist center with expertise in diagnosing and managing invasive placentation. Planned delivery for women with placenta accreta spectrum should take place in a specialist center with logistic support for immediate access to blood products, adult intensive care unit, and NICU by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in complex pelvic surgery. Any woman giving consent for caesarean section should understand the risks associated with caesarean section in general and the specific risks of placenta accreta spectrum in terms of massive obstetric hemorrhage, increased risk of lower urinary tract damage, the need for blood transfusion, and the risk of hysterectomy.

Women with suspected placenta accreta spectrum should meet with a senior obstetrician to discuss risks and treatment options, including whether conservative management or hysterectomy is preferred. The delivery should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including senior anaesthetists, obstetricians, and gynaecologists. The ACOG recommends planned caesarean section hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ. Uterus preserving surgical techniques should only be attempted by experienced surgeons. Leaving the placenta in situ may be an option for women who desire to preserve their fertility. Interventional radiology may be considered to reduce the risks of intraoperative hemorrhage during delivery.

Diagnosis of different grades of villous invasion and confounding factors, such as placental position and previous caesarean deliveries, have been studied. Prophylactic lower abdominal aorta balloon occlusion has shown reduced need for blood transfusion. In cases of undiagnosed placenta accreta spectrum, immediate delay of caesarean section until appropriate resources are available is recommended. If placenta percreta is discovered post-birth, emergency hysterectomy should be performed. Leaving the placenta in place and proceeding to hysterectomy if it fails to separate is associated with less blood loss. Postnatal debriefing and training are essential for clinical governance. Future research should focus on optimal timing of delivery and management strategies for placenta accreta spectrum. Antenatal diagnosis and management of placenta praevia and accreta spectrum are crucial for patient care.

Placenta previa and associated reproductive techniques have been studied extensively. Various risk factors and outcomes have been analyzed to determine the best management strategies for this condition. Studies have looked at the persistence of placenta previa, differences in migration of the placenta, and the resolution of complete placenta previa. Additionally, the use of transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound has been evaluated for screening and predicting placenta previa. Various studies have also examined the correlation between cervical length and bleeding during cesarean section in cases of placenta previa. Management strategies, such as maintenance tocolytics and nifedipine therapy, have been investigated for preterm symptomatic placenta previa. The timing of delivery for women with placenta previa has been a topic of discussion, with studies looking at the optimal timing for delivery to reduce complications. Various techniques, such as the intra-abdominal version technique and the use of the Bakri balloon, have been explored for managing postpartum hemorrhage in cases of placenta previa.

Intrauterine Bakri balloon tamponade is effective in managing postpartum hemorrhage in placenta previa patients during cesarean section. Balloon tamponade can reduce hemorrhage and is useful for severe cases. Other management options include the B-Lynch surgical technique, uterine compression suture, and transarterial embolization. Antenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta can lead to reduced blood loss and improved outcomes. Ultrasound and MRI are valuable tools for diagnosing and managing abnormal placentation. Placenta percreta can lead to life-threatening complications such as uterine rupture and bladder invasion. Placenta accreta is a risk factor for late preterm birth and perinatal mortality.
