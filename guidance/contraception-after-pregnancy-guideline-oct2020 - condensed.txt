FSRH Guideline  
Contraception After Pregnancy  
Discussion and provision of contraception after pregnancy  
What methods of contraception are available in the UK?  
- Clinicians should refer to the relevant current FSRH guidelines, including the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (UKMEC), when making a clinical judgement on safe and appropriate methods of contraception for a woman after pregnancy.  

Effectiveness of contraceptive method  
- Women should be informed during pregnancy about the effectiveness of different contraceptives, including the superior effectiveness of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), when choosing an appropriate method to use after pregnancy.  

Information giving and counselling  
- All clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women should provide the opportunity to discuss contraception.  
- Whenever contraceptive counselling is provided, care should be taken to ensure women do not feel under pressure to choose a method of contraception.  
- Clinicians should adopt a person-centred approach when providing contraceptive counselling.  
- Clinicians who are giving advice to women about contraception after pregnancy should ensure that this information is timely, up-to-date.

Comprehensive information on contraceptive methods after pregnancy should be available in different languages and formats. Services providing care to pregnant women should offer all appropriate contraception methods before discharge. Clinicians should discuss medical and social factors relevant to contraceptive choice. Record keeping and obtaining valid consent are important. Clinicians should facilitate private discussions and know how to support women affected by gender-based violence. Services should have pathways to local sexual and reproductive health services for women with complex needs. Contraception should be initiated soon after childbirth, with a focus on LARC methods. Clinicians should provide timely and accurate information on contraception postpartum. Breastfeeding women can safely use progestogen-only methods. Clinicians should consider individual risk factors for CHC use. Female sterilization is a safe option after childbirth. Barrier methods can be used safely. Fertility awareness methods may be challenging postpartum. After an abortion, contraception should be initiated immediately, with a focus on LARC methods. Women should be informed about the effectiveness of different contraceptive methods. Emergency contraception is safe to use after abortion. Additional contraceptive precautions may be needed depending on the timing of contraception initiation.

Barrier methods/abstinence are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after abortion. Additional contraceptive precaution is not required if contraception is initiated immediately or within 5 days of abortion. 

Intrauterine contraception (IUC) can be safely used by women after an uncomplicated abortion. Women may benefit from reduced uterine bleeding with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). IUC can be inserted any time after expulsion of the pregnancy with medical abortion and immediately after evacuation of the uterine cavity with surgical abortion.

Progestogen-only contraception can be safely started at any time after medical or surgical abortion. Women should be advised that scant or absent bleeding should not be attributed to a hormonal method of contraception but may be due to failed medical abortion. 

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) can be safely started immediately at any time after abortion. 

Female sterilisation is a safe option for permanent contraception after abortion. Tubal occlusion should ideally be performed after some time has elapsed after abortion. 

Condoms can be used by women after abortion. Women choosing a diaphragm should wait at least 6 weeks after abortion. 

Fertility awareness methods (FAM) can be used by women after abortion. 

Effective contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Women should be informed about the effectiveness of different contraceptive methods. 

Emergency contraception (EC) is indicated if unprotected sexual intercourse takes place more than 5 days after treatment for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. 

Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after miscarriage or treatment for ectopic pregnancy. Additional contraceptive precaution is not required if contraception is initiated immediately or within 5 days of treatment. 

After complete molar pregnancy, women should avoid subsequent pregnancy for at least 6 months. After partial molar pregnancy, women should avoid pregnancy until two consecutive monthly hCG levels are normal. 

Clinicians should ensure valid consent is obtained before providing contraception. 

Most methods of contraception can be safely used after treatment for GTD. IUC should not be inserted in women with persistently elevated hCG levels or malignancy. 

Emergency contraception is safe to use after GTD. 

Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after treatment for GTD. Additional contraceptive precaution is not required if contraception is initiated immediately or within 5 days of treatment.

contraception after pregnancy, including the method chosen and the reasons for the choice, in the woman's medical records.  
D Valid consent should be obtained from the woman before providing contraception after pregnancy. This should include discussing the benefits, risks, and alternatives to the chosen method.  

1.5 Implementation and audit  
This guideline should be implemented across all relevant services in the UK to ensure a collaborative and consistent approach to providing contraception after pregnancy. Audit tools should be developed to assess compliance with the recommendations in this guideline and to monitor the quality of care provided to women.  

1.6 Updating this guideline  
This guideline will be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that it remains current and reflects the latest evidence and expert consensus on contraception after pregnancy.  

Overall, this guideline aims to provide healthcare providers with a framework for discussing and providing contraception to women after pregnancy, promoting informed decision-making and access to a range of contraceptive methods to meet individual needs and preferences.  

Valid consent must be obtained before providing women with their chosen method of contraception. Clinicians should be aware of the procedures for obtaining valid consent and document the method of contraception provided. Women should be informed about signs of possible complications and when to seek medical attention. Clinicians should facilitate private discussions with women and be knowledgeable about gender-based violence and support services. Services should have pathways of care for women with complex medical conditions or non-medical care needs. Women should be informed about where to access contraception if their chosen method is not available. Vulnerable women should be informed about appropriate services for continuing care and support. Maternity services should offer opportunities for women to discuss contraception and fertility intentions. Effective contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after childbirth for both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Women should be informed about contraceptive methods and encouraged to consider LARC methods. Contraceptive counselling should be available antenatally to enable women to choose a method for use after childbirth. Contraception can be initiated immediately after childbirth, with IUC and progestogen-only implant insertion being convenient and highly acceptable options. Women should be advised to wait at least 12 months before trying to conceive again. Appropriately trained clinicians should provide contraception after childbirth, with pathways of care to specialist services for complex needs. Record keeping is essential for documenting consent and the method of contraception provided.

Clinicians should clearly document the discussion and provision of contraception after childbirth. Valid consent must be obtained before providing women with their chosen method. Most methods of contraception can be safely initiated immediately after childbirth, with the exception of combined hormonal contraception (CHC). IUC can be inserted immediately after childbirth, and progestogen-only contraception can be safely used by breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Emergency contraception is safe to use from 21 days after childbirth. Women who breastfeed can use LNG-EC without restriction. Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 21 days or more after childbirth. Progestogen-only methods have no adverse effects on breastfeeding or infant outcomes. Women who are breastfeeding should wait until 6 weeks after childbirth before initiating a CHC method. The use of CHC methods may exacerbate the risk of VTE. Women may use the lactational amenorrhoea method as contraception if they are less than [age not provided].

6 months postpartum, amenorrhoeic and fully breastfeeding, the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is a highly effective method of contraception. Women using LAM should be advised that the risk of pregnancy is increased if the frequency of breastfeeding decreases when menstruation returns or more than 6 months after childbirth. Suckling suppresses the resumption of ovarian activity and the return of menses after childbirth. Full breastfeeding includes exclusive or almost exclusive breastfeeding. Women who are fully breastfeeding have reduced fertility and breastfeeding can be used to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. Women must fulfill all three criteria to effectively use breastfeeding as contraception. Studies have consistently shown that when the rules of LAM are applied, the failure rates are less than 2%. The use of expressing milk may reduce the efficacy of LAM. Breastfeeding varies by geographical region, mother's age, and deprivation in the UK. A woman who wishes to switch from LAM to a different method of contraception will require additional contraceptive precautions for a number of days. Intrauterine contraception (IUC) can be safely inserted immediately after birth or within the first 48 hours after uncomplicated caesarean section or vaginal birth. IUC insertion immediately after childbirth is associated with higher expulsion rates but also higher continuation rates 6-12 months postpartum. Progestogen-only implant (IMP) can be safely started at any time after childbirth including immediately after delivery. Studies have shown that insertion of IMP immediately after childbirth is safe and highly acceptable to women. Progestogen-only injectable (POI) can be started at any time after childbirth, including immediately after delivery.

The SPC for Depo-Provera and Sayana Press recommend caution with DMPA after childbirth due to potential bleeding pattern changes. Evidence is needed to confirm this association, but DMPA can still be used. 

Progestogen-only pills can be started immediately after childbirth without additional precautions. They have minimal effects on health factors and are a suitable choice for postpartum women. 

Women should undergo a risk assessment for VTE postnatally and should not use CHC if they have risk factors within 6 weeks of childbirth. CHC should be delayed for women not breastfeeding and without additional risk factors. 

Female sterilization is a safe and effective permanent contraception option after childbirth. Filshie clips and modified Pomeroy technique are both effective methods. 

Barrier methods like condoms can be used after childbirth, but diaphragms should be fitted after 6 weeks. 

Fertility awareness methods can be used after childbirth, but may be difficult to use during breastfeeding. 

Contraception should be initiated at the time of abortion or soon after to prevent unintended pregnancies.

Ovulation can resume very soon after abortion, with over 90% of women experiencing ovulation within 1 month of first-trimester abortions. Immediate initiation of contraception after abortion is associated with higher continuation rates and reduced risk of unintended pregnancy. Clinicians should provide comprehensive and accurate contraceptive information after abortion. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) at the time of abortion is convenient and highly effective in preventing another abortion. Women should be offered their chosen method of contraception immediately after abortion. Intrauterine contraception (IUC) and progestogen-only implants (IMP) are highly acceptable and effective methods after abortion. Women who use LARC immediately after abortion have a significantly reduced likelihood of another abortion within 2 years. Emergency contraception is safe to use after abortion, and additional contraceptive precautions may be required if hormonal contraception is started more than 5 days after abortion. IUC can be safely used after abortion, with immediate insertion associated with reduced risk of adverse outcomes. Women who choose LNG-IUS after abortion may benefit from reduced menstrual blood loss.

A normal bleeding pattern, four reported amenorrhoea, five reported spotting, and five reported heavy bleeding after insertion of IUC. IUC can be safely inserted after medical abortion immediately after expulsion of the pregnancy. Women should be advised that progestogen-only contraception can be safely initiated at the time of mifepristone administration. Immediate insertion of progestogen-only contraception after medical abortion is safe and associated with higher uptake and fewer unintended pregnancies. Women should be advised that administration of DMPA at the same time as mifepristone may be associated with a small increase in the risk of failure of EMA. Scant or absent bleeding should prompt urgent medical review after abortion. Combined hormonal contraception can be safely started immediately after abortion. Female sterilization is a safe option for permanent contraception after abortion, but tubal occlusion should ideally be performed after some time has elapsed. Consent for female sterilization at the same time as surgical abortion should be taken and documented in advance. Condoms and diaphragms can be used after abortion.

Condoms can be used immediately after abortion, but are considered one of the least effective methods. Diaphragms should wait until 6 weeks after abortion. Fertility awareness methods can be used but may be difficult shortly after abortion. Women should be informed about effective contraception methods. After ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, contraception should be discussed immediately. Methotrexate users should use contraception for at least 3 months after treatment. Emergency contraception is safe to use after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Additional contraceptive precautions are needed if hormonal contraception is started more than 5 days after treatment.

Initiation ≥5 days after treatment for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Number of days of additional contraceptive precautions required: Copper intrauterine device - None, Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system - 7, Progestogen-only pill - 2, Progestogen-only implant or injectable - 7, Combined hormonal contraception - 7. Women with recurrent early miscarriage should be investigated for underlying causes but should not delay initiation of contraception if they do not wish to become pregnant. Combined hormonal contraception should be avoided by women with recurrent early miscarriage until antiphospholipid syndrome has been excluded. Women with a history of ectopic pregnancy should consider using a LARC method for contraception. Women should seek medical advice if they suspect they may be pregnant and have symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, even while using contraception. All contraceptive methods can effectively reduce the number of intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies, with LARC being most effective. Women with a history of ectopic pregnancy have a higher risk of another ectopic pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs with an IUC in place, there is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Female sterilization also carries an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Effective contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after treatment for GTD. Women should be informed about the effectiveness of different contraceptive methods, including LARC, when choosing a method after GTD. Clinicians should provide timely, up-to-date, and accurate information on contraceptive methods after GTD in a person-centered approach.

Clinicians should reassure women with GTD that fertility and pregnancy outcomes are favorable after GTD, including after chemotherapy for GTN. However, there is an increased risk of GTD in subsequent pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid subsequent pregnancy for at least 6 months after complete molar pregnancy and until two consecutive monthly hCG levels are normal after partial molar pregnancy. After chemotherapy for GTD, women should avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year. Most methods of contraception can be safely used after treatment for GTD, except for intrauterine contraception which should not be inserted until hCG levels have normalized. Emergency contraception is safe to use after GTD, and additional contraceptive precautions may be required if hormonal contraception is started more than 5 days after treatment. Female sterilization is a safe option for permanent contraception after GTD. Women should be informed about all contraceptive options available to them.

Tubal occlusion after surgical evacuation for GTD should ideally be delayed, as there is a risk of regret and increased failure rates if performed at the same time. Barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragms can be used after treatment for GTD, with diaphragm fitting advised after 6 weeks. Fertility awareness methods can also be used, but may be challenging due to disrupted signs of fertility shortly after treatment. There is no evidence that any contraceptive method used after GTD increases the risk of GTD in subsequent pregnancies.

Immediate postpartum provision of highly effective reversible contraception is important for improving postpartum contraceptive use. Education for contraceptive use by women after childbirth is valuable. Barriers to intrauterine device insertion in postpartum women should be addressed. The timing of postpartum intrauterine device placement should be considered for cost-effectiveness. Views of general practitioners on providing contraceptive advice at the postnatal visit are important. Postpartum insertion of long-acting reversible contraception is beneficial. Contraceptive continuation and repeat pregnancy rates should be monitored in young mothers. Timing of intrauterine device insertion postpartum is crucial. Lactogenesis after early postpartum use of the contraceptive implant should be studied. Immediate postpartum insertion of intrauterine devices for contraception is effective. Intrauterine contraception after cesarean section and during lactation should be considered. Postpartum insertion of levonorgestrel intrauterine system at different time periods should be studied. Postplacental or delayed insertion of intrauterine devices after delivery should be compared. Immediate postpartum etonogestrel implant is a good contraception option with long-term continuation. Immediate postpartum compared to delayed postpartum and interval etonogestrel contraceptive implant insertion should be studied for removal rates. Immediate postpartum insertion of implants and intrauterine devices can impact rapid repeat pregnancy in adolescents. The safety of contraceptive implants during the immediate postpartum period should be evaluated. Effects of contraceptive implants inserted immediately postpartum on maternal hemostasis should be studied.

Tubal ligation and Filshie clips for immediate postpartum sterilisation have been shown to be effective methods of contraception. It is important to consider the timing of female sterilisation to reduce the risk of regret. Immediate postabortal insertion of intrauterine devices has also been found to be a cost-effective option associated with fewer repeat abortions. Immediate postabortion initiation of levonorgestrel implants has been shown to reduce the incidence of births and abortions at 2 years and beyond. Overall, timely contraception following abortion procedures is crucial in preventing repeat pregnancies.

Device use among women with gestational trophoblastic disease has been studied in various research articles. Factors such as oral contraceptives and hormonal contraception have been investigated for their influence on post-molar trophoblastic neoplasia and human chorionic gonadotropin regression curves. Risk factors for complete molar pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease have also been explored. The guideline was developed by the Clinical Effectiveness Unit (CEU) with input from contraception providers and patient representatives. The evidence was systematically reviewed and graded to generate recommendations for clinical practice.

Considerations when making recommendations
FSRH clinical guidelines are produced primarily to recommend safe and appropriate clinical practice in relation to the provision of different contraceptive methods. Therefore, when formulating the recommendations, the GDG takes into consideration the health benefits, side effects, and other risks associated with implementing the recommendations, based on the available evidence and expert opinion. Further, the GDG takes into consideration the different financial and organizational barriers that clinicians and services may face in the implementation of recommendations to ensure that the recommendations are realistic and achievable.

Reaching consensus on the recommendations
When further revisions based on public consultation feedback have been made, members of the GDG were asked to complete a form to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the recommendations proposed. The consensus process is as follows:
Consensus will be reached when 80% of the GDG members agree with the recommendation.
Recommendations where consensus is not reached will be redrafted in light of any feedback.
The recommendation consensus form will be sent again for all recommendations. Consensus will be reached when 80% of the GDG members agree with the recommendation.
If consensus is not reached on certain recommendations these will be redrafted once more.
If after one more round of consultation, consensus is still not reached, the recommendation will be taken to the CEC for final decision.
Any group member who is not content with the decision can choose to have their disagreement noted within the guideline.

Updating this guideline
Clinical guidelines are routinely due for update 5 years after publication. The decision as to whether update of a guideline is required will be based on the availability of new evidence published since its publication. Updates may also be triggered by the emergence of evidence expected to have an important impact on the recommendations. The final decision on whether to carry out a full or partial clinical guideline update is taken by the CEU in consultation with the CEC.

Plasma or serum anti -β2-glycoprotein I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype present on at least two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. 

Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include amenorrhoea or missed period, vaginal bleeding with or without clots, abdominal or pelvic pain, and vomiting and diarrhea associated with pain. Other reported symptoms may include breast tenderness, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, fainting or syncope, shoulder tip pain, urinary symptoms, passage of tissue, and rectal pressure or pain on defecation. 

Common multiple choice questions for continuing professional development include estimates of pregnancies ending in abortion, timing for conception after delivery, suitable contraceptive methods postpartum, and emergency contraception indications. 

Auditable outcomes for postnatal contraception, abortion, ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) are provided for healthcare practitioners to monitor and improve patient care. 

Feedback on published guidelines can be sent to the Clinical Effectiveness Unit of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare for review and potential amendments.
