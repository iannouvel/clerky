Induction of Labour at Term in Older Mothers

The average age of childbirth is rising, with older mothers at higher risk for adverse outcomes. Risks include obstetric complications, preexisting medical conditions, and stillbirth. Women aged 40 and older have a similar stillbirth risk at 39 weeks as 25-29 year olds at 41 weeks. Induction of labour at 39-40 weeks may reduce these risks. Studies show that older mothers have higher rates of caesarean section and instrumental delivery. Neonatal mortality is also higher in older mothers. Induction of labour at term in older mothers may improve outcomes without increasing caesarean section rates.

Insufficient data available on the effect of induction of labor in older mothers. It is possible that any beneficial effect from prevention of late antepartum stillbirth is reversed by an increase in intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths. There is growing evidence that such a policy would not increase the number of operative vaginal deliveries or emergency caesarean sections. Women who are older and pregnant should discuss the risks and benefits of induction of labor versus elective caesarean section. Further research is urgently required to define the effect of induction of labor in women of advanced maternal age. A National Institute for Health Research funded multicentre RCT is currently recruiting to investigate intrapartum complications and perinatal morbidity and mortality in nulliparous women aged over 35 years.
