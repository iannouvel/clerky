Pregnancy and Breast Cancer
Greenâ€“top Guideline No. 12
March 2011
Purpose and scope: This document provides clinical guidance for healthcare professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer.
Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females, affecting almost 5000 women of reproductive age in the UK annually. Treatment should be multidisciplinary according to standard UK guidelines.
Optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: Prognosis is not worsened by pregnancy, but diagnosis can be challenging. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, with considerations for the safety of the fetus.
Timing of delivery: Birth timing should be discussed with the multidisciplinary team, with most women able to go to full term. Breastfeeding while on certain medications is not advised.
Contraceptive choices: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods are recommended for women with a history of breast cancer. Hormonal contraception is contraindicated.
Advice for women planning pregnancy after breast cancer: Women should consult with their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon, and obstetrician. Pregnancy does not adversely affect long-term survival after breast cancer.

Several studies show better survival outcome in women who conceive after treatment for breast cancer. Women who had a full-term pregnancy had a relative risk of death. The impact of pregnancy does not seem to be modified by tumor characteristics, but there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy. Advice on postponement of pregnancy should be individualized based on treatment needs and prognosis over time. Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception due to the risk of cancer recurrence. Women should be reassured concerning the risk of malformation in children conceived after treatment for breast cancer. Pregnancy following breast cancer should be jointly supervised by the obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon. Echocardiography should be performed during pregnancy in women at risk to detect cardiomyopathy. Women can breastfeed from the unaffected breast without increasing the risk of recurrence. The effect of breast cancer treatment on fertility should be discussed with all women of reproductive age diagnosed with breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea or subfertility. The effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy on fertility is reversible. Women are generally advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years after treatment, but age is a major determinant of fertility. Fertility preservation techniques should be considered before treatment for breast cancer. Every breast oncology service should have a designated pathway for prompt referral to a fertility specialist able to offer assisted conception.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends universal access to sperm, egg, and embryo storage for individuals undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. However, NHS funding is not available in all areas and depends on the primary care trust and local infertility budget. The oncology referral pathway in the cancer network may not align with local in vitro fertilization arrangements. The joint Royal Colleges working party recommended adequate funding should be made available. Assisted reproduction after treatment for breast cancer is limited by loss of ovarian reserve. Fertility treatment after chemotherapy carries risks and options such as donated eggs, hormone replacement therapy, and surrogacy may be considered. Women for whom pregnancy is contraindicated may wish to consider surrogacy.

Young women with breast cancer may experience fertility-related concerns and menopausal symptoms due to cancer treatment. It is important to provide information and options for preserving fertility in these patients, such as using GnRH agonists or cryopreservation of embryos, oocytes, or ovaries. Studies have shown that certain treatments, like Epirubicin/vinorelbine adjuvant chemotherapy, can help preserve menstrual function in young women with breast cancer. Additionally, letrozole has been shown to reduce estrogen and gonadotropin exposure in women undergoing ovarian stimulation before chemotherapy. It is essential to consider fertility preservation options and discuss them with patients before starting cancer treatment.
