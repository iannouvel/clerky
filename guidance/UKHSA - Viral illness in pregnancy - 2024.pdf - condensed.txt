Guidance on the investigation, diagnosis, and management of viral illness (plus syphilis) or exposure to viral rash illness in pregnancy. This guidance aims to help decision making in the investigation, diagnosis, and management of pregnant women with rash illness or exposure to rash illness. The document includes advice on managing pregnant women in contact with viral rash illnesses, occupational exposure, antibody screening, and inadvertent immunization during pregnancy. It also covers the background and epidemiology of viral infections associated with rash illnesses, such as parvovirus B19, measles, rubella, and chickenpox. The guidance does not cover HIV or herpes simplex virus infections in pregnancy.

Maternal shingles on the chest, abdomen, or exposed areas pose a risk of natal transmission to the baby. Rubella infections in pregnancy can lead to congenital rubella syndrome, with substantial risks in the first trimester. Enterovirus infections may have various manifestations, including potential risks to vulnerable infants. Pregnant women with rash illnesses should be referred for medical management and laboratory investigation. Laboratory testing should be done with clear information on the patient's pregnancy status and relevant history. Written information and interpreter services should be provided for non-English speaking patients. Management decisions for infections in early pregnancy should be made in a specialist fetal medicine unit. Investigation of maculopapular rashes in pregnancy is advised even after 20 weeks gestation for accurate diagnosis and management.

Guidance on the investigation, diagnosis, and management of viral illness in pregnancy includes specific laboratory investigations for suspected infections such as rubella, parvovirus B19, syphilis, and measles. Confirmation of infections is crucial for appropriate management, with recommendations for testing at different stages of pregnancy. Management of confirmed infections, such as parvovirus B19, includes specialist advice and monitoring through ultrasound scanning. In cases of rubella, management depends on the gestation of pregnancy and individual circumstances. For syphilis, prompt referral to a genitourinary physician is essential. Chickenpox diagnosis can be confirmed through laboratory testing, and management includes antiviral treatment if necessary. It is important to monitor pregnant women closely for any signs of complications, especially in cases of severe disease. In cases of proven chickenpox exposure in utero, there is limited evidence to support specific treatments to prevent vertical transmission. Termination of pregnancy due to chickenpox is not recommended without prior prenatal diagnosis.

Some pregnant women may be at risk of fetal varicella syndrome and should be offered counselling and abortion care if necessary. Neonates exposed to chickenpox should receive VZIG prophylaxis, with consideration for intravenous aciclovir in high-risk cases. Breastfeeding is safe for mothers with chickenpox or shingles, as long as precautions are taken. Pregnant women in contact with rash illnesses should undergo risk assessment and appropriate testing. Post-exposure prophylaxis for chickenpox is recommended for susceptible pregnant women, with antivirals offered as needed. Vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a second exposure should be reassessed and treated accordingly. Occupational exposure to certain illnesses should be assessed on an individual basis. Women planning pregnancy should be up to date on vaccinations. Screening for past infection with certain viruses is not routinely recommended during pregnancy.

Rubella immunity should be established at booking by checking for documented evidence of 2 doses of a rubella-containing vaccine. Varicella screening is not recommended, but a firm history of chickenpox or shingles should be recorded. Live vaccines like MMR and chickenpox should not be given during pregnancy, but termination is not recommended if inadvertently administered. Shingrix, a non-live recombinant vaccine, is safe in pregnancy. Surveillance of inadvertent vaccine administration is ongoing.
