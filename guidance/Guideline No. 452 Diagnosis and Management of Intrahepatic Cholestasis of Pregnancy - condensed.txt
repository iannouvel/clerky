Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a common condition in late pregnancy, characterized by itching and elevated bile acid levels. Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended for itching. Antenatal fetal monitoring may not improve outcomes. Planned early delivery based on bile acid levels may reduce the risk of stillbirth. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common. Clinicians should consider ICP in pregnant patients with itching, perform relevant lab tests, and offer timely treatment. Monitoring and counseling on risks and treatment options are important. Delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Continuous fetal monitoring during labor is recommended. Resolution of symptoms should be confirmed postpartum, with further evaluation if symptoms persist. Patients and family members are at higher risk in future pregnancies.

This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is the most common gestational liver disease, with varying incidence rates globally. Bile acids play a key role in the pathophysiology of ICP, and genetic susceptibility and environmental factors can contribute to its development. The main symptom of ICP is pruritis, and laboratory findings include elevated serum bile acids and liver transaminases. Imaging may not be necessary for diagnosis. Monitoring bile acid levels is crucial for assessing fetal risk, as elevated levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Routine testing for viral infections and autoimmune diseases is not recommended. Maternal and fetal sequelae of ICP include an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Management should focus on timely diagnosis, monitoring, and close follow-up to optimize perinatal outcomes.

Urocholate impacted the rate and rhythm of cardiomyocyte contraction and abnormal calcium dynamics. Evaluation of pregnancies with ICP have supported the presence of alterations to fetal cardiac parameters. The goal of treating ICP is to ameliorate maternal symptomatology of pruritus and improve fetal outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most frequently used medication for ICP. Treatment with UDCA may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Refractory cases of ICP may benefit from a referral to a specialist. Follow-up laboratory testing and monitoring should be performed based on severity of pruritic symptoms and weeks of gestation. Fetal monitoring with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasound may be reasonable. Delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels and individual risk factors. Postpartum outcomes, contraception considerations, and recurrence risk should be discussed. Infants born to parents with ICP have normal development but may have an increased risk of metabolic disease in adulthood. The recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies is around 70%. The World Health Organization endorses postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception for those with ICP. Overall, ICP is a common hepatic disease unique to pregnancy that requires standardized care for the best perinatal outcomes.

Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy is a condition that can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is important to monitor bile acid levels and consider treatment options such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Operative delivery rates may be higher in cases of induction of labor for obstetric cholestasis.
