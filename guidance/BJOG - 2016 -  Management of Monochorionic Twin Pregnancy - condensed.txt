Management of Monochorionic Twin Pregnancy
All women with a twin pregnancy should be offered an ultrasound examination between 11+0weeks and 13+6weeks of gestation to assess fetal viability, gestational age, and chorionicity. Chorionicity should be determined based on ultrasound findings before 14 weeks of gestation. Fetal ultrasound assessment should take place every 2 weeks from 16+0 weeks onwards until delivery. Monochorionic twin pregnancies have higher fetal loss rates and may have a higher risk of associated neurodevelopmental morbidity. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities should be offered. TTTS, TAPS, and sGR should be screened for and managed accordingly. Delivery of monochorionic twin pregnancies should be discussed and offered from 36+0 weeks, aiming for vaginal birth unless there are specific clinical indications for a caesarean section. MCMA pregnancies have a high risk of fetal death and should be delivered by caesarean section between 32+0 and 34+0 weeks. Higher order multiple pregnancies with monochorionicity have higher fetal loss rates and may be complicated by various conditions. Discordant abnormalities in monochorionic pregnancies should be promptly assessed and managed in a fetal medicine center.

Meticulous mapping of twins' position in the uterus is essential during prenatal tests and treatments. Amniocentesis in monochorionic twin pregnancies should sample both sacs. Selective reduction should be discussed before invasive testing, and monitoring for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is not necessary. Feticide by injection is not recommended due to placental anastomoses. Conjoined twins require prenatal assessment in a fetal medicine center. Sonographers should be trained to identify chorionicity and complications in monochorionic twins. Fetal therapy centers should have experienced operators for optimal outcomes.

Chorionicity determines the number of amniotic sacs and may identify fetal anomalies in twins. Screening for Down syndrome should be offered in monochorionic twins. Accurate assessment of chorionicity is important in the first trimester. Monochorionic twin pregnancies have a single placental mass, while dichorionic twins have two. It is important to review chorionicity in multiple pregnancies. Monochorionic twins have higher fetal loss rates and neurodevelopmental morbidity compared to dichorionic twins. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities in monochorionic twins should include nuchal translucency measurements and serum markers. Structural abnormalities, especially cardiac, are more common in twin pregnancies. Routine ultrasound scans are recommended for monochorionic twins between 18 and 20+6 weeks of gestation. Management of monochorionic pregnancies with abnormalities is complex and involves multidisciplinary specialists.

A single fetus in a monochorionic pregnancy should be assessed and carried out in a center with expertise and experience in performing such prenatal procedures. Increased prenatal surveillance and potential referral to a tertiary specialist center must be discussed. Fetal ultrasound assessment should take place every 2 weeks in uncomplicated monochorionic pregnancies from 16 weeks onwards until delivery. Ultrasound examinations focus on detecting pathologies such as TTTS and sGR. Screening for TTTS should be done by ultrasound examination from 16 weeks onwards at 2-weekly intervals. Screening for sGR should include calculating EFW discordance and evaluating umbilical artery Doppler. Discordant growth is a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes in monochorionic twins.

A minimum two-fold increase in risk of perinatal morbidity exists even when both twin birthweights are appropriate for gestational age. A compromise 'cut-off' of a difference in EFW of greater than 20% for monochorionic twins is recommended. Umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index measurements should be taken from 20 weeks of gestation. sGR type I is associated with good outcomes, while type II and III are associated with higher risks. TTTS should be staged using the Quintero system for prognosis. Fetoscopic laser ablation is recommended for TTTS presenting before 26 weeks of gestation. Weekly ultrasound assessments are necessary post-treatment. Recurrent TTTS can occur in up to 14% of pregnancies treated with fetoscopic laser ablation. Termination of pregnancy may be considered in severe cases of TTTS. Ultrasound surveillance is recommended post-fetoscopic laser ablation. Functional cardiac studies may add to the prognosis of MCDA twins.

Delivery of monochorionic twin pregnancies previously complicated by TTTS and treated should be between 34+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation. Regular ultrasound surveillance is recommended, and consideration should be given to delivery between 34+0 and 36+6 weeks, or earlier if there are concerns. Prophylactic maternal steroids should be given if possible prior to delivery, and mode of delivery can be individualized, often by caesarean section. In cases of sGR in monochorionic twins, surveillance should be undertaken every 2 weeks with fetal Doppler assessment. Delivery should be planned based on fetal growth velocity and Doppler waveforms. Monochorionic twin pregnancies require regular review with interval ultrasound biometry to monitor fetal growth velocity and placental and fetal circulation assessment. In cases of single twin demise, fetal magnetic resonance imaging may be performed to detect neurological morbidity. Fetal anaemia may be assessed by measuring the fetal MCA PSV using Doppler ultrasonography. Delivery for otherwise uncomplicated monochorionic pregnancies should be discussed and elective delivery offered from 36+0 weeks with antenatal steroids. Aim for vaginal birth unless there are specific clinical indications for caesarean section.

In monochorionic pregnancies, there is a higher risk of fetal demise, especially in monochorionic twins. Delivery should be considered from 36 weeks with antenatal steroids. Planned caesarean section for twin pregnancies does not significantly decrease or increase risks compared to vaginal delivery. Higher order multiple pregnancies with monochorionicity have higher fetal loss rates. Conjoined twins are rare and require careful prenatal assessment in a fetal medicine center. Training competencies for managing monochorionic pregnancies include establishing chorionicity and recognizing complications like TTTS, sGR, and TAPS. Fetal medicine centers should have experienced operators for fetal therapy. Future research should focus on the use of serial MCA PSV in screening for T.
