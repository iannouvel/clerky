Management of Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women
This guideline provides information on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary. Most ovarian masses in premenopausal women are benign, and differentiation between benign and malignant masses can be challenging. Conservative management is preferred, and laparoscopic surgery is recommended for benign masses. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised for suspected malignancies. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, with additional tests such as CA-125, LDH, and hCG for complex masses. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) is used to estimate the risk of malignancy. Women with specific ultrasound findings indicating malignancy should be referred to a gynaecological oncologist. Women with simple ovarian cysts may not require follow-up, while those with larger cysts may need further imaging or surgery.

Intervention: Simple ovarian cysts less than 50 mm do not require follow-up as they are likely to resolve within 3 menstrual cycles. Cysts 50-70 mm may require follow-up, while cysts larger than 70 mm may need further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or increasing cysts may warrant surgical management, especially in the case of mature cystic teratomas. The use of combined oral contraceptives does not promote resolution of functional ovarian cysts. Laparoscopic approach is preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses, associated with lower morbidity and shorter recovery time. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is less effective and may have a high recurrence rate. Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent complications. The possibility of oophorectomy should be discussed preoperatively, and benign ovarian masses should be removed via the umbilical port when possible for better outcomes.
