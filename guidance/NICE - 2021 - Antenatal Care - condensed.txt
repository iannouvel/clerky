Antenatal care guideline by NICE outlines the organization and delivery of care, routine clinical care, information and support for pregnant women, and interventions for common problems during pregnancy. It emphasizes the importance of involving partners in care decisions and providing comprehensive medical history at the first antenatal appointment. The guideline aims to ensure pregnant women receive regular check-ups, information, and support.

Consider reviewing the woman's previous medical records if needed, be aware of increased risks for women and babies from minority ethnic backgrounds and those in deprived areas, offer referral to NHS Stop Smoking Services for smokers, ask about domestic abuse and female genital mutilation, refer for clinical assessment for cardiac conditions if necessary, update antenatal records at each appointment, offer ultrasound scans for various purposes at specific weeks, assess risk factors for venous thromboembolism and gestational diabetes, offer aspirin for pre-eclampsia risk, measure and record blood pressure at each appointment, offer urine dipstick test for proteinuria, assess risk for fetal growth restriction and offer symphysis fundal height measurement and ultrasound scans as needed.

1.2.34 Discuss the topic of babies' movements with the woman after 24 weeks, ask about concerns, advise to contact maternity services if needed, and assess if there are concerns.

1.2.35 Structured fetal movement awareness packages have not been shown to reduce stillbirth rates.

1.2.36 Offer abdominal palpation after 36 weeks to identify possible breech presentation.

1.2.37 Offer an ultrasound scan if breech presentation is suspected.

1.2.38 For women with confirmed breech presentation after 36 weeks, discuss different birthing options and offer external cephalic version for those preferring vaginal birth.

1.3 Communication with pregnant women should be responsive to their needs and preferences, ensuring informed decision-making and respect for their choices.

1.3.4 Provide clear, tailored information throughout pregnancy, including on antenatal care, physical and emotional changes, and support resources.

1.3.13 Discuss babies' movements after 24 weeks.

1.3.14 Start discussing birth preferences before 28 weeks.

1.3.15 Provide information on preparing for labor, recognizing active labor, and postnatal care after 28 weeks.

1.3.16 Continue discussing birth preferences from 28 weeks onwards.

1.3.17 Discuss prolonged pregnancy and management options from 38 weeks.

1.3.19 Provide appropriate support for women with babies at increased risk of neonatal admission.

1.3.23 Discuss the potential benefits of peer support with pregnant women and explain how it may provide practical support, help to build confidence, and reduce feelings of isolation. Offer pregnant women information about how to access local and national peer support services.

1.3.25 Advise women to avoid sleeping on their back after 28 weeks of pregnancy and consider using pillows to maintain their position while sleeping. Explain the potential link between back sleeping and stillbirth in late pregnancy.

1.4 Interventions for common problems during pregnancy:
Nausea and vomiting:
- Reassure women that mild to moderate nausea and vomiting are common and likely to resolve before 16 to 20 weeks.
- Consider non-pharmacological options like ginger for mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting.
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different antiemetics for pharmacological treatment.
- Offer antiemetics to pregnant women who choose pharmacological treatment.
- Consider IV fluids and acupressure for moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting.
- Consider inpatient care for severe vomiting not responding to primary care.

Heartburn:
- Give information about lifestyle and dietary changes.
- Consider antacids or alginate for heartburn.

Symptomatic vaginal discharge:
- Advise pregnant women on common vaginal discharge and when to seek medical attention.
- Offer treatments for vaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis.

Pelvic girdle pain:
- Consider referral to physiotherapy services for exercise advice or a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt.

Unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks:
- Offer anti-D immunoglobulin to RhD-negative women with vaginal bleeding.
- Refer pregnant women with unexplained bleeding to secondary care for review.
- Assess the need for hospital admission based on various factors.
- Consider corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation if there is an increased risk of preterm birth within 48 hours.

Models of antenatal care with varying numbers and times of appointments should be considered for groups at risk of worse outcomes. Routine ultrasound from 36+0 weeks may be more effective in identifying breech presentation. Corticosteroids may be effective for severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. It is important to involve partners in antenatal care and provide information and support. Flexible timing of antenatal classes and the use of virtual platforms for appointments may improve partner involvement. Taking and recording the woman's history is important for providing appropriate care.

The recommendations emphasize the importance of addressing potential risks and tailoring care to women's needs by discussing past and present conditions, medication use, home and family situations, and issues such as domestic abuse. It is important to identify women at risk of maternal mortality and stillbirth, as well as those with underlying cardiac problems. Information sharing between maternity units and GPs is crucial for complex cases. Antenatal appointments allow for monitoring and reassessment of care needs. Recommendations on examinations, investigations, venous thromboembolism, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, hypertension, and fetal growth align with current practice. Risk assessment tools and urine testing for proteinuria are recommended for early detection and management of conditions. Routine ultrasound scans in late pregnancy may not provide additional benefits for uncomplicated pregnancies.

Committee recommends discussing fetal movements routinely and taking women's concerns seriously. No evidence supports structured awareness packages. Recommendations on fetal growth monitoring reflect current practice. Committee recommends external cephalic version for breech presentation. Key principles of care include listening to women and enabling informed decisions. Providing information about antenatal care improves engagement. Antenatal classes may benefit nulliparous women. Peer support can be helpful during the antenatal period. Committee recommends discussing sleep positions to reduce the risk of stillbirth and low birth weight.

The committee recommends pregnant women to avoid sleeping on their backs after 28 weeks to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Practical advice and aids, such as using pillows, can help maintain a side sleeping position. Healthcare professionals may need to spend more time discussing sleep positions with pregnant women. 

For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, the committee recommends reassuring women that these symptoms are common and may improve in the second trimester. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments are both options, with ginger being effective for mild-to-moderate symptoms. Different medications have varying effectiveness and safety profiles, and shared decision-making is encouraged. 

Heartburn in pregnancy can be managed with lifestyle and diet advice, antacids, or alginate therapy. Acupuncture and proton pump inhibitors are not routinely recommended due to limited evidence. 

Symptomatic vaginal discharge in pregnancy may be caused by candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis, which can be treated with antifungals or antibiotics. Metronidazole is effective for bacterial vaginosis, and oral or vaginal antibiotics can be considered. 

Pelvic girdle pain can be reduced with exercise advice from a physiotherapist, and referral to physiotherapy services is recommended. A non-rigid lumbopelvic belt, along with information on anatomy and body posture, can help reduce pain intensity.

No evidence of adverse effects with lumbopelvic belt use. Providing a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt found to be cost-effective. Manual therapy alone not beneficial for women with pelvic girdle pain. Acupuncture evidence mixed and of poor quality. Recommendations may increase referrals to physiotherapy services. Unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks requires review in secondary care. Hospitalization may be necessary for monitoring and administering corticosteroids. Antenatal care is crucial for identifying and addressing potential pregnancy complications. Guideline replaces previous version from 2008. Recommendations on managing nausea and vomiting updated. Recommendations on pelvic floor dysfunction added.
