Diagnosis:
1. Preterm Prelabour Rupture of Membranes (PPROM)
2. Chorioamnionitis

Investigation:
1. Sterile speculum examination
2. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) test
3. Placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) test
4. Maternal blood tests (C-reactive protein and white cell count)
5. Fetal heart rate monitoring

Management:
1. Antibiotics (preferably erythromycin) for 10 days or until the woman is in established labour
2. Corticosteroids for women who have PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeksâ€™ gestation
3. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks for women whose pregnancy is complicated by PPROM after 24+0 weeks of gestation and who have no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy
4. Intravenous magnesium sulfate for women who have PPROM and are in established labour or having a planned preterm birth within 24 hours, between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation.
