The ESHRE guideline on management of women with endometriosis 
Recently, a group of clinical experts in endometriosis has written a Europea n guideline on 
endometriosis in an attempt to improve clinical practice within Europe and as a result improve 
the quality of life of women with endometriosis.  The guideline is entitl ed “Management of 
women with endometriosis”.  
 
Why a patient version? 
This patient version is a translation of the guideline in plain language. This version aims at 
involving patients in healthcare improvement, either by learning about th e current standard 
of care, or by enabling patients to make informed decisions on their health, supported by the 
best available evidence.  
 
How this booklet was developed 
This booklet was written by Dr Nathalie Vermeulen (methodological expert), Ms Bianc a de Bie 
(patient representative) and Dr Gerard Dunselman (gynaecologist and chair of the Guideline 
Development Group). 
A number of key questions w as selected based on patient enquiries received by the Dutch 
endometriosis patient organisation (Endometriose Stichting). The questions o f patients are 
listed in the back of this booklet. Focussing on these questions, the clinicians version of the 
Guideline on the management of women with endometriosis was translated to p lain language 
advises and answers for patients.  
Further background information and answers to questions not addressed in the guideline is 
added in yellow squares. Difficult terms are coloured blue and explaine d in the dictionary. The 
chair of the guideline development group checked the accuracy of all pr ovided information . 
Finally, the booklet was sent to the guideline development group and national patient 
organisations for review . The text was adapted based on comments from the following 
individuals and organisations:  
Helen North/ Patient Advisory Group Endometriosis UK 
Sandra Engstrom support group leader for EndometriosisUK in Edinburgh

It is estimated that between 2 and 10% of the women within the general population have 
endometriosis and that up to 50% of the infertile women have endometriosis.  
Women with endometriosis often have severe complaints and significantly reduced quality of 
life, including restraint of normal activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/d epression. 
 
What is endometriosis? 
Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outsi de the uterus 
(Kennedy et al ., 2005). Endometriosis triggers a chronic inflammatory reaction resulting in 
pain and adhesions . Adhesions  develop when scar tissue attaches separate structures or 
organs together. The activity and the complaints due to endometriosis may vary du ring the 
woman’s menstrual cycle as hormone  levels fluctuate. Consequently, symptoms may be 
worse at certain times in the cycle, particularly just prior to and during the woman’s menstrual 
period. While some women with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain, others have no 
symptoms at all or regard their symptoms as simply being ‘ordinary menstrual pain ’.

 How can endometriosis be classified?  
A staging system has been developed by the American Society of Reproductive M edicine 
(ASRM) to stage endometriosis and adhesions  due to endometriosis. This classification is 
often used by gynaecologists to document any endometriosis and adhesions  that are 
visualized during surgery. While a higher stage is generally regarded as  denoting a more severe 
form of disease, the staging system neither predicts severity of pain nor co mplexity of surgery. 
The classification was originally developed to predict impairment to ferti lity and for this 
reason is focused on ovarian disease and adhesions . Patients w ith the same ‘stage’ of disease 
may have different disease presentations and types. Furthermore, some forms of severe 
disease are not included e.g., invasive disease of the bowels, bladder and diaph ragm. The four 
stages of the ASRM staging system for endometriosis are as follows: 
Stages 1 & 2 (minimal to mild disease): Superficial peritoneal endometriosis. Possible 
presence of small deep lesions . No endometrioma. Mild filmy adhesions , if present.  
Stages 3 and 4 (moderate to severe disease): The presence of superficial peritoneal 
endometriosis, deeply invasive endometriosis with moderate to extensive adhesions between 
the uterus and bowels and/or endometrioma cysts with moderate to extensive adhesions  
involving the ovaries and tubes. 
As a patient, your stage of disease does not indicate your symptoms nor necessaril y the 
optimal treatment to manage those symptoms. However, the subtype(s) of disease that you 
have may well be informative in deciding upon optimal treatment.

Because the symptoms of endometriosis are not very specific, the diagnosis of endomet riosis 
cannot be made by the symptoms alone. However, symptoms can give a doctor a first h int 
towards the diagnosis of endometriosis.  
Should my doctor perform a clinical examination? 
In addition to your symptoms, clinical examination can provide additional information to the 
doctor. However, there is little scientific evidence for the value of c ertain clinical signs to come 
to the diagnosis endometriosis .  
During clinical vaginal examination the doctor looks for tenderness, nodules or swelling of the 
vaginal wall especially in the deepest point of the vagina between the b ack of the uterus and 
the rectum by inspection using the speculum and by palpation using h is/her fingers. In women 
with deep endometriosis or endometriosis of the ovaries, clinical examinati on may give 
considerable information regarding the proper diagnosis, while in per itoneal disease the 
clinical examination most of the time is completely normal.  Part 5: Diagnosis of Endometriosis 21 
  
Endometriosis is a chronic disease. In that sense, there is no cure for e ndometriosis, but the 
symptoms can be reduced with the right treatment. Communication is the key to finding a 
treatment that fits you. Please discuss your options with your doctor and ask any qu estions 
you may have. Your doctor will be happy to explain the different options and answer your 
questions.  
Women with endometriosis have either pain,  fertility problems  or they have both. Treatment 
of endometriosis focuses on resolving or reducing pain due to endometri osis or on improving 
fertility, so a patient can get pregnant naturally or through fertilit y treatments. For treating 
endometriosis, the doctor can prescribe medical treatment or advise surgical t reatment. Bot h 
will be explained in detail here. 
Depending on the patient, the treatment will be different. Your d octor will take several factors 
into consideration when prescribing medical treatment or advising surgic al treatment. These 
factors include: 
 The preferences of the woman 
 The type of disease (peritoneal disease, ovarian cyst or deep endometriosis) 
 The severity and type of pain symptoms 
 The wish to become pregnant immediately or at a later stage 
 The costs and side-effects of some treatments 
 The age of the woman 
 The treatments she has already received. 
 The doctor (country, expert centre) 
This means that two women with endometriosis could receive different tr eatments and even 
that one woman could receive different treatments over time dependi ng on her preferences, 
her age, her wish to become pregnant. 
Important to remember is that medical treatment works only when they are  taken as 
prescribed. Stopping medical treatment often means that the symptoms r ecur. 
In the next section, options for medical treatment and surgical treatment w ill be explained. Part 6: Treatment of pain due to endometriosis 30 
  
Am I infertile because I have endometriosis? 
Probably not, women diagnosed with endometriosis are not all infertil e. In medical terms, 
infertility  is defined as not reaching pregnancy after 1 year of regular intercourse. It is 
estimated that 60-70% of women with endometriosis are fertile and can get p regnant 
spontaneously and have children. Therefore, women not wanting to get pregn ant should 
discuss their options for contraception with their doctor.    
A proportion of women with endometriosis and fertility problems will stay involuntaril y 
childless, but there are no exact data on how many. Of the women wit h fertility problems , a 
proportion will get pregnant, but only after medical assistance, either s urgery or medically 
assisted reproduction  (IUI or IVF). There is no evidence that hormonal treatment or 
alternative treatment enhances the chance of spontaneous pregnancy in women with 
endometriosis .  
There is no best option for aiding infertile women with endometriosis to get pregnant. The 
decision on which option to take, surgery of medically assisted reproduction, shoul d be based 
on type of disease, the doctor ’s preferences  and the patient ’s preferences .  
There is also no evidence that women with endometriosis have a high er risk of complications 
in pregnancy (birth defects, miscarriages), but please inform your doctor or mi dwife of a 
diagnosis of endometriosis.  Part 7: Endometriosis and infertility  
Ablation:  removal of diseased or unwanted tissue by surgery or other means 
Add-back therapy : Hormonal therapy to minimize side effects of medications that suppress estrogen 
(such as leuprolide acetate); add-back therapy usually decreases hot flashes and also helps prevent 
bone loss.  
Adhesions : bands of fibrous scar tissue 
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) : The name for treatments that enable people to conceive by 
means other than sexual intercourse. Assisted reproduction techniques include intra-uterine 
insemination (IUI) , in vitro fertilisation (IVF) , intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) , donor 
insemination and egg donation.  
Controlled ovarian stimulation  (COS): For ART: pharmacologic treatment in which women are 
stimulated to induce the development of multiple ovarian follicles to obtain m ultiple oocytes at 
follicular aspiration. 
Definite diagnosis : A diagnosis that has been absolutely confirmed 
Dyschezia :  Painful or difficult defecation. 
Dysmenorrhea :  Severe pain in the lower abdomen or back, sometimes together with nausea, 
depression and headache, directly before and/or during menstruation . 
Dyspareunia : Recurrent or persistent genital pain directly before, during or shortly after coitus (sexual 
intercourse). 
Embryo:  A fertilised egg.  
Endometrioma:  An endometrial cyst containing old blood and endometrium . 
Endometrium : The layer of tissue that lines the uterus. During the menstrual cycle, the endometrium  
grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. The main job of the endo metrium is to accept 
the implantation of the fertilized egg that drops into the uterine cavity sever al days after ovulation and 
to nurture the dividing cells in the early stages of pregnancy.  
Estrogen/Oestrogen:  A female sex hormone  produced by developing eggs in the ovaries, which 
stimulates the development of female sex characteristics.  
Excision : To remove tissue surgically. (Synonym of resection) 
Fertility problem : Where no pregnancy results for a couple after 2 years of regular (at least every 2 to 
3 days) unprotected sexual intercourse. 
Heavy menstrual bleeding : Abnormally heavy and prolonged menstruation  at regular intervals.   
Hormone : A molecule that is produced by one tissue and carried in the bloodstream to another tissu e 
to cause a biological effect. Part 11: Dictiona ry  
39 
 In vitro fertilization (IVF) :  A technique by which eggs are collected from a woman and fertilised with 
a man’s sperm outside the body. Usually one or two resulting embryos are then  transferred to the 
womb. If one of them attaches successfully, it results in a pregnancy. 
Infertility : the state of being not fertile and unable to become pregnant. Clinical definition  of infertility: 
A disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy  after 12 
months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. 
Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) : A technique to place sperm int o a woman’s womb through the cervix  
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI):  A variation of IVF in which a single sperm is injected into an 
egg.  
Laparoscopy:  A “keyhole” operation in which the surgeon uses uses a low diameter telescopic system , 
called a laparoscope, to examine or operate on an area in a woman’s pelvis. Done under general 
anaesthetic. 
Laparotomy or open surgery:  opening the abdominal cavity with an incision made with a scalpel 
Lesions : Areas of abnormal tissue or disease  
Medically assisted reproduction (MAR):  Reproduction brought about through ovulation induction, 
controlled ovarian stimulation , ovulation triggering, ART procedures, and intrauterine, intracervical, 
and intravaginal insemination with semen of husband/partner or donor. 
Menstruation : The monthly discharge from the uterus; it consists of blood and endometrium  sloughed 
from the uterine lining.  
Menorrhagia :  Abnormally heavy and prolonged menstruation  at regular intervals. (Synonym of Heavy 
menstrual bleeding ) 
Natural cycle IVF: An IVF procedure in which one or more oocytes are collected from the ovaries during 
a spontaneous menstrual cycle without any drug use. 
Ovary : an organ in the pelvis of women containing the eggs. 
Progesterone : A hormone  produced by the Ovary , but only if ovulation has occurred (after the egg is 
released). Its action is to prepare the endometrium  for implantation of the embryo.  
Randomized controlled trail (RCT):  The “gold standard” of medical proof of the relative efficacy of one 
treatment over another, or over using nothing at all (placebo). Patients with a disease and who are 
similar to one another in most other respects (such as age, height, weight, duration of il lness, and 
severity of disease) are assigned to one treatment group or another by randomization. The patients 
undergo treatment and are followed for a certain length of time to see if there is any difference in the 
results of the treatments studied.  
Ultrasound:  High frequency sound waves used to provide images of the body, tissue s and internal 
organs.
