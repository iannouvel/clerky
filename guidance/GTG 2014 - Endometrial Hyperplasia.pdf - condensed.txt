Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia
Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia should be identified and monitored. It should be classified based on the presence of cytological atypia. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include histological examination, endometrial sampling, and hysteroscopy. Treatment for hyperplasia without atypia includes observation, progestogens, and continuous oral or intrauterine progestogens. Surgical management is appropriate in certain cases. Atypical hyperplasia should be managed with total hysterectomy. Women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to preserve fertility should be offered the LNG-IUS. Endometrial hyperplasia in women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer should be managed carefully. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to an endometrial polyp should be managed with complete removal of the polyp. Regular endometrial surveillance is recommended. Management in women wishing to conceive and those on HRT should be individualized.

The revised 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups: hyperplasia without atypia and atypical hyperplasia. Endometrial surveillance includes endometrial sampling, outpatient endometrial biopsy, and transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy may be necessary for diagnosis and monitoring. Biomarkers have not been found to accurately predict disease. Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia has a low risk of progression to cancer and may regress spontaneously. Progestogen treatment is recommended for non-regressing cases. Addressing reversible risk factors such as obesity and HRT use is important in management. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate management approach.

Many women with endometrial hyperplasia may require treatment due to the risk of progression to cancer. The first-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens. Treatment with progestogens should last for a minimum of 6 months to induce regression. Endometrial surveillance with biopsies should be done at least every 6 months. Hysterectomy is not recommended as a first-line treatment but may be considered if there is no regression after 12 months of treatment or in cases of relapse. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred. Endometrial ablation is not recommended. Women with persistent or relapsing hyperplasia may be at higher risk of cancer and may require long-term follow-up or hysterectomy. In cases where progestogen treatment fails, hysterectomy should be considered. Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the standard surgical management for postmenopausal women, while the decision to remove ovaries in premenopausal women should be individualized. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred.

8.1 Initial management of atypical hyperplasia:
- Total hysterectomy is recommended due to the risk of underlying malignancy.
- Laparoscopic approach is preferred for shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery.
- Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be offered to postmenopausal women.
- Ovaries removal for premenopausal women should be individualized.
- Endometrial ablation is not recommended due to incomplete destruction and adhesion formation.
- Risk of endometrial cancer is highest in atypical hyperplasia.

8.2 Management for fertility preservation or unsuitable for surgery:
- Women should be counseled on risks of malignancy and progression to cancer.
- LNG-IUS is recommended as first-line treatment.
- Hysterectomy should be offered once fertility is no longer required.
- Hormonal therapies can be considered for treatment.

8.3 Follow-up for women not undergoing hysterectomy:
- Routine endometrial surveillance with biopsy every 3 months until negative results.
- Long-term follow-up with biopsy every 6-12 months until hysterectomy is performed.
- Consideration of obesity in follow-up due to higher risk of relapse.
- Endometrial evaluation every 3 months initially until two consecutive negative biopsies.

9. Management of endometrial hyperplasia in women wishing to conceive:
- Disease regression should be achieved before attempting to conceive.
- Referral to fertility specialist for further assessment and treatment.
- Assisted reproduction may be considered for higher live birth rates and prevention of relapse.
- Regression of endometrial hyperplasia before assisted reproduction is recommended.

A small trial showed LNG-IUS treatment led to regression of hyperplasia in women with PCOS. Hysterectomy is recommended for atypical hyperplasia. Systemic estrogen-only HRT should be avoided in women with a uterus. Women with hyperplasia on HRT should switch to continuous progestogen intake. Tamoxifen users should report any abnormal vaginal bleeding promptly. Aromatase inhibitors do not increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. LNG-IUS may prevent polyp formation in tamoxifen users. Management of hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen should be based on histological classification. Endometrial hyperplasia within a polyp should be managed with complete removal. Recommended topics for future research include clinical factors in diagnosis and weight loss impact on hyperplasia. Auditable topics include weight loss advice and postmenopausal women with atypical hyperplasia undergoing hysterectomy.
