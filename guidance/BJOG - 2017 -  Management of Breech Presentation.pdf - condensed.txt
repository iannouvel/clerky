Management of Breech Presentation
Women with a breech presentation at term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) unless there is an absolute contraindication. They should be advised on the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery. Women should also be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care may allow planned vaginal breech birth to be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way that ensures a proper understanding of the absolute as well as relative risks of their different options. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term and the potential complications for both the mother and future pregnancies. Women should also be informed about the risks of planned vaginal breech birth for their future babies. Antenatal assessment and the skill and experience of the birth attendant play crucial roles in the safety of vaginal breech delivery. Intrapartum assessment and management of women presenting with breech presentation in labor should be individualized based on various factors. Adequate descent of the breech in the passive second stage is necessary for the active second stage. Women should be informed about the different positions for delivery during a vaginal breech birth. Assistance without traction is required if there is a delay or evidence of poor fetal condition during delivery. Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills needed during vaginal breech birth by all doctors and midwives. Departments should develop guidelines for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth to reduce the risk of complications.

Women with breech presentation at term should be counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section. Planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. The risk of perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section and 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth. Planned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications. Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way to ensure a proper understanding of the risks. Planned caesarean section carries a small increase in immediate complications for the mother compared with planned vaginal birth. Caesarean section increases the risk of complications in future pregnancies. Women should be informed about the risks of stillbirth for subsequent babies associated with caesarean section.

Planned vaginal breech birth is associated with increased perinatal risk compared to delivery by caesarean section. Factors affecting safety include antenatal assessment for risk factors, skill and experience of the birth attendant, and intrapartum management. It is essential to have skilled personnel present during vaginal breech birth to reduce risks. Intrapartum assessment should include fetal monitoring and appropriate management based on the stage of labor. Adherence to a protocol for management reduces the chances of early neonatal morbidity. The position of the woman during delivery can be either semirecumbent or all-fours, depending on preference and experience. Assistance without traction is required during the active second stage of vaginal breech birth. Traction should be avoided, and a hands-off approach is recommended.

All maneuvers to avoid fetal trauma: grasp the fetus around the pelvic girdle, avoid hyperextending the neck, and consider selective episiotomy. Signs that delivery should be assisted include lack of tone or color, or delay. Intervention to expedite breech birth is necessary if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or significant delays. The semirecumbent position is recommended, and gentle rotation without traction should be used if the back starts to rotate posteriorly. Delivery using the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver or forceps is advised. The Bracht maneuver is an alternative mode of delivery. In the absence of robust evidence, decision-making for preterm breech delivery should be individualized by an experienced obstetrician. Routine caesarean section for breech presentation in preterm labor is not recommended. For twin pregnancies with a breech presentation, planned caesarean section is recommended for the first twin, while routine caesarean section for the second twin is not recommended. Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse skills needed for vaginal breech birth, and guidelines for case selection and management should be developed in each department.

Breech birth supports the adherence to a strict management protocol and the presence of skilled birth attendants. Recommendations for future research include evaluation of the all-fours position for vaginal breech birth, the role of pelvimetry in planning vaginal breech delivery, and the effect of epidural analgesia on vaginal breech birth. Auditable topics include documentation of discussion regarding mode of delivery, vaginal delivery rates in women planning vaginal breech delivery, rate of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes following planned and actual breech birth, and percentage of staff who have undergone training in vaginal breech delivery.
