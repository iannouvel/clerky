Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a clinical syndrome associated with ascending infection from the endocervix, causing various complications. The incidence of PID is underestimated and increasing due to factors like younger age at first sexual intercourse. Diagnosis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia is recommended. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential to cover various bacteria commonly found in PID. Patients should be offered adequate analgesia and anti-emetics. Antibiotic regimens vary for outpatient and inpatient management, with considerations for penicillin allergy. Switching from IV to oral antibiotics is recommended after certain criteria are met. NICE guidance on drug choice during very early pregnancy is also provided.

TIS reviewed safety data of NSAIDs from published research and post marketing surveillance systems. They concluded that 'the available data do not indicate that exposure to ibuprofen before 30 weeks of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects or spontaneous abortions'. Antibiotics are recommended in very early pregnancy, with ceftriaxone considered low risk during pregnancy. Doxycycline is contraindicated beyond the 15th week of gestation, while metronidazole and ofloxacin are considered safe. Azithromycin exposure in human pregnancy does not show an increased risk of congenital malformations. Removal of IUCD in PID should be considered, with expert opinions differing on whether to remove it. Follow-up for PID patients includes treatment compliance, clinical progress, and safer sex messages. Training and monitoring compliance details are also provided.
