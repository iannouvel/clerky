Overview 
This guideline co vers t he car e of w omen wit h a singlet on pr egnancy at incr eased risk of , or 
with sympt oms and signs of , preterm labour (bef ore 37 weeks), and w omen wit h a 
singlet on pr egnancy ha ving a planned pr eterm bir th. It aims t o reduce t he risks of pr eterm 
birth for the bab y and describes tr eatment s to prevent or dela y early labour and bir th. 
In this guideline, w e use t he terms 'w oman' or 'mot her' t hroughout. These should be tak en 
to include people who do not identify as w omen but ar e pregnant or ha ve giv en bir th. 
Who is i t for? 
• Healt hcare professionals who car e for women at incr eased risk of or wit h sympt oms 
and signs of pr eterm labour and w omen ha ving a planned pr eterm bir th 
• Commissioners and pr oviders of mat ernity ser vices 
• Women at incr eased risk of or wit h sympt oms and signs of pr eterm labour and w omen 
having a planned pr eterm bir th, and t heir f amilies and car ers Preterm labour and bir th (NG25)

• ensur e this is giv en as early as possible, taking int o account t he lik elihood of 
preterm bir th and t he status of labour 
• follow the principles in NICE's guideline on patient e xperience in adult NHS 
services 
• bear in mind t hat t he w oman (and t heir f amily members or car ers) ma y be 
particularly anxious 
• give bot h oral and writt en inf ormation 
• describe t he sympt oms and signs of pr eterm labour 
• explain about t he car e that ma y be off ered. [2015]

and additional suppor t. The r epor t sho wed that acr oss all bir ths (not just t hose 
which ar e preterm): 
• compar ed wit h whit e babies (32 out of 10 ,000), t he stillbir th rat e is: 
－ more than twice as high in black babies (72 out of 10 ,000) 
－ around 50% higher in Asian babies (51 out of 10 ,000) 
• compar ed wit h the least depriv ed ar eas (23 out of 10 ,000), t he still bir th rat e 
is twice as high in t he most depriv ed ar eas (47 out of 10 ,000). [2022]

Preterm bir th causes significant neonatal morbidity and mor tality , as w ell as long-t erm 
disability . Ther efore strat egies f or pr eventing pr eterm bir th are impor tant. Ther e are 
recognised risk f actors f or pr eterm bir th, and so int erventions can be off ered to women

history of pr eterm bir th, but t here is limit ed evidence on which is mor e eff ectiv e, and t he 
relativ e risks and benefit s (including cost s) of each. Mor e randomised r esear ch is needed 
to compar e the relativ e eff ectiv eness of pr ophylactic cer vical cer clage and pr ophylactic

37Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. 
Prophylactic v aginal pr ogester one 
Recommendations 1 .2.1 to 1.2.5 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was good e vidence t hat v aginal pr ogest erone r educed t he risk of pr eterm bir th 
before 34  weeks in w omen wit h a pr evious hist ory of pr eterm bir th, and in w omen wit h a 
shor t cer vix (25  mm or less). The committ ee w ere awar e that t hese gr oups o verlapped, as 
some w omen wit h a pr evious hist ory of pr eterm bir th will also ha ve a shor t cer vix. 
Ther efore, they adopt ed the recommendation fr om t he pr evious guideline t o off er vaginal 
progest erone t o women wit h a pr evious hist ory of pr eterm bir th and a shor t cer vix. The 
committ ee concluded t hat, as in t he pr evious guideline, pr ogest erone should be off ered as 
an equal option wit h cer vical cer clage (f or which no new e vidence r eview had been done), 
as there is no e vidence t o det ermine which of t hese options is mor e eff ectiv e. 
As the tr eatment options ar e very diff erent (r egular use of v aginal pr ogest erone 
throughout pr egnancy , compar ed wit h a single operativ e procedur e), the committ ee 
highlight ed that t he choice of tr eatment should be made aft er discussion of t he risks and 
benefit s of t he 2 treatment s. 
The committ ee w ere awar e that t here is uncer tainty about which risk f actors should be 
used t o identify w omen at risk of pr eterm bir th (cervical lengt h measur ement s, previous 
history of pr eterm bir th, pr evious cer vical sur gery). Ther e is also v ariation in practice

women at high risk of pr eterm bir th who w ould definit ely benefit fr om tr eatment wit h 
vaginal pr ogest erone. Consequent ly, the committ ee agr eed t hat tr eatment wit h 
progest erone should be consider ed for women wit h either of t hese risk f actors ( cervical 
lengt h of 25  mm or less, or a pr evious hist ory of pr eterm bir th). Because of t he uncer tainty

The timing of pr ogest erone administration v aried betw een t he studies. Ho wever, most

treatment at an y suitable time during t hat range of gestational age. Ther e was no e vidence 
on when pr ogest erone should be st opped, but t he committ ee's e xperience was t hat it 
should be continued until at least 34  weeks. As t here was uncer tainty about t hese timings, 
the committ ee also made a r ecommendation f or resear ch on t he optimal timing of

this might incr ease t he use of pr ogest erone, but t he benefit s of r educed numbers of

that cor ticost eroids administ ered for ot her r easons during pr egnancy w ould not count 
towards this total of 2  courses, and so clarified in t heir r ecommendation t hat only courses 
administ ered for pr eterm labour should be count ed.

How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendations pr ovide guidance on when a single r epeat course of mat ernal 
corticost eroids ma y be used, and so ma y reduce v ariation in practice. This ma y incr ease 
the number of w omen who r eceiv e a single r epeat course, and ma y reduce t he number of

therefore likely to be minimal considering t he lo w cost of a course of mat ernal

37Context 
Preterm bir th is t he single biggest cause of neonatal mor tality and morbidity in t he UK. 
Over 52, 000 babies (ar ound 7 .3% of liv e bir ths) in England and W ales in 2012 w ere born 
preterm (t hat is, bef ore 37+0  weeks of pr egnancy). Ther e has been no decline in t he 
preterm bir th rat e in t he UK o ver the last 10  years. 
Babies born pr eterm ha ve high rat es of neonatal and inf ant mor tality , and t he risk of 
mortality incr eases as gestational age at bir th decr eases. Babies who sur vive preterm 
birth have incr eased rat es of disability . Recent UK studies comparing cohor ts born in 1995 
and 2006 ha ve sho wn impr oved rat es of sur vival (fr om 40% t o 53%) f or extreme pr eterm 
births (born betw een 22  and 26  weeks). Rat es of disability in sur vivors w ere largely 
unchanged o ver this time period. 
The major long-t erm consequence of pr ematurity is neur odevelopmental disability . 
Although t he risk f or the individual child is gr eatest for those born at t he earliest 
gestational ages, t he global bur den of neur odevelopmental disabilities depends on t he 
number of babies born at each of t hese gestations, and so is gr eatest for babies born 
betw een 32  and 36  weeks, less f or those born betw een 28  and 31  weeks, and least f or 
those born at less t han 28  weeks gestation. 
Around 7 5% of pr eterm bir ths occur aft er pr eterm labour , which ma y or ma y not be 
preceded b y preterm pr elabour ruptur e of membranes. The r emaining w omen giving bir th 
preterm ha ve an electiv e preterm bir th when t his is t hought t o be in t he fetal or mat ernal 
interest (f or example, because of e xtreme gr owth retardation in t he bab y or mat ernal 
conditions such as pr e-eclampsia). 
This guideline r eviews t he evidence f or the best wa y to provide tr eatment f or women who 
present wit h sympt oms and signs of pr eterm labour , and w omen who ar e scheduled t o 
have an early planned bir th. It also r eviews ho w preterm bir th can be optimally diagnosed 
when sympt oms ar e present, giv en that man y women t hought t o be in pr eterm labour on a 
clinical assessment will not giv e bir th preterm. 
The guideline does not co ver who should and should not ha ve medically indicat ed pr eterm 
birth, or diagnostic or pr edictiv e tests in asympt omatic w omen. Preterm labour and bir th (NG25)
