Cervical Cerclage
Green-top Guideline No. 75
June 2022

1. Key recommendations
- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage.
- Women with a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may be offered cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less.
- Cerclage is not recommended for women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.
- In cases of unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, transabdominal cerclage may be considered.
- Emergency cerclage may delay birth and reduce the chance of preterm birth.

2. Background and scope
Cerclage is used for women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss, providing structural support to the cervix.

5. History-indicated cerclage
- Cerclage is recommended for women with three or more previous preterm births.
- Cerclage is not recommended for women with less than three previous preterm births without additional risk factors.

6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage
- Cerclage is not recommended for women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.
- Women with a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may be offered cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less.

An ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical shortening reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks gestation in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth. Serial sonographic surveillance may help identify women who may benefit from cerclage. Cerclage is not recommended for funnelling of the cervix without shortening. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies. The role of cerclage is uncertain in women with Mullerian anomalies or previous cervical surgery. Further research is needed in these areas.

Cerclage is effective in women with a raised BMI. In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be discussed and considered. Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy, with the laparoscopic approach associated with fewer complications. Decisions on care and treatment in cases of delayed miscarriage or fetal death in women with an abdominal cerclage should be individualized with input from a senior obstetrician. The decision to place an emergency cerclage should be individualized, taking the parents' views carefully into account. The contraindications to cerclage insertion are active preterm labor, clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, continuing vaginal bleeding, PPROM, evidence of fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Before cerclage insertion, women should be given information about potential complications.

Women should be informed of potential complications associated with cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labour, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage. Intraoperative complications are rare, and fistula formation is a late, rare complication. Cerclage insertion is associated with an increased risk of maternal pyrexia, but not with chorioamnionitis, PPROM, induction of labour, or caesarean birth. Prior to insertion, appropriate verbal and written information should be given to women. Investigations before insertion should include a first-trimester ultrasound scan and screening for aneuploidy for history-indicated sutures, and an anomaly scan for ultrasound-indicated or emergency cerclage. Maternal white cell count and C-reactive protein can be used to detect chorioamnionitis before emergency cerclage. Routine amniocentesis is not recommended before rescue or ultrasound-indicated cerclage, but may be considered in selected cases. Amnioreduction before emergency cerclage is not recommended. The decision for perioperative tocolysis, antibiotics, and anaesthesia should be made on an individual basis. Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure. The choice of suture material, technique, and material should be at the discretion of the surgeon.

pregnancy and cervical length less than 25mm between 16 and 23 weeks were randomized to McDonald cerclage or no cerclage. Outcomes of women who underwent cerclage were analysed by the type of suture material comparing polyester braided thread to mersilene tape. Rates of preterm birth less than 35 weeks were similar between polyester braided thread and mersilene tape. An RCT is currently ongoing assessing the type of suture material. Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efficacy of single versus double cerclage. Limited data exists to support the use of bed rest but individualization of care should be considered as well as the risks associated with prolonged immobilization. Abstinence from sexual intercourse following cerclage insertion should not be routinely recommended. Routine fetal fibronectin testing is not recommended post-cerclage. Routine use of progesterone supplementation following cerclage is not recommended. There is no evidence that either progesterone or Arabin pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical cerclage. A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before labor, usually between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. In women with PPROM between 24 and.

Delayed removal of cerclage until labor or birth is indicated is not recommended due to the increased risk of maternal/fetal sepsis. The minimal benefit of delaying suture removal for 48 hours in cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes before 23 and after 34 weeks of gestation is unlikely to be advantageous. Studies have shown that leaving the cerclage in place may be associated with higher rates of chorioamnionitis without extending pregnancy.
