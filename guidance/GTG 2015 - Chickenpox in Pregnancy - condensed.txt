Green-top Guideline No. 13 on Chickenpox in Pregnancy recommends varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy. Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles and inform healthcare workers of any exposure. If exposed, a blood test should be done to determine immunity, and VZIG may be offered if necessary. Pregnant women with chickenpox should seek immediate care and may be prescribed oral aciclovir. Hospital referral is recommended for severe cases. Risks to the fetus include fetal varicella syndrome, and neonates should be monitored for infection. Varicella vaccination is cost-effective for seronegative women. Pregnant women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks after vaccination. Routine screening for varicella immunity may be considered for women from tropical areas. Contact with chickenpox or shingles should be managed carefully, with VZIG offered if needed. Awareness of the risks and appropriate care are crucial in managing chickenpox in pregnancy.

Pregnant women with shingles should notify their doctor if a rash develops. Isolation is necessary for pregnant women with chickenpox. A second dose of VZIG may be needed after exposure. Chickenpox is contagious before the rash appears and while lesions are active. Contact with shingles poses a risk, especially in certain cases. Susceptibility should be determined through history or testing. VZIG should be offered to non-immune pregnant women after exposure. VZIG may prevent chickenpox and reduce the risk of fetal varicella syndrome. Adverse effects of VZIG are minimal. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their doctor immediately. Aciclovir may be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox. Hospitalization may be necessary for severe cases of chickenpox in pregnant women. Delivery must be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox. Risks to the fetus from varicella infection include FVS. Prenatal diagnosis of FVS is possible through ultrasound.

The presence of VZV DNA in amniotic fluid has high sensitivity but low specificity for the development of FVS. Ultrasound and amniotic fluid PCR testing can help identify cases of FVS, but the positive predictive value is poor. In cases of maternal varicella infection in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, there is a significant risk of varicella infection in the newborn. Planned delivery should be delayed for at least 7 days after the onset of maternal rash to allow for passive antibody transfer. Neonatologists should be informed of births to women with chickenpox during pregnancy. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox, with precautions for active lesions. Prophylaxis with VZIG is recommended for newborns exposed to chickenpox around the time of delivery. Further research is needed on screening practices and antiviral treatment in pregnancy.

Varicella-zoster contact – clarify significance of the contact
Presents with chickenpox – initial contact should be with the woman’s GP
Uncertain or no past history of chickenpox, or woman from a tropical or subtropical country
Check blood for VZV IgG
No action needed. Reassure and return to normal antenatal care
VZV IgG present VZV IgG not present
Past history of chickenpox
• Give VZIG if less than 10 days since contact or, for continuous exposure, less than 10 days since the appearance of the rash in the index case
• Advise the woman that she is potentially infectious from 8–28 days after contact
• Discuss postpartum varicella immunization
• Women who develop severe infection and women at high risk of complicated chickenpox should be referred to hospital
• Intravenous aciclovir should be given
• Inform women that infection at < 28+0 weeks is associated with a small (~1%) risk of FVS
• Refer to a fetal medicine specialist at 16–20 weeks or 5 weeks after infection
• Amniocentesis to detect varicella DNA may be considered
• Avoid contact with potentially susceptible individuals (e.g. neonates and other pregnant women)
• Symptomatic treatment and hygiene should be advised
• If the woman presents < 24 hours of the appearance of the rash and she is ≥ 20+0 weeks of gestation, prescribe aciclovir
• If the woman presents < 24 hours of the appearance of the rash and she is < 20+0 weeks of gestation, consider aciclovir
• Avoid delivery of the baby until at least 7 days since the rash appeared
