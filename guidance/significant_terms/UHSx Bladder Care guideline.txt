Here are the most clinically significant terms and keywords extracted from the guideline, categorized for clarity:

### **General Concepts**  
- Bladder care and management  
- Evidence-based guidance  
- Labour and postnatal period  
- Bladder health optimization  
- Overdistension prevention  
- Infection risk reduction  
- Urethral damage prevention  
- Voiding dysfunction  
- Management plans  

### **Clinical Recommendations**  
- Fluid intake monitoring  
- Regular voiding encouragement  
- Timely catheterization  
- Postnatal voiding assistance  
- Voiding volume documentation  
- Bladder scan  
- Physiotherapy referral  
- Urinary catheter removal (when clinically indicated)  
- Catheter care instructions  
- Trial without catheter (TWOC)  
- Close monitoring and prompt intervention  

### **Bladder Scan Management (Post-Scanning Volumes)**  
- **<200 mL**: Hydration advice, TWOC process, fluid balance review  
- **200-500 mL**: In-out catheter, restart TWOC  
- **500-1000 mL**: Indwelling catheter (IDC) for 24h, urine dip/CSU, repeat TWOC  
- **>1000 mL / second failed TWOC**:  
  - Urine dip, CSU  
  - Datix (incident reporting)  
  - Obstetrician review  
  - IDC for 7 days (bladder rest)  
  - Community Continence Nurse Referral (home TWOC)  

### **Second Unsuccessful TWOC Management**  
- Document 2 voided volumes post-IDC removal  
- Post-void residual (PVR) check within 30 min  
- **Discharge criteria**:  
  - Voided volume >200 mL & PVR <150 mL  
- **Persistent dysfunction**:  
  - Reinsert IDC for 7 days (free-drainage bag)  

### **Indications for Indwelling Catheter (IDC)**  
- Post-LSCS (caesarean) or operative birth  
- Spinal/epidural analgesia  
- Distended bladder in labour  
- Persistent retention/voiding dysfunction  
- Retained placenta  
- Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)  
- 3rd/4th degree tear  
- Extensive perineal trauma (periurethral tear, labial swelling, hematoma)  

### **Key Abbreviations & Procedures**  
- **TWOC** (Trial Without Catheter)  
- **
