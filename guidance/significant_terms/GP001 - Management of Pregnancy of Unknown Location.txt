Here are the most clinically significant terms and keywords extracted from the guideline, critical for understanding the guidance on **Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL)**:

### **Key Clinical Terms & Keywords:**  
1. **Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL)** – Primary diagnosis (positive pregnancy test, no ultrasound confirmation).  
2. **Ectopic pregnancy** – Must be ruled out until location is confirmed.  
3. **hCG levels** (human chorionic gonadotropin) – Key biomarker for monitoring and decision-making.  
4. **Progesterone levels** – Used alongside hCG for risk stratification.  
5. **Conservative management** – Based on symptoms and hCG trends.  
6. **Methotrexate contraindication** – Not to be used for PUL.  
7. **Emergency care** – Advised for severe pain or feeling unwell.  
8. **Ultrasound** – Primary imaging tool (failure to visualize pregnancy defines PUL).  
9. **Laparoscopy** – Potential intervention if ectopic pregnancy is suspected.  
10. **Written information** – Must be provided to patients (emergency protocols).  
11. **Individualized management** – Based on clinical signs/symptoms (may include repeat scans or surgery).  
12. **Travel restrictions** – Avoid areas without immediate medical access.  

### **Key Stakeholders:**  
- **Clinicians** (Gynaecologists, Obstetricians, Midwives, Nurses) – Responsible for applying guidance.  
- **Management Team** – Ensures protocol accessibility and updates.  

These terms encapsulate the core clinical, diagnostic, and management principles for PUL.
