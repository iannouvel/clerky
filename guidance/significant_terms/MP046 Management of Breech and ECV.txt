Here are the most clinically significant terms and keywords extracted from the guideline, organized by relevance and category:

### **General Definitions & Epidemiology**  
- Breech presentation  
- Longitudinal lie  
- Perinatal mortality/morbidity  
- Incidence (20% at 28 weeks, 16% at 32 weeks, 3–4% at term)  

### **Types of Breech Presentation**  
- Frank (extended) breech  
- Complete (flexed) breech  
- Footling breech  
- Kneeling breech  

### **Management & Referral**  
- External cephalic version (ECV)  
- Success rate (~50%)  
- Contraindications (absolute contraindications to vaginal birth)  
- Day Assessment Unit (DAU) referral (>36 weeks)  
- RCOG leaflet: *A Breech Baby at the End of Pregnancy*  

### **Delivery Options & Counseling**  
- Elective LSCS (caesarean section at ~39 weeks)  
- Vaginal breech birth (assessment required)  
- Risks/benefits discussion (ECV, vaginal breech, LSCS)  

### **Risk Factors for Vaginal Breech Birth**  
- Hyperextended neck  
- High/low estimated fetal weight  
- Footling presentation  
- Antenatal fetal compromise  

### **Intrapartum Care & Birth Plan**  
- Multidisciplinary team approach  
- Immediate caesarean access & neonatal support  
- Induction of labor (not recommended unless specific criteria)  
- Continuous monitoring  
- Lower tolerance for slow progress in breech labor  

### **Second Stage of Labor & Delivery Techniques**  
- Passive second stage before active pushing  
- Progressive descent monitoring  
- Hands-poised/hands-off approach  
- **Maneuvers:**  
  - Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit (for after-coming head delay)  
  - Assisted vaginal breech maneuvers  
- **Positions:**  
  - Semirecumbent  
  - All-fours  
- **Key warnings:**  
  - No traction on breech  
  - Selective episiotomy  
  - Signs requiring intervention (lack of tone/color, delay)  

### **Special Cases & Governance**  
- Preterm breech → LSCS recommended  
- Twin pregnancy (breech presenting twin → LSCS)  
- Undiagnosed breech in labor (consider
