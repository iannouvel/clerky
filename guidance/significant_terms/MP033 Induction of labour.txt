Here are the most clinically significant terms and keywords extracted from the guideline, organized by category for clarity:

### **General Protocol Terms**  
- Induction of Labour (IOL)  
- Protocol  
- Professional judgement  
- Scope (pregnant women)  
- Responsibilities (Midwives, Obstetricians, Management)  

### **Key Clinical Concepts**  
- Prolonged pregnancy (>42 weeks)  
- Low-lying placenta (check before membrane sweeping)  
- Membrane sweeping (recommended adjunct)  
- Bishop Score (assessment before induction)  
- Vaginal PGE2 (preferred pharmacological method)  
- Amniotomy (avoid as primary method unless contraindications)  
- Oxytocin (secondary method)  
- Uterine hyperstimulation (risk with PGE2)  
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (required)  

### **Specific Indications & Contraindications**  
- **41+0 to 42+0 weeks** (recommended induction window)  
- **Preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes (PPROM)**  
- **Term pre-labour rupture of membranes (PROM)**  
- **VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Caesarean)** (refer to MP034)  
- **Maternal request** (not routinely offered)  
- **Breech presentation** (not recommended unless failed ECV)  
- **Fetal growth restriction (severe with compromise)** (not recommended)  
- **History of precipitate labour** (not routinely offered)  
- **Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD)** (support & tailored induction)  
- **Suspected fetal macrosomia** (not sole reason for induction)  
- **Diabetes & hypertension** (refer to specific protocols)  

### **Methods NOT Recommended**  
- Herbal supplements  
- Acupuncture  
- Homeopathy  
- Castor oil  
- Hot baths  
- Enemas  
- Sexual intercourse  
- Balloon catheters (mechanical methods)  
- Laminaria tents  

### **Monitoring & Safety**  
- Outpatient induction (only if safety protocols in place)  
- Inpatient induction (preferred for PGE2)  
- Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring  
- Uterine contraction monitoring  
- Pain management (informed about increased pain)  
- Cord prolapse (precautions)  
- Uterine rupture (emergency C-section if suspected)  
- Failed induction (management options discussed)
