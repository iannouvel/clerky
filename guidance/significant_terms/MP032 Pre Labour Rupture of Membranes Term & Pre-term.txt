- **Induction of Labour (IOL)**  
- **Bishop score**  
- **MDT (Multidisciplinary Team) review**  

### **Assessment & Diagnosis**  
- **Telephone/verbal risk assessment**  
- **Clinical assessment (history, physical exam, testing)**  
- **Sterile speculum examination**  
- **Amnisure® test**

- **22-24+6 weeks (neonatal team discussion, active management)**  
- **24+6–33+6 weeks (EFW/presentation, steroids, MgSO₄)**  
- **34–36+6 weeks (2-weekly scans, EFW/presentation)**  
- **>37 weeks (term PROM, IOL considerations)**  

### **Monitoring & Follow-Up**  
- **4-weekly scans (unless concerns for fetal movements)**  
- **2-weekly scans (34 weeks until delivery)**  
- **Intrapartum monitoring & resuscitation planning**  

### **Guidelines & References**
