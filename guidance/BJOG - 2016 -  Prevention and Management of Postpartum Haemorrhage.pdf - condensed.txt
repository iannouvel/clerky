Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage
Risk factors for PPH should be identified and managed throughout pregnancy. Antenatal anaemia should be treated to reduce PPH risk. Uterine massage is not beneficial for preventing PPH. Prophylactic uterotonics should be offered during the third stage of labor. Oxytocin is the preferred agent for vaginal deliveries, while oxytocin or ergometrine-oxytocin may be used for cesarean sections. Tranexamic acid may be considered for women at increased PPH risk during cesarean sections. Communication and multidisciplinary care are essential for managing PPH. Resuscitation measures for minor and major PPH should be followed. Blood transfusion should be based on clinical and hematological assessments. Intraoperative cell salvage and blood components may be necessary. Consideration should be given to using tranexamic acid for PPH management. Recombinant factor VIIa therapy is not routinely recommended. Monitoring and investigations for major PPH should be performed promptly. The anaesthetist plays a crucial role in maintaining stability during PPH. A combination of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical methods should be used to control bleeding. Surgical interventions should be considered if pharmacological measures fail. Secondary PPH should be managed with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and surgical evacuation if necessary. Training and preparation are essential for optimal PPH management. Accurate documentation and debriefing should be conducted after PPH events.

Increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units. Obstetricians and midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community, including PPH. This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH; the prevention and management of PPH related to placenta praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in a separate guideline. Obstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and developing countries. Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modified as and when risk factors arise. Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account when counseling women about the place of delivery. Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the morbidity associated with PPH. Prophylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of labor in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH. Uterine massage is of no benefit in the prophylaxis of PPH. For women delivering vaginally, oxytocin is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labor. For women delivering by caesarean section, oxytocin should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and decrease blood loss. Ergometrine-oxytocin may be used in women at increased risk of hemorrhage. Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid in addition to oxytocin at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. Carbetocin is licensed for the prevention of PPH in the context of caesarean delivery.

Guidelines recommend carbetocin for prevention of PPH in elective caesarean deliveries. Tranexamic acid is effective in reducing blood loss in women undergoing caesarean section. Clinical signs and symptoms should be used to assess PPH severity. Communication with patients and multidisciplinary care are important in managing PPH. Measures for minor and major PPH include intravenous access, blood tests, and fluid resuscitation. Blood transfusion should be based on clinical and hematological assessment. Monitoring of vital signs and blood parameters is crucial during resuscitation.

Selection of red cell units for transfusion must include emergency blood provision with immediate issue of group O, RhD-negative and K-negative units, switching to group-specific blood as soon as feasible. Close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential in the presence of clinically significant red cell antibodies to avoid delays in transfusion during life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnant women and women of childbearing age who are RhD negative should only receive RhD-negative blood to prevent D alloimmunization. Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in postpartum hemorrhage. Delivery units, especially those without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supply of group O, RhD-negative blood. The use of CMV-seronegative products is recommended in elective transfusions during the antenatal period to prevent transmission to the fetus. Consideration should be given to using tranexamic acid in the management of PPH. Platelets should be transfused when the count is less than 75 x 10^9/l during ongoing PPH. Fibrinogen levels should be maintained at greater than 2 g/l during ongoing PPH, with cryoprecipitate used for replacement.

In the management of major postpartum hemorrhage, the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is not recommended unless as part of a clinical trial. It is important to prioritize resuscitation and other essential treatments before considering rFVIIa. However, in life-threatening cases of postpartum hemorrhage, rFVIIa may be considered as a treatment option but should not delay life-saving procedures. Monitoring and investigation in major postpartum hemorrhage should include immediate venepuncture for various tests, continuous physiological monitoring, and prompt escalation of treatment when abnormal scores are observed. It is also crucial to administer thromboprophylaxis after bleeding is controlled to prevent thrombosis. The role of the anaesthetist in managing postpartum hemorrhage is to maintain hemodynamic stability and determine the appropriate anesthesia method. Various pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used to arrest bleeding, with uterine atony being the most common cause. Surgical interventions should be considered if pharmacological measures fail to control hemorrhage, with intrauterine balloon tamponade as a first-line option. Hysterectomy may be necessary in cases of placenta accreta or uterine rupture. The decision for surgical interventions should not be delayed by the use of pharmacological agents.

5.6.2.1 Uterine balloon tamponade
Tamponade using various types of hydrostatic balloon catheter has superseded uterine packing for the control of atonic PPH. The urological Rusch balloon has been described as preferable by virtue of larger capacity, ease of use, and low cost. Balloon tamponade can serve as a 'test' to determine the need for further intervention. Evidence supports the effectiveness of uterine balloon tamponade in treating PPH.

5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing
Haemostatic brace sutures, such as the B-Lynch technique, have shown success in controlling PPH due to atony and placenta praevia. Various techniques have been described with success rates in preventing hysterectomy. Delay in uterine compression suture can increase the risk of hysterectomy. Combined use of haemostatic suturing and balloon tamponade has been reported in managing PPH.

5.6.2.3 Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation
Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation are conservative surgical treatments for PPH. These techniques have shown effectiveness in controlling severe PPH without the need for hysterectomy. Fertility outcomes following these procedures are not impaired.

5.6.2.4 Selective arterial occlusion or embolisation by interventional radiology
Arterial embolisation can be effective in stopping bleeding in PPH cases. Uterine balloon tamponade is recommended as a first-line treatment due to logistical considerations. Arterial embolisation does not impair subsequent fertility and obstetric outcomes.

5.6.2.5 Hysterectomy
Hysterectomy should be considered by experienced clinicians in cases of severe PPH, especially with placenta accreta or uterine rupture. Subtotal hysterectomy is often preferred, and there has been a decrease in the proportion of women requiring hysterectomy for PPH.

7. Risk management
Maternity units should have protocols for PPH management, and staff should receive training in obstetric emergencies, including PPH. Cases of PPH with significant blood loss should undergo a formal clinical incident review to ensure optimal management. Training and simulations have been shown to improve outcomes in obstetric emergencies.

Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential. Inadequate documentation can lead to medicolegal consequences. Record staff, events, pharmacological agents, surgical intervention, mother's condition, and fluid/blood products given. Offer debriefing to women after obstetric hemorrhage to address psychological effects. Discuss future pregnancy and arrange appropriate investigations.
