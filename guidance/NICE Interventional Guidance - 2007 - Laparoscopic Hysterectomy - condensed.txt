Laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy are safe and effective, but carry a higher risk of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, and clinicians should undergo special training. Hysterectomy is performed for various benign conditions and cancers of the uterus and ovaries. Laparoscopic procedures can result in shorter hospital stays and quicker return to normal activities compared to open surgery. However, there is a higher incidence of major operative hemorrhage with laparoscopic techniques. Special training is necessary to ensure safety and prevent adverse events such as injury to the ureter and bowel, vascular injury, hemorrhage, and the need for blood transfusion. Other interventional procedures for similar indications include laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer and various endometrial ablation techniques.
