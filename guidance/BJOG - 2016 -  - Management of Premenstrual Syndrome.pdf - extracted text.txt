This is the second edition of this guideline, which was first published in 2007 under the same title.
Executive summary of recommendations
How is premenstrual syndrome (PMS) diagnosed?
When clinically reviewing women for PMS, symptoms should be recorded prospectively, over
two cycles using a symptom diary, as retrospective recall of symptoms is unreliable.
A symptom diary should be completed by the patient prior to commencing treatment.
Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues may be used for 3 months for a definitive
diagnosis if the completed symptom diary alone is inconclusive. [New 2016]
What aspects are involved in delivering a service to women with PMS?
When should women with PMS be referred to a gynaecologist?
Referral to a gynaecologist should be considered when simple measures (e.g. combined oral
contraceptives [COCS], vitamin B6, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) have been
explored and failed and when the severity of the PMS justifies gynaecological intervention.
Who are the key health professionals to manage women with severe PMS?
Women with severe PMS may benefit from being managed by a multidisciplinary team
comprising a general practitioner, a general gynaecologist or a gynaecologist with a special
interest in PMS, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counsellor)
and a dietician. [New 2016]
How is PMS managed?
Are complementary therapies efficacious in treating PMS?
Women with PMS should be informed that there is conflicting evidence to support the use of C
some complementary medicines.
An integrated holistic approach should be used when treating women with PMS.

A
Interactions with conventional medicines should be considered.
Is there a role for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other psychological counselling techniques?
When treating women with severe PMS, CBT should be considered routinely as a treatment
option.
Hormonal medical management of PMS
Which COC has the best evidence for managing PMS, including regimens delivering ethinylestradiol?
When treating women with PMS, drospirenone-containing COCs may represent effective treatment
for PMS and should be considered as a first-line pharmaceutical intervention. [New 2016]
What is the optimum COC pill regimen, e.g. continuous, cyclical or flexible?
When treating women with PMS, emerging data suggest use of the contraceptive pill
continuously rather than cyclically.
How efficacious is percutaneous estradiol?
Percutaneous estradiol combined with cyclical progestogens has been shown to be effective for
the management of physical and psychological symptoms of severe PMS.
When treating women with PMS, alternative barrier or intrauterine methods of contraception
should be used when estradiol is used to suppress ovulation.
How can the return of PMS symptoms be avoided during estrogen therapy with progestogenic protection?
When using transdermal estrogen to treat women with PMS, the lowest possible dose of
progesterone or progestogen is recommended to minimise progestogenic adverse effects. [New 2016]
Women should be informed that low levels of levonorgestrel released by the levonorgestrel-
releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) 52 mg can initially produce PMS-type adverse effects
(as well as bleeding problems). [New 2016]
Micronised progesterone is theoretically less likely to reintroduce PMS-like symptoms and
should therefore be considered as first line for progestogenic opposition rather than
progestogens. [New 2016]
What is the optimum regimen for prevention of endometrial hyperplasia?
When treating women with percutaneous estradiol, a cyclical 10-12 day course of oral or
vaginal progesterone or long-term progestogen with the LNG-IUS 52 mg should be used for the
prevention of endometrial hyperplasia. [New 2016]
A
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 48
e75 of e105 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
When using a short duration of progestogen therapy, or in cases where only low doses are
tolerated, there should be a low threshold for investigating unscheduled bleeding. [New 2016]
What is the safety of estradiol on the premenopausal endometrium and breast tissue?
When treating women with PMS using estradiol, women should be informed that there are
insufficient data to advise on the long-term effects on breast and endometrial tissue.
For how long can estradiol be used safely and what is the risk of recurrence?
Due to the uncertainty of the long-term effects of opposed estradiol therapy, treatment of
women with PMS should be on an individual basis, taking into account the risks and benefits.
[New 2016]
What is the evidence for efficacy and adverse effects of danazol in the treatment of PMS?
Women with PMS should be advised that, although treatment with low dose danazol (200 mg
twice daily) is effective in the luteal phase for breast symptoms, it also has potential
irreversible virilising effects. [New 2016]
Women treated with danazol for PMS should be advised to use contraception during treatment
due to its potential virilising effects on female fetuses. [New 2016]
How effective are GnRH analogues for treating severe PMS?
GnRH analogues are highly effective in treating severe PMS. [New 2016]
When treating women with PMS, GnRH analogues should usually be reserved for women with
the most severe symptoms and not recommended routinely unless they are being used to aid
diagnosis or treat particularly severe cases. [New 2016]
How should women with PMS receiving add-back therapy be managed?

When treating women with severe PMS using GnRH analogues for more than 6 months, add-
back hormone therapy should be used. [New 2016]
A
When add-back hormone therapy is required, continuous combined hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) or tibolone is recommended.
A
Women should be provided with general advice regarding the effects of exercise, diet and
smoking on bone mineral density (BMD).
Women on long-term treatment should have measurement of BMD (ideally by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) every year. Treatment should be stopped if bone density declines
significantly. [New 2016]

Can GnRH analogues be useful in clarification of diagnostic category?
When the diagnosis of PMS is unclear from 2 months' prospective Daily Record of Severity of
Problems (DRSP) charting, GnRH analogues can be used to establish and/or support a diagnosis
of PMS. [New 2016]
What is the role for progesterone and progestogen preparations in treating PMS?
There is good evidence to suggest that treating PMS with progesterone or progestogens is not
appropriate. [New 2016]
There is no evidence to support the use of the LNG-IUS 52 mg alone to treat PMS symptoms.
Its role should be confined to opposing the action of estrogen therapy on the endometrium.
Non-hormonal medical management of PMS
How do selective SSRIs work in PMS and how should they be given?
SSRIs should be considered one of the first-line pharmaceutical management options in severe
PMS. [New 2016]
A
A
What is the efficacy of SSRIs in treatment of PMS?
When treating women with PMS, either luteal or continuous dosing with SSRIs can be
recommended.
Is there any evidence on how SSRIs should be discontinued when used in PMS?
SSRIs should be discontinued gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms, if given on a continuous
basis.
What are the risks and adverse effects of SSRIs?

B
Women with PMS treated with SSRIs should be warned of the possible adverse effects such as
nausea, insomnia, somnolence, fatigue and reduction in libido. [New 2016]
✓
Is there evidence for improved efficacy with other SSRI regimens?
When using SSRIs to treat PMS, efficacy may be improved and adverse effects minimised by
the use of luteal-phase regimens with the newer agents. [New 2016]
A
What preconception and early pregnancy advice should be given regarding SSRIs/serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs)?
Women should be provided with prepregnancy counselling at every opportunity. They should
be informed that PMS symptoms will abate during pregnancy and SSRIs should therefore be
discontinued prior to and during pregnancy. [New 2016]
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 48
e77 of e105 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Women should be informed how to safely stop SSRIs. [New 2016]
Women with PMS who become pregnant while taking an SSRI/SNRI should be aware of the
possible, although unproven, association with congenital malformations. They should be
reassured that if such an association does exist, it is likely to be extremely small when
compared to the general population. [New 2016]
Are diuretics efficacious in the treatment of PMS?
Spironolactone can be used in women with PMS to treat physical symptoms. [New 2016]
How can PMS be managed surgically?
B
C
Can surgical management of PMS be justified and is it efficacious?
When treating women with severe PMS, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy has been
shown to be of benefit.
D
14710528, 2017, 3, Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14260 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [29/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
When treating women with PMS, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy can be considered
when medical management has failed, long-term GnRH analogue treatment is required or other
gynaecological conditions indicate surgery. [New 2016]
Should the efficacy of surgery always be predicted by the prior use of GnRH analogues?
When treating women with PMS, surgery should not be contemplated without preoperative
use of GnRH analogues as a test of cure and to ensure that HRT is tolerated.
What is the role of HRT after surgical management?
Women being surgically treated for PMS should be advised to use HRT, particularly if they are
younger than 45 years of age. [New 2016]
Is there a role for endometrial ablation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy alone?
When treating women with severe PMS, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy with
conservation of the ovaries are not recommended. [New 2016]
Bilateral oophorectomy alone (without removal of the uterus) will necessitate the use of a
progestogen as part of any subsequent HRT regimen and this carries a risk of reintroduction of
PMS-like symptoms (progestogen-induced premenstrual disorder). [New 2016]

The aim of this guideline is to review the diagnosis, classification and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
The evidence for pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments is examined.
2.
Introduction and background epidemiology
Since the 2007 guideline, there has been considerable work by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders
(ISPMD) and the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS) to achieve consensus on the recognition,
diagnosis, classification and management of PMS. Misdiagnosis of PMS (e.g. confusion with bipolar disorder) and the
use of a wide range of treatments, often with little evidence for effectiveness and safety, demand that these issues
are addressed.
2.1
Definition of PMS
PMS encompasses a vast array of psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability, loss of confidence
and mood swings. There are also physical symptoms, typically bloatedness and mastalgia. It is the timing, rather than
the types of symptoms, and the degree of impact on daily activity that supports a diagnosis of PMS. The character of
symptoms in an individual patient does not influence the diagnosis. In order to differentiate physiological menstrual
symptoms from PMS, it must be demonstrated that symptoms cause significant impairment to the individual during
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.'
2.2
Classification of PMS (ISPMD consensus)
Core premenstrual disorders (PMDs) are the most commonly encountered and widely recognised type of PMS. As
with all PMDs, symptoms must be severe enough to affect daily functioning or interfere with work, school
performance or interpersonal relationships. The symptoms of core PMDs are nonspecific and recur in ovulatory
cycles. They must be present during the luteal phase and abate as menstruation begins, which is then followed by a
symptom-free week. There is no limit on the type or number of symptoms experienced; however, some individuals
will have predominantly psychological, predominantly somatic or a mixture of symptoms (Appendix II).
There are also PMDs that do not meet the criteria for core PMDs. These are called 'variant' PMDs and fall into four
subtypes.
1. ‘Premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying disorder', such as diabetes, depression, epilepsy, asthma
and migraine. These patients will experience symptoms relevant to their disorder throughout the menstrual
cycle.
2. 'Non-ovulatory PMDs' occur in the presence of ovarian activity without ovulation. This is poorly understood
due to a lack of evidence, but it is thought that follicular activity of the ovary can instigate symptoms.
3. 'Progestogen-induced PMDs' are caused by exogenous progestogens present in hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) and the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill. This reintroduces symptoms to women who
may be particularly sensitive to progestogens. Although progestogen-only contraceptives may introduce
symptoms, as they are noncyclical they are not included within variant PMDs and are considered adverse effects
(probably with similar mechanisms) of continuous progestogen therapy.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
4. 'PMDs with absent menstruation' include women who still have a functioning ovarian cycle, but for reasons
such as hysterectomy, endometrial ablation or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) they
do not menstruate.²
An additional term, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) classified by the American Psychiatric Association in
1994³ requires fulfilment of strict criteria. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)
demands five out of || stipulated symptoms, one of which must include mood.4 The symptoms must strictly occur in
the luteal phase and must be severe enough to disrupt daily functioning. However, these restrictive criteria may
exclude women with a narrow range of severe symptoms who should receive treatment.
Care must be taken not to label women with underlying psychiatric or somatic disorders that do not appear to be
influenced by the menstrual cycle as having PMS.
2.3 Prevalence and aetiology
Four in ten women (40%) experience symptoms of PMS and of these 5-8% suffer from severe PMS.5 A cross-
sectional survey of 929 women based in Southampton who completed a 6-week prospective symptom diary
revealed a 24% prevalence of premenstrual symptoms.6 Although the aetiology remains uncertain, it revolves
around the ovarian hormone cycle, which is reinforced by the absence of PMS prior to puberty, during pregnancy
and after the menopause. Currently two theories predominate and appear interlinked. The first suggests that
some women are 'sensitive' to progesterone and progestogens, since the serum concentrations of estrogen or
progesterone are the same in those with or without PMS. The second theory implicates the neurotransmitters
serotonin and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Serotonin receptors are responsive to estrogen and progesterone, and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are proven to reduce PMS symptoms. GABA levels are modulated
by the metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and in women with PMS the allopregnanolone levels appear
to be reduced.7
3.
Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and DARE), EMBASE, Trip,
MEDLINE, Psych INFO, CINAHL, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and the British
Nursing Index (BNI) were searched. The search was restricted to articles published between 2005 and March 2014
in the English language. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms,
including all subheadings, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included ‘premenstrual
syndrome', 'premenstrual tension', 'late luteal phase dysphoric disorder', 'premenstrual dysphoric disorder', 'PMDD',
'PMS', 'PMD', 'LLPDD', ‘PMT'. The search was restricted to humans and there were no language restrictions.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. In the absence of published evidence, these have
been annotated as 'good practice points'. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of
recommendations may be found in Appendix I.

How is PMS diagnosed?
When clinically reviewing women for PMS, symptoms should be recorded prospectively, over
two cycles using a symptom diary, as retrospective recall of symptoms unreliable.
A symptom diary should be completed by the patient prior to commencing treatment.
Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues may be used for 3 months for a
definitive diagnosis if the completed symptom diary alone is inconclusive.
8
There are many patient-rated questionnaires available. However, the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)
remains the most widely used and is simple for patients to use.² The DRSP has also been consistently shown to
provide a reliable and reproducible record of symptoms (see Appendix III). The Premenstrual Symptoms Screening
Tool (PSST) is another patient-rated questionnaire; however, it is retrospective and has been validated for screening
but not diagnosis. Various attempts at electronic data capture have been attempted. Commercially available
diagnostic apps are now available, but these require validation. Another easily accessible symptom diary exists on
the NAPS website (www.pms.org.uk). This diary is not validated but is sufficient to be used in the context of
clinical practice.10
Before any form of treatment is initiated, symptom diaries should be completed over at least two consecutive
menstrual cycles. Treatment may improve symptoms, therefore masking underlying PMS, but it can also create a
pattern of symptoms incompatible with a diagnosis of PMS, making the interpretation of DRSP charts confusing.
These charts should be brought by the patient to any future appointments.
Symptom diaries can sometimes be confusing and inconclusive: this is most likely to occur in those patients with
variant PMDs. GnRH analogues, which are widely used within gynaecology, can be useful in separating those with and
those without PMS by inhibiting cyclical ovarian function. These should be used for 3 months to establish a definitive
diagnosis. This is to allow a month for the agonist to generate a complete hormonal suppressive effect, as well as
providing 2 months' worth of symptom diaries.

When should women with PMS be referred to a gynaecologist?

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Referral to a gynaecologist should be considered when simple measures (e.g. COCs,
vitamin B6, SSRIs) have been explored and failed and when the severity of the PMS
justifies gynaecological intervention.
General practitioners will manage the majority of cases of PMS; therefore, awareness of the condition together with
up-to-date information on its management is essential. Referral to secondary care should be reserved for those with
confirmed PMS in whom simple measures have failed to control symptoms. In women whose symptom diaries
demonstrate noncyclical symptoms, an underlying psychiatric or somatic disorder should be considered.

5.2
Who are the key health professionals to manage women with severe PMS?
Women with severe PMS may benefit from being managed by a multidisciplinary team
comprising a general practitioner, a general gynaecologist or a gynaecologist with a special
interest in PMS, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counsellor)
and a dietician.
While this set-up is desirable, it is not widely available or implemented within the National Health Service (NHS).
There are specialist clinics within tertiary centres to which patients can be referred. However, it is likely that the
general practitioner will remain key in facilitating potential treatments. A multidisciplinary team can offer women an
individualised management plan utilising a range of treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and
lifestyle interventions.''

6.1
Are complementary therapies efficacious in treating PMS?
Women with PMS should be informed that there is conflicting evidence to support the use
of some complementary medicines.
An integrated holistic approach should be used when treating women with PMS.
Interactions with conventional medicines should be considered.

Although there is limited evidence to support the use of complementary therapies, some women with PMS
may benefit from a holistic approach. .12 This is particularly important for women in whom hormonal Evidence
therapy is contraindicated. It is important to evaluate evidence carefully for PMS as there is a 36-43% level 1-
placebo response.

Unsaturated fatty acids, as contained in evening primrose oil, have been shown in one prospective randomised trial '5
to improve menstrual symptoms compared with placebo at both I g/day and 2 g/day dosages. There was no
measurable change in cholesterol levels.
Dante et al.16 conducted a systematic review into herbal remedies for PMS. Four of the trials, including almost
600 women, supported the use of Vitex agnus castus L. (also known as chasteberry). However, this study concluded
that there were inadequate safety data to support its use.
Whelan et al.17 conducted a systematic review of 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two of these studies
(n = 499) revealed consistent evidence for calcium in alleviating both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.
The evidence for both vitamin B6 and Vitex was contradictory in this review and therefore advice could not be given
for either. Due to the lack of power, reliable recommendations cannot be provided.

A systematic review focusing on the use of Vitex illustrated that in four out of five discrete placebo-controlled trials
and two comparator trials, Vitex was superior to placebo, pyridoxine and magnesium in the treatment of PMS. In
another study, it appeared comparable to fluoxetine for PMDD.' The safety of Vitex is described as excellent, with
adverse effects being infrequent and mild. 18,19 Studies have shown a dose dependent treatment response; however,
due to the variability in quality and content of preparations a dosage range to treat PMS cannot be recommended.
RCTs including St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) show conflicting results. A trial 20 including |
36 women with mild PMS showed significant improvements in physical and behavioural symptoms but no
improvement in mood or pain-related symptoms. Another trial² including 125 women found no evidence Evidence

6.3.1.1 Which COC has the best evidence for managing PMS, including regimens delivering ethinylestradiol?
When treating women with PMS, drospirenone-containing COCs may represent effective
treatment for PMS and should be considered as a first-line pharmaceutical intervention.

Despite the combined pill's ability to suppress ovulation, studies initially illustrated no benefit in the
treatment of PMS.79 This may be attributed to the progestogens in second-generation pills (levonorgestrel
or norethisterone) regenerating PMS-type symptoms. Further research has therefore been directed
towards new combined contraceptives, in particular those containing the antimineralocorticoid and
antiandrogenic progestogen, such as drospirenone.
80
A Cochrane review involving five RCTs and 1920 participants looked into the effectiveness of drospirenone
(3 mg) and ethinylestradiol COCs against placebo or an alternative COC, where the progestogen was
substituted for desogestrel (150 micrograms) or levonorgestrel (150 micrograms). This concluded that, when
compared with placebo, drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives used for 3 months did reduce the
severity of symptoms for those with PMDD (mean difference -7.92; 95% CI −11.16 to -4.67). The severity
of symptoms was rated using validated questionnaires and where nonvalidated tools were used the original
data were analysed.

6.3.1.2 What is the optimum COC pill regimen, e.g. continuous, cyclical or flexible?
When treating women with PMS, emerging data suggest use of the contraceptive pill
continuously rather than cyclically.
Continuous therapy would seem appropriate; there are some data to support this. Phase I of a study 83
showed that a 168-day extended regimen of drospirenone 3 mg and ethinylestradiol 30 micrograms led to
a significant decrease in premenstrual-type symptoms compared with a standard 21/7-day regimen. Phase II
of this trial extended the continuous use of this COC for a total of 364 days. Menstrual symptoms were
recorded using DRSP charts. The results concluded that mood, headache and pelvic pain scores improved

continuing on this regimen 6 months on from the 364-day trial. 84 This trial used a preparation that is
currently available in the UK as a 24/4-day regimen containing ethinylestradiol 20 micrograms and
drospirenone 3 mg; however, phase II of the study supports continuous use and this may be considered
for off-label usage.
6.3.2 How efficacious is percutaneous estradiol?
Percutaneous estradiol combined with cyclical progestogens has been shown to be effective
for the management of physical and psychological symptoms of severe PMS.
When treating women with PMS, alternative barrier or intrauterine methods of
contraception should be used when estradiol is used to suppress ovulation.
Percutaneous preparations give sufficient estradiol levels to suppress ovarian activity. A placebo-controlled
trial demonstrated that implants of 17ẞ-estradiol combined with cyclical progestogens are effective for the
management of severe PMS symptoms. Administered as a 100-mg implant, this proved to be highly
effective when compared with placebo. Both implants and patches have been evaluated in controlled
trials but gels have not. Implants are available in the UK but are unlicensed for use in PMS.
85
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 20 women with cross-over at 3 months,
transdermal estradiol patches (200 micrograms) were assessed and found to be highly effective.86
Significant improvements occurred after changing to active treatment, proven by the use of symptom
questionnaires. There was concern that estradiol 200 micrograms twice weekly was still too high a dose
to be used as long-term therapy. A subsequent randomised study 87 showed that 100-microgram estradiol
patches twice weekly were as effective as 200 micrograms in reducing symptom levels in severe PMS and
this dosage was better tolerated.88

Although doses are usually sufficient to suppress ovulation, contraceptive efficacy has not been demonstrated and so
should not be relied upon; additional contraceptive measures should be adopted. It is also important to ensure
appropriate endometrial protection (see section 6.3.4).
6.3.3 How can the return of PMS symptoms be avoided during estrogen therapy with progestogenic
protection?
When using transdermal estrogen to treat women with PMS, the lowest possible dose of
progesterone or progestogen is recommended to minimise progestogenic adverse effects.
Women should be informed that low levels of levonorgestrel released by the LNG-IUS 52 mg
can initially produce PMS-type adverse effects (as well as bleeding problems).
Micronised progesterone is theoretically less likely to reintroduce PMS-like symptoms and
should therefore be considered as first line for progestogenic opposition rather than
progestogens.

Use of continuous estradiol necessitates the addition of cyclical progesterone or progestogens
(10-12 days/cycle) to avoid endometrial hyperplasia in women who have a uterus. A study of long-term
treatment over eight cycles using a 100 mg estradiol patch with a low dose of cyclical norethisterone
acetate (1 mg; 10 days/cycle) has shown benefit compared with placebo, with continued improvement in a
6-month extension.
89
Evidence
level 1+
Intrauterine administration of progestogen has the potential to avoid systemic absorption and hence minimise
progestogenic effects. The LNG-IUS 52 mg as progestogen replacement can maximise efficacy by minimising PMS-like
adverse effects. Low systemic levels of levonorgestrel released by the LNG-IUS can initially produce PMS-type
adverse effects (as well as bleeding) in progestogen-intolerant women and on rare occasions it will need to be
removed due to the persisting adverse effects. 90-92
90
Micronised oral progesterone (100 or 200 mg) has fewer androgenic and unwanted adverse effects
compared with progestogens such as norethisterone and levonorgestrel. Progesterone may act as a
diuretic and a central nervous system anxiolytic and so in theory could also alleviate PMS symptoms,
although there is currently little evidence to demonstrate this.⁹0 Micronised progesterone can also be
administered vaginally, which may be better tolerated by avoiding first-pass hepatic metabolism.
Vaginally administered progesterone avoids the formation of psychoactive metabolites such as
allopregnanolone.
6.3.4 What is the optimum regimen for prevention of endometrial hyperplasia?
93,94
When treating women with percutaneous estradiol, a cyclical 10–12 day course of oral or
vaginal progesterone or long-term progestogen with the LNG-IUS 52 mg should be used for
the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia.
When using a short duration of progestogen therapy, or in cases where only low doses are
tolerated, there should be a low threshold for investigating unscheduled bleeding.
Evidence
level 2-
The lowest dose for the shortest time should limit unwanted progestogenic effects, and therefore an oral dose
(micronised progesterone 100 mg or norethisterone 2.5 mg) for days 17-28 of each calendar month should be
sufficient.
88
Due to the lack of evidence regarding endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia in this cohort, any suspicious Evidence
symptoms should be investigated.
6.3.5
What is the safety of estradiol on the premenopausal endometrium and breast tissue?
When treating women with PMS using estradiol, women should be informed that there are
insufficient data to advise on the long-term effects on breast and endometrial tissue.
level 4
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an increased risk of endometrial or breast
carcinoma in premenopausal women using percutaneous patches and cyclical progestogens or the LNG-IUS.
Randomised placebo-controlled trial data in large populations looking at major outcome measures over a long
period of time are lacking.

6.3.6
For how long can estradiol be used safely and what is the risk of recurrence?
Due to the uncertainty of the long-term effects of opposed estradiol therapy, treatment of
women with PMS should be on an individual basis, taking into account the risks and
benefits.
Treatment of PMS is required as long as the woman's ovarian cycle continues to function. Discontinuation of
treatment could allow a return of premenstrual symptoms. A reliable long-term treatment is therefore essential and
should be seriously considered when evaluating treatment options.
Unlike premature ovarian failure, women with PMS still have a functioning endogenous hormone cycle. With this in
mind, there are no long-term data among this specific cohort of patients.
6.3.7 What is the evidence for efficacy and adverse effects of danazol in the treatment of PMS?
Women with PMS should be advised that, although treatment with low dose danazol
(200 mg twice daily) is effective in the luteal phase for breast symptoms, it also has
potential irreversible virilising effects.
A
Women treated with danazol for PMS should be advised to use contraception during
treatment due to its potential virilising effects on female fetuses.

Cycle suppression may be achieved using danazol, an androgenic steroid. Mansel et al. first assessed the
effect of danazol on PMS symptoms in a study randomised on the basis of the complaint of breast
tenderness. It demonstrated benefit for breast but no other PMS symptoms. Other studies have
shown greater benefit. A randomised, double-blind, cross-over study compared three successive
cycles of danazol at a dose of 200 mg twice daily with three cycles of placebo.97 Twenty-eight of 31
women completed at least one cycle of treatment while recording symptoms. From this study, the
authors demonstrated that danazol at a dose of 200 mg twice daily was superior to placebo for the Evidence
relief of severe PMS during the premenstrual period. However, this superiority is muted or even
reversed when the entire cycle is considered. This may be explained by the fact that danazol therapy
does have some adverse effects, which may interfere with the usual symptom-free late follicular phase
of women with PMS. These symptoms include acne, weight gain, hirsutism and deepening of the voice.
One solution suggested for this problem might be to limit danazol treatment to the luteal phase only.
One study of danazol given in the luteal phase demonstrated improvement in breast symptoms only, but
with minimal adverse effects.

Danazol taken during pregnancy is known to cause cliteromegaly, labial fusion and urogenital sinus abnormalities in

How effective are GnRH analogues for treating severe PMS?
GnRH analogues are highly effective in treating severe PMS.
When treating women with PMS, GnRH analogues should usually be reserved for women
with the most severe symptoms and not recommended routinely unless they are being used
to aid diagnosis or treat particularly severe cases.
GnRH analogues suppress ovarian steroid production and therefore cause a drastic improvement or
complete cessation of symptoms in patients with core PMDs, but their effects on bone mineral density
(BMD) mean that they should only be considered for severe cases. A meta-analysis identified 71 women
on active treatment in seven trials. 100 The overall standardised mean difference (SMD) for all trials was
-1.19 (95% CI -1.88 to -0.51). The OR for benefit was 8.66 (95% CI 2.52–30.26). The SMD was -1.43
and OR 13.38 (95% CI 3.9-46.0) if data were taken only from anovulation trials. Efficacy of symptom relief
was greater for physical than for behavioural symptoms (physical SMD -1.16, 95% CI -1.53 to −0.79;
behavioural SMD -0.68, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.25) but the difference was not significant (P = 0.484). If
GnRH analogue therapy does not result in elimination of premenstrual symptoms, a lack of efficacy
suggests a questionable diagnosis rather than a limitation of the therapy.

When treating women with severe PMS using GnRH analogues for more than 6 months,
add-back hormone therapy should be used.

D
Evidence
level 1++
Women on long-term treatment should have measurement of BMD (ideally by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) every year. Treatment should be stopped if bone density
declines significantly.
As symptoms return with the onset of ovarian function, therapy may (rarely) have to be continued
indefinitely; GnRH alone is precluded by significant trabecular bone loss, which can occur with only
6 months of treatment. It should be noted that GnRH analogues are only licensed for use for 6 months
when used alone and are not licensed to treat PMS."
101
Continuous combined therapy or tibolone is preferable to sequential combined therapy in order to
minimise the risk of reappearance of PMS-like progestogenic adverse effects. 102,103 Both of these
methods of add-back HRT combat the hypoestrogenic symptoms apparent with GnRH analogues
but also maintain BMD. The overall SMD favoured neither GnRH alone nor GnRH with add-back
(SMD 0.12, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.59), demonstrating there is no reversal of the beneficial effect of GnRH
when using add-back.

DEXA is accepted as the gold standard investigation for assessing BMD. 107 DEXA scans every year are

however, this is largely based on monitoring the natural menopause and may not apply in this unique

6.3.10 Can GnRH analogues be useful in clarification of diagnostic category?
When the diagnosis of PMS is unclear from 2 months' prospective DRSP charting, GnRH

Although not licensed for this indication, GnRH analogues are widely used as a diagnostic tool. There is currently no
evidence to support their use in PMS diagnostically but extrapolating from the evidence available for treatment of
PMS with GnRH analogues it seems a logical option.
6.3.11
What is the role for progesterone and progestogen preparations in treating PMS?
There is good evidence to suggest that treating PMS with progesterone or progestogens is
not appropriate.
There is no evidence to support the use of the LNG-IUS 52 mg alone to treat PMS symptoms.
Its role should be confined to opposing the action of estrogen therapy on the endometrium.
109
A systematic review
to evaluate the efficacy of progesterone and progestogens in the management of
PMS concluded, after meta-analyses, that neither treatment demonstrated benefit, despite the fact they

progesterone and progestogen (by both routes of administration) showed no clinically significant difference
between progesterone/progestogen and placebo in symptom reduction.
A Cochrane review 10 has also shown that the evidence for or against the use of progesterone or
progestogens in PMS is equivocal. Seventeen studies were identified but only two were eligible; however,
they could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to differences in study design, participants and
progesterone dose. Overall, these studies were of poor quality.

The exact mode of action of SSRIs is unknown in PMS; however, both estrogen and progesterone have the ability to
regulate the number of serotonin receptors, as shown in rat studies and human positron emission tomography (PET)
studies.
112-114
115
A Cochrane review analysed data from 31 RCTs comparing SSRIs with placebo. SSRIs compared
included fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram. Nine studies involving
1276 women with PMS used a moderate dose SSRI and this showed that symptoms improved when
compared with placebo (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84).
115
When evaluating continuous dosing versus luteal dosing there was no significant difference between the
SSRI regimens.' SSRIs appear to be effective for both physical and psychological symptoms. There are
also data supporting the use of serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for PMDD.116

Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, anxiety, dizziness, paraesthesia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, influenza-like

In the Cochrane review, women with PMS were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse

effects when compared with placebo (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84-3.53). The most common symptoms were
nausea, asthenia, somnolence, fatigue, decreased libido and sweating. All of these adverse effects are dose-level 1-
dependent.
6.4.1.4 Is there evidence for improved efficacy with other SSRI regimens?
When using SSRIs to treat PMS, efficacy may be improved and adverse effects minimised by
the use of luteal-phase regimens with the newer agents.
117
118
The use of newer SSRIs, such as citalopram, may produce resolution of symptoms where other SSRIs have
failed. Severe PMS also improves significantly with either luteal-phase or symptom-onset dosing of
escitalopram with good tolerability. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 119 involving
314 women with moderate to severe PMS were randomised to sertraline 25 or 50 mg or placebo.
Participants took the medication in the luteal phase for two cycles followed by one cycle of continuous
dosing and ending with symptom-onset dosing for the final cycle. This showed a significant difference in
favour of luteal dosing of sertraline (25 mg and 50 mg) when compared with placebo. Another double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial, involving 118 women with severe PMS or PMDD, compared continuous
versus luteal phase sertraline versus placebo for three cycles. There was no difference between continuous
and luteal dosing and both regimens were superior to placebo." Continuous and symptom-onset dosing
have also been shown to be advantageous.

Currently, most SSRIs are licensed in the USA for PMDD, but not in the UK.
6.4.1.5 What preconception and early pregnancy advice should be given regarding SSRIs/SNRIs?
Women should be provided with prepregnancy counselling at every opportunity. They
should be informed that PMS symptoms will abate during pregnancy and SSRIs should
therefore be discontinued prior to and during pregnancy.
Women should be informed how to safely stop SSRIs.
Women with PMS who become pregnant while taking an SSRI/SNRI should be aware of the
possible, although unproven, association with congenital malformations. They should be
reassured that if such an association does exist, it is likely to be extremely small when
compared to the general population.

Previous studies assessing the risk of birth defects after use of SSRIs or SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine) in pregnancy have
been conflicting. However, many have reported cardiovascular birth defects and other major congenital defects (e.g.
anal atresia, cystic kidneys, clubfoot, gastroschisis, hypospadias, limb reduction and omphalocele). The difficulty with
interpretation of these studies is that they have been limited by a number of factors including a failure to control for
confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status and substance misuse) and low statistical power.

A multinational population-based study of over 2.3 million births from five Nordic countries, compared
36 772 infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine during the first trimester with 2 266 875 non-exposed
infants. Consistent with many of the earlier studies, it found significant small increases in the prevalence of
cardiac defects (1.5% versus 1.2%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26) and other major congenital defects
(3.7% versus 3.2%; OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06–1.20) in those infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine. Crucially,
however, this study also compared data from 2288 infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine with data from
their unexposed siblings. This analysis failed to find significant increases in prevalence of any cardiac birth
defects (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72–1.17) or other major congenital defects (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91–1.24). The
absence of an association in the sibling controlled analyses points against teratogenic effects caused by
SSRIs or SNRIs and suggests that the increased risks found in the initial analysis, and many previous
studies, are attributable to the confounding effect of unspecified familial and/or other lifestyle-related
factors.

In summary, published data are conflicting and it is still possible that SSRI or SNRI use in very early
pregnancy may be associated with a small increased risk of congenital malformations. However, the study
by Furu et al. 123 points against a substantial teratogenic risk associated with exposure to these drugs Evidence
during the first trimester, and suggests that the reported risk is driven by yet to be determined level 2+
confounding factors. In addition, women with PMS are likely to discontinue treatment soon after the first
missed period rather than later in the first trimester and therefore the risk may be further diminished.
6.4.2 Are diuretics efficacious in the treatment of PMS?
Spironolactone can be used in women with PMS to treat physical symptoms.
124,125
Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials have shown improvement in both mood and
physical symptoms. One study 124 included 35 women who were given spironolactone 100 mg and placebo
for three cycles each. Women taking spironolactone showed improvement in mood and somatic
symptoms when compared with placebo. The other study 125 involving 28 women highlighted the benefit
for physical symptoms, in particular reduced weight gain.

How can PMS be managed surgically?
6.5.1 Can surgical management of PMS be justified and is it efficacious?
When treating women with severe PMS, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy has been
shown to be of benefit.
D
When treating women with PMS, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy can be
considered when medical management has failed, long-term GnRH analogue treatment is
required or other gynaecological conditions indicate surgery.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 48
e94 of e105 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy is a permanent form of ovulation suppression, as this removes
126
the ovarian cycle completely; it also removes the endometrium, allowing the use of estrogen replacement
without the need for progestogen. Blinded randomised studies cannot be conducted for this intervention. Evidence
Observational questionnaire data' suggest a highly beneficial effect in the selected women undergoing level 3
hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, the majority of whom were highly satisfied following this
procedure.
Severe PMS is in most cases treated successfully with medical management, but hysterectomy with bilateral
oophorectomy can be justified in women in whom medical management has proven unsuccessful, where long-term
GnRH analogue treatment would be required, or if gynaecological comorbidities indicate hysterectomy.
6.5.2
Should the efficacy of surgery always be predicted by the prior use of GnRH analogues?
When treating women with PMS, surgery should not be contemplated without preoperative
use of GnRH analogues as a test of cure and to ensure that HRT is tolerated.

Preoperative GnRH analogues appear to be of value in predicting the effects of oophorectomy; although |
such a strategy has never been tested scientifically, it would seem important, particularly when surgery
being contemplated in women younger than 45 years of age and for PMS alone. 100
is
6.5.3
What is the role of HRT after surgical management?
Women being surgically treated for PMS should be advised to use HRT, particularly if they
are younger than 45 years of age.
Following hysterectomy, estrogen-only replacement can be used. The avoidance of progestogen prevents
reintroduction of PMS-type adverse effects. Consideration should also be given to replacing testosterone, as the
ovaries are a major production source (50%) and deficiency could result in distressing low libido (hypoactive sexual
desire disorder). 12
6.5.4
127
Is there a role for endometrial ablation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy alone?
When treating women with severe PMS, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy with
conservation of the ovaries are not recommended.
Bilateral oophorectomy alone (without removal of the uterus) will necessitate the use of a
progestogen as part of any subsequent HRT regimen and this carries a risk of reintroduction
of PMS-like symptoms (progestogen-induced PMD).
✓
There have been no published studies of bilateral oophorectomy with uterine conservation in PMS. Although it may
be a successful option in selected patients it is not possible to predict in which patients success will be achieved, and
in whom there will be a risk of the reintroduction of PMS-like symptoms during the necessary combined HRT
treatment. If such a strategy is employed then women should be counselled regarding the lack of research evidence
and this potential return of symptoms.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 48
e95 of e105 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Conservation of the ovaries will lead to persistence of PMS (ISPMD classification: PMDs with absent
menstruation).
128
An RCT 129 comparing hysterectomy with the LNG-IUS 52 mg in alleviating PMS symptoms as a secondary
analysis showed benefit. However, the women presented with menorrhagia and diagnosis was not
prospectively confirmed using a validated tool.
Evidence
level 2-
There is no reliable evidence to support endometrial ablation; however, a cohort study 130 of 36 women
with menorrhagia and PMS symptoms as rated on DRSP charts showed benefit at 4–6 months' follow-up
(mean difference -5.75; P < 0.05). Patients were not randomised on the basis of their PMS and prospective
diagnosis was not established using validated tools.
7.
Recommendations for future research
Blinded RCTs comparing complementary therapies (in particular Vitex agnus castus, vitamin B6 and calcium) with
placebo.
More evidence to support the use of CBT for PMS. The difficulty remains where studies cannot be double-
blinded.
Blinded RCTs comparing different regimens of drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives and long-term data
regarding the risk of continuous use.
Evidence to support/refute the use of estradiol gel and vaginal rings in the treatment of PMS.
Evidence to support/refute the use of LNG-IUS 13.5 mg as endometrial protection in PMS.
Long-term safety data regarding opposed estradiol therapy on breast and endometrial tissue within a PMS
cohort.
Blinded RCTs comparing tolerance of micronised progesterone versus progestogens when used as estrogenic
opposition in women with PMS.
• Safety data for SSRIs in the early first trimester of pregnancy.

131
The auditable topics are based on the current ISPMD consensus and are as follows:
100% of women referred with PMS should have this diagnosis formally confirmed by completion of at least
2 consecutive months of a prospective symptom diary, usually the DRSP.
100% of women with PMS should not be offered progestogen therapy alone.
100% of women being considered for surgical treatment should have a trial of GnRH analogue therapy.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be
evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations
in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into
routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
