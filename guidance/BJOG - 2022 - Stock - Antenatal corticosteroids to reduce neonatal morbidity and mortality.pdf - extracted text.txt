This guideline will supplement NICE guideline [NG25] Preterm labour and birth (November 2015, updated 2019)
and the archived RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 7 Antenatal corticosteroids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality
(October 2010).
1. Key recommendations
/C15 A course of antenatal corticosteroids given within the seven days prior to preterm birth reducesperinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. [Grade A]
/C15 For women undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0and 38+6weeks an informed
discussion should take place with the woman about the potential risks and beneﬁts of a courseof antenatal corticosteroids. Although antenatal corticosteroids may reduce admission to theneonatal unit for respiratory morbidity, it is uncertain if there is any reduction in respiratorydistress syndrome, transient tachypnoea of the newborn or neonatal unit admission overall,and antenatal corticosteroids may result in harm to the neonate which includes hypoglycaemiaand potential developmental delay. [Grade B]
/C15 Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0and 34+6weeks’ gestation in whom
imminent preterm birth is anticipated (either due to established preterm labour, preterm prelabourrupture of membranes [PPROM] or planned preterm birth). [Grade A]
/C15 Women with twins and triplets should be offered targeted antenatal corticosteroids for early birth in linewith recommendations for singletons. [Grade D]
/C15 Birth should not be delayed for antenatal corticosteroids if the indication for birth is impacting the healthof the woman or her baby. [Grade GPP]
/C15 Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with PPROM, who are at increased risk ofpreterm birth. [Grade A]
/C15 Antenatal corticosteroid use reduces neonatal death when the ﬁrst dose is given within the 48 hoursprior to birth. [Grade D]
/C15 Beneﬁts are also seen when the ﬁrst dose is given within 24 hours of birth and antenatal corticosteroidsshould still be given if birth is expected within this time. [Grade D]

2. Background and scope
Maternal administration of antenatal corticosteroids before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important
interventions to improve neonatal outcomes.1They are effective in reducing neonatal respiratory morbidity and
other complications of prematurity. The aim of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on theuse of antenatal corticosteroids in women at risk of preterm birth or undergoing caesarean birth at term.
This guideline replaces the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top guideline No. 7,
Antenatal corticosteroids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality (published October 2010 and archived in 2016) and
supplements NICE guideline [NG25], Preterm labour and birth (published November 2015, updated 2019).

Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that
it is not only people who identify as women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductiveservices in order to maintain their gynaecological health and reproductive wellbeing. Gynaecological and obstetricservices and delivery of care must therefore be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individualswhose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
The Cochrane Library and electronic databases (DARE, EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed) were searched
looking for the following terms in the title or abstract ‘corticosteroids’, ‘glucocorticoids’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘obstetrics’,
‘antenatal’ and ‘fetal’. The search was restricted to articles published until January 2021. The full search strategy isavailable to view online as supporting information (Appendix S1 and S2).
This guideline was developed using the standard methodology for developing Green-top Guidelines. The
recommendations have been graded according to the SIGN hierarchy of evidence.

A Cochrane systematic review (including 27 studies with 11 272 women and 11 925 babies) investigating
the effects of corticosteroids administered prior to anticipated preterm birth found high certainty of thebeneﬁt of antenatal corticosteroids for the neonate.
9These beneﬁts include reductions in perinatal death
(risk ratio [RR] 0.85, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.77 –0.93), neonatal death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 –0.87)
and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 –0.78). There was moderate certainty
evidence that antenatal corticosteroids reduce intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 –
0.75), and reduce developmental delay in childhood (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 –0.97)Evidence

4.2. What are the beneﬁts of corticosteroids in planned caesarean birth at term?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
NICE CG132 recommends that planned
caesarean birth should not routinely becarried out before 39
+0weeks ’gestation4D Recommended by NICE CG132.10
For women undergoing planned caesarean
birth between 37+0and 38+6weeks an
informed discussion should take place withthe woman (and her family members orcarers as appropriate) about the potentialrisks and bene ﬁts of a course of antenatal
corticosteroids. Although antenatal
corticosteroids may reduce admission tothe neonatal unit (NNU) for respiratorymorbidity, it is uncertain if there is anyreduction in RDS, transient tachypnoea ofthe newborn (TTN) or NNU admissionoverall, and antenatal corticosteroids mayresult in harm to the neonate which
includes hypoglycaemia and potential
developmental delay (see table 1)2+ B Supported by a Cochrane systematic
review that found that steroids mayreduce admission to the neonatal unit forrespiratory morbidity, but the quality ofevidence was low to moderate and camefrom a single trial
Compared with vaginal birth, infants born by caesarean birth are at greater risk of RDS, TTN, and
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
11The risk of respiratory morbidity at term is low
(~5%) and decreases with advancing gestational age.12Ideally, planned caesarean births should be
undertaken at or after 39+0weeks’ gestation.10Evidence

When a planned caesarean birth is being undertaken before 39+0weeks’ gestation, corticosteroids may be
considered to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity. A Cochrane systematic review hasassessed the effects of antenatal corticosteroid administration given before planned caesarean birth at term(at or after 37
+0weeks’ gestation).13A previous version of this review14included data from four trials, but
in the updated version data from three trials were removed as trials did not meet pre-specifedtrustworthiness criteria.
13The updated review includes only one multicentre randomised controlled trial of
998 women and infants, of whom 943 were analysed. As the trial was not placebo controlled and so bothparticipants and personnel knew whether or not antenatal corticosteroids were given, the trial wasclassiﬁed as having high risk of performance and detection bias. There was uncertainty if antenatalcorticosteroid administration decreased the risk of RDS (RR 0.34 95% CI 0.07 –1.65; low certainty evidence)
or TTN, (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 –1.11; low certainty evidence). Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduced
admission to NNU or NICU for respiratory morbidity (all levels of care; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 –0.90) with
an absolute reduction of NNU admission for respiratory morbidity from 5.1 to 2.3% (moderate certaintyevidence). However, it was uncertain if overall admissions to NNU were reduced (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 –
1.33). The authors of this Cochrane review concluded that there is currently insufﬁcient evidence to drawany deﬁnite conclusions and that further studies of higher quality and larger sample sizes are required.There are several ongoing trials of antenatal corticosteroids that may inform future guidelines.Evidence
level 2 –
There is a paucity of evidence on the balance of beneﬁts versus harms when corticosteroids are administered in late
pregnancy. Antenatal corticosteroids may increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia in term neonates(extrapolating data from trials of corticosteroids in the late preterm period
15and observational data16,17) and there
is some evidence that they may be associated with developmental delay (based on limited and incomplete trialfollow-up
18and observational studies;19see section 9.2). As the risk of respiratory distress at term is low ( ~5%), and
it is usually mild and transient, and there is low certainty of beneﬁt, clinicians should discuss these factors with thewoman when considering the administration of corticosteroids prior to caesarean birth at term (See Table 1).
5. At what gestation should antenatal corticosteroids be discussed and offered?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
Corticosteroid administration has bene ﬁts when
administered to women in whom imminentpreterm birth is anticipated (either due toestablished preterm labour, PPROM or plannedpreterm birth) before 24
+0weeks ’gestation. The
obstetric and neonatal team should discuss the
administration of corticosteroids at these earlygestations with the woman in the context of herindividual circumstances and preferences2+ B The bene ﬁts of corticosteroids at
the threshold of viability aresupported by a systematic reviewand meta-analysis of observationalstudies, and recommended by
guidance from the British
Association of PerinatalMedicine.

Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
Clinicians and women should consider the balance
of risks and bene ﬁts of corticosteroids in women
in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipatedfrom 35
+0to 36+6weeks ’gestation4D In late preterm birth, steroids have
short term respiratory bene ﬁts for
the neonate but increase thelikelihood of neonatalhypoglycaemia. This is addressedin the Cochrane systematic reviewand in NICE NG25.
2
The gestational age range at which antenatal corticosteroids provide beneﬁt and should therefore be
considered or offered, remains controversial.21NICE NG25 addresses the administration of
corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth, recommending that when offering or consideringcorticosteroids a discussion should take place with the woman about how steroids may help and thepotential risks associated with their administration.
2Evidence
level 4
There is evidence that corticosteroid administration has beneﬁts when given prior to birth at the
threshold of viability (before 24+0weeks’ gestation).22–24A systematic review and meta-analysis
investigating corticosteroid administration before 25+0weeks’ gestation, (nine observational studies and a
total of 13 443 neonates) found that compared with controls, corticosteroid administration wasassociated with reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.42 –0.55), and reduced IVH/
periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.63 –0.79).
25In this study, antenatal corticosteroids
were associated with signiﬁcantly reduced neonatal mortality at 22, 23 and 24 weeks; the beneﬁt forsevere IVH/PVL was signiﬁcant only at 23 and 24 weeks.Evidence
level 2 +
The British Association of Perinatal Medicine recommends that neonatal stabilisation and resuscitation
may be considered for babies born from 22+0weeks’ gestation.20When a woman has made an informed
decision, that active care for the baby is appropriate, then active obstetric management, including theadministration of corticosteroids, is important.Evidence
level 4
The 2020 Cochrane systematic review looked at outcomes in two gestational age subgroups at trial entry:
up to 35 weeks+0days and from 34 weeks+0days.9No differences between subgroups for the outcomes
of perinatal death, neonatal death, fetal death, RDS, IVH, birthweight or chorioamnionitis were seen.Evidence
level 1 ++
The subgroup analysis of antenatal corticosteroids from 34+0weeks gestation included in the Cochrane
review9was dominated by a single trial which assessed the effects of corticosteroids in 2831 woman at
risk of late preterm birth (34+0until 36+5weeks’ gestation).15In this trial the administration of
corticosteroids signiﬁcantly reduced the requirement for respiratory support in the ﬁrst 72 hours of life(11.6% versus 14.4%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 –0.97). Neonatal hypoglycaemia was more common in the
betamethasone group than in the placebo group (24.0 versus 15.0%; RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.37 –1.87).Evidence

There are currently insufﬁcient data to assess on long-term effects of late preterm antenatal corticosteroids for the
child.9

6. In what particular circumstances should antenatal corticosteroids be discussed with and offered
to women?
6.1. Multiple pregnancy
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women with twins and triplets should be
offered targeted antenatal corticosteroidsfor early birth in line withrecommendations for singletons3D There is little direct evidence of bene ﬁti n
twins, but no indication that the effects ofcorticosteroids are different in multiplepregnancies than in singletons in a
Cochrane systematic review of randomised
controlled trials
Uncertainties around the bene ﬁts and
risks of antenatal corticosteroids in twins
and triplets should be discussed with
women4 GPP This is regarded as good practice
Single or multiple untargeted (routine)
courses of corticosteroids should not be
used in twin or triplet pregnancy. Womenshould be informed that there is noevidence of bene ﬁt in using untargeted
administration of corticosteroids4D Recommendation from NICE NG137 on
basis of no evidence of bene ﬁt.
7
The majority of antenatal corticosteroid trials has excluded women with multiple pregnancy so there is
little evidence regarding use in twins or higher order multiple pregnancies. Eleven trials included in theCochrane Systematic Review of Antenatal Corticosteroids for lung maturity included some women withmultiple pregnancies, but outcomes were only reported separately for twins in four included studies.
9In a
prespeciﬁed subgroup analysis of these studies there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in thematernal or perinatal outcomes of multiple pregnancies that received antenatal corticosteroids comparedto those that did not. However, the analyses included a limited number of cases so these ﬁndings shouldbe interpreted with caution.Evidence
Level 3
A secondary analysis of data from a trial of progesterone to prevent preterm birth in multiple pregnancy
suggested there may be harm associated with antenatal corticosteroid use (432 women; 850 neonates).Babies of women who received antenatal corticosteroid treatment were more likely to be admitted to aneonatal intensive care unit (235 [78%] versus 322 [59%]) and receive mechanical ventilation (70 [23%] Evidence

antenatal corticosteroids in women with
diabetes.27
In women with diabetes who are receiving
corticosteroids, additional insulin should begiven according to an agreed protocol and
close monitoring should be undertaken4D NICE NG3 addresses the use of

For women with diabetes undergoingplanned caesarean birth between 37

38+6weeks an informed discussion should
take place with the woman (and her family
members or carers as appropriate) about thepotential risk and bene ﬁts of a course of
corticosteroids. Corticosteroid administrationis associated with increased rates ofneonatal hypoglycaemia2+ C The administration of corticosteroids has
been shown to increase rates ofneonatal hypoglycaemia in retrospective
cohort studies
Women with diabetes mellitus have been excluded from most randomised controlled trials of antenatal
corticosteroids because of concerns about their potential effects on glycaemic control. Maternal blood glucose levelsrise shortly after administration of corticosteroids and can remain elevated for up to 5 days.
28,29One systematic
review and meta-analysis identiﬁed no eligible studies on preterm birth outcomes following corticosteroid therapy inpregnancies complicated by diabetes.

Trials of antenatal corticosteroids include a diverse number of sub-populations of women whose response to
corticosteroids may vary. However, in general sub-group analyses have been underpowered to provide preciseestimates of the beneﬁts and risks of antenatal corticosteroids for speciﬁc indications. NICE NG25recommendations for antenatal corticosteroid administration were thus made regardless of any speciﬁc indication
for preterm birth.

In the Cochrane Systematic Review of antenatal corticosteroids prespeciﬁed subgroup analyses were
performed in women with hypertension syndromes.9There were no differences in corticosteroid effects
on perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality and fetal death seen between women with and without
hypertension syndromes. Heterogeneity of effects were seen for RDS in the subgroup analyses, withpotentially a larger reduction in RDS seen in hypertensive mothers than other groups, but there isconsiderable uncertainty around these estimates. There were insufﬁcient data to perform subgroupanalyses for many other outcomes. NICE guidance recommends that a course of antenatal corticosteroidsis offered if planned early birth is necessary for hypertension in pregnancy.

A systematic review identiﬁed no randomised controlled trials of antenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies
complicated by fetal growth restriction.30A meta-analysis of eight observational studies of women with
SGA or fetal growth restricted babies (2846 women and babies) found no statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁtsassociated with antenatal corticosteroids. No differences in neonatal mortality were associated withantenatal corticosteroid administration in babies that were SGA (pooled OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 –1.04;
six studies, 958 infants) or those that had fetal growth restriction (pooled OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 –1.14;
four studies, 504 infants). Antenatal corticosteroids were not associated with any statistically signiﬁcantreductions in morbidities either. One small study included in the meta-analysis found signiﬁcantly higherrates of survival without disability at two years’ corrected age in infants born with fetal growth restrictionwho were exposed to antenatal corticosteroids compared to those that were not exposed (115 infant;OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.11 –5.87], 82 versus 65%).
33A subsequent systematic review of 13 observational,
cohort and case-control studies including 6387 preterm SGA infants found that neonatal mortality wassigniﬁcantly lower among infants whose mothers had received antenatal corticosteroids than those whohad not (12 studies: 12.8 versus 15.1%; pooled OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.46 –0.86). There was no apparent effect

Children who are born preterm and growth restricted are at increased risk of adverse long-term

There is however, little evidence to suggest that steroids will perform differently in babies with growth

7.4. Preterm, prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM)
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered
to women with PPROM who are atincreased risk of preterm birth1++ A A meta-analysis of randomised controlled
trials supports the use of antenatalcorticosteroids in this situation
There is currently limited evidence to
recommend repeat courses of antenatalcorticosteroids if a woman remains atimminent risk of preterm birth seven daysafter administration of antenatalcorticosteroids. However, a further coursemay reduce the need for neonatalrespiratory support1+ B The administration of one or more repeat
courses of corticosteroids is addressed insection 10.
The role of antenatal corticosteroids in women presenting with suspected PPROM from 24

gestation is addressed in RCOG Green-top Guideline no. 73 and in NICE NG25.2,3The World Health
Organization recommends that corticosteroids are appropriate for women with PPROM who have noclinical signs of infection.

PPROM complicates up to 3% of pregnancies and is associated with 30 –40% of preterm births.36The
median latency after PPROM is seven days and tends to shorten as the gestational age at PPROMadvances.
37,38A meta-analysis of 17 randomised controlled trials has demonstrated that the administration
of corticosteroids to women with PPROM reduces the risks of RDS (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 –0.98) and IVH
(RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 –0.96). No difference was observed between steroid and control groups concerning
the risk for necrotising enterocolitis, neonatal sepsis and Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes. Perinatalmortality was similar between steroid and control groups.

7. What is the optimum dose and route of administration for a course of antenatal
corticosteroids?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
In the UK it is recommended that 24mg
dexamethasone phosphate is givenintramuscularly in two divided doses of12 mg 24 hours apart or four divideddoses of 6 mg 12 hours apart2+ B A Cochrane systematic review, found that
dexamethasone, compared withbetamethasone, reduced the risk ofintraventricular haemorrhage
An alternative is 24 mg betamethasone
sodium phosphate/acetate mix givenintramuscularly in two divided doses of12 mg 24 hours apart2++ B Betamethasone acetate/phosphate is the
formulation of betamethasone which ismost trialled. Compared todexamethasone, betamethasone sodiumphosphate/acetate may reduce the risk of
chorioamnionitis
Clinicians should be aware that
betamethasone phosphate, the preparation
widely available in the United Kingdom,
has different pharmacokinetics frombetamethasone sodium phosphate/acetatemix and there is little evidence to guidethe effective dosage regimen for thisformulationGPP This is considered good practice
Oral or transplacental administration is not
recommended2++ B There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to support
administration by these routes
Antenatal corticosteroids are designed to cross the placenta. They are given at high doses that have been unchanged
since Liggins’ and Howie’s original experiments in the 1970s and have not been optimised for human pregnancy.
46
Two types of antenatal corticosteroid have been widely tested and used in clinical practice –betamethasone and
dexamethasone. These are synthetic ﬂuorinated corticosteroids, with similar activities.46
Betamethasone
Betamethasone is available in two formulations. Betamethasone sodium phosphate is soluble with a short
half-life, while betamethasone sodium acetate is insoluble and has a long half-life.47In many countries the
two preparations are available in a 50:50 mixture (as a generic preparation or under the trade nameCelestone Chronodose
/C226). This mixed soluble/insoluble preparation is similar to one used in the original
studies performed by Liggins and Howie and has been most widely used in trials of antenatalcorticosteroids for fetal lung maturity.
46,47This formulation is used in North America, Australia and most
of Europe. It is an opaque white liquid that requires refrigeration. The most commonly trialled andrecommended dosage regimen is two 12 mg boluses given intramuscularly 24 hours apart (total 24 mg).Evidence

Betamethasone sodium phosphate, the soluble form of betamethasone, is used in some countries,
including the United Kingdom, where the mixed formulation is not widely available. This is a clear liquid,
has a short half-life and has been less widely tested in clinical trials. The difference between the two
formulations of betamethasone and their very different pharmacokinetics has not been widely recognisedand many trial publications do not specify the formulation used. The optimum dosage strategy forbetamethasone sodium phosphate is not clear; however, given the short half-life a similar dosage scheduleto dexamethasone may be pragmatic.Evidence

Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone phosphate is a soluble preparation, which is slightly cheaper than betamethasone sodium
phosphate/acetate mix and does not require refrigeration. Dexamethasone is included in the WorldHealth Organisation Essential Medicine List , the World Health Organisation Managing complications in
pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors and is more commonly used in low and middle
income countries.

In the Cochrane Systematic review on antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity a prespeciﬁed
subgroup analysis was performed comparing the formulation of antenatal corticosteroid used.9Sixteen
trials used ‘betamethasone’, and eight used dexamethasone. No distinction was made betweenbetamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix or betamethasone phosphate in the review, but themajority of betamethasone studies were carried out in countries where betamethasone sodiumphosphate/acetate mix is recommended. In this analysis betamethasone resulted in less maternalchorioamnionitis than dexamethasone, although there was uncertainty regarding these estimates. Littledifference between formulations was seen in other outcomes.

Another Cochrane systematic review assessed the use of different corticosteroids and regimens for
accelerating fetal lung maturation and included a total of 12 trials (1557 women and 1661 infants).50No
distinction was made in the review between betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix orbetamethasone phosphate. Six of the included trials had a primary outcome of a fetal biophysicalparameter or maternal blood parameter rather than a morbidity outcome. On analysis of the remainingtrials, no differences were seen in respiratory distress syndrome (ﬁve trials, 753 babies) or perinatal death(four trials, 596 babies) between the two formulations. Dexamethasone resulted in a lower risk of
interventricular haemorrhage (four trials, 549 babies).Evidence

More recently, a randomised control trial (1346 women, 1509 babies, 79 with follow up to two years)

1,53There was a signiﬁcant reduction in cases of
RDS among babies born before 48 hours (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 –0.93; three studies, 374 infants) and
between one and seven days (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 –0.60; nine studies, 1110 infants), but not among those
born before 24 hours (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 –1.15; nine studies, 517 infants) or those born more than
seven days after the ﬁrst dose of antenatal corticosteroids (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.53 –1.28; eight studies, 988

one study, 373 infants) but not those born between one and seven days (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 –1.09;
three studies, 606 infants) or those born after seven days (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 –2.23; three studies, 598

However, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of the data due to the limitations and potential bias of
the subgroup analyses in the original 2006 review. The question as to whether the effects of antenatalcorticosteroids change with time to delivery would require re-analysis of individual patient data to clarify whetherthe association is real.
54This re-analysis was not undertaken in the 2017 or 2020 updates of the Cochrane review
and therefore the need for caution remains.9,55

Follow up of 407 of the original 998 participants of a trial of antenatal corticosteroids prior to term
planned caesarean birth at 8 –15 years of age found that children exposed to antenatal betamethasone
prior to planned caesarean birth were more likely to be in the lower quartile of academic ability
(8.5 versus 17.7%; P=0.03); although no other differences in outcome were detected.18These ﬁndings
must be interpreted with caution due to the low follow-up rates. In a cohort of 179 surviving adults,29–36 years old, who were born at extremely low birthweight (below 1 kg), exposure to antenatal
corticosteroid was associated with clinically signiﬁcant anxiety (OR 3.34 [95% CI 1.03 –10.81]).
73Evidence
level 2 –
WHO recommend antenatal corticosteroids should only be offered when a minimum standard of maternal
and neonatal hospital services are available.1In a cluster randomised control trial in low- and middle-income
settings of a strategy to scale up use of antenatal corticosteroids,74there was a very unexpected increase in
neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 1.02 –1.22) and stillbirth (RR 1.11, 1.02 –1.22) in clusters with increased
antenatal corticosteroid use. Only 16% of the women who received antenatal corticosteroids gave birth to aless-than-ﬁfth-percentile newborn (which was used as a surrogate for preterm birth, due to difﬁculties inestablishing gestation) suggesting signiﬁcant over diagnosis of imminent preterm birth and overtreatmentwith antenatal corticosteroids. The increased mortality was driven by increases in infants above the 25
th
percentile for birthweight (i.e. likely term born). Reassuringly however, a subsequent large randomisedcontrol trial of 2852 women at risk of early preterm birth (26
+0to 33+6weeks’ gestation) attending sites
with maternal and neonatal hospital services meeting the WHO criteria for antenatal corticosteroidtreatment in ﬁve low and middle income countries, found that, compared to placebo, dexamethasonephosphate reduced neonatal death (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72 –0.97; P=0.03) and perinatal mortality (RR 0.88;
95% CI 0.78 –0.99; P=0.04) without increasing maternal infection (RR, 0.76; 95% CI 0.56 –1.03).

10. What are the contraindications to the use of antenatal corticosteroids?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Birth should not be delayed to administer
antenatal corticosteroids when there areserious concerns about maternal or fetalcondition that will be alleviated by
expedited birth4 GPP This is considered good practice
In the presence of systemic infection, the
potential bene ﬁcial effects of antenatal
corticosteroids intended for the baby are
balanced against the effect of exacerbatingthe severity of systemic infection both forthe woman and her baby4D Addressed in guidance from the WHO.
Corticosteroids cause immune
suppression, so there is a potential risk of
worsening systemic infection

Corticosteroids suppress the immune system, so there is a risk that their use may activate latent
infections or exacerbate fungal infections. In a woman with systemic infection, it may theoretically
suppress the immune response to infection. There is no evidence to suggest that a single course of
corticosteroids increase infections or antibiotic use but caution should be exercised when there issystemic infection.

11. In what circumstances should an antenatal course of corticosteroids be repeated?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
Women should be informed that no reduction in
serious morbidity or long-term bene ﬁts have been
seen with repeat corticosteroids but babies whoreceive repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroidsare smaller (lower birthweight and reducedlength)1+ B These are the ﬁndings from an
individual participant data meta-analysis of RCTs
There is currently limited evidence to recommend
repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids if awoman remains at imminent risk of preterm birthseven days after administration of antenatal
corticosteroids. However, a further course may
reduce the need for neonatal respiratory support1+ B These are the ﬁndings from an
individual participant data meta-analysis of RCTs
The maximum number of corticosteroid courses
given in any one pregnancy should not exceed
three4 GPP Authors expert opinion from an
individual participant data meta-
analysis of RCTs
An individual participant data meta-analysis included data from 11 randomised trials of repeat doses of
corticosteroids (4857 women; 5915 babies; 4557 children) compared to single dose.
64There was a statistically
signiﬁcant reduction in the use of respiratory support in babies who had repeat antenatal corticosteroidscompared with infants who received a single dose (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 –0.97). However, there was no effect
of repeat corticosteroids on serious morbidity or mortality outcomes for the baby. No differences were seenin childhood outcomes of death, neurosensory impairment or disability or respiratory disease. Babies exposedto repeat antenatal corticosteroids had a lower birth weight than those exposed to a single course and a doseresponse was seen. Children who received repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids had lower systolic,diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures. The clinical relevance of this is unclear. The authors concluded thattotal dose of repeat antenatal corticosteroids to reduce the need for neonatal respiratory support should belimited to 24 –48 mg and a maximum of three courses to minimise side effects.
Evidence
level 1 +
The World Health Organisation systematic review and guidance recommends a single rescue course of
antenatal corticosteroids if women remain at high risk of preterm birth and more than seven days haselapsed since previous treatment.

12. Recommendations for future research
/C15Studies are required to determine whether antenatal corticosteroids are effective in reducing neonatal morbidity
when administered prior to elective caesarean birth at term.
/C15The gestational age range at which antenatal corticosteroids provide beneﬁt and should therefore be considered
or offered, remains controversial and requires further investigation.
/C15The safety and effectiveness of steroids in multiple pregnancy, women with diabetes and in women withchorioamnionitis requires further investigation.
/C15Research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of lower doses of corticosteroids, compared with currentregimens, and the potential off-target effects of different formulations and dosing schedules of antenatalcorticosteroids.
/C15Follow up studies are required to determine the long term effects of antenatal corticosteroids including oncardiovascular function and neurodevelopment.
/C15Research is needed to investigate sexual dimorphism in response to antenatal corticosteroids.
13. Auditable topics

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
