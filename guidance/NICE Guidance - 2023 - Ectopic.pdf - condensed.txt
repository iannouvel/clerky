Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management guidelines aim to improve early pregnancy loss diagnosis and support for women with complications. Healthcare professionals should provide dignified and respectful care, offer information and support sensitively, and ensure women receive evidence-based information in various formats. Early pregnancy assessment services should be available seven days a week for women with complications, staffed by trained healthcare professionals. Symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy should be recognized, and women with unstable hemodynamics or significant concerns should be referred to A&E. Ectopic pregnancy can present with a variety of symptoms and signs that should be carefully assessed by healthcare professionals.

In women of reproductive age, consider offering a pregnancy test even with non-specific symptoms. Healthcare professionals should have access to pregnancy tests. Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment. Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, even without known risk factors. Refer women with early pregnancy complications for assessment based on clinical situation. Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies. Consider signs indicating tubal ectopic pregnancy during ultrasound scans. Avoid using serum hCG measurements to determine pregnancy location. Use serum hCG measurements for trophoblastic proliferation assessment. Take two serum hCG measurements 48 hours apart for management of pregnancy of unknown location. Provide written information to women with a pregnancy of unknown location on accessing emergency care.

1.4.29 For a woman with an increase in serum hCG levels greater than 63% after Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management (NG126)
- Inform her that she is likely to have a developing intrauterine pregnancy (although the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy cannot be excluded).
- Offer her a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the location of the pregnancy between 7 and 14 days later. Consider an earlier scan for women with a serum hCG level greater than or equal to 1,500 IU/litre.
- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed, offer her routine antenatal care.
- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not confirmed, refer her for immediate clinical review by a senior gynaecologist.

1.4.30 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels greater than 50% after 48 hours:
- Inform her that the pregnancy is unlikely to continue but that this is not confirmed.
- Provide her with oral and written information about where she can access support and counseling services.
- Ask her to take a urine pregnancy test 14 days after the second serum hCG test.

1.4.31 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels less than 50%, or an increase less than 63%, refer her for clinical review in the early pregnancy assessment service within 24 hours.

1.4.32 For women with a pregnancy of unknown location, when using serial serum hCG measurements, do not use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.

Management of ectopic pregnancy includes offering systemic methotrexate to women who meet specific criteria, such as having no significant pain and a certain size adnexal mass. Surgery is offered as a first-line treatment to women who cannot return for follow-up after methotrexate treatment or who have certain risk factors. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended whenever possible for surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Salpingectomy is offered unless there are other risk factors for infertility, and salpingotomy is considered as an alternative in certain cases. Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis is recommended for all rhesus-negative women undergoing surgical procedures for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Ultrasound is used to determine a viable intrauterine pregnancy. Research recommendations include evaluating early pregnancy assessment units and the effectiveness of different management strategies for miscarriage.

Over the past 2 decades, there has been a shift towards outpatient or day case care and the introduction of medical and expectant management as alternatives to surgery. Despite these changes, there is a lack of research into the effects of these different approaches from the woman's perspective, particularly their psychological and emotional impact. Miscarriage is distressing for most women, and the type of management itself might affect women's need for counseling, with a resulting cost to the NHS. Because of this, it is an important area for research.

Comparison between expectant, medical, or surgical management of ectopic pregnancy: In women with ectopic pregnancy, does the type of intervention impact on women's experience, including psychological and emotional outcomes? Currently, there is no evidence exploring the psychological impact of the different treatments for ectopic pregnancy. However, the emotional impact of the condition can be significant, in some circumstances leading to post-traumatic stress disorder. A qualitative comparative study should be carried out to assess how this impact can be reduced, helping to maximize women's emotional recovery in the short and long term, enable women and clinicians to decide the optimum treatment method, and identify what support is needed for women during and after the process.

Using ultrasound for the diagnosis of a tubal ectopic pregnancy: There is good evidence that certain ultrasound features can reliably indicate an ectopic pregnancy. Other features may indicate a suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy but are not reliable enough on their own for diagnosis. Therefore, ultrasound features, clinical presentation, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels should be used together to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

Progestogens for preventing miscarriage: Micronized vaginal progesterone has been shown to increase the number of live births in women with early pregnancy bleeding and a previous miscarriage. There is no evidence of benefit for other preparations or doses of progesterone. The use of progesterone should be limited to women with an intrauterine pregnancy confirmed with a scan to avoid the risk of giving progesterone to women with a pregnancy of unknown location or an ectopic pregnancy.

Medical management of miscarriage: The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is recommended to reduce the failure of the gestational sac to pass spontaneously and the need for surgical intervention. Recommendations have been revised to clarify the treatment of incomplete and missed miscarriage and provide additional advice on seeking help during the miscarriage process.

Expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy: Expectant management can be offered to clinically stable women with small ectopic pregnancies as an alternative to medical management. This recommendation aims to standardize the management of ectopic pregnancy and make expectant management available when clinically appropriate.

Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage have an adverse effect on the quality of life of many women. Approximately 20% of pregnancies miscarry, and miscarriages can cause considerable distress. Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is 11 per 1,000 pregnancies, with a maternal mortality of 0.2 per 1,000 estimated ectopic pregnancies. About two-thirds of these deaths are associated with substandard care. Women who do not access medical help readily are particularly vulnerable. Improvement in the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy loss is therefore of vital importance to reduce the incidence of the associated psychological morbidity and avoid unnecessary deaths of women with ectopic pregnancies.
