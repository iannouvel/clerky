This is the second edition of this guideline. The first edition was published in 2011 under the same title.
Executive summary
Clinical issues
Can women at risk of impending collapse be identified early?
An obstetric modified early warning score chart should be used for all women undergoing
observation, to allow early recognition of the woman who is becoming critically ill.
What are the causes of maternal collapse?
Maternal collapse can result from a number of causes. A systematic approach should be taken
to identify the cause. [New 2019]
In cases of collapse assumed to be due to anaphylaxis mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in
confirming the diagnosis.
What are the physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy that affect resuscitation?
D
B
It is essential that anyone involved in the resuscitation of pregnant women is aware of the
physiological differences. This includes pre-hospital care clinicians, paramedics and
emergency medicine department staff.
Aortocaval compression significantly reduces cardiac output from 20 weeks of gestation
onwards and the efficacy of chest compressions during resuscitation. [New 2019]
с
Changes in lung function, diaphragmatic splinting and increased oxygen consumption make
pregnant women become hypoxic more readily and make ventilation more difficult. [New 2019]
C
Difficult intubation is more likely in pregnancy. [New 2019]
Pregnant women are at an increased risk of aspiration. [New 2019]

What is the optimal initial management of maternal collapse?
Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the
standard ABCDE approach, with some modifications for maternal physiology, in particular relief
of aortocaval compression.
If maternal cardiac arrest occurs in the community setting, basic life support should be
administered and rapid transfer arranged.
Manual displacement of the uterus to the left is effective in relieving aortocaval compression in
women above 20 weeks' gestation or where the uterus is palpable at or above the level of the
umbilicus. This permits effective chest compressions in the supine position in the event of
cardiac arrest.
A left lateral tilt of the woman from head to toe at an angle of 15-30° on a firm surface will
relieve aortocaval compression in the majority of pregnant women and still allow effective
chest compressions to be performed in the event of cardiac arrest.
In cases of major trauma, the spine should be protected with a spinal board before any tilt is
applied. In the absence of a spinal board, manual displacement of the uterus should be used.
[New 2019]
Intubation in an unconscious woman with a cuffed endotracheal tube should be performed
immediately by an experienced anaesthetist.
Supplemental high flow oxygen should be administered as soon as possible to counteract rapid
deoxygenation.
Bag and mask ventilation or insertion of a simple supraglottic airway should be undertaken
until intubation can be achieved.

If the airway is clear and there is no breathing, chest compressions should be commenced
immediately.
Two wide-bore cannulae (minimum 16 gauge) should be inserted as soon as possible. If
peripheral venous access is not possible, early consideration of central venous access,
intraosseous access or venous cutdown should be considered.
There should be an aggressive approach to volume replacement, although caution should be
exercised in the context of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia.
Abdominal ultrasound by a skilled operator can assist in the diagnosis of concealed
haemorrhage.

The same defibrillation energy levels should be used as in a nonpregnant woman.
There should be no alteration in algorithm drugs or doses used in the Resuscitation Council
(UK) protocols.

Resuscitation efforts should be continued until a decision is taken by the consultant obstetrician
and consultant anaesthetist to discontinue resuscitation efforts. This decision should be made in
consensus with the cardiac arrest team.
When, where and how should perimortem caesarean section (PMCS) be performed?
In women over 20 weeks of gestation, if there is no response to correctly performed CPR
within 4 minutes of maternal collapse or if resuscitation is continued beyond this, then PMCS
should be undertaken to assist maternal resuscitation. Ideally, this should be achieved within
5 minutes of the collapse.
PMCS should not be delayed by moving the woman. It should be performed where maternal
collapse has occurred and resuscitation is taking place.
The operator should use the incision, which will facilitate the most rapid access. This may be a
midline vertical incision or a suprapubic transverse incision.
A scalpel and umbilical cord clamps (or alternative ligatures) should be available on the
resuscitation trolley in all areas where maternal collapse may occur, including the accident and
emergency department.
What does the ongoing management consist of?
Senior staff with appropriate experience should be involved at an early stage.
Transfer should be supervised by an adequately skilled team with appropriate equipment.
In the case of maternal collapse secondary to antepartum haemorrhage, the fetus and placenta
should be delivered promptly to allow control of the haemorrhage.
In the case of massive placental abruption, caesarean section may occasionally be indicated
even if the fetus is dead to allow rapid control of the haemorrhage.
Intravenous tranexamic acid significantly reduces mortality due to postpartum haemorrhage.

Massive pulmonary embolism should be treated according to RCOG Green-top Guideline No.
37b Acute Management of Thrombosis and Embolism during Pregnancy and the Puerperium.
[New 2019]
The management of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is supportive rather than specific, as there is
no proven effective therapy.
Early involvement of senior experienced staff, including midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists,
haematologists and intensivists, is essential to optimise outcome.
Coagulopathy needs early, aggressive treatment, including the use of fresh frozen plasma.
Recombinant factor VII should only be used if coagulopathy cannot be corrected by massive
blood component replacement as it causes poorer outcome in women with AFE. [New 2019]
After successful resuscitation, cardiac cases should be managed by an expert cardiology team.
Septic shock should be managed in accordance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.
The antidote to magnesium toxicity is 10 ml 10% calcium gluconate or 10 ml 10% calcium
chloride given by slow intravenous injection.
If local anaesthetic toxicity is suspected, stop injecting immediately.
Lipid rescue should be used in cases of collapse secondary to local anaesthetic toxicity.
IntralipidⓇ 20% should be available in all hospitals offering maternity services.
Manage arrhythmias as usual, recognising that they may be very refractory to treatment.
All cases of lipid rescue should be reported to NHS Improvement and the Lipid Rescue site.
Eclampsia should be managed in accordance with the NICE Clinical Guideline 107 Hypertension
in Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management. [New 2019]
Neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons should be involved in the care of pregnant women with
intracranial haemorrhage at the earliest opportunity. [New 2019]
In cases of anaphylaxis, all potential causative agents should be removed, and the ABCDE

If the anaphylactic reaction occurs in the community, the woman should have basic life support
and be transferred to a hospital setting as quickly as possible, unless a suitably trained
healthcare professional is present with appropriate equipment and drugs in which case
definitive resuscitation and treatment should be commenced.
The treatment for anaphylaxis is 1:1000 adrenaline 500 micrograms (0.5 ml) intramuscularly.
This dose is for intramuscular use only.
What are the outcomes for mother and baby after maternal collapse?
Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age and access
to emergency care, with survival rates being poorer if the collapse occurs out of hospital. In
maternal cardiac arrest maternal survival rates of over 50% have been reported. [New 2019]
Who should be on the team?
In addition to the general arrest team, there should also be a senior midwife, an obstetrician
and an obstetric anaesthetist included in the team in cases of maternal collapse.
The most senior obstetrician and senior anaesthetist should be called at the time of a
cardiopulmonary arrest call.
The neonatal team should be called early if delivery is likely (antepartum collapse over
220 weeks of gestation).

Purpose and scope
Maternal collapse is a rare but life-threatening event, with a wide ranging aetiology. The outcome primarily for the
mother, but also the fetus, depends on prompt and effective resuscitation. The purpose of this guideline is to discuss
the identification of women at an increased risk of maternal collapse and the different causes of maternal collapse, to
delineate the initial and ongoing management of maternal collapse, and review the maternal and neonatal outcomes.
It covers both hospital and community settings, and includes all gestations and the postpartum period. The
resuscitation team and equipment, and training requirements will also be covered.

Introduction and background epidemiology
Maternal collapse is defined as an acute event involving the cardiorespiratory systems and/or central nervous systems,
resulting in a reduced or absent conscious level (and potentially cardiac arrest and death), at any stage in pregnancy
and up to 6 weeks after birth. Importantly, if maternal collapse which is not as the result of cardiac arrest is not
treated effectively, maternal cardiac arrest can then occur. There is a robust and effective system for maternal
mortality audit in the UK in the form of the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Death performed by MBRRACE-UK
(Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK). However, the
incidence of maternal collapse or severe maternal morbidity is unknown as morbidity data is not routinely collected.
Even when it is, it is not collected in a standardised way to facilitate comparisons.' The incidence of cardiac arrest in
pregnancy is much rarer than maternal collapse at around I in 36 000 maternities², with a case fatality rate of 42%. In
a UK study, a total of 25% of cardiac arrests in pregnancy were secondary to anaesthesia and all were associated with
a 100% survival rate.²
It is accepted that lessons can be learned from severe morbidity and near misses, and MBRRACE-UK now undertake
targeted maternal morbidity confidential enquiries.³ The UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS), run by the
National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, has made a significant contribution towards the study of rare events and
maternal morbidity. * Severe maternal morbidity data were collected across Scotland for 10 years and published in
2014.5 A woman was defined as having had a severe maternal morbidity event if there was a risk of maternal death

without timely intervention. The data showed a severe maternal morbidity rate of 7.3 in 1000 (730 in 100 000)
maternities in 2012, but not all cases of severe maternal morbidity involved maternal collapse (although all cases of
collapse were included in the figures). A publication from Ireland showed a severe maternal morbidity rate of 6.35 in
1000 (635 in 100 000) births in 2015.6 These reports demonstrate that the rate of maternal morbidity has increased
year on year. This is likely to reflect the changing demographics of women and better reporting, rather than a
decline in care. Between 2012 and 2014, the maternal mortality rate was 8.5 in 100 000 in the UK.³ However, not
all maternal collapse results in maternal death. Thus, the true rate of maternal collapse is unknown.
Whilst maternal collapse is such an uncommon event, the consequences are potentially devastating, therefore it is
essential that the clinical team are skilled in initial effective resuscitation techniques, and are able to investigate and
diagnose the cause of the collapse to allow appropriate, directed ongoing management. Unfortunately, in reports
regarding morbidity 5,6 and the MBRRACE-UK report 2016,³ areas of substandard care continue to be identified,
including poor resuscitation skills. However, it should also be remembered that death and disability may result
despite excellent care. It should be noted that vasovagal attacks and epileptic seizures³ are the most common causes
of maternal collapse and are not covered by this guideline.

Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and
PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT), systematic reviews
and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published up to June 2018. The databases were searched
using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings, and this was combined with a
keyword search. Search words included, **labor complication', **maternal morbidity', ‘*maternal mortality',
**pregnancy complication' and '*heart arrest'. The search was restricted to humans and the English language. The
National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant guidelines and
reviews.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. In the absence of published evidence, these have
been annotated as 'good practice points'. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of
recommendations may be found in Appendix I.

deaths in the UK,9 substandard care was often identified where these signs and symptoms were not
recognised and acted upon. The MBRRACE-UK report published in 2016 recommended a national
obstetric early warning scoring system should be introduced and used for all obstetric women, including
those being cared for outside the obstetric setting. It also recommended that clinical judgment must
be incorporated in that if the woman looks or feels unwell, despite the score, her care should be
escalated.³
The first Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS systems) 10 were introduced on the basis that a
deterioration in simple physiological vital signs will precede significant clinical deterioration and that early Evidence

care, although the optimal system has yet to be identified.

Despite this, the MEWS systems have not been demonstrated to be highly effective, even when their use
has triggered input from a specialised medical emergency team. Although their use is recommended by
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 21 and MBRRACE-UK³ this is based on
informal consensus rather than evidence.
The physiological changes of pregnancy may render the existing MEWS systems inappropriate, 22 and no
validated system for use in pregnant women currently exists. Because of this, many maternity hospitals
have developed their own modified MEWS system so local training is required, and there is ongoing
work in the UK to try and develop a national obstetrics MEWS system. This, however, should be
subjected to rigorous scrutiny to ensure that it is effective before it is universally implemented.
The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) 23 is endorsed by NHS England and NHS Improvement but
is not recommendend for women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant because the physiological
response to acute illness can be modified in pregnancy. With that in mind, it would seem reasonable to
consider the use of NEWS2 in women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant. The timing of the use of
NEWS2 postpartum is uncertain as the physiological changes of pregnancy are largely returned to pre-
pregnancy levels by 48 hours although full return can take up to 6 weeks.
Evidence
level 4
It is also important to consider the potential risks associated with the use of different scoring systems in the same
organisation for the same patient depending on their stage of pregnancy.
A scoring system may still miss an unwell patient and a high level of clinical suspicion should be present if a
patient looks unwell, even if her MEWS/Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS)/NEWS2 score is normal.
4.2. What are the causes of maternal collapse?
Maternal collapse can result from a number of causes. A systematic approach should be taken
to identify the cause.
Maternal collapse can result from many causes which may or may not be pregnancy related. A systematic
approach to assessment facilitates identification of the cause of collapse. If the cause is reversible, the
survival rates are greater 24 and those for which specific treatment exists must be rapidly considered.
A systematic ABCDE approach should enable the clinical team to identify the most common causes of level 4
collapse. For ease of memory, these are divided by the Resuscitation Council (UK) in to the '4 T's' and

‘4 H's'.24 In pregnant women, eclampsia and intracranial haemorrhage should be added. Other specific
obstetric causes could also be present and should be considered systematically (please see Appendix 2).
Due to the lack of robust morbidity data regarding collapse, maternal deaths are often used as a
reference point. The common causes of maternal collapse are discussed below, but this is not an
exhaustive list, as this is beyond the scope of this guideline.
Evidence

4.2.1.
Haemorrhage
Evidence
Major obstetric haemorrhage has an estimated incidence of 6 in 1000 maternities. 5 This is among the
most common causes of maternal collapse and was responsible for 13 maternal deaths between 2012
and 2014.³ Causes of major obstetric haemorrhage include postpartum haemorrhage, major antepartum
haemorrhage from placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture and ectopic pregnancy. In most
cases of massive haemorrhage leading to collapse, the cause is obvious, but concealed haemorrhage level 2+
should not be forgotten, including following caesarean section and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Other
rarer causes of concealed haemorrhage include splenic artery rupture 25 and hepatic rupture. Blood loss
is often difficult to estimate, especially slow, steady bleeding, and fit, healthy women can tolerate
significant loss prior to showing signs of decompensation.

Thromboembolism

In the MBRRACE-UK report 2016,³ deaths were the result of thromboembolism, making it the most
common cause of direct maternal death. Appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis has improved maternal
morbidity and mortality, but improvements in clinical risk assessment and prophylaxis are still
required.³

UK data published in 2016 give an incidence of AFE of 1.7 per 100 000 maternities.2 Survival rates
seem to have improved significantly over time, from 14% in 1979,30 to approximately 30% in 2005³¹ and
81% by 2014.29 However, neurological morbidity in survivors is well recognised.2 The perinatal
mortality rate in cases of AFE is 67 per 1000 total births. 29 It presents as collapse during labour or
birth, or within (usually) 30 minutes of birth, in the form of acute hypotension, respiratory distress and
acute hypoxia. Seizures and cardiac arrest may occur. There are different phases to the disease
progression, which clearly depend on maternal survival. Initially, pulmonary hypertension may | Evidence

left ventricular dysfunction or failure develops. Coagulopathy often develops if the mother survives long
enough, often giving rise to massive postpartum haemorrhage. If AFE occurs prior to birth, profound
fetal distress develops acutely. The underlying pathophysiological process has been compared to
anaphylaxis or severe sepsis, and may be due to complement activation. 35,36 Diagnosis in nonfatal cases
is clinical, as there is no established accurate diagnostic test premortem, although research continues in
the area.

Cardiac disease was the most common overall cause of indirect maternal death in the MBRRACE-UK

report 2016,³ being responsible for 51 maternal deaths between 2012 and 2014. The majority of deaths
secondary to cardiac causes occur in women with no previous history, and almost one in five deaths
occurred in an ambulance or accident and emergency department.2 Therefore, paramedics and accident
and emergency staff must be familiar with the management of maternal collapse. The main cardiac causes of
maternal death are ischaemia and sudden arrhythmic cardiac death with a structurally normal heart.³ Most
cardiac events have preceding signs and symptoms. Aortic root dissection, although usually associated with
an inherited aortopathy e.g. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can present in otherwise healthy women, and signs
and symptoms, such as central chest or interscapular pain, a wide pulse pressure (mainly secondary to
systolic hypertension) and a new cardiac murmur, must prompt appropriate imaging and, if required,
referral to a cardiologist. The incidence of congenital and rheumatic heart disease in pregnancy is increasing,
secondary to increased survival rates and with improved management of congenital heart disease. In
addition, women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves are at particularly increased risk of complications
in pregnancy."
These women should be cared for by an appropriately skilled and experienced
multidisciplinary team, usually in regional centres.² Other cardiac causes include: cardiomyopathy; dissection
of the coronary artery; acute left ventricular failure; infective endocarditis; and pulmonary oedema.

4.2.5.
Sepsis
Sepsis has been recognised for centuries as a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and
substandard care continues to feature in the cases that result in death.³ Bacteraemia, which can be
present in the absence of pyrexia or a raised white cell count, can progress rapidly to severe sepsis and
septic shock leading to collapse. 40,41 The most common organisms implicated in obstetric sepsis are the
streptococcal groups A, B and D, pneumococcus and Escherichia coli.

Drug toxicity and overdose
14710528, 2020, 5, Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.15995 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [29/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Drug toxicity and overdose should be considered in all cases of collapse. Substance misuse should be remembered as
a potential cause of collapse especially outside of hospital. In terms of therapeutic drug toxicity, the commonly used
drugs in obstetric practice are magnesium sulphate in the presence of renal impairment and local anaesthetic agents.
Toxic effects associated with local anaesthetics usually result from excessively high plasma
concentrations. This can be either as a result of inadvertent intravenous injection, or systemic
absorption of toxic amounts administered via appropriate (epidural, local infiltration etc.) routes. On
intravenous injection, convulsions and cardiovascular collapse may occur very rapidly. Local anaesthetic
toxicity resulting from systemic absorption of the local anaesthetic may occur sometime after the initial
injection. Effects initially include a feeling of inebriation and lightheadedness followed by sedation,
circumoral paraesthesia and twitching; convulsions can occur in severe toxicity. Signs of severe toxicity
include sudden loss of consciousness, with or without tonic-clonic convulsions, and cardiovascular
collapse; sinus bradycardia, conduction blocks, asystole and ventricular tachyarrhythmias can all occur.

In terms of local anaesthetics, total spinal block or high spinal/epidural block are rare. A high index of suspicion is
needed in cases of maternal collapse following spinal anaesthesia or epidural top up. Appropriate training of medical
and midwifery staff to recognise the signs and symptoms of high block is essential.
4.2.7.
Eclampsia
Eclampsia as the cause of maternal collapse is usually obvious in the inpatient setting. Often the diagnosis of pre-
eclampsia has already been made and the seizure witnessed. In the community setting, fitting after 20 weeks'
gestation may be attributable to eclampsia, notably where there is no known history of epilepsy. However, epilepsy
should always be considered in cases of maternal collapse associated with seizure activity.³
4.2.8.
Intracranial haemorrhage
Intracranial haemorrhage is a significant complication of uncontrolled, particularly systolic, hypertension, but can also
result from ruptured aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. The initial presentation may be maternal collapse,
but often severe headache precedes this.

In cases of collapse assumed to be due to anaphylaxis mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in
confirming the diagnosis.
43
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction,ª³ resulting in respiratory,
cutaneous and circulatory changes, and possibly gastrointestinal disturbance and collapse. There is significant
intravascular volume redistribution, which can lead to decreased cardiac output. Acute ventricular failure and
myocardial ischaemia may occur. Upper airway occlusion secondary to angioedema, bronchospasm and mucous
plugging of smaller airways all contribute to significant hypoxia and difficulties with ventilation. Common triggers are
a variety of drugs, latex, animal allergens and foods. The incidence of severe perioperative obstetric anaphylaxis is
between 1 and 3.5 per 100 000, with a mortality rate of approximately 1%.** Anaphylaxis is likely when all of the
following three criteria are met:
44
sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms
.
life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems
• skin and/or mucosal changes (flushing, urticaria, angioedema).
Exposure to a known allergen for the woman supports the diagnosis, but many cases occur with no
previous history. Mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. As a minimum, I
sample at 1-2 hours after the start of symptoms should be taken. Ideally though 3 timed samples should
be taken: as soon as possible after resuscitation has started (without delaying resuscitation); 1-2 hours
after the start of symptoms; 24 hours later.4

Other causes
These include hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia 45 and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. Other causes of
hypoxia include airway obstruction secondary to aspiration or foreign body, air embolism, tension pneumothorax,
cardiac tamponade secondary to trauma or dissection, and hypothermia. From an anaesthetic perspective, the main
causes of collapse would be local anaesthetic toxicity or failed tracheal intubation. There will be other very
unusual and rare causes of maternal collapse, but detailed discussion of all causes is beyond the scope of this
guideline.
4.3. What are the physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy that affect resuscitation?
It is essential that anyone involved in the resuscitation of pregnant women is aware of the
physiological differences. This includes pre-hospital care clinicians, paramedics and emergency
medicine department staff.
46
Pregnant women undergo a variety of physiological changes that can accelerate the development of
hypoxia and acidosis, and make ventilation more difficult. These changes are listed in Appendix 3,47 and
combined with other physical changes, make resuscitation during pregnancy more challenging. It is
essential that anyone involved in the resuscitation of a pregnant woman is aware of these differences.
This includes paramedics, critical care staff and emergency medicine department staff.

4.3.1.
Aortocaval compression
Aortocaval compression significantly reduces cardiac output from 20 weeks of gestation
onwards and the efficacy of chest compressions during resuscitation.
Evidence
From around 20 weeks of gestation onwards the gravid uterus reduces venous return in the supine
position. As a consequence, cardiac output is reduced by up to 30-40%.48 Supine hypotension itself can
precipitate maternal collapse, which is usually reversed by turning the woman into the left lateral level 2+
position.
When cardiopulmonary arrest occurs, chest compressions are needed to produce a cardiac output. In
the nonpregnant situation, they achieve around 30% of the normal cardiac output. Aortocaval
compression further reduces cardiac output to approximately 10% of the nonpregnant cardiac output.
Therefore, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is less likely to be effective in a woman who is at 20 or
more weeks of gestation.

The increased progesterone level in pregnancy increases the respiratory drive,5 leading to an increase
in tidal volume and minute ventilation. Splinting of the diaphragm by the enlarged uterus reduces the
functional residual capacity (FRC) and also makes ventilation more difficult. Reduction in FRC along with
the markedly increased oxygen consumption of the fetoplacental unit, means that pregnant women
become hypoxic much more rapidly during periods of hypoventilation.

Pregnant women are at an increased risk of aspiration.
Pregnant women are at a significantly higher risk of regurgitation and aspiration, secondary to the
progesterone effect relaxing the lower oesophageal sphincter along with the raised intra-abdominal
pressure secondary to the gravid uterus. During labour or following maternal opioid administration there
can also be a delay in gastric emptying. Aspiration pneumonitis in pregnant women, known as
Mendelsson's syndrome, 57 can be severe. The risks can be minimised by early intubation with effective
cricoid pressure, and the use of H2 antagonists and antacids prophylactically in all women considered to
be at high risk of obstetric intervention during labour.

Evidence

The increased cardiac output and hyperdynamic circulation of pregnancy mean that large volumes of
blood can be lost rapidly, especially from the uterus which receives 10% of the cardiac output at term.
Otherwise healthy women tolerate blood loss remarkably well and can lose up to 35% of their
circulation before becoming symptomatic, and often maternal tachycardia may be the only sign of Evidence
hypovolaemia until very late in the haemorrhage. Blood loss is tolerated less well if there is a pre-existing level 4
maternal anaemia,58 and clotting is less efficient if there is significant anaemia. Concealed bleeding and
underestimation of loss means that intervention is often delayed. Where signs of hypovolaemia have
been subtle, hypovolaemia as the cause of maternal cardiopulmonary arrest may go unrecognised.

What is the optimal initial management of maternal collapse?
Resuscitation in maternal collapse
Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the
standard ABCDE approach, with some modifications for maternal physiology, in particular relief
of aortocaval compression.

If maternal cardiac arrest occurs in the community setting, basic life support should be
administered and rapid transfer arranged.
In the UK, resuscitation is conducted according to the guidelines of the Resuscitation Council (UK).
These guidelines include: Adult Basic Life Support; Adult Advanced Life Support; and Automated External
Defibrillation algorithms and recommendations. 24 These guidelines were updated in 2015 by international
experts under the auspices of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation 59 and are used in the
resuscitation of a pregnant woman.
Evidence
level 4
Maternal collapse can occur in the community setting, and pre-hospital care of the collapsed pregnant patient should
follow the same guidance from the Resuscitation Council (UK) listed above and will be delivered by ambulance
paramedics and/or pre-hospital care clinicians. The care standards delivered in the pre-hospital setting have been well
documented in the UK Ambulance Services Clinical Practice Guidelines Pocket Book and Emergency Birth in the
Community guideline. 60,61
In the event of maternal collapse, signs of life should be sought if the assessor is confident in this (check for
breathing and carotid pulse). If the assessor is not confident or there is any doubt in the detection of signs of life,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be commenced. However, if signs of life are detected, a standard ABCDE
approach should be taken. The woman should be placed in the left lateral position, obstetric review should be
sought, the need for oxygen therapy should be assessed and adequate vascular access should be gained. An alert,
verbal stimulus, pain stimulus, unresponsive (AVPU) assessment should be undertaken as an alteration of
consciousness can be a sign of critical illness. The cause of the maternal collapse should be rapidly identified and
treated to prevent potential progression to maternal cardio-respiratory arrest. Ongoing regular ABCDE assessment
should be performed as the risk of progression to cardiac arrest remains until the cause of the collapse is treated.
Assessment of fetal wellbeing should be undertaken after ABCDE assessment (Appendix 4).
If signs of life are not detected in the hospital setting, a cardiac arrest should be declared and the cardiac
arrest team called. An emergency call for the obstetric, obstetric anaesthetic and neonatal (if undelivered
and more than 22+0 weeks of gestation) resuscitation teams should be made. The consultant obstetrician
and consultant anaesthetist should also attend. Standard basic life support should be initiated.62
Evidence
level 4
From 20 weeks of gestation, changes in maternal physiology mean that adaptations are made to the resuscitation
process. While Resuscitation Council (UK) algorithms for generic, paediatric and neonatal life support are available in
standardised posters, adaptations for maternal resuscitation are addressed but are not available in algorithmic and
poster form. For this reason, the Resuscitation Council (UK) algorithm for advanced life support has been modified
by the authors and is included in Appendix 4 of this guideline.
4.4.2.
Relieving aorto-caval compression
Manual displacement of the uterus to the left is effective in relieving aortocaval compression in
women above 20 weeks' gestation or where the uterus is palpable at or above the level of the
umbilicus. This permits effective chest compressions in the supine position in the event of
cardiac arrest.

A left lateral tilt of the woman from head to toe at an angle of 15-30° on a firm surface will
relieve aortocaval compression in the majority of pregnant women and still allow effective
chest compressions to be performed in the event of cardiac arrest.
In cases of major trauma, the spine should be protected with a spinal board before any
tilt is applied. In the absence of a spinal board, manual displacement of the uterus should be
used.

There are essential adaptations to the management of a collapsed pregnant woman because of the physiological and
anatomical changes of pregnancy.
Evidence
After 20 weeks' gestation or when the uterus is palpable at or above the level of the umbilicus, manual
uterine displacement is the preferred method to reduce compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta
by the gravid uterus if performed correctly. The technique should be performed using an ‘up, off and
over' method. 63,64 This is achieved by placing a hand below the uterus on the maternal right and pushing level 2+
the uterus slightly upwards and to the left. This maintains the woman in a supine position, allowing for
continuous effective cardiac compressions if necessary.°
66,67
65
A left lateral tilt of the woman from head to toe at an angle of 15-30° to relieve aortocaval
compression can be achieved on a tilting operating table, with a solid wedge (of an appropriate size) 68
and spinal board, and allow for effective chest compressions to be performed 67. In the absence of these, Evidence
manual displacement of the uterus is preferable. Using soft surfaces, such as a bed, or objects, such as
pillows or blankets, are not nearly as effective, compromise effective chest compressions, and should not
be used (a video of the procedure can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VyqGqDNILc).
4.4.3. Airway
Intubation in an unconscious woman with a cuffed endotracheal tube should be performed
immediately by an experienced anaesthetist.
63,69
70
The airway in pregnancy is more vulnerable because of the increased risk of regurgitation and
aspiration. For this reason, it is important to clear and protect the airway as early as possible. Intubation
with a cuffed endotracheal tube should then be performed. This will protect the airway, ensure good
oxygen delivery and facilitate more efficient ventilation. Intubation can be more difficult in pregnancy, so this
should be undertaken by someone with appropriate skills. Failed intubation is more common in the
pregnant than nonpregnant patient and a plan for failed intubation should always be considered. A full
description of the failed intubation drill is available from the Difficult Airway Society. In brief: Maintain
oxygenation; Call for help; Supraglottic airway device; Front of Neck access. During cardiac arrest in a
nonpregnant woman it is acceptable to use a supraglottic device, such as a laryngeal mask airway as an
alternative to the endotracheal tube. In pregnant women, physiological changes in the airway, such as
hyperaemia, hypersecretion and oedema lead to increased friability of the airway mucosa causing bleeding
and difficulties in visualisation for intubation.69 Pregnant women are also more likely to regurgitate and
aspirate in the absence of a secured airway (endotracheal tube) than a nonpregnant woman, and thus, the
early involvement of an appropriately skilled anaesthetist remains best practice.69

Waveform capnography must be used to confirm and continually monitor tracheal tube placement, and may be used
to monitor the quality of CPR and to provide an early indication of return of spontaneous circulation.
24
Appendix 5 of this guideline presents suggested equipment that should be available for cases where airway
management may be difficult.
4.4.4. Breathing
Supplemental high flow oxygen should be administered as soon as possible to counteract rapid
deoxygenation.
Bag and mask ventilation or insertion of a simple supraglottic airway should be undertaken
until intubation can be achieved.
Maternal physiological changes lead to increased oxygen requirements. Furthermore, in maternal collapse,
reduced oxygen reserve and a reduced functional residual capacity leads to deoxygenation occurring Evidence
level 2++
more rapidly than in nonpregnant women. Therefore, supplemental oxygen should be added with a gas
flow of 10-15 1 per minute to whatever method of ventilation is being employed.62
Ventilation, using a face mask, or a supraglottic airway device and self-inflating bag, or via a cuffed endotracheal tube,
may be more difficult because of the physiological changes of pregnancy as previously described. It can also be
difficult to see the chest rise.
4.4.5. Circulation
If the airway is clear and there is no breathing, chest compressions should be commenced
immediately.
Two wide-bore cannulae (minimum 16 gauge) should be inserted as soon as possible. If
peripheral venous access is not possible, early consideration of central venous access,
intraosseous access or venous cutdown should be considered.
There should be an aggressive approach to volume replacement, although caution should be
exercised in the context of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia.
Abdominal ultrasound by a skilled operator can assist in the diagnosis of concealed
haemorrhage.
The same defibrillation energy levels should be used as in a nonpregnant woman.

Chest compressions should be commenced immediately in the absence of a cardiac output.'
Compressions may be made difficult because of obesity and if the woman is in the tilted position. Hand
position should be over the centre of the chest and it is important to ensure that the direction of Evidence
compression is perpendicular to the chest wall. If a left lateral tilt is employed then the angle of tilt must
be taken into account when performing chest compressions. Immediate and competent chest
compressions have been found to have a direct impact on maternal outcome.
72
In total, 30 chest compressions (at a rate of 100-120 per minute) should be performed for every two
ventilation breaths initially. If there are two rescuers, one should be responsible for chest compressions
and ventilation breaths, whilst the other should ensure aortocaval decompression with manual uterine
displacement. Once intubation is performed, the ratio of chest compressions to ventilation breaths
should be desynchronised. Ventilation should be at a rate of 10 breaths per minute with continuous
chest compressions at 100-120 per minute. Because chest compressions are not as effective after
20 weeks of gestation, there should be early recourse to delivery of the fetus and placenta if CPR is not
effective. In woman with a very high BMI chest compressions can be performed over the head of the
woman if there is sub-optimal rescuer positioning.'

73

Evidence
level 2++
Ideally, early vascular access will be obtained with wide-bore intravenous cannulae inserted above the level of the
diaphragm. This allows the administration of fluids to not be affected by aortocaval compression. If peripheral venous
access is difficult, there should be early consideration of central venous access, intraosseous access or venous
cutdown to aid volume replacement.
74
Haemorrhage is the most common cause of maternal collapse, and is a consequence of other causes of collapse.
There must be a high index of suspicion for bleeding and awareness of the limitations of maternal clinical signs.
Caution must be exercised in the clinical context of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, where fluid overload can
contribute to poor outcome. In the case where significant haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia or eclampsia exist,
careful fluid management is essential.
Very occasionally, ultrasound by a skilled operator can assist in the diagnosis of free fluid associated with
intra-abdominal bleeding, although laparotomy should not be delayed if the findings are negative and/or
the index of suspicion is high.' This, however, should not interfere with the resuscitation process.
75-78
If defibrillation is required, the same settings should be used as in the nonpregnant adult, as there is no
change in thoracic impedance.79 Adhesive defibrillator pads are preferable to defibrillator paddles, and
the left defibrillation pad should be applied lateral to the left breast. If the woman's breasts are large or
engorged, defibrillator pads may need to be placed on the anterior and posterior precordium to optimise
defibrillation energy transfer. The energy from the defibrillation shock is directed across the heart and
there is no evidence that shocks from a direct current defibrillator have an adverse effect on the fetus.
Uterine monitors should be removed before shock delivery.

When, where and how should perimortem caesarean section (PMCS) be performed?
In women over 20 weeks of gestation, if there is no response to correctly performed CPR
within 4 minutes of maternal collapse or if resuscitation is continued beyond this, then PMCS
should be undertaken to assist maternal resuscitation. Ideally, this should be achieved within
5 minutes of the collapse.
PMCS should not be delayed by moving the woman. It should be performed where maternal
collapse has occurred and resuscitation is taking place.
The operator should use the incision, which will facilitate the most rapid access. This may be a
midline vertical incision or a suprapubic transverse incision.
A scalpel and umbilical cord clamps (or alternative ligatures) should be available on the
resuscitation trolley in all areas where maternal collapse may occur, including the accident and
emergency department.
,81

level 4
D
Evidence
The concept of PMCS was introduced by Katz et al. in 1986. This research group initially focused on infant
survival and found that 69% of infants survived when PMCS was performed within 5 minutes. However,
when Katz et al. explored maternal outcomes, they found that hypoxic brain injury only occurred if PMCS
was performed after 6 minutes. Although the research basis for this recommendation is scarce, the
rationale for this timescale is that pregnant women become hypoxic more quickly than nonpregnant
women, and irreversible brain damage can ensue within 4-6 minutes. The term 'resuscitative
hysterotomy' has been introduced by non-obstetric clinicians (for example, emergency medicine clinicians
and paramedics) in the trauma and emergency department environments, as the procedure is primarily used level 4
to assist maternal resuscitation rather than to save the fetus. Obstetricians should be aware of this
terminology to ensure effective communication. The gravid uterus impairs venous return and thus reduces
cardiac output by approximately 60% secondary to aortocaval compression. 83 Delivery of the fetus and
placenta reduces oxygen consumption, improves venous return and cardiac output, facilitates chest
compressions and makes ventilation easier. It also allows for internal chest compressions by inserting the hand
through the open abdomen up to the diaphragm and compressing the posterior aspect of the heart against the
82

chest wall. This improves cardiac output beyond that achieved in closed chest compressions.84 At less than
20 weeks of gestation there is no proven benefit from delivery of the fetus and placenta. PMCS should be
considered a resuscitative procedure, to be performed primarily in the interests of maternal survival.

Delivery within 5 minutes of maternal collapse improves the chances of survival for the baby. If maternal
resuscitation is continuing beyond 4 minutes of the collapse, delivery of the fetus and placenta should be
performed as soon as possible to aid this, even if the fetus is already dead. Case series have shown that Evidence

collapse. There is, of course, the possibility that the outcome could be that the surviving child has
sustained damage in an attempt to preserve the life of the mother.
86,87
Time should not be wasted by moving the woman to an operating theatre; a PMCS can be performed
anywhere, with a scalpel being the only essential equipment required. With no circulation, blood loss
is minimal, and no anaesthetic is required. If resuscitation is successful following birth, there should be
prompt transfer to an appropriate environment at that point, as well as anaesthesia and sedation, to
control ensuing haemorrhage and complete the operation. The doctrine of 'best interests of the patient'
would apply to conduct of this procedure being carried out without consent.
In terms of the best incision to use, a midline abdominal incision and a classical uterine incision will give
the most rapid access. However, many will be unfamiliar with this approach and as delivery can be
achieved rapidly with a transverse approach, the operator should use the approach they are most
comfortable with.86 Manual uterine displacement can be stopped immediately prior to incision. If
resuscitation is successful, the uterus and abdomen should be closed in the usual way to control blood
loss and minimise the risk of infection. Where the resuscitation is not successful, the case should be
discussed with the coroner or procurator fiscal to determine whether a postmortem is required before
any medical devices, such as lines and endotracheal tube are removed, as per the Royal College of
Pathologists recommendations.

Evidence
level 4
Evidence
level 2++
To ensure there are no delays in executing a PMCS when indicated, the equipment necessary should be immediately
available on the resuscitation trolley. All that is required is a fixed blade scalpel and two clamps for the umbilical
cord. In the absence of a specific tray, a scalpel alone will enable delivery of the fetus and placenta, and cutting of the
umbilical cord, which can then be manually compressed until a clamp is found if the baby is alive.
4.6.
What does the ongoing management consist of?
Senior staff with appropriate experience should be involved at an early stage.
Transfer should be supervised by an adequately skilled team with appropriate equipment.
Ongoing management depends on the underlying cause of the collapse and appropriate senior staff must be involved
early. It is essential the woman is transferred to an appropriate environment to ensure optimal ongoing care. This
would usually mean transfer to a high dependency or critical care area with appropriate staff and monitoring
facilities.68

Inotropic support is likely to be needed and measurement of cardiac output may help direct therapy and avoid fluid
overload; fluid overload will exacerbate pulmonary oedema and increase the risk of acute respiratory distress
syndrome. High filling pressures are indicative of a failing left ventricle.
In women with AFE, those treated with recombinant factor VII were found to have worse outcomes than in
those not treated with recombinant factor VII. Therefore, recombinant factor VII should only be used in
29,96
patients with AFE when haemorrhage cannot be stopped by massive blood component replacement.²
If undelivered, delivery of the fetus and placenta should be performed as soon as possible. The incidence of
uterine atony is increased in this condition and contributes to the postpartum haemorrhage. This should be
managed as described in the RCOG Green-top Guideline on postpartum haemorrhage."

Many drug overdoses have treatments specific to the drug in question and appropriate help should be sought in the
management of such cases, including liaising with Toxbase and speaking to GP/local pharmacist. In obstetric practice,
the two main drugs that can give rise to overdose or toxic problems are magnesium sulphate and local anaesthetic
agents.
4.6.6.1.
Magnesium sulphate
The antidote to magnesium toxicity is 10 ml 10% calcium gluconate or 10 ml 10% calcium
chloride given by slow intravenous injection.
Magnesium sulphate toxicity should be managed by slow intravenous injection of 10 ml 10% calcium gluconate or
10 ml 10% calcium chloride. 101

If local anaesthetic toxicity is suspected, stop injecting immediately.
Lipid rescue should be used in cases of collapse secondary to local anaesthetic toxicity.
IntralipidⓇ 20% should be available in all hospitals offering maternity services.
Manage arrhythmias as usual, recognising that they may be very refractory to treatment.
All cases of lipid rescue should be reported to NHS Improvement and the Lipid Rescue site.
The mechanism by which lipids reverse local anesthetic cardiotoxicity may be increasing clearance from cardiac
tissue. This nonspecific, observed extraction of local anesthetics from aqueous plasma or cardiac tissues is termed a
'lipid sink.' Another proposed mechanism is that lipids counteract local anesthetic inhibition of myocardial fatty acid
oxidation, thereby enabling energy production and reversing cardiac depression.

Treatment of cardiac arrest with lipid emulsion 42,102 consists of an intravenous bolus injection of
IntralipidⓇ (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) 20% 1.5 ml/kg over I min (100 ml
for a woman weighing 70 kg) followed by an intravenous infusion of Intralipid® 20% 15 ml/kg/h
(1000 ml.h for a woman weighing 70 kg). The bolus injection can be repeated twice at 5-minute
intervals if an adequate circulation has not been restored (a further two 100 ml boluses at 5-minute
intervals for a woman weighing 70 kg). After another 5 minutes, the infusion rate should be increased to
30 ml/kg/hr if an adequate circulation has not been restored. Do not exceed a maximum cumulative dose
of 12 ml/kg (840 ml for a woman weighing 70 kg). CPR should be continued throughout this process
until an adequate circulation has been restored. This may take over I hour.'

Prolonged resuscitation may be necessary, and it may be appropriate to consider other options. The first-line
treatment should be lipid emulsion, but if the facilities are available, some may consider the use of cardiopulmonary

4.7. What are the outcomes for mother and baby?
Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age and access
to emergency care, with survival rates being poorer if the collapse occurs out of hospital. In
maternal cardiac arrest maternal survival rates of over 50% have been reported.
Due to the lack of robust population data, it is not possible to be accurate regarding maternal and neonatal
outcomes of maternal collapse. There remains a significant reporter bias in publications relating to the topic.
The MBRRACE-UK Saving Lives and Improving Mothers' Care report and UK Obstetric Surveillance System
studies provide robust data for maternal survival for individual conditions, such as AFE and sepsis. The
general trend of reducing numbers of maternal deaths despite a plateau in the number of maternities
demonstrated by MBRRACE-UK suggests that survival from maternal collapse is improving.2
2,3
A UKOSS prospective cohort study identified 66 cardiac arrests between July 2011 and June 2014 resulting
in an incidence of 2.78 per 100 000 maternities. In all, 28 women died (case fatality rate 42%). Basic and

advanced life support were quickly delivered. Women who collapsed at home were more likely to die.
PMCS was performed on 49 women (II of these performed in the emergency department). Time intervals
between collapse and PMCS was significantly shorter in women who survived compared with those who
died (median interval, 3 minutes versus 12 minutes; P = 0.001).
The latest systematic review to study the efficacy of PMCS was published in 2012 by Einav et al. 87 This
review identified a total of 80 relevant publications that reported the outcome of 94 women. In 31.7% of
identified cases of PMCS, the procedure was found to be of benefit for maternal or fetal survival. No
harm was found in any of the 94 women who underwent PMCS. When analysing maternal outcome,
54.3% of women survived until hospital discharge and 42.6% of women survived with good to moderately
impaired neurological outcome. Although the study was unable to validate the need to deliver by
5 minutes duration, it was able to demonstrate that maternal outcomes were more favourable if
performed within 10 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest (OR 7.42; P < 0.05). Neonatal survival was also
associated with a shorter mean cardiac arrest to delivery time (14[±11] minutes versus 22[±13] minutes).
Neonatal survival was only found in women who suffered cardiac arrest in hospital and there were
reports of neonatal survival where delivery was performed 30 minutes after maternal cardiac arrest.
The MBRRACE-UK report 2016 described the neonatal outcomes of the 32 babies born by PMCS.³ Of
these babies, 19 were delivered by caesarean section after 32 weeks of gestation; nine of the 19 babies
survived. Of the 13 babies born by PMCS at 32 weeks of gestation or less, only three survived.
Therefore, the overall neonatal survival of babies delivered by PMCS was 38%. Survival was directly
associated with advanced gestation and delivery within a suitable birthing or critical care setting.

In addition to the general arrest team, there should also be a senior midwife, an obstetrician
and an obstetric anaesthetist included in the team in cases of maternal collapse.
The most senior obstetrician and senior anaesthetist should be called at the time of a
cardiopulmonary arrest call.
The neonatal team should be called early if delivery is likely (antepartum collapse over
22+0 weeks of gestation).
Where the woman survives, a consultant intensivist should be involved as soon as possible.

If the maternity unit is an integral part of a general hospital, the maternal CPR team should be the hospital
cardiopulmonary arrest team with the addition of:
senior midwife
most senior resident obstetrician (usually ST 3–7)
. resident anaesthetist who has recognised skills in obstetric anaesthesia (usually ST 3-7).
This will mean that the request needs to be specific with common terminology, so that the switchboard operators
know exactly who to call. While managing the arrest, there must be dialogue between the team leader, the
obstetrician and the obstetric anaesthetist as to how best to manage the pregnant woman.
In stand-alone consultant-led maternity units or those that are geographically distant from the main general hospital,
the entire arrest team is often made up of staff from within the maternity unit. In this case, the team is usually made
up of senior midwifery staff, operating department practitioners, resident obstetric staff and the resident obstetric
anaesthetist.
If a maternal collapse occurs in a stand-alone midwifery unit or homebirth environment, the midwifery staff should
provide life support and call a 999 ambulance to transfer the woman to the nearest appropriate environment.
Maternity services that include a stand-alone midwifery unit should ensure that there is a written agreement with the
ambulance service confirming the emergency status of a 999 call from the midwifery unit.

Appendix 1: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be
evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations
in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into
routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
