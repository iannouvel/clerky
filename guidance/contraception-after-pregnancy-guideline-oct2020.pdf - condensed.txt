FSRH Guideline on Contraception After Pregnancy was first published in January 2017 and amended in October 2020. Changes have been made to include additional advice on estradiol-containing combined oral contraceptives. The guideline provides information on the availability of contraception methods in the UK, the effectiveness of different contraceptives, and the importance of counselling and information giving to women after pregnancy. It emphasizes the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) for better effectiveness. Clinicians are advised to refer to the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (UKMEC) for safe and appropriate contraceptive methods. Women should be given the opportunity to discuss contraception without feeling pressured to choose a specific method. A person-centered approach is recommended for contraceptive counselling.

Clinical guideline recommends comprehensive and unbiased information on contraceptive methods after pregnancy in various formats. Services should offer all appropriate methods of contraception, including LARC, before discharge. Clinicians should discuss medical and social factors relevant to contraceptive choice, ensure valid consent, and provide continuing care and support. Contraception after childbirth should be discussed and initiated promptly, with emphasis on LARC methods. Maternity services should have pathways to local community services for complex medical needs. Barrier methods, fertility awareness methods, and female sterilization are safe options. After abortion, contraception should be initiated immediately, with LARC methods reducing the likelihood of another abortion within 2 years. Emergency contraception is safe to use after abortion. Additional contraceptive precautions may be necessary depending on the timing of contraception initiation.

Barrier methods/abstinence are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after abortion. Additional contraceptive precaution is not required if contraception is initiated immediately or within 5 days of abortion. 

Intrauterine contraception (IUC) can be safely used by women after an uncomplicated abortion. Women may benefit from reduced uterine bleeding when using levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). With medical abortion, IUC can be inserted any time after expulsion of the pregnancy. With surgical abortion, IUC can be inserted immediately after evacuation of the uterine cavity. 

Progestogen-only contraception can be safely started at any time, including immediately, after medical or surgical abortion. Women should be advised about the risks of continuing pregnancy if DMPA is initiated at the time of mifepristone administration. Scant or absent bleeding should not be attributed to a hormonal method of contraception but may be due to failed medical abortion, requiring urgent medical review.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) can be safely started immediately at any time after abortion. Female sterilisation is a safe option for permanent contraception after abortion. Tubal occlusion should ideally be performed after some time has elapsed after abortion. Condoms and diaphragms can be used by women after abortion. Fertility awareness methods can be used but may be difficult after abortion. 

Effective contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Women should be informed about the effectiveness of different contraceptive methods. Clinicians should ensure timely and accurate information is provided about contraception after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Women should be advised about the risks and benefits of different contraceptive methods after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. 

Emergency contraception is safe to use after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after treatment for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. 

Women with recurrent early miscarriage should be investigated for underlying causes but should not delay initiation of contraception. Women should be advised about the risks associated with different contraceptive methods. Clinicians should reassure women with GTD about fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Effective contraception should be started as soon as possible after GTD. 

Emergency contraception is safe to use after GTD. Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after treatment for GTD. Specific considerations for intrauterine contraception and hormonal contraception after GTD are provided. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of different contraceptive methods after GTD.

contraception after pregnancy, including the method chosen and any relevant medical or social factors. Valid consent should be obtained from the woman before initiating contraception.

Valid consent must be obtained before providing women with their chosen method of contraception. Clinicians should be aware of the procedures for obtaining valid consent, which includes documenting the purpose, process, assessment of capacity, provision of information, and assessment of a patient's autonomy. The clinician providing contraception is responsible for ensuring that valid consent is given before initiating the method. It is important to clearly document the method of contraception provided, especially for intrauterine contraception (IUC) or implants (IMP). Women should be provided with clear information on signs of possible complications, when to seek medical attention, when to have a thread check, and when the device needs replacing. Clinicians should facilitate private discussions with women and be knowledgeable about gender-based violence and how to support affected women. Services should have pathways for care to local community sexual and reproductive health services for women with complex medical conditions or needs. It is important to ensure that women receive the care they need after pregnancy, considering issues such as domestic violence, mental health, substance misuse, and social support. Partners may be involved in decision-making, but discussions with women should be private to avoid coercion. Healthcare services should have pathways to refer women to appropriate services if they are unable to provide their chosen method of contraception. Women from vulnerable groups should be informed about continuing care and support services as needed. Maternity services should offer opportunities for women to discuss fertility intentions, contraception, and preconception planning. Contraceptive counselling should be provided antenatally, and women should have access to a full range of contraceptives postpartum, including long-acting reversible methods. Immediate initiation of contraception after childbirth is important to prevent unintended pregnancies and ensure spacing of children. Women should be advised on the effectiveness of different contraceptive methods and given comprehensive, unbiased information. Clinicians should adopt a person-centered approach and provide timely, accurate information on contraceptive methods. Contraception should be initiated by 21 days after childbirth, and women should be informed about immediate insertion of IUC and implants. It is important to provide sufficient staff trained in providing contraception after childbirth and to have pathways for referral to specialist services if needed. Record keeping is essential for documenting consent, methods provided, and any discussions or decisions made.

Clinicians should clearly document the discussion and provision of contraception after childbirth. Valid consent must be obtained before providing women with their chosen method. Women who choose to have IUC or sterilization should have their decision clearly documented before they are admitted for delivery. Most methods of contraception can be safely initiated immediately after childbirth, except for combined hormonal contraception (CHC). IUC can be inserted immediately after childbirth, and progestogen-only contraception is safe to use. Emergency contraception is safe to use from 21 days after childbirth. Women who are breastfeeding can use LNG-EC without adverse effects. Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 21 days or more after childbirth. Progestogen-only methods of contraception have no adverse effects on breastfeeding or infant outcomes. Women who are breastfeeding should wait until 6 weeks after childbirth before initiating a CHC method. Women should be informed about the full range of safe alternative contraceptive methods they can use, particularly during the first 6 weeks after childbirth when the risk of VTE is highest.

6 months postpartum, amenorrhoeic and fully breastfeeding, the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is a highly effective method of contraception. Women using LAM should be advised that the risk of pregnancy is increased if the frequency of breastfeeding decreases, when menstruation returns, or when more than 6 months after childbirth. Full breastfeeding includes exclusive or almost exclusive breastfeeding. Evidence shows that when the rules of LAM are followed, failure rates are less than 2%. The use of expressing milk may reduce the efficacy of LAM. It is recommended that women fulfill specific criteria for LAM to be effective. For women who wish to switch from LAM to a different method of contraception, additional precautions may be needed. Intrauterine contraception (IUC) can be safely inserted immediately after birth or within the first 48 hours after childbirth. IUC insertion between 48 hours and 4 weeks after childbirth should be based on clinical judgment. Progestogen-only implant (IMP) can be safely started at any time after childbirth, including immediately after delivery. Studies have shown high continuation rates of IMP at 6 and 12 months postpartum. Progestogen-only injectable (POI) can also be started at any time after childbirth, including immediately after delivery. There are theoretical concerns about DMPA and VTE risk.

The SPC for Depo-Provera and Sayana Press recommend caution with DMPA after childbirth due to potential bleeding pattern changes. Evidence is needed to confirm this association. DMPA can inhibit first ovulation after childbirth without additional precautions. Progestogen-only pills have minimal effects on factors and can be started immediately after childbirth. Combined hormonal contraception should not be used within 6 weeks of childbirth for women with VTE risk factors. Female sterilisation is safe after childbirth with various methods available. Barrier methods can be used after childbirth, with diaphragms recommended after 6 weeks. Fertility awareness methods can be used after childbirth but may be challenging. Contraception should be discussed and initiated at the time of abortion or soon after.

Ovulation can resume very soon after abortion, with over 90% of women experiencing ovulation within 1 month of first-trimester abortions. Immediate initiation of contraception after abortion is associated with higher continuation rates and reduced risk of unintended pregnancy. Clinicians should provide person-centered contraceptive counseling to women after abortion. Highly effective contraceptive methods, such as IUC and progestogen-only implants, should be offered immediately after abortion to prevent another abortion within 2 years. Emergency contraception is safe to use after abortion, and additional contraceptive precautions may be necessary if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after abortion. Intrauterine contraception can be safely used after abortion, with immediate insertion associated with reduced risk of adverse outcomes. Women who choose LNG-IUS after abortion may benefit from reduced uterine bleeding.

A normal bleeding pattern was reported by four individuals, while five reported amenorrhoea, spotting, and heavy bleeding each. Insertion of LNG-IUS reduced postabortion bleeding compared to Cu-IUD. IUC can be safely inserted after medical abortion immediately after expulsion of the pregnancy. Women who delay insertion of IUC should schedule a return visit as soon as possible. Ultrasound is necessary to exclude ongoing pregnancy before insertion of IUC. Progestogen-only contraception can be safely started immediately after medical or surgical abortion. Immediate initiation of DMPA may slightly increase the risk of continuing pregnancy. Combined hormonal contraception can be safely started immediately after abortion. Female sterilisation is a safe option for permanent contraception after abortion, but tubal occlusion should ideally be performed after some time has elapsed. Consent for female sterilisation at the same time as surgical abortion should be obtained and documented in advance. Condoms and diaphragms can be used after abortion.

- Condoms can be used without restriction at any time after abortion, but are considered one of the least effective contraceptive methods.
- Diaphragms are unsuitable until 6 weeks after second-trimester abortion, as the uterus size changes.
- Fertility awareness methods can be used after abortion, but may be difficult due to disrupted signs of fertility.
- Effective contraception should be initiated as soon as possible after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage to prevent further pregnancy.
- Methotrexate treatment requires effective contraception for at least 3 months after treatment.
- Emergency contraception can be used after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage if unprotected sexual intercourse occurs more than 5 days after treatment.
- Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started more than 5 days after miscarriage or treatment for ectopic pregnancy.

Initiation ≥5 days after treatment for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Number of days of additional contraceptive precautions required:
- Copper intrauterine device: None
- Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system: 7 days
- Progestogen-only pill (traditional/desogestrel): 2 days
- Progestogen-only implant or injectable: 7 days
- Combined hormonal contraception: 7 days, except for Qlaira® which requires 9 days of additional precautions. 

Specific issues:
- Lack of evidence on the effect of hormonal methods of contraception on bleeding after ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.
- Women with recurrent early miscarriage should be investigated for underlying causes but should not delay contraceptive initiation if they do not wish to become pregnant.
- Combined hormonal contraception should be avoided by women with recurrent early miscarriage until antiphospholipid syndrome has been excluded.

Is there any method associated with a risk of another ectopic pregnancy?
- Women should be advised that the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy when contraception is used is extremely small and lowest with LARC.
- Women should seek medical advice if they suspect they may be pregnant and have symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, even while using contraception.

Female sterilisation:
- Women should be informed that if pregnancy occurs after tubal occlusion, there is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and the location of the pregnancy should be confirmed by ultrasound as soon as possible.

Clinicians should reassure women with GTD that fertility and pregnancy outcomes are favorable after GTD, including after chemotherapy for GTN. However, there is an increased risk of GTD in subsequent pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after complete molar pregnancy, until two consecutive monthly hCG levels are normal after partial molar pregnancy, and for 1 year after chemotherapy for GTD. Services should offer all methods of contraception to women before discharge, including LARC, and ensure sufficient staff for progestogen-only implant initiation. Additional contraceptive precautions are required if hormonal contraception is started 5 days or more after GTD treatment. Female sterilization is a safe option for permanent contraception after GTD.

- Tubal occlusion should ideally be performed after some time has elapsed after surgical evacuation for GTD. Women who request tubal occlusion to be performed at the time of surgical treatment should be advised of the possible increased failure rate and risk of regret. There is no evidence on sterilisation at the time of surgical evacuation for GTD. Extrapolating evidence from sterilisation at the time of caesarean section, the GDG recommends that tubal occlusion at the time of treatment for GTD may not be appropriate given the possibility of regret associated with concomitance of both procedures. WHOMEC107 recommends that women with persistently elevated hCG levels or malignant disease should delay being sterilised. 

- Condoms (male and female) can be used by women after treatment for GTD. Women who choose a diaphragm should be advised to wait at least 6 weeks after treatment for GTD because the required size of diaphragm may change as the uterus returns to normal size. Fertility awareness methods (FAM) can be used by women after treatment for GTD. However, women should be advised that because FAM relies on the detection of the signs and symptoms of fertility and ovulation, its use may be difficult after treatment for GTD.

- Clinicians should inform women that there is no evidence that the use of any contraceptive method after an episode of GTD increases the risk of GTD in a subsequent pregnancy. The population risk of molar pregnancy is 0.1 –0.2%. After one molar pregnancy, the risk of a repeat episode is about 1–2%. Oral contraceptives and Copper intrauterine devices have not been shown to increase the risk of GTD in subsequent pregnancies.

Immediate postpartum provision of highly effective reversible contraception is important for improving postpartum contraceptive use. Education for contraceptive use by women after childbirth is valuable. Barriers to intrauterine device insertion in postpartum women need to be addressed. The timing of postpartum intrauterine device placement should be considered for cost-effectiveness. General practitioners play a key role in providing contraceptive advice and long-acting reversible contraception at the 6-week postnatal visit. Contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices are effective options for postpartum contraception. Postpartum insertion of intrauterine devices and implants have high continuation rates. Immediate postpartum insertion of intrauterine devices and implants can reduce rapid repeat pregnancies. Intrauterine contraception is safe and effective during the immediate postpartum period. Postpartum insertion of levonorgestrel intrauterine systems is feasible and well-tolerated. Immediate postpartum contraception options, such as implants and intrauterine devices, should be offered to women to prevent unintended pregnancies.

Tubal ligation and Filshie clips for immediate postpartum sterilisation have been shown to be effective methods of contraception. Studies have also looked at the timing of female sterilisation and factors contributing to regret after the procedure. It is important to consider the timing of insertion of contraceptive devices post-abortion to reduce the risk of repeat abortions. Immediate post-abortion insertion of intrauterine devices and implants has been shown to be effective in preventing repeat pregnancies. Studies have also evaluated the use of contraceptive pills and patches post-abortion to assess their impact on bleeding patterns and contraceptive efficacy. Timing of sterilisation procedures in abortion patients has also been studied to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Clinical guidelines for gestational trophoblastic disease were developed by the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare. The guideline development process involved a multidisciplinary group and patient representatives. Evidence was systematically reviewed, and recommendations were graded based on the level of evidence. Recommendations were formulated using a standardized grading scheme.

Considerations when making recommendations
FSRH clinical guidelines recommend safe and appropriate clinical practice for different contraceptive methods. The recommendations are based on health benefits, side effects, and risks, considering available evidence and expert opinion. Financial and organizational barriers are also taken into account to ensure realistic and achievable recommendations.

Reaching consensus on recommendations
Consensus is reached when 80% of the GDG members agree with a recommendation. If consensus is not reached, recommendations are revised based on feedback until agreement is reached. Recommendations not achieving consensus after revisions are taken to the CEC for a final decision. Any group member can note their disagreement with a decision.

Updating this guideline
Guidelines are updated every 5 years based on new evidence availability. The decision to update is made by the CEU in consultation with the CEC, considering new evidence that could impact recommendations.

Plasma or serum anti -β2-glycoprotein I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype present on at least two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. 

Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include amenorrhoea or missed period, vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other reported symptoms may include breast tenderness, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, fainting, shoulder tip pain, urinary symptoms, passage of tissue, and rectal pressure or pain on defecation. 

Multiple choice questions for continuing professional development include topics on pregnancies ending in abortion, interval between deliveries to reduce risks, contraceptive methods postpartum, emergency contraception, and post-ectopic pregnancy recommendations. 

Auditable outcomes for postnatal contraception, abortion, ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, and gestational trophoblastic disease are provided for healthcare practitioners to monitor and improve patient care. 

Feedback on the published guideline can be sent to the Clinical Effectiveness Unit of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare via the FSRH website.
