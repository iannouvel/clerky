DISCLAIMER  
The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (hereinafter referred to as 'ESHRE ') developed the current clinical practice guideline, to provide clinical recommendations to improve the quality of healthcare delivery within the field of human reproduction and embryology. The aim of clinical practice guidelines is to aid healthcare professionals in everyday clinical decisions about appropriate and effective care of their patients. ESHRE makes no warranty, express or  implied, regarding the clinical practice guidelines and specifically excludes any warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose. ESHRE shall not be liable for direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages related to the use of the information contained herein. 

Introduction to the guideline  
Approximately  30%  of infertile couples are considered to experience  “unexplained infertility” (UI) (2019, 2020) . UI is inevitably a diagnosis by exclusion, following otherwise  “standard” investigations. However, a consensual  standardization of the diagnostic work -up is still lacking. The International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART) defined UI as “infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis and with adequate coital frequency; and apparen tly normal testicular function, genito -urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate. The potential for this diagnosis is dependent upon the methodologies used and/or those methodologies available” (Zegers -Hochschild et al., 2017) . In some instances, the terms “unexplained” and “idiopathic” infertility have been used interchang eably. The proportion of couples with UI is related to the extent of diagnostic exam ination  performed to uncover putative causes for unsuccessful attempts at pregnancy (ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2004) . The management of UI is traditionally empirical. Existing guidelines for UI were released from the Canadian Fertility and Androl ogy Society (Buckett a nd Sierra, 2019)  in 2019 and from the American Society f or Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in 2020 (20 20). This guideline was developed in collaboration with Monash University led Australian NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health. 

GUIDELINE SCOPE  
The aims of this guideline are:  
- To provide clinicians with evidence -based inform ation on the optimal diagnostic work -up for infertile couples based  on the examination s and procedures available to date, to correctly establish the diagnosis of UI.  
- To provide clinicians with evidence -based information on the optimal therapeutic approach considering issues like live birth rates, safety, patient compliance, and individualization. 

This guideline focuses on couples with unexplained infertility and includes chapters on diagnosis, tests, and treatment. Target users include general practitioners, gynaecologists, andrologists, infertility specialists, and reproductive surgeons. The guideline emphasizes outcomes such as live birth, ongoing pregnancy rate, and patient satisfaction. Terminology is based on the international glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. Diagnostic recommendations include confirmation of ovulation, ovarian reserve testing, and tests for tubal and uterine factors. Routine laparoscopy and post-coital tests are not recommended.

15 Vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting. 
16 Testicular imaging is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
17 Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in the semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
18 Testing for sperm DNA fragmentation is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
19 Sperm chromatin condensation test is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
20 Sperm aneuploidy screening is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
21 Serum hormonal testing is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
22 HPV testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
23 Microbiology testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 
24 Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum of either males or females with unexplained infertility is not recommended. 
25 Testing for coeliac disease in women with unexplained infertility can be considered. 
26 Testing for thyroid antibody and other autoimmune conditions (apart from coeliac disease) in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. 
27 TSH measurement is considered good practice in pre-conception care. 
28 No additional thyroid evaluation in women is recommended if TSH is within the normal range. 
29 Testing for thrombophilia in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. 
30 Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with unexplained infertility should only be considered in the context of research. 
31 Measurement of oxidative stress in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. 
32 Genetic or genomic tests are currently not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility. 
33 Testing for vitamin D deficiency in women is not recommended for diagnosis of unexplained infertility. 
34 Prolactin testing in women is not recommended. 
35 BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. 
36 IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. 
37 The GDG advises to base the decision to start active treatment on prognosis in couples with unexplained infertility. 
38 IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. 
39 To avoid multiple pregnancies and OHSS, care is needed by using gonadotrophin treatment only in a low-dose regimen with adequate monitoring. 
40 IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation in couples with unexplained infertility. 
41 It is expected that the decision to use IVF is individualized by patient characteristics such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment and previous pregnancy. 
42 ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF in couples with unexplained infertility. 
43 Hysteroscopy for the detection and possible correction of intrauterine abnormalities not seen at routine imaging is not recommended. 
44 HSG (i.e., tubal flushing) with an oil-soluble contrast medium is preferable over a water-soluble contrast medium. Risks and benefits of tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast medium should be discussed with all couples with unexplained infertility. 
45 Endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility. 
46 Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to women undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended. 
47 Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to males undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended. 
48 Acupuncture in women is probably not recommended. 
49 Inositol supplementation in women is probably not recommended. 
50 Psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed. 
51 A healthy diet and regular exercise, supported by behavioral therapy, when necessary, are recommended. 
52 Healthcare professionals should be aware that there is probably no difference in QoL between women with unexplained infertility versus women in couples with known causes of infertility, except when the cause of infertility is PCOS, where the QoL is lower. QoL is probably higher in men from a couple with unexplained infertility compared to men from a couple with known causes of infertility except when the cause of infertility is men with a partner with PCOS, then the men from a couple with unexplained infertility have a lower QoL.

NARRATIVE QUESTION: SHOULD FEMALE OR MALE PARTNER'S AGE AFFECT THE DEFINITION OF UI?

Analysis of 237 studies found that the ICMART definition of UI does not include the female partner's age. However, a mathematical model suggests that after 2 years of unprotected intercourse, the false positive diagnosis of UI increases with age.

Male

The GDG recommends a basic semen examination for males, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical examination and history. Results below the lower 5th percentile reference limit should prompt further investigation.

Female

The ICMART definition of UI excludes any female factors. The GDG defines UI as infertility in couples under 40 years old with normal reproductive anatomy and adequate coital frequency.

CONCLUSION

The GDG defines UI as infertility in couples under 40 with normal reproductive anatomy and adequate coital frequency. Investigations should start after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse.

II. Diagnosis

II.1 Confirmation of ovulation

In a study of infertile women with regular cycles, urinary LH tests showed high accuracy in predicting ovulation compared to ultrasound monitoring. Basal body temperature and cervical mucus changes were less accurate. Tests such as urinary LH measurements, ultrasound monitoring, or mid-luteal progesterone measurement can be used to confirm ovulation in women with regular cycles.

II.3 Ovarian reserve
PICO QUESTION: SHOULD ONE OR MORE TESTS OF OVARIAN RESERVE BE INCLUDED IN THE DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP?
ANTI-MÜLLERIAN HORMONE (AMH)
Evidence
In a cohort study, lower anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly associated with unexplained infertility (UI) in women, while antral follicle count (AFC) was not found to be associated with UI.
A study of women between 30 and 44 years old showed that those with low AMH values had similar chances of conceiving compared to those with normal values. Women with high serum FSH values also had similar chances of conceiving compared to those with normal values.

In a study, AMH, FSH, and AFC were compared between women with and without infertility. No significant differences were found in predictive value for time to pregnancy. Serum AMH levels and AFC were similar in both groups. Serum AMH levels were not predictive of live birth in five years. Women with high AMH levels had lower fecundability rates. Antral follicle count was not predictive of spontaneous pregnancy. Women with unexplained infertility had lower AFC compared to women with male factor infertility. Serum FSH levels were higher in women with unexplained infertility. No difference was found in cumulative probability of conception for women with elevated FSH levels.

112 women with male factor infertility had similar FSH and estradiol levels compared to women with unexplained infertility (UI) (Yücel et al., 2018).

A study found that 52% of women with UI had an abnormal Clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT), compared to lower percentages for other infertility factors (Scott et al., 1993).

Studies have shown no association between inhibin B levels and the probability of conception in women without infertility (Steiner et al., 2017).

Ovarian volume and inhibin B levels were similar between women with UI and male factor infertility (Yücel et al., 2018).

Ovarian reserve testing is not necessary for women with regular menstrual cycles to identify infertility causes or predict spontaneous conception (Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023).

Studies have consistently shown that ovarian reserve status does not predict spontaneous conception rates over 6-12 months (Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023).

Ovarian reserve testing may not be informative for predicting the success of expectant management, OS-IUI, or IVF (Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023).

Ovarian response plays a major role in the probability of live birth per IVF cycle, with women with decreased ovarian reserve having lower success rates (Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023).

Hagen CP et al. found that low levels of antimüllerian hormone are not predictive of reduced fecundability in young healthy women. Hunault CC et al. developed two new prediction rules for spontaneous pregnancy leading to live birth among subfertile couples. Hvidman HW et al. discovered that infertile women under 40 have similar antimüllerian hormone levels compared to women without a history of infertility. Nguyen DK et al. found that antimüllerian hormone is predictive of natural conception leading to live birth in subfertile couples. Yücel B et al. conducted a cohort study showing that a decline in ovarian reserve may be an undiagnosed reason for unexplained infertility. 

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Alcázar et al. found that 2D-HyCoSy has a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.94 for diagnosing tubal pathology, while 3D/4D-HyCoSy has a sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.89. Wang and Qian's study showed that 3D and 4D-HyCoSy have a sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 for tubal patency. Additional studies by Chen et al., Cimen et al., and Liang et al. also demonstrated the accuracy of HyCoSy compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation for tubal patency testing.

A systematic review found that HSG has a sensitivity of 46-100% and specificity of 73-100% for tubal pathology diagnosis compared to laparoscopy with chromopertubation. In women with low-risk clinical history, sensitivity for unilateral tubal pathology was 38% compared to 61% in high-risk women. Sensitivity for bilateral tubal pathology ranged from 0-100% and specificity from 87-97%. Additional studies showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.79 for HSG.

Hystero salpingo -contrast -sonography (HyCoSy) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are valid tests for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. HSG and HyCoSy are comparable in diagnostic capacity, thus selection of the technique depends on the preference of the clinician and the patient. High risk factors for tubal occlusion include past chlamydia infection, PID, peritonitis, known endometriosis, and pelvic surgery. HyCoSy is a valid test for tubal patency with high specificity and sensitivity. HSG is also a valid test for tubal patency and less costly and harmful than laparoscopy. Chlamydia antibody testing can differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. In patients at high risk for tubal abnormality, visual demonstration of tubal patency is necessary.

The sensitivity of Chlamydia antibody testing compared to laparoscopy is lower than HSG and HyCoSy, with good specificity. The validity varies depending on the assay used. CAT may have a limited role in clinical practice, with low false negative rates. A negative result with low-risk medical history may indicate tubal patency, but confirmation with visual methods is recommended for both positive and negative results with high-risk medical history. Studies have shown high rates of tubal pathology in patients with high-risk medical history. Newer antibodies and more specific CAT tests have improved performance, but limitations remain, especially with sensitivity.

Hysterosalpingograms and laparoscopy are used in diagnosing tubal factor infertility. Various studies compare different diagnostic procedures for uterine anomalies, with 3D ultrasound showing superior results. 3D ultrasound is recommended for excluding uterine anomalies in women with unexplained infertility.

MRI is not recommended as a first-line test to confirm a normal uterine structure and anatomy in women with unexplained infertility due to lack of evidence and cost considerations. Hysteroscopy or HyCoSy should be considered as second-line diagnostic tools for further evaluation if needed. If ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity is normal, no further evaluation is needed. Further information is available in Annex 6 and Annex 7.

II.7 Cervical / vaginal factor  
PICO QUESTION: WHAT IS THE NEED FOR FEMALE LOWER GENITAL TRACT INVESTIGATIONS?  
POST-COITAL TEST (PCT)  
Evidence  
A systematic review and meta-analysis reported predictive values of normal and abnormal post-coital test (PCT) and sensitivity and specificity ranges. Likelihood ratios for normal and abnormal PCT were also provided.  
In a randomised controlled trial, cumulative pregnancy rates at 24 months were similar with and without PCT.  
A retrospective cohort study compared pregnancy rates after a positive or negative PCT in patients with unexplained infertility.  
A retrospective study investigated the predictive value of normal and abnormal PCTs on pregnancy rates in couples undergoing routine fertility work-up. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were provided.

In couples with less than 3 years of infertility, positive PCT results were associated with higher conception rates compared to negative results. However, PCT is not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility due to its poor discriminating capacity and lack of impact on management. Vaginal microbiota testing may be considered in research settings for couples with unexplained infertility, but there is currently insufficient evidence to support its role in fertility outcomes.

Recommendation: Anti-sperm antibody testing may be considered in cases of unexplained infertility in men with normal semen analysis. Positive anti-sperm antibodies may impact sperm function and fertility outcomes. More research is needed to determine the clinical significance of anti-sperm antibodies in male infertility.

Couples with UI were divided based on sperm antibody levels, with higher pregnancy rates in couples with <50% antibody bound sperm. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Sperm DNA fragmentation testing is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Sperm chromatin condensation testing and sperm aneuploidy screening are also not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Genetic factors can contribute to male infertility.

The number of identified genes linked with seminal phenotypes and male infertility is constantly expanding. The risk of men being carriers of genetic anomalies decreases with increasing sperm output. Aneuploidy is rare in fertile men and is most commonly observed in men with spermatogenic failure, oligozoospermia, or oligoasthenozoospermia. Hormonal testing is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. HPV testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Microbiology testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal.

A study on anti-sperm antibodies in couples with unexplained infertility found a weak correlation with IVF success. Another study showed a strong correlation between anti-sperm antibodies and infertility. Presence of anti-sperm antibodies in females slightly lowered fertilization rates in IVF. High titers of antibodies significantly decreased pregnancy rates. Coeliac disease and thyroid antibodies were also investigated in relation to infertility, with coeliac disease showing a higher risk in patients with infertility. Thyroid antibodies were associated with lower pregnancy rates in infertile patients.

In a study on thyroid dysfunction and auto-immunity in infertility, the percentage of patients with positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies was not significantly different between patients with unexplained infertility and controls. Other auto-immune tests did not provide enough data to draw conclusions. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum is not recommended, but testing for coeliac disease in women with unexplained infertility can be considered. Testing for thyroid antibodies and other autoimmune conditions in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. TSH measurement is considered good practice in pre-conception care, but no additional thyroid evaluation is recommended if TSH is within the normal range. Thrombophilia markers did not show significant differences between patients with unexplained infertility and controls. Testing for thrombophilia in women with unexplained infertility did not show significant associations with lower fertility success rates.

Thrombophilia prevalence is higher in women with unexplained infertility, with prothrombin gene mutation showing a significant difference. Testing for thrombophilia in these women is not recommended due to the small and heterogeneous nature of the studies, as well as the high cost and lack of proven effective treatment. 

Oxidative stress markers, such as DNA fragmentation and ROS, are significantly elevated in males with unexplained infertility compared to fertile controls. These markers negatively correlate with fertilization and embryo quality.

In UI patients, higher levels of ROS were found in semen compared to controls. However, testing for oxidative stress in men with UI should only be considered in research settings. Testing for oxidative stress in women with UI is not recommended. Genetic testing has shown abnormalities in 3% of UI patients. Carriers of the FSHB-211 T-allele had higher serum FSH and LH concentrations. No relationship was found between pregnancy rate and genetic polymorphisms in the PPAR gamma gene or CIAS1. MiRNA expression levels were found to be different in males with UI compared to fertile controls. Chromosomal polymorphisms were found in normozoospermic men with female partners with UI. Genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR did not show significant differences between males with UI and controls.

In a study on normovulatory subfertile women, no significant association between chromosome abnormalities and infertility was found. However, a higher prevalence of chromosome abnormalities was seen in women with secondary infertility compared to primary infertility. Genetic or genomic tests are not recommended for couples with unexplained infertility due to lack of evidence of specific benefit. Vitamin D deficiency and prolactin levels were studied in relation to infertility, but testing for these is not recommended for diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Body weight and dietary status were found to have an impact on infertility outcomes, with lower caloric intake and higher BMI associated with higher rates of infertility.

Analysed in women with UI. Estradiol on the day of hCG was lower in overweight/obese patients <35 years but not in over 35 years. In older women, estradiol, progesterone, and LH were lower in women with greater weight. BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. GPP. Although there is little evidence of a specific association between BMI and UI, reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. The standard advice and medical investigation and interventions apply equally to patients with UI as to any other causes of infertility. Patients generally value advice about lifestyle and healthy alternatives to maximize fertility in the context of their social and cultural environment. While healthy lifestyle intervention may improve spontaneous conception, active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not yet shown a benefit in getting pregnant.

III.0 When to start treatment  
Couples with Unexplained Infertility (UI) can achieve spontaneous pregnancy, but prediction models like the Hunault model are not fully evolved. Prognostic factors like age and duration of infertility are important. Dynamic models for updated estimates of natural conception chances exist but are not widely used. Treatment effectiveness varies based on prognosis, with active treatment more beneficial for older couples with longer infertility duration. Patient preferences should also be considered when deciding on treatment options.

Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023

Expectant management compared to active treatment for patients with UI was evaluated. Timed intercourse without hormonal stimulation was considered part of expectant management. 

Clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse versus expectant management:
- One RCT showed no significant difference in live birth rates between the two treatments.
- Cost-benefit analysis also found no advantage of clomiphene citrate over expectant management.

Letrozole with timed intercourse versus expectant management:
- No relevant studies comparing the two treatments were identified.

Gonadotropins with timed intercourse versus expectant management:
- No relevant studies comparing the treatments were identified.

Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle versus expectant management:
- Live birth rates were not significantly different between IUI and expectant management.

Ovarian stimulation with IUI versus expectant management:
- OS combined with IUI had a higher cumulative live birth rate in couples with poor prognosis.

IVF versus expectant management:
- IVF had a higher live birth rate compared to expectant management.
- Immediate IVF treatment did not significantly differ from waiting a year before starting IVF treatment in terms of live birth rates.

Overall recommendation:
- IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility.

Decision to start active treatment should be based on prognosis.

Justification:
- Evidence suggests IUI with OS is preferred over expectant management, especially for couples with poor prognosis.
- Low-dose regimen for gonadotrophins can reduce multiple pregnancy rate without significantly reducing live birth rate.
- IVF is recommended over expectant management, considering higher efficacy.

Further information:
- Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 6, Annex 7, and Annex 8.

Active treatment for unexplained infertility includes timed intercourse with clomiphene citrate or letrozole, as well as gonadotropins. In a comparison of timed intercourse with clomiphene citrate and letrozole, no significant differences were noted in ongoing pregnancy rates or multiple pregnancy rates. In a comparison of timed intercourse with clomiphene citrate and letrozole to IUI in a natural cycle, IUI resulted in a higher live birth rate. IVF was found to have a higher live birth rate compared to unstimulated IUI, but there was no difference in multiple pregnancy rates. IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility, with caution advised for the use of gonadotropins to avoid multiple pregnancies and OHSS. IVF is not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation, with individualized decision-making based on patient characteristics.

Justification  
IUI with OS is not inferior to IVF in couples with unexplained infertility. IUI in a stimulated cycle for three to six cycles is recommended as the first-line treatment, considering patient characteristics. IVF is as effective as IUI with OS in treatment-naïve patients, but the invasiveness and costs are lower with IUI, making it the preferred option. ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF for couples with unexplained infertility.

Women with fibroids on transvaginal ultrasound were assigned to have the fibroids removed or not. Surgical removal of fibroids did not show a significant improvement in clinical pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates. Hysteroscopy for intrauterine abnormalities not seen on routine imaging is not recommended due to insufficient evidence. Tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media may increase live birth and clinical pregnancy rates. HSG with oil-soluble contrast medium is preferred over water-soluble contrast medium for couples with unexplained infertility. Laparoscopic surgery may improve clinical pregnancy rates in women with minimal to mild endometriosis. Routine laparoscopy is not recommended. Endometrial injury/scratching during timed intercourse did not show a significant difference in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates.

Endometrial scratching has been proposed to increase the probability of pregnancy in couples with unexplained infertility by enhancing endometrial receptivity and facilitating embryo implantation. However, multiple studies have shown no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes when endometrial scratching was performed before intercourse or before intrauterine insemination (IUI). The timing and method of endometrial injury varied among studies, but overall, the evidence does not support the use of endometrial scratching for unexplained infertility.

Antioxidants may not be recommended for women or men with unexplained infertility. 

Acupuncture is probably not recommended for women with unexplained infertility. 

Inositol supplementation is probably not recommended for women with unexplained infertility. 

Psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed. 

Traditional Chinese Medicine and behavioral therapy were not recommended due to limited evidence.

Recommendation: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and behavioral therapy are recommended for couples with unexplained infertility. Although specific associations between diets or exercise regimes and unexplained infertility are not identified, reproductive outcomes are known to be affected by BMI. Lifestyle advice and medical interventions apply equally to patients with unexplained infertility as to other causes of infertility. Lifestyle interventions may improve spontaneous conception, but active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not shown benefits in getting pregnant. Healthcare professionals should be aware that there is likely no difference in quality of life between women with unexplained infertility versus women with known causes of infertility, except in cases of PCOS. Quality of life is probably higher in men from couples with unexplained infertility compared to men from couples with known causes of infertility, except in cases of men with partners with PCOS.

Male infertility is being proposed as a possible biomarker for current and future health. Up to 70% of male idiopathic and unexplained infertility cases remain with no aetiological factor. MAR is routinely used for clinical management of male infertility when no causative factor is identified. A paradigm shift in treatment of male factor infertility becomes essential. Research efforts should focus on addressing gaps in understanding male infertility to develop more personalized therapeutic options. Various research gaps have been identified, including the role of vaginal microbiota in UI, developing predictive models for fertility, and standardized fertility assessment before expectant management in women at risk of age-related infertility. Other gaps include the impact of sperm DNA damage on clinical management and the role of lifestyle intervention. Further research is needed on the relationship between regular menstrual cycles and proof of ovulation, as well as the role of different endometrial biomarkers.

NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health conducted online meetings to develop a guideline on Unexplained Infertility. Literature searches were performed to gather evidence, which was assessed and summarized. Key questions were identified regarding the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of Unexplained Infertility. Recommendations were formulated and labeled as strong or conditional. The guideline draft underwent a review process before being published. Implementation strategies include dissemination through various channels and the development of a patient version of the guideline.

The guideline will be considered for revision in 2027, with an intermediate search for new evidence two years after publication. Corrections will be published on the web version of the document. Stakeholder consultation was conducted, and a list of representatives and reviewers is available on the ESHRE website. No commercial use of the guidelines is authorized.
