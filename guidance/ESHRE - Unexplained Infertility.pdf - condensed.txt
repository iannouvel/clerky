The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) has developed a clinical practice guideline for Unexplained Infertility (UI). UI is a diagnosis made when no abnormalities are identified in the male or female reproductive systems, and it affects approximately 30% of infertile couples. This guideline provides evidence-based information on the optimal diagnostic work-up for infertile couples to establish the diagnosis of UI, and on the optimal therapeutic approach considering live birth rates, safety, patient compliance, and individualization. The guideline aims to assist healthcare professionals and couples in decision making about appropriate and effective management of all cases of UI. The guideline does not guarantee a successful or specific outcome, and healthcare professionals must make their own clinical decisions on a case-by-case basis, using their clinical judgment, knowledge, and expertise.

The guideline addresses unexplained infertility (UI), covering diagnosis, treatment, and the impact on quality of life. The guideline is relevant for general practitioners, gynaecologists, andrologists, infertility specialists, and reproductive surgeons. The patient population includes couples, women, and men experiencing UI. The guideline applies terms and definitions from the international glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. Outcomes of relevance, accuracy, acceptability, reliability, feasibility, value for diagnostic tools, and efficacy, safety, and patient-related outcomes for treatment are focused on. Critical outcomes include live full-term singleton birth, live birth, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancies/multiple births. Important outcomes are clinical symptoms, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness value. Other outcomes include clinical pregnancy rate, adverse pregnancy outcome, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, fetal abnormalities, feasibility, acceptability.

Vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting. Testicular imaging, testing for anti-sperm antibodies in the semen, sperm DNA fragmentation, sperm chromatin condensation test, sperm aneuploidy screening, serum hormonal testing, HPV testing of semen, and microbiology testing of semen are not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum of either males or females with unexplained infertility is not recommended. Testing for coeliac disease in women with unexplained infertility can be considered. Testing for thyroid antibody and other autoimmune conditions in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. TSH measurement is considered good practice in pre-conception care. No additional thyroid evaluation in women is recommended if TSH is within the normal range. Testing for thrombophilia in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with unexplained infertility should only be considered in the context of research. Measurement of oxidative stress in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. Genetic or genomic tests are currently not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility. Testing for vitamin D deficiency in women is not recommended for diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Prolactin testing in women is not recommended. BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation in couples with unexplained infertility. ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF in couples with unexplained infertility. Hysteroscopy for the detection and possible correction of intrauterine abnormalities not seen at routine imaging is not recommended. HSG (i.e., tubal flushing) with an oil-soluble contrast medium is preferable over a water-soluble contrast medium. Endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility. Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to women or males undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended. Acupuncture in women is probably not recommended. Inositol supplementation in women is probably not recommended. Psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed. A healthy diet and regular exercise, supported by behavioural therapy, when necessary, are recommended.

Unexplained Infertility guideline 202 3 13 proposes that females over 40 years old should not be considered for Unexplained Infertility (UI) diagnosis, as the false positive diagnosis of UI increases to 80% after 2 years of regular unprotected intercourse. Male age could also affect fertility potential, but at more extreme ages. 

The guideline suggests that the initial fertility evaluation of the male should include at least one basic semen examination. Results below the lower 5th percentile reference limit should be considered clinically relevant for further investigation. Any abnormalities found in the semen analysis should be repeated. 

According to the ICMART definition of UI, any presence of female factors excludes the diagnosis of unexplained infertility. 

The GDG defines unexplained infertility as infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis, age ≤ 40 years and with adequate coital frequency; and apparently normal testicular function, genito-urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate. 

The GDG recommends routinely taking a medical, reproductive and sexual history from both the male and female partner. The GDG considers a regular menstrual cycle to be 24 to 38 days, up to 8 days in duration and shortest to longest cycle variation of less than 7 to 9 days. 

The GDG recommends at least one basic semen examination, according to WHO criteria, performed by a laboratory which subscribes to an external quality control programme. If the result from the first basic semen analysis is below the lower 5th percentile reference limit as per WHO criteria (6th edition), a second analysis should be performed after a 3-month interval.

The guideline discusses the reliability and convenience of methods to confirm regular ovulation in infertile women with regular menstrual cycles. No relevant studies were found comparing menstrual history or changes in cervical mucus with other methods. 

In a study of 101 women, the accuracy of urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) and serum progesterone tests for predicting ovulation was determined with ultrasound monitoring as a reference. The agreement between ultrasound and urinary LH test was 97%. The accuracy of progesterone measurement on day six with ultrasound as reference was 79%. 

Another study found a high correlation between quantitative and qualitative LH tests. In two other studies, positive test results, presumably reflecting a urinary LH surge above 50 IU/L, were observed in 97-98% of spontaneous cycles. 

The accuracy of basal body temperature (BBT) was compared with ultrasound for the prediction of ovulation. In 67 /101 cycles, the BBT was in agreement with the ultrasound monitoring, resulting in an accuracy of 74%. 

In the relevant papers identified, follicular growth and rupture monitoring by ultrasound was defined as the gold standard. No relevant papers were identified that investigated the accuracy of ultrasound to predict ovulation. 

The overall recommendation is that in women with regular menstrual cycles, tests for confirmation of ovulation are not routinely recommended. If confirmation of ovulation is warranted, tests such as urinary LH measurements, ultrasound monitoring or mid-luteal progesterone measurement can be used.

The guideline discusses the reliability of parameters detecting good oocyte/corpus luteum quality. A cohort study found that the lowest progesterone threshold for conception cycles was 8.5 ng/ml. However, it is suggested not to routinely measure midluteal serum progesterone levels in women with regular menstrual cycles due to lack of conclusive evidence. 

In terms of endometrial biopsy, an RCT and a cohort study showed no significant difference between fertile and infertile women in terms of endometrial maturation. Hence, endometrial biopsy for histological examination is not recommended in the absence of other indications. 

There were no relevant papers investigating the reliability of fertilization failure or euploid embryo rate to determine good oocyte or corpus luteum quality. 

The guideline also discusses the use of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) in the diagnostic work-up of ovarian reserve. A cohort study found lower AMH levels significantly associated with unexplained infertility (UI), but antral follicle count (AFC) was not associated with UI. Another cohort study found that women with low AMH values had a similar predicted probability of conceiving as women with normal values.

In several studies, Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) or Antral Follicle Count (AFC) showed no predictive value for time to ongoing pregnancy or natural conception. Similar AMH levels and AFC were reported in infertile couples and women with no history of infertility. In a small cohort study, serum AMH and FSH levels, as well as AFC were similar between women who achieved a spontaneous pregnancy and those who did not. AMH alone was a poor predictor of live birth. AMH level was not a significant predictor of natural conception in a retrospective study, but its addition to the Hunault model improved the model's accuracy. AFC was not predictive of spontaneous pregnancy. Women with Unexplained Infertility (UI) had lower AFC than those with male factor infertility, but AFC was not significantly associated with UI. Women aged between 25 and 40 years in the UI group had significantly lower AFC than similarly aged women in the community group. No difference was found in cumulative probability of conception for women with FSH>10 IU/L.

112 women with male factor infertility and those with unexplained infertility (UI) had similar FSH, estradiol levels, ovarian volume, and inhibin B levels. A study found 52% of women with UI had an abnormal Clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT), and these women were less likely to conceive. Another study found no association between inhibin B levels and the probability of conception. Inhibin B alone was a poor predictor of live birth over 5 years. 

The guideline recommends that in women with regular menstrual cycles, ovarian reserve testing is not required to identify the cause of infertility or to predict the probability of spontaneous conception over 6 to 12 months. Studies show that ovarian reserve status is not predictive of spontaneous conception over 6-12 months. Ovarian reserve testing would only be relevant for management if it determined the probability of pregnancy with expectant management, OS-IUI, or IVF. However, current studies do not suggest this is the case. 

While women with decreased ovarian reserve have lower pregnancy/live birth rate per cycle with IVF, it is questionable to divert women with low ovarian reserve directly or rapidly to IVF.

The clinical guideline discusses the accuracy of Hystero Salpingo-Contrast-Sonography (HyCoSy/HyFoSy) versus laparoscopy and chromopertubation for diagnosing tubal pathology in subfertile patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 1977 patients found that for 2D-HyCoSy, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively. For 3D/4D-HyCoSy, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.89, respectively. Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 1553 patients found that the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for 3D- and 4D-HyCoSy were 0.92 and 0.92, respectively. The unadjusted pooled accuracy of HyCoSy showed a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.83.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies with 4521 women investigated the sensitivity and specificity of hysterosalpingography (HSG) in diagnosing tubal pathology. The sensitivity of HSG for any tubal pathology ranged between 46% and 100% and specificity between 73% and 100%. The pooled accuracy of HSG showed a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.78. After imputation of missing laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.53 and 0.87 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. In women with a low-risk clinical history, the sensitivity of HSG for detecting unilateral tubal pathology was 38% versus 61% in women with a high-risk history. For bilateral tubal pathology, sensitivity ranged between 0% and 100% and specificity between 87% and 97%. Pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 0.66 and 0.91, respectively. After imputation of laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.46 and 0.95. An additional 18 studies showed high sensitivity and specificity for HSG, with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively.

The clinical guideline suggests that Hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are valid tests for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. The selection between HSG and HyCoSy depends on the preference of the clinician and the patient. High risk for tubal occlusion includes past chlamydia infection, PID, peritonitis, known endometriosis and/or pelvic surgery. HyCoSy is a valid test for tubal patency with high specificity and sensitivity. HSG is also a valid test for tubal patency and is less costly and harmful than laparoscopy. HyCoSy is less harmful than laparoscopy or HSG as it does not require general anaesthesia or exposure to radiation. Chlamydia antibody testing for tubal patency could be considered a non-invasive test to differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. In patients at high-risk for tubal abnormality, visual demonstration of tubal patency is necessary.

Chlamydia antibody testing (CAT) has a role in clinical practice, particularly in high-risk patients for tubal occlusion. The test's validity varies according to the assay used. A discrepancy was found in 21% of patients between MIF and ELISA assays for IgG. CAT does not allow evaluation of the degree of occlusion or occlusions due to other infections than CT. A negative result combined with a low-risk medical history may be considered specific for tubal patency. Both a positive and a negative test combined with a high-risk medical history should be confirmed with visual methods like HyCoSy, HSG or laparoscopy. Tubal pathology was reported in 84.3% of patients with a high-risk medical history. Newer antibodies and more specific CAT have emerged with improved performance, but limitations with sensitivity still remain.

The clinical guideline cites numerous studies on the evaluation of tubal patency and infertility. These studies focus on the effectiveness of hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy), hysterosalpingography, diagnostic laparoscopy, and various serological tests, including Chlamydia IgG ELISA antibody testing. The studies also discuss the role of medical history in predicting tubal factor infertility. Some studies highlight the limitations and potential misdiagnosis in these methods. The guideline also refers to research on the persistence of Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies and their correlation with self-reported infection and behavioural risks. Studies comparing different methods are also discussed, such as HyCoSy vs radiographic hysterosalpingography, and the accuracy of hysterosalpingography vs laparoscopy.

This text discusses the diagnostic procedures for confirming normal uterine structure/anatomy and uterine wall/myometrium in cases of unexplained infertility. Evidence from various studies suggests that 3D ultrasound (US) is significantly better than both initial and expert 2D-US in diagnosing uterine anomalies. The accuracy of 3D-US was found to be 97.1% versus 51.4% for initial 2D-US and 82.9% for expert 2D-US. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of real-time 3D-US were significantly higher compared to 2D-US. Therefore, the recommendation is to use ultrasound, preferably 3D, to exclude uterine anomalies in women with unexplained infertility. Despite 2D-US being a valid diagnostic tool, 3D-US showed superior results and costs per scan are the same.

The guideline states that MRI is not recommended as a first-line test to confirm a normal uterine structure and anatomy in women with unexplained infertility due to lack of evidence for its usefulness, its cost, and the time it takes. In terms of confirming an anatomically normal uterine cavity, the guideline suggests that if ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity is normal, no further evaluation is needed. This is justified by the fact that additional uterine findings in subsequent hysteroscopy or HyCoSy procedures in women with normal ultrasonography findings were mostly polyps or a septum, which likely will not have a major effect on pregnancy outcomes, especially if they are asymptomatic.

The clinical guideline discusses the role of laparoscopy and post-coital test (PCT) in diagnosing unexplained infertility (UI). Evidence from several studies suggests that laparoscopy may not be necessary in women with normal hysterosalpingogram (HSG) or suspected unilateral tubal pathology on HSG, as it did not change the original treatment plan in the majority of patients. Therefore, routine diagnostic laparoscopy is not recommended for diagnosing UI. However, laparoscopy may be reserved for women with an abnormal HSG or those at risk for tubo-peritoneal disease.

Regarding PCT, the predictive values of normal and abnormal PCT varied widely in different studies. Some studies reported similar pregnancy rates with or without PCT. Other studies found higher pregnancy rates after a positive PCT compared to a negative test. The guideline does not make a clear recommendation about the use of PCT in diagnosing UI.

In a retrospective analysis of 207 couples, it was found that in couples with less than 3 years of infertility and positive PCT, 68% conceived within 2 years compared with 17% of those with negative result. After 3 years of infertility, corresponding rates were 14% and 11%. However, the post-coital test is not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility as it has poor discriminating capacity and does not change further management.

Various studies have been conducted to compare vaginal and gut microbiota between women with unexplained infertility and fertile controls. Differences have been observed in the abundance of certain bacteria and the biodiversity of species. However, vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting as there is currently insufficient evidence of a role of abnormal vaginal microbiota in unexplained infertility and no evidence suggesting that correcting abnormal vaginal microbiota improves fertility outcomes.

The guideline discusses the need for additional diagnostic procedures in men with unexplained infertility (UI). Evidence shows that testicular volume is linked with sperm concentration and total sperm count. Testicular inhomogeneity and parenchymal calcification were associated with lower sperm vitality and concentration. Intratesticular artery peak systolic velocity and epididymal mean head size were positively associated with sperm normal morphology. Vas deferens mean size was positively associated with progressive motility. However, testicular imaging is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. 

The guideline also addresses the added value of additional tests in men with normal WHO semen analysis. The guideline development group (GDG) acknowledges that UI is a diagnosis by exclusion and supports the need for robust standardised methods for establishing etiological diagnosis in the male partner. The guideline also discusses the impact of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) on infertility. Evidence suggests that ASA is found more in the infertile group compared to controls. ASA-positive men showed decreased acrosome reaction, increased DNA fragmentation, and higher reactive oxygen species. Pregnancy rates were not significantly different between couples with ASA positive males and couples without ASA.

A study found higher pregnancy rates in couples with <50% sperm antibody bound compared to those with >50% sperm antibody bound. However, testing for anti-sperm antibodies is not recommended when semen analysis is normal due to insufficient evidence of its benefits. 

Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) assays have different capacities to measure sperm DNA damage. Studies found higher live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates in groups with low SDF. However, testing for SDF is not recommended when semen analysis is normal as the methodology and cut-offs are not standardized worldwide, and the clinical relevance for performing SDF test in couples with unexplained infertility (UI) is questionable.

No studies were identified to answer the question about sperm chromatin condensation test and sperm aneuploidy screening. Therefore, these tests are not recommended when semen analysis is normal.

The number of genes linked with seminal phenotypes and male infertility is constantly expanding. The risk of men being carriers of genetic anomalies decreases with increasing sperm output. Abnormal levels of aneuploid sperm are most commonly observed in men with spermatogenic failure, oligozoospermia or oligoasthenozoospermia, and among normozoospermic men who are partners in couples with recurrent pregnancy loss. Aneuploidy is not indicated for routine testing in men with normal semen parameters. 

Hormonal testing is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. In cases of abnormal sperm parameters, potential hypogonadism is ruled out by reproductive hormone testing. No evidence supports endocrine testing as a first line of investigation for males with unexplained infertility (UI) and normal semen examination results. 

HPV testing of semen is not recommended when conventional semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. HPV is a transient infection which most often clears spontaneously. The effects of semen HPV infection on reproductive outcomes makes it impossible to recommend routine screening of HPV in a diagnostic setting in assisted reproduction. 

Microbiology testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. Excessive numbers of leukocytes in the ejaculate may be associated with infection and poor sperm quality. In the case of a normal physical examination and in the absence of symptoms associated with genitourinary tract infection, further microbiological culture of the semen is not usually warranted.

Depuydt CE et al. highlighted that infectious human papillomavirus virions in semen reduce clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing intrauterine insemination. Eshre Guideline Group on Viral infection/disease emphasised the need for medically assisted reproduction in patients with a viral infection/disease. Ferlin A et al. suggested a pharmacogenetic approach to male infertility, focusing on polymorphism of follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit promoter. Grigorova M et al. found that genetically determined dosage of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) affects male reproductive parameters. Houston BJ et al. reviewed the validated monogenic causes of human male infertility. Luttmer R et al. found a relationship between the presence of human papillomavirus in semen and semen quality. Minhas S et al. provided an update on Male Infertility in the European Association of Urology Guidelines on Male Sexual and Reproductive Health. Ramasamy R et al. found increased sperm aneuploidy in men with recurrent pregnancy loss using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Repalle D et al. found that sperm DNA fragmentation negatively influences the cumulative live birth rate in intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles of couples with unexplained infertility. Schlegel PN et al. provided a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men. Schubert M et al. focused on the pharmacogenetics of FSH action in the male and also detected a genomic region determining follicle-stimulating hormone levels in a GWAS in Idiopathic/Unexplained Infertile Men.

A systematic review and meta-analysis found that sperm DNA damage impacts in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcome. Sperm chromatin damage has been shown to impair human fertility. The sperm DNA fragmentation test can predict intra-uterine insemination outcome. The -29G/A FSH receptor gene polymorphism is associated with higher FSH and LH levels in normozoospermic men. The FSHB gene -211G/T polymorphism impacts male gonadal function. Sperm DNA fragmentation is associated with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss. Sperm chromatin anomalies influence assisted reproductive technology outcome. The variants FSHB -211G>T and FSHR 2039A>G combined affect male reproductive parameters. 

Additional tests for systemic conditions should be considered for unexplained infertility (UI). Serum anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) have been associated with UI. The presence of ASA in the female can affect pregnancy rates after IVF. The risk of coeliac disease in UI was found to be significant. Anti-thyroid antibodies can affect IVF outcome.

A cross-sectional study found no significant difference in thyroid peroxidase-antibodies between patients with unexplained infertility (UI) and controls. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies, thyroid antibody, and other autoimmune conditions in patients with UI is not recommended. Testing for coeliac disease in women with UI can be considered. The benefits of testing for coeliac disease may be considerable depending on the test used. 

In studies investigating the role of thyroid hormones in UI, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 were found to be slightly higher in women with UI than controls. However, no additional thyroid evaluation in women is recommended if TSH is within the normal range. 

In studies investigating the role of thrombophilia in UI, no significant differences were detected between UI and controls for any of the isolated or combined thrombophilia markers. The presence of thrombophilia was not significantly associated with lower fertility success rate. In fact, women who had activated protein C resistance and/or factor V Leiden or had antiphospholipid antibodies had significantly higher live birth rates in comparison to women who were tested negative.

A higher prevalence of thrombophilia and prothrombin gene mutation was found in women with unexplained infertility (UI) compared to controls. However, the presence of Factor V Leiden (FVL) and anticoagulant protein deficiencies was not significantly higher. In other studies, the only gene to show a significant difference between women with UI and controls was MTHFR C677T. In another study, significantly more mutations in FVL were found in the UI group compared to controls, but no significant differences were found in MTHFR or FII mutations. A significant difference in PAI-1 4G-675 allele frequency was found between UI and fertile controls. Despite these findings, testing for thrombophilia in women with UI is not recommended due to the small size and heterogeneity of the studies, high cost, and lack of proof of effective treatment.

Several studies found a significantly higher level of oxidative stress in males with UI compared to fertile controls, including higher DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and lipid peroxidation. However, no significant differences were found in isolated ROS or total antioxidant capacity between the UI group and controls in one study. Despite the high ROS levels, the ROS-TAC score was significantly lower in the UI group.

Levels were found in semen of UI patients compared to controls. In a case-control study, DNA damage and oxidative stress were measured in semen of 30 males with UI and 20 fertile donors. No significant differences were found. In another study, metabolomic analysis was performed on the urine of 71 UI and 47 fertile males, with significant differences found between the two groups. 

In women, oxidative stress markers were evaluated in the serum and follicular fluid of 31 women with UI and compared to 40 women with male factor infertility. Significant differences were found. In another study, the association between oxidant status and infertility and outcomes after ICSI was investigated. TOS and OSI in follicular fluid of the UI patients were statistically higher than the control group. 

In a case-control study, the role of SOD 2 and nitric oxide synthase polymorphisms in UI was evaluated. A significant difference was noted only for the eNOS gene. Homozygosity for the 894G-eNOS allele was associated with a significant increased risk of infertility. 

Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with unexplained infertility should only be considered in the context of research. Measurement of oxidative stress in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. 

In genetic tests, abnormalities were found in 3% of patients with UI, compared with 2.2% for ART failure and 1.6% for recurrent miscarriage. Genetic polymorphisms in the FSHB gene were evaluated in females with UI and healthy women. Carriers of the FSHB-211 T-allele had significantly higher serum FSH and LH concentrations. This allele was enriched among infertility patients. No relationship was found between pregnancy rate and the studied polymorphisms in the PPAR gamma gene.

A study of 1206 normovulatory subfertile women found no association between chromosome abnormalities and infertility. However, a higher prevalence of chromosome abnormalities was observed in women with secondary infertility compared to those with primary infertility. Another study found more micronucleated cells in infertile couples. Current guidelines do not recommend genetic or genomic tests in couples with unexplained infertility due to the lack of specific benefit and high cost.

Studies have shown varying results regarding the association of vitamin D levels and infertility. Some found lower vitamin D levels in infertile men and women, while others found no significant difference in vitamin D levels between infertile and fertile groups. Current guidelines do not recommend testing for vitamin D deficiency for the diagnosis of unexplained infertility.

Several studies investigated the association between prolactin and unexplained infertility, with mixed results. Some found higher prolactin levels in women with unexplained infertility, while others found no significant difference. Current guidelines do not recommend prolactin testing in women.

Studies have shown a significant difference in caloric intake between women with unexplained infertility and controls, with the former having a lower intake of carbohydrates and vitamins and a higher intake of fats. Also, a significantly higher live birth rate per cycle was found in women with normal weight and slight overweight compared to those with a BMI ≥27 kg/m².

In women with unexplained infertility (UI), estradiol was found to be lower on the day of hCG in overweight/obese patients under 35 years, but not in those over 35 years. In older women, estradiol, progesterone, and LH were lower in those with greater weight. BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. Although there is little specific evidence linking BMI and UI, reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. The standard advice and medical investigation and interventions apply equally to patients with UI as to any other causes of infertility. Healthy lifestyle intervention may improve spontaneous conception, but active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not yet shown a benefit in getting pregnant.

Metabolic patterns are related to female infertility and in vitro fertilization outcomes. Factors such as subfertility cause, smoking, and body weight affect the success rate of IVF. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Brazilian women of reproductive age. Autoantibodies in premature menopause and unexplained infertility are more frequent than in the general population. Different types of antibodies influence in vitro fertilization results. Oxidative stress markers are associated with unexplained male infertility. Antisperm antibodies in infertile human couples influence sperm-cervical mucus interactions and subsequent fertility. Thrombophilic SNPs are related to unexplained infertility. Nutrition imbalances may be responsible for a portion of unexplained infertility. Increased lipid peroxidation and abnormal fatty acid profiles are found in normozoospermic males from infertile couples. Higher TSH levels within the normal range are associated with unexplained infertility. Anti-endometrial autoantibodies are present in women with a diagnosis of infertility. Changes of sFas and sFasL, oxidative stress markers are found in serum and follicular fluid of patients undergoing IVF. Thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity are found in infertile women. Predictive serum markers for unexplained infertility in child-bearing aged women have been identified. Altered thyroid hormones and oxidative stress play a role in unexplained infertility. Vitamin D levels influence IVF outcomes. FSHB-211 G>T is a major genetic modulator of reproductive physiology and health in childbearing age women. Polymorphisms in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ gene may improve fertilization in IVF. Spermatozoa from normozoospermic fertile and infertile individuals convey a distinct miRNA cargo. Increased sperm DNA damage in relation to seminal oxidative stress is found in men with idiopathic and male factor infertility. Oxidant status plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of unexplained infertility and intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer success.

Couples with Unexplained Infertility (UI) can still achieve spontaneous pregnancy. Models, such as the Hunault model, have been developed to predict the chance of spontaneous pregnancy, using prognostic factors such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment and previous pregnancy. However, these models are not fully evolved and have only been validated for specific populations. Dynamic models have been developed to provide updated estimates of natural conception over 6 - 12 months, but these are not commonly used as they have not been validated in other settings or implemented in clinical practice. The effectiveness of treatment varies, with younger women with short duration of infertility having a high prognostic index and small added benefit from active treatment. As the duration of infertility increases and age advances, the prognostic index decreases and the benefit of active treatment increases. Prognostic models can assist in decision-making for treatment plans in couples with unexplained infertility, but patient preferences should also be considered.

This clinical guideline discusses the value of expectant management versus active treatment for patients with unexplained infertility (UI). The guideline does not include timed intercourse without hormonal stimulation as part of active treatment. 

Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing expectant management with various active treatments are presented. These include clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse, letrozole with timed intercourse, gonadotropins with timed intercourse, intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle, ovarian stimulation with IUI, and in-vitro fertilization (IVF). 

The evidence shows that there is no significant benefit of clomiphene citrate over expectant management. No studies were identified comparing letrozole or gonadotropins with expectant management. IUI in a natural cycle also showed no significant difference in live birth rate compared to expectant management. However, IUI with ovarian stimulation showed a significantly higher live birth rate, particularly in couples with poor prognosis. 

IVF also showed a higher live birth rate than expectant management, but the evidence is of low quality and insufficient. A retrospective cohort study showed no significant difference in live birth rate between immediate IVF treatment and waiting for about a year.

The guideline recommends IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. The decision to start active treatment should be based on prognosis. IVF is recommended over expectant management, but this decision should be based on patient characteristics and preferences.

The clinical guideline for unexplained infertility (UI) explores various active treatment methods. In randomized control trials (RCTs), clomiphene citrate (CC) and timed intercourse were compared to letrozole. No significant differences were found in ongoing pregnancy rates, but the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher with letrozole. No relevant studies were found comparing timed intercourse with letrozole or gonadotropins to ovarian stimulation (OS) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) in couples with UI. 

In a 3-arm RCT, treatment with IUI resulted in a higher live birth rate compared to CC with timed intercourse. In another RCT, conception rates were not statistically different between timed intercourse and IUI. A systematic review and meta-analysis found uncertain results comparing OS with timed intercourse to OS and IUI.

A systematic review and meta-analysis found a higher live birth rate with OS and IUI compared to IUI in a natural cycle. Another systematic review and meta-analysis found a higher live birth rate with in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to unstimulated IUI. No significant difference was found for multiple pregnancy rate.

The overall recommendation is for IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with UI. IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation in couples with UI. The decision to use IVF should be individualized based on patient characteristics such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment, and previous pregnancy.

There's a lack of high-quality RCTs on unexplained infertility. Clomiphene, letrozole, gonadotrophins and IUI alone are not effective compared to expectant management or IUI in a natural cycle. IUI in combination with OS is not inferior to IVF. Considering the additional costs and risks of IVF, IUI in a stimulated cycle for three to six cycles is recommended as the first-line treatment. The decision to use IVF is individualized based on factors such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatments and previous pregnancy. 

An RCT compared IVF with ICSI in couples with unexplained infertility and found no differences in live birth rates. Given the comparable live birth rates and additional costs associated with ICSI, it is not recommended over conventional IVF for unexplained infertility. 

In a study of mechanical-surgical procedures, an RCT found that in the microhysteroscopy group, when uterine abnormalities were detected and treated, the ongoing pregnancy rate and clinical pregnancy rate were significantly higher compared to the group without microhysteroscopy.

Surgical removal of fibroids in women with unexplained infertility showed uncertain improvement in clinical pregnancy rates and insufficient evidence to show a benefit on miscarriage rates. Hysteroscopic surgery is not recommended for the detection and correction of intrauterine abnormalities not seen at routine imaging due to insufficient evidence. No recommendation can be made for the treatment of uterine fibroids in these women due to insufficient evidence. 

Tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media (OSCM) may increase the odds of live birth and clinical pregnancy, while it is uncertain if flushing with water-soluble contrast media (WSCM) has the same effect. OSCM is preferable over WSCM for tubal flushing. 

Minimal to mild endometriosis found incidentally at laparoscopy is not considered unexplained infertility. Laparoscopic surgery in women with minimal or mild endometriosis showed an improvement in clinical pregnancy rate. 

Endometrial injury/scratching during timed intercourse showed no difference in the outcomes of live birth or ongoing pregnancy.

An RCT with 234 women with Unexplained Infertility (UI) undergoing timed intercourse with Ovarian Stimulation (OS) showed a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate in women receiving endometrial scratch (17/114 (14.9%) vs. 6/103 (5.8%)) with no significant difference in miscarriage rate. 

Several RCTs were conducted with women suffering from infertility of unknown cause undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) with OS. In these studies, there was no statistical difference in ongoing pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate between women undergoing endometrial scratch or not. 

In one RCT with 154 women with UI, the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in women receiving endometrial injury compared to controls (30/77 (39%) vs. 14/77 (18.2%)). There was no statistical difference in multiple pregnancy rate or abortion rate. 

The guideline recommends that endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility. Despite the low-cost and easy procedure, the evidence does not show better pregnancy outcome if scratching was performed before intercourse or before IUI in couples with UI.

The Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023 discusses alternative therapeutic approaches for unexplained infertility. The effectiveness of antioxidants, acupuncture, nutraceuticals (inositol), psychotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy were discussed.

Antioxidants: A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing oral antioxidant treatment with placebo in couples with unexplained infertility reported similar live birth rates in both groups. The recommendation is that adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to women and men undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended due to low-quality evidence.

Acupuncture: One RCT investigated the effect of acupuncture sessions before and after embryo transfer during IVF in women with unexplained infertility. The live birth rate was significantly higher in the acupuncture group vs. controls. However, the evidence on acupuncture in unexplained infertility is very limited and of low quality, therefore, acupuncture is probably not recommended.

Inositol: One RCT compared adjuvant treatment with myo-inositol suppositories during timed intercourse cycles with placebo. Pregnancy rates were higher in the myo-inositol group compared to the control group. However, inositol supplementation in women is probably not recommended due to lack of convincing evidence.

Psychotherapy: No relevant studies were identified investigating the effect of psychotherapy in couples with unexplained infertility. However, psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed.

Traditional Chinese Medicine: Most literature was in Chinese language, and only publications in English were considered for this guideline. One uncontrolled study identified, where Onkyeong-tang and herbal medicine for ovulation and implantation were administered to women with unexplained infertility. After treatment, the women were followed for 3 menstrual cycles of observation. Live birth rate was 7.8% and 37% of women experienced adverse events, but none were serious.

Diet, Exercise, Behavioral Therapy: Behavioral therapy is a form of therapy that treats mental health disorders by identifying and helping to change potentially self-destructive or unhealthy behaviors.

No relevant studies were identified investigating the effect of diet, exercise or behavioural therapy in couples with unexplained infertility (UI). However, a healthy diet and regular exercise, supported by behavioural therapy when necessary, are recommended. Reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. 

In terms of quality of life (QoL), there is probably no difference between women with unexplained infertility versus women in couples with known causes of infertility, except when the cause of infertility is PCOS, where the QoL is lower. QoL is probably higher in men from a couple with unexplained infertility compared to men from a couple with known causes of infertility except when the cause of infertility is men with a partner with PCOS, then the men from a couple with unexplained infertility have a lower QoL.

Baris Ata received speakers fees from Merck, Gedeon Richter, Organon and Intas Pharma and is part of the advisory board of Organon Turkey. Siladitya Bhattacharya is an editor and author for Cambridge University Press and received speakers fees from various organizations. Ernesto Bosch received research grants and consulting fees from various companies. Samuel Dos Santos-Ribeiro received research grants, consulting fees, speakers fees and gifts from various companies. Mina Mincheva received consulting fees from Mojo Fertility Ltd.

Terhi Piltonen received research grants, speakers fees and is part of various associations. Sesh Sunkara received speakers fees from various companies. Harold Verhoeve received consulting fees from Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

The GDG has also made recommendations for future research on Unexplained Infertility. The top three priorities identified are: developing, testing, and validating a predictive model to compare outcomes of different management strategies; determining the optimal ART for Unexplained Infertility; and assessing the value of current methods to evaluate sperm DNA integrity in predicting clinical outcomes. The GDG also emphasizes the importance of research on male infertility due to a reported decline in sperm quality over the past 50 years.

A potential biomarker for health is being proposed. However, no aetiological factor is found in up to 70% of male idiopathic and unexplained infertility cases. MAR is used for clinical management of male infertility when no causative factor is identified. The lack of strong evidence-supported treatment options puts a disproportionate burden on the female partner. A paradigm shift in treatment of male factor infertility is essential. Research should focus on addressing gaps in the understanding of male infertility, such as identifying new aetiological causes, clinical diagnostics, and MAR treatment options. This will enable the development of more personalised therapeutic options to manage couple’s infertility and improve reproductive outcomes. 

Research gaps identified include: 
- The role of vaginal microbiota in UI 
- Development of a predictive model for fertility based on ovarian reserve tests 
- The impact of standardized fertility assessment before attempting expectant management in women at risk of age-related infertility 
- The causes of UI
- The relationship between luteal progesterone levels and spontaneous pregnancy
- The impact of sperm DNA damage on the clinical management of couples with UI
- The value of new and existing sperm function tests for prognosis or allocation to treatment
- The role of lifestyle intervention
- The impact of hysteroscopic removal of an endometrial polyp in women with otherwise unexplained infertility
- Prevention of age-related infertility
- The role of different endometrial biomarkers
- The role of oxidative stress markers in semen in couples with UI
- The impact of hysteroscopic resection in women with a uterine septum and otherwise unexplained infertility
- The role of oxidative stress biomarkers in endometrial implantation
- The relationship between regular menstrual cycles and proof of ovulation
- The impact of removal of mild intrauterine adhesions in women with otherwise unexplained infertility.

The guideline development group (GDG) for the NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health developed a guideline for unexplained infertility. The process included online meetings to discuss key questions, literature searches in PUBMED/MEDLINE and the Cochrane library, and assessment of the quality of selected papers. The GDG formulated a list of 21 key questions related to the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life aspects of unexplained infertility. Recommendations were labeled as either strong or conditional according to the GRADE approach. The guideline draft was reviewed and published on the ESHRE website. The implementation strategy includes publishing the guideline on the ESHRE website, announcements, and the development of a patient version of the guideline.

The current guideline will be considered for revision in 2027, with an intermediate search for new evidence performed two years after publication. Corrections to the guideline will be published on the ESHRE website. The guideline draft was open for review for 6 weeks, between 12 December 2022 and 30 January 2023. Reviewers, their comments, and the replies of the guideline development group are summarized in the review report on the ESHRE website. The list of representatives of professional organizations and individual experts who provided comments to the guideline are also summarized.
