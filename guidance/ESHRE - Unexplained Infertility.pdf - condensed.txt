The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) has developed a clinical guideline for Unexplained Infertility (UI). The guideline provides clinical recommendations to improve healthcare delivery in human reproduction and embryology. The aim of the guideline is to aid healthcare professionals in making clinical decisions about appropriate and effective care for their patients. The guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome, nor does it establish a standard of care. Healthcare professionals must make their own clinical decisions on a case-by-case basis, using their clinical judgment, knowledge, and expertise, and considering the condition, circumstances, and wishes of the individual patient. 

The guideline addresses both the diagnosis and the therapeutic management of couples with UI. It provides clinicians with evidence-based information on the optimal diagnostic work-up for infertile couples to correctly establish the diagnosis of UI. It also provides clinicians with evidence-based information on the optimal therapeutic approach considering issues like live birth rates, safety, patient compliance, and individualization. The guideline acknowledges that each medical decision needs to consider individual characteristics, preferences, beliefs and values, and that all recommendations need to be contextualized based on different socio-geographical areas.

This clinical guideline addresses pre-conception care, diagnosis/treatment of infertility, and interventions to improve pregnancy and child-health outcomes. The guideline consists of four chapters covering the definition of Unexplained Infertility (UI), diagnostic tests, treatment, and quality of life comparisons. It is intended for general practitioners, gynaecologists, andrologists, infertility specialists, and reproductive surgeons. The guideline focuses on couples with UI but acknowledges the experiences of single women, same-sex couples, and transgender individuals. 

The guideline applies the terms and definitions from the international glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, including the term medically assisted reproduction (MAR). It focuses on the outcomes of diagnostic tools and treatment efficacy, safety, and patient-related outcomes. 

The critical outcomes are live full-term singleton birth, live birth, ongoing pregnancy rate, and multiple pregnancies/multiple births. The important outcomes are clinical symptoms, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness value. Other outcomes include clinical pregnancy rate, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and acceptability. 

The guideline also provides a list of recommendations for the diagnosis, including confirmation of ovulation, oocyte/corpus luteum quality, ovarian reserve, tubal factor, uterine factor, and cervical/vaginal factor.

Vaginal microbiota testing should be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting. Testicular imaging, anti-sperm antibodies testing, sperm DNA fragmentation, sperm chromatin condensation test, sperm aneuploidy screening, serum hormonal testing, HPV testing, and microbiology testing of semen are not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum, thyroid antibody and other autoimmune conditions, thrombophilia, oxidative stress in women, genetic or genomic tests, vitamin D deficiency, and prolactin are not recommended in unexplained infertility. TSH measurement and BMI evaluation are considered good practice in pre-conception care. Testing for coeliac disease in women with unexplained infertility can be considered. 

Intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. The decision to start active treatment should be based on prognosis. In Vitro Fertilization is probably not recommended over IUI. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is not recommended over conventional IVF. Hysteroscopy for the detection and correction of intrauterine abnormalities and endometrial scratching should not be offered. Tubal flushing with an oil-soluble contrast medium is preferable over a water-soluble contrast medium. 

Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy, acupuncture, and inositol supplementation are probably not recommended. Psychological support, a healthy diet, and regular exercise are recommended. The quality of life is probably no different between women with unexplained infertility versus women with known causes of infertility, except when the cause is PCOS, where the quality of life is lower.

The Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023 discusses the role of age and mild infertility factors in defining unexplained infertility (UI). From the analysis of 237 studies, it was found that the age of the female partner can affect the diagnosis of UI, with a suggested upper limit of 40 years old. After 2 years of regular unprotected intercourse, the false positive diagnosis of UI is 10% in women under 35 years of age, and increases to 80% in women over 40 years of age. Male age could also affect fertility potential at more extreme ages. 

The guideline also discusses the importance of initial fertility evaluation of the male, including at least one basic semen examination and a reproductive and medical history. Results from a basic semen examination below the lower 5th percentile reference limit should be considered as clinically relevant for decision-making about further clinical investigation. Anything outside this reference excludes unexplained infertility. 

The guideline defines unexplained infertility as infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis, age ≤ 40 years and with adequate coital frequency; and apparently normal testicular function, genito-urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate. 

The guideline recommends at least one basic semen examination, according to WHO criteria, performed by a laboratory which subscribes to an external quality control programme. If the result from the first basic semen analysis is below the lower 5th percentile reference limit as per WHO criteria, a second analysis should be performed after a 3-month interval.

The guideline discusses the reliability and convenience of methods to confirm regular ovulation in infertile women. No relevant studies were found that compare menstrual history or changes in cervical mucus with other methods for predicting/confirming ovulation. 

A study found that the accuracy of urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) and serum progesterone tests for predicting/confirming ovulation were determined with ultrasound monitoring as a reference. The agreement between ultrasound and urinary LH test was 97%. The accuracy of progesterone measurement on day six with ultrasound as a reference was 79%.

In another study, the accuracy of urinary LH tests was compared with ultrasound for the prediction/confirmation of ovulation. The LH test was in agreement with the ultrasound monitoring in 97% of cycles. 

The accuracy of basal body temperature (BBT) was compared with ultrasound for the prediction/confirmation of ovulation in another study. The BBT was in agreement with the ultrasound monitoring in 67% of cycles.

In the relevant papers identified, follicular growth and rupture monitoring by ultrasound was defined as the gold standard. 

The overall recommendation suggests that in women with regular menstrual cycles, tests for confirmation of ovulation are not routinely recommended. If confirmation of ovulation is warranted, tests such as urinary LH measurements, ultrasound monitoring or mid-luteal progesterone measurement can be used. The documentation of an ovulation episode in one specific menstrual cycle is not a surrogate marker of regular ovulation.

The clinical guideline discusses the reliability of parameters for detecting good oocyte/corpus luteum quality. A cohort study showed that the lowest progesterone threshold for conception cycles was 8.5 ng/ml. However, it is suggested not to routinely measure midluteal serum progesterone levels in women with regular menstrual cycles due to a lack of evidence showing an increase in live birth rates with exogenous progesterone administration. 

Endometrial biopsy for histological examination is not recommended in the absence of other indications, as studies show that endometrial dating does not discriminate between fertile and infertile women.

No studies were found investigating the reliability of fertilization failure or euploid embryo rate to determine good oocyte or corpus luteum quality. 

In terms of ovarian reserve, a cohort study suggested lower anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels being significantly associated with unexplained infertility (UI), but antral follicle count (AFC) was not found to be associated with UI. Another study showed that women with low AMH values had a similar predicted probability of conceiving compared with women with normal values.

In multiple studies, AMH, FSH, and AFC showed no predictive value for time to ongoing pregnancy or natural conception. AMH levels and AFC were similar in infertile couples and those without a history of infertility. AMH alone was a poor predictor of live birth. In a study with women aged 20-35, those with low AMH had similar fecundability to those with medium levels, while those with high AMH had lower fecundability. In another study, AFC was not predictive of spontaneous pregnancy. In a cohort study, there was no difference in cumulative probability of conception for women with FSH>10 IU/L.

In studies involving women with unexplained infertility (UI) and male factor infertility, similar FSH, estradiol levels, ovarian volume, and inhibin B levels were observed in both groups. 52% of women with UI had an abnormal Clomiphene citrate challenge test, which was associated with lower chances of conception. However, inhibin B was a poor predictor of live birth. 

The guideline recommends that ovarian reserve testing is not necessary in women with regular menstrual cycles to identify infertility causes or predict spontaneous conception over 6 to 12 months. This is because ovarian reserve status does not predict spontaneous conception over 6 -12 months. 

Studies do not suggest that ovarian reserve status would determine the probability of a spontaneous pregnancy in 6 -12 months. Therefore, ovarian reserve test (ORT) is not required from a diagnostic standpoint. 

ORT could be relevant for management choice if ovarian reserve status is a determinant of pregnancy probability with expectant management, OS -IUI or IVF. However, the evidence is not clear and further studies are needed. 

Ovarian response, hence ovarian reserve, is a major determinant of cumulative probability of live birth per OS cycle in IVF. Women with decreased ovarian reserve will have lower pregnancy/live birth rate per cycle with IVF compared to women with similar characteristics but higher ovarian reserve.

A systematic review and meta-analysis including 1977 subfertile patients in 21 studies investigated the sensitivity and specificity of hystero salpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy /HyFoSy) in diagnosing tubal pathology using laparoscopy with chromopertubation as the reference standard. For 2D-HyCoSy the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively. High heterogeneity was found for sensitivity and specificity. For 3D/4D-HyCoSy the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.89, respectively. Both sonography methods had almost identical areas under the curve (0.96 for 2D-HyCoSy and 0.97 for 3D/4D-HyCoSy). 

Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 1553 patients in 23 studies investigated the sensitivity and specificity of 3D- and 4D-HyCoSy for tubal patency using laparoscopy as the gold standard. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.92. The area under the ROC curve was 0.97.

The unadjusted pooled accuracy of HyCoSy showed a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.83.

A systematic review and meta-analysis, including seven studies with 4521 women, investigated the sensitivity and specificity of hysterosalpingography (HSG) in diagnosing tubal pathology using laparoscopy with chromopertubation as the reference standard. The sensitivity of HSG for any tubal pathology ranged between 46% and 100% and specificity between 73% and 100% across the studies. The unadjusted pooled accuracy of HSG showed a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.78. After imputation of missing laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.53 and 0.87 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. In women with a low-risk clinical history, the sensitivity of HSG for detecting unilateral tubal pathology was 38% versus 61% in women with a high-risk history. For bilateral tubal pathology, sensitivity ranged between 0% and 100% and specificity between 87% and 97% across the individual studies. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 0.66 and 0.91, respectively. After imputation of laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.46 and 0.95. Additional 18 studies showed high sensitivity and specificity for HSG, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of these additional 18 studies were 0.86 and 0.79, respectively.

The clinical guideline suggests that Hystero salpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are valid tests for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. The selection between HSG and HyCoSy depends on the preference of the clinician and the patient. High risk for tubal occlusion includes past chlamydia infection, PID, peritonitis, known endometriosis and/or pelvic surgery. The current evidence for HyCoSy and HSG shows that they are valid tests for tubal patency and less costly and harmful than laparoscopy. HyCoSy (using saline or foam) is less harmful than laparoscopy or HSG. Chlamydia antibody testing for tubal patency could be considered a non-invasive test to differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. In patients at high-risk for tubal abnormality, visual demonstration of tubal patency is necessary.

The Chlamydia antibody testing (CAT) has a role in clinical practice, despite its limitations. The low false negative rate suggests that a negative result combined with low-risk medical history could indicate tubal patency. However, due to the somewhat low positive predictive value for CAT, both positive and negative results combined with a high-risk medical history should be confirmed with visual methods like HyCoSy, HSG or laparoscopy. The test's validity varies depending on the assay used. Newer antibodies and more specific CAT have emerged with improved performance, but sensitivity issues remain.

The text discusses various studies on methods used to diagnose tubal pathology in subfertile women. These methods include hysterosalpingography, hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy), diagnostic laparoscopy, and Chlamydia IgG ELISA antibody testing. Some studies also examine the accuracy of medical history taking in predicting tubal factor infertility. Several studies investigate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis infections and antibodies in tubal factor subfertility. Other studies compare the diagnostic value of hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy, and some consider the predictive value of oil-soluble versus water-soluble contrast media in hysterosalpingography. The accuracy of serum chlamydial antibodies in diagnosing tubal pathology is also discussed. There is also mention of the use of real-time three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography in assessing tubal patency.

The guideline discusses the use of various diagnostic procedures for tubal factor infertility and uterine anomalies in women. It includes hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, serological tests for Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies, and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography. The guideline also mentions the use of 2D and 3D ultrasound for the detection of uterine anomalies, stating that 3D ultrasound has been found to be more accurate and is recommended for women with unexplained infertility. Despite the same cost per scan, 3D ultrasound showed superior results compared to 2D ultrasound.

The guideline acknowledges that 3D ultrasound may not be available in every clinic. No relevant studies were found investigating the use of MRI compared to 2D ultrasound to confirm a normal uterine structure and anatomy in women with unexplained infertility. Therefore, MRI is not recommended as a first-line test for this purpose, given its cost and time-consuming nature. 

Several studies were reviewed that assessed the value of additional diagnostic procedures, such as hysteroscopy or HyCoSy, in cases where ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity was normal. Findings suggest that even though some additional uterine abnormalities were detected, most of these were not likely to have a major effect on pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, if ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity is normal, no further evaluation is needed. 

In cases where further assessment for uterine cavity is needed, HyCoSy should be prioritized over hysteroscopy due to its good performance, availability and cost profile.

The guideline discusses the role of laparoscopy in diagnosing unexplained infertility (UI). Studies suggest that in most cases, laparoscopy does not change the original treatment plan. For instance, one study found that only 4.8% of patients had abnormalities that necessitated a change in treatment plan. Another study found that while laparoscopy changed the initial treatment plan in 25% of cases, only 4% of these changes were significant. A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in pregnancy rates between groups that underwent immediate laparoscopy and those who had immediate intrauterine insemination (IUI). Therefore, routine diagnostic laparoscopy is not recommended for the diagnosis of UI. It should be reserved for women with an abnormal HSG or those at risk for tubo-peritoneal disease. 

The guideline also discusses the use of the post-coital test (PCT) in diagnosing UI. A systematic review and meta-analysis found varied predictive values for normal and abnormal PCTs. However, a randomized controlled trial found similar pregnancy rates at 24 months with and without PCT. A retrospective study found higher pregnancy rates after a positive PCT compared to a negative test. Another retrospective study found varied predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity for normal and abnormal PCTs. The effectiveness and need for PCT in diagnosing UI remains unclear.

A retrospective analysis of 207 couples found that in couples with less than 3 years of infertility and positive PCT, 68% conceived within 2 years compared with 17% of those with a negative result. After 3 years of infertility, corresponding rates were 14% and 11%. However, the post-coital test is not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility as it has poor discriminating capacity and does not change further management.

Studies comparing vaginal and gut microbiota in women with unexplained infertility (UI) and fertile controls found differences in bacterial abundance. However, the role of vaginal microbiota in UI is unclear due to different detection methods used, and there is currently no evidence suggesting that correcting abnormal vaginal microbiota improves fertility outcomes. Therefore, vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting.

The clinical guideline discusses the diagnosis of unexplained infertility (UI) in men. The guideline suggests that men should not undergo additional diagnostic procedures to confirm normal genito-urinary anatomy if semen analysis is normal. This is based on evidence showing that mean testicular volume, testicular inhomogeneity, parenchymal calcification, intratesticular artery peak systolic velocity, epididymal mean head size, and vas deferens mean size are all associated with sperm parameters but do not provide additional benefit to routine semen analysis.

The guideline also discusses the value of additional tests in men with normal semen analysis. It acknowledges that UI is a diagnosis by exclusion and that some underlying sperm dysfunction may not be detected during routine semen assessment. It suggests that further tests may be indicated in some cases, but these tests are currently regarded as research only and are not recommended for routine use.

The guideline then discusses the evidence for anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) in infertile men. It cites several studies showing that ASA is more common in infertile men and can affect sperm function and fertility outcomes. However, the guideline does not make a specific recommendation regarding ASA testing.

A cohort study found a higher pregnancy rate in couples with <50% sperm antibody bound compared to those with >50% sperm antibody bound. However, testing for anti-sperm antibodies in semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal due to insufficient evidence of its benefits.

Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) assays cannot be used interchangeably. In studies, higher pregnancy and live birth rates were found in groups with low SDF. However, testing for SDF is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. This is due to data indicating that SDF may adversely affect reproductive success, and the lack of standardization in SDF testing methodologies and thresholds.

No studies were found to answer the question regarding sperm chromatin condensation test and sperm aneuploidy screening. Therefore, these tests are not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. This is due to the lack of evidence suggesting their clinical significance and the absence of studies testing their effect on the clinical management of infertile couples. 

At least 15% of male infertility can be attributed to genetic factors. However, the recommendation remains that sperm aneuploidy screening is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal.

The number of genes linked with seminal phenotypes and male infertility is constantly expanding. The risk of men being carriers of genetic anomalies decreases with increasing sperm output. Sperm aneuploidy is rare in fertile men and is most commonly observed in men with spermatogenic failure, oligozoospermia or oligoasthenozoospermia, and among normozoospermic men who are partners in couples with recurrent pregnancy loss. Aneuploidy is not indicated for routine testing in men with normal semen parameters.

Hormonal testing is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. Semen analysis is used to assess male reproductive function and genital tract patency. In cases of abnormal sperm parameters, potential hypogonadism is ruled out by reproductive hormone testing. However, no evidence was found supporting endocrine testing as a first line of investigation for males with unexplained infertility (UI) and normal semen examination.

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing of semen is not recommended when conventional semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. HPV is a transient infection which most often clears spontaneously. Conflicting data on the effects of semen HPV infection on reproductive outcomes makes it impossible to recommend routine screening of HPV in a diagnostic setting in assisted reproduction.

Microbiology testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. In the case of a normal physical examination and in the absence of symptoms associated with genitourinary tract infection, further microbiological culture of the semen is not usually warranted. Tests for discriminating specific leukocyte types from round immature germ cells are not part of the routine semen analysis and their clinical value is not clear.

Simon L, et al. Comparative analysis of three sperm DNA damage.

A systematic review and meta-analysis found that sperm DNA damage impacts in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcomes. Sperm chromatin damage was found to impair human fertility. The FSHB gene -211G/T polymorphism was found to impact male gonadal function. Sperm DNA fragmentation was associated with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss and influenced assisted reproductive technology outcome. The FSHB -211G>T and FSHR 2039A>G variants were found to impact male reproductive parameters. A study found no relationship between anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) status and the success of IVF-ICSI. However, another study suggested a strong correlation between unexplained infertility and ASA. The presence of ASA in women was found to slightly lower fertilization rates after IVF. High agglutinin titers in men and women were associated with significantly lower pregnancy rates. The risk of coeliac disease was found to be higher in patients with unexplained infertility. The presence of thyroid antibodies was found to lower clinical pregnancy rates.

A study found no significant difference in thyroid peroxidase-antibodies between unexplained infertility (UI) patients and controls. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies, thyroid antibody, and other autoimmune conditions (excluding coeliac disease) in women with UI is not recommended. Testing for coeliac disease may be considered. 

Studies on thyroid hormones in UI showed slightly higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 in UI women. TSH measurement is recommended in pre-conception care, but no additional thyroid evaluation is suggested if TSH is within the normal range.

In terms of thrombophilia, one study found no significant differences in thrombophilia markers between UI and controls. The presence of thrombophilia was not significantly associated with lower fertility success rate. Some differences were found in the frequency of the MTHFR C677T genotype between UI women and controls.

A higher prevalence of thrombophilia was found in women with unexplained infertility (UI) compared to controls (13% vs. 7.1%). A higher prevalence of prothrombin gene mutation was also found in the UI group compared to controls (5.7% vs. 2.1%, OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.02 - 8.03). However, the presence of Factor V Leiden (FVL) and anticoagulant protein deficiencies was not significantly higher. Other studies found no significant difference between UI and control groups for any thrombophilia. However, MTHFR C677T gene showed a significant difference between women with UI (22%) and controls (0%). Significantly more mutations in FVL were found in the UI group compared to controls (30.6% vs. 0%). A significant difference in PAI-1 4G-675 allele frequency was found between UI and fertile controls. Despite these findings, testing for thrombophilia in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended due to the small size and heterogeneity of the studies, the cost of testing, and the lack of effective treatment.

In terms of oxidative stress, studies have found a significantly higher percentage of DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the UI group compared to controls. Seminal plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl group (PC), and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were significantly elevated in UI versus control group. Other studies found ROS to be significantly increased in UI males compared to fertile controls. ROS was significantly higher in UI males compared to controls, both in neat and washed semen. Lipid peroxidation levels in blood plasma were found to be significantly higher in the UI males group compared to controls.

Levels were found to be different in semen of UI patients compared to controls. A case-control study found no significant differences in DNA damage and oxidative stress between UI and control males. A metabolomic analysis was able to distinguish significant differences between UI and fertile males. Oxidative stress markers were evaluated in women with UI and found to be significantly different from controls. Another study found that TOS and OSI in follicular fluid of UI patients were statistically higher than the control group. A study found 27 metabolites in follicular fluid to be significantly different between infertile females and controls. Serum nitrite was lower and serum MDA levels were higher in UI compared to controls. A significant difference was noted for the eNOS gene in UI patients. 

Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with UI should only be considered in the context of research. Measurement of oxidative stress in women with UI is not recommended. 

In a retrospective cohort study, abnormalities were found in 3% of patients with UI. Genetic polymorphisms in the FSHB gene were evaluated in females with UI and found to be significantly different. No relationship was found between pregnancy rate and the genetic polymorphisms in the PPAR gamma gene. Sperm miRNA expression levels were evaluated in males with UI and found to be differentially expressed. Chromosomal polymorphisms were found in normozoospermic men with female partners with UI. No significant differences in allele frequencies between males with UI and controls were found.

A study of 1206 normovulatory subfertile women found no association between chromosome abnormalities and infertility, but a higher prevalence of chromosome abnormalities was observed in women with secondary infertility. Another study found more micronucleated cells in infertile couples. However, genetic or genomic tests are not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility due to lack of specific benefit and high cost.

In studies investigating vitamin D levels in men with unexplained infertility and women undergoing their first IVF cycle, lower vitamin D levels were found in the infertile group and the cumulative live birth rate was lower in the vitamin D-deficient group. However, testing for vitamin D deficiency is not recommended for diagnosis of unexplained infertility as no role of vitamin D has been found in this context.

In studies investigating the association between prolactin and unexplained infertility, prolactin levels were found to be significantly higher in women with unexplained infertility in some studies but not others. Testing for prolactin levels in women is not recommended due to poor and heterogenous data quality.

Studies examining the association of dietary status and body weight with unexplained infertility found a significant difference in caloric intake between women with unexplained infertility and controls, and a higher live birth rate per cycle in women with normal weight and slight overweight compared to women with a BMI ≥27 kg/m².

In women with unexplained infertility (UI), estradiol was lower on the day of hCG in overweight/obese women under 35 years, but not in those over 35. In older women, estradiol, progesterone, and LH were lower in those with greater weight. Therefore, BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. Despite the lack of specific evidence linking BMI and UI, reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. The standard advice and medical interventions apply to patients with UI as with any other causes of infertility. Healthy lifestyle intervention may improve spontaneous conception, but active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not yet shown a benefit in pregnancy.

Metabolic Pattern Correlates with Female Infertility and Outcome Measures of In Vitro Fertilization. Effects of subfertility cause, smoking and body weight on the success rate of IVF.

The role of oxidant status on the etiopathogenesis of unexplained infertility and intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer success.

Unexplained Infertility (UI) couples can achieve spontaneous pregnancy. Prediction models like the Hunault model (Hunault et al., 2004) use prognostic factors such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment and pregnancy to predict the chance of spontaneous pregnancy. However, these models are not fully evolved and have limitations. Dynamic models providing updated estimates of natural conception over 6-12 months are being developed, but are not yet in common clinical use. Treatment effectiveness varies for UI. For young women with short infertility duration, the added benefit of active treatment is small. However, for longer infertility durations and older ages, the benefit of active treatment increases. Prognostic models can aid treatment decision-making, but patient preferences should also be considered.

The guideline discusses expectant management vs. active treatment for patients with unexplained infertility (UI). The comparison of timed intercourse without hormonal stimulation vs. expectant management is not included in the guideline. 

One study compared six months of expectant management with clomiphene citrate (CC) and timed intercourse, finding no significant difference in birth rates or cost-benefit. Another study found higher pregnancy rates with CC and hCG compared to placebo. 

No relevant studies were identified comparing letrozole or gonadotropins with timed intercourse vs. expectant management in couples with UI. 

One study compared intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle with expectant management, finding no significant difference in live birth rate. A systematic review and meta-analysis compared ovarian stimulation with IUI and expectant management, finding a higher live birth rate in couples with poor prognosis. 

A systematic review and meta-analysis compared IVF with expectant management, finding a higher live birth rate with IVF, although the evidence is of low quality and insufficient. A retrospective cohort study found no significant difference in live birth rate between immediate IVF treatment and waiting for about a year. 

The guideline recommends IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with UI, particularly for those with poor prognosis. The decision to start active treatment should be based on prognosis. The evidence for IVF vs. expectant management is scarce, and the decision to use IVF should be based on patient characteristics and preferences.

The clinical guideline for unexplained infertility (UI) discusses various treatment options. 

In a randomised control trial (RCT) comparing Clomiphene citrate (CC) and timed intercourse to letrozole, no significant differences were noted in ongoing pregnancy rate or multiple pregnancy rate. However, another RCT found a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate with letrozole and a higher multiple pregnancy rate with CC. 

No relevant studies were identified comparing timed intercourse with letrozole or gonadotropins to ovarian stimulation (OS) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) in couples with UI. 

A 3-arm RCT found that treatment with IUI resulted in a higher live birth rate compared to CC with timed intercourse. 

A systematic review and meta-analysis found it uncertain whether OS and IUI results in a higher live birth rate or a lower multiple pregnancy rate than OS with gonadotropins and timed intercourse. 

Another systematic review and meta-analysis found that live birth rate was higher with OS and IUI compared to IUI in a natural cycle. 

A systematic review and meta-analysis compared in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with IUI in a natural cycle and found a higher live birth rate with IVF. Another systematic review and meta-analysis found a significantly higher live birth rate after IVF compared to IUI with OS. 

The overall recommendation is for IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with UI. IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation in couples with UI. The decision to use IVF should be individualized by patient characteristics such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment and previous pregnancy.

There is a lack of high-quality RCTs on the topic. Clomiphene, letrozole, gonadotrophins and IUI on their own are not effective compared to expectant management or IUI in a natural cycle. However, IUI in combination with OS is not inferior to IVF. Considering the additional costs and risks of IVF, IUI in a stimulated cycle for three to six cycles is viewed as the first-line treatment in couples with unexplained infertility. This takes into account low-dose gonadotropins for OS to avoid a high number of growing follicles, which can increase the risk of multiple pregnancies. The decision to use IVF is individualized by patient characteristics, such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatments and previous pregnancy. Current evidence shows that in treatment-naïve patients, IVF is as effective as IUI with OS. However, as the invasiveness of the procedure and the costs are considerably lower with IUI, the GDG concluded that OS and IUI is recommended as the first-line treatment. 

An RCT, including 60 couples with UI, compared IVF with ICSI. There were no differences in live birth rate between the IVF and ICSI groups. A subgroup analysis of a large RCT included 382 couples with UI, randomly assigned to IVF and ICSI, found no significant difference in live birth rate between groups. A subgroup analysis of an RCT included 100 couples with UI. There was no difference in pregnancy rates between IVF and ICSI. Therefore, ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF in couples with unexplained infertility. 

Evidence from RCTs comparing IVF with ICSI in couples with UI showed comparable live birth rates. Furthermore, there is substantial evidence from RCTs showing no difference in live birth rate between IVF and ICSI for non-male factor infertility. Given this evidence, and the additional resources and costs associated, ICSI is not routinely recommended for UI.

The clinical guideline discusses the treatment of uterine fibroids in women with unexplained infertility. It suggests that there is insufficient evidence to show the benefit of fibroid removal on pregnancy and miscarriage rates. Hysteroscopy for detecting and correcting intrauterine abnormalities is not recommended due to lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness. 

The guideline also discusses tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media (OSCM) and water-soluble contrast media (WSCM). OSCM may increase the odds of live birth and clinical pregnancy, while it is uncertain whether flushing with WSCM increases these rates. OSCM is preferred over WSCM as it may lead to more clinical pregnancies and live births. 

For women with minimal to mild endometriosis, laparoscopic surgery may improve clinical pregnancy rates. However, if endometriosis is found incidentally during laparoscopy, it is not considered unexplained infertility. 

Lastly, the guideline discusses endometrial injury or scratching. A recent trial found no difference in the outcomes of live birth or ongoing pregnancy between women who had an endometrial biopsy and those who had a placebo procedure.

An RCT with 234 women with unexplained infertility (UI) undergoing timed intercourse with ovarian stimulation (OS) showed a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate in women receiving endometrial scratch compared to those receiving a mock biopsy. However, there was no significant difference in miscarriage rate. 

In an RCT with 96 women with UI undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) with OS, there was no statistical difference in ongoing pregnancy rate between women who received an endometrial scratch and those who did not. 

In another RCT with 150 women with UI undergoing IUI, there was no difference in ongoing pregnancy rate or multiple pregnancy rate between those who received a scratch on day 6-7 of their treatment cycle and those who did not. 

An RCT with 120 women with UI undergoing IUI with OS showed no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate between women who received an endometrial injury on cycle day 3 and those who did not. 

An RCT with 80 women with UI undergoing IUI with OS showed no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rate between women who received an endometrial scratch and those who did not. 

An RCT with 154 women with UI showed a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate in women receiving endometrial injury compared to controls. However, there was no statistical difference in multiple pregnancy rate or abortion rate. 

The guideline recommends that endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility. The procedure, though low-cost and can be done without anaesthetics, does not show better pregnancy outcome if performed before intercourse or IUI in couples with UI.

The clinical guideline examines alternative therapeutic approaches for unexplained infertility. 

1. Antioxidants: A systematic review and meta-analysis compared oral antioxidant treatment with a placebo in couples with unexplained infertility. Similar live birth rates were reported in both groups. The recommendation is that adjunct oral antioxidant therapy to women or men undergoing fertility treatment is probably not recommended due to the lack of evidence showing a benefit.

2. Acupuncture: One RCT investigated the effect of acupuncture sessions before and after embryo transfer during IVF. The live birth rate was significantly higher in the acupuncture group vs. controls. However, the recommendation is that acupuncture in women is probably not recommended due to very limited and low-quality evidence.

3. Nutraceuticals (Inositol): One RCT compared adjuvant treatment with myo-inositol suppositories during timed intercourse cycles with a placebo. Pregnancy rates were higher in the myo-inositol group compared to the control group. However, the recommendation is that inositol supplementation in women is probably not recommended due to the lack of convincing evidence of benefit.

4. Psychotherapy: No relevant studies were identified investigating the effect of psychotherapy in couples with unexplained infertility. However, psychological support, including psychotherapy, is recommended for patients when needed.

5. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): One uncontrolled study was identified where Onkyeong-tang and herbal medicine for ovulation and implantation were administered to women with UI. However, the literature was mostly in Chinese and only English publications were considered for this guideline.

6. Diet, Exercise, Behavioural Therapy: No specific studies or recommendations were mentioned in the guideline.


No relevant studies were found investigating the effect of diet, exercise or behavioural therapy in couples with unexplained infertility (UI). However, a healthy diet and regular exercise, supported by behavioural therapy when necessary, are recommended as reproductive outcomes can be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. 

Quality of life (QoL) comparisons between couples with a known infertility cause and couples with UI found probably no difference in QoL between women with UI and women with known causes of infertility, except when the cause is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Men from a couple with UI probably have a higher QoL compared to men from a couple with known causes of infertility, except when the cause is a partner with PCOS. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these differences.

The guideline suggests future research on unexplained infertility should focus on developing a predictive model to compare the outcomes of different management strategies, determining the optimal ART for UI, and assessing the value of current methods to assess sperm DNA integrity to predict clinical outcomes. The guideline also emphasizes the importance of research on male infertility.

The text discusses the increase in the use of MAR (Medically Assisted Reproduction) for male infertility cases where no cause is identified. This approach puts a burden on the female partner and necessitates a shift in treatment. Research efforts should focus on identifying new causes, diagnostics, and treatment options for male infertility. This would allow for more personalized therapeutic options and improved reproductive outcomes. Several research gaps were identified, including the role of vaginal microbiota, predictive models based on ovarian reserve tests, causes of Unexplained Infertility (UI), impact of sperm DNA damage, role of lifestyle intervention, value of sperm function tests, and the role of oxidative stress markers among others. The text suggests that addressing these gaps could potentially enhance the management of infertility.

The guideline development group (GDG) for the NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health developed a list of 21 key questions about unexplained infertility (UI). Literature searches were conducted using key words in PUBMED/MEDLINE and the Cochrane library. The search process was iterative, starting with systematic reviews and meta-analyses, then randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case reports. Selected papers were assessed for quality using the ESHRE guideline manual and summarized in an evidence table. The GDG meetings were organized to discuss draft recommendations and reach consensus on the final recommendations. 

The guideline includes key questions on the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of UI, as well as its impact on quality of life. Recommendations were labelled as either ‘‘strong’’ or ‘‘conditional’’ according to the GRADE approach. For each recommendation, the quality of the supporting evidence was mentioned, along with considerations taken into account when formulating the recommendations. 

The draft guideline was open for review from 12 December 2022 to 30 January 2023. The final guideline was published on the ESHRE website and in Human Reproduction Open, and announced at the ESHRE Annual meeting. Patient versions of the guideline were also developed. Members of the GDG were asked to select recommendations for which they believe implementation will be difficult.

The current guideline will be revised in 2027, four years after publication. An intermediate search for new evidence will be performed two years after publication. Corrections to the guideline will be published in the web version of the document. The guideline draft was open for review for 6 weeks, between 12 December 2022 and 30 January 2023. All reviewers, their comments and the reply of the guideline development group are summarized in the review report, which is published on the ESHRE website. The list of representatives of professional organization, and of individual experts that provided comments to the guideline are summarized below.
