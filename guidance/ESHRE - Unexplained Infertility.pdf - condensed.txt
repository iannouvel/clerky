The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) has developed a clinical practice guideline for Unexplained Infertility (UI). This guideline is intended to assist healthcare professionals in making clinical decisions about patient care. However, adherence to these guidelines does not guarantee a specific outcome, and healthcare professionals must use their clinical judgment, knowledge, and expertise to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. The guideline is developed in collaboration with Monash University led Australian NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women’s Reproductive Health. 

UI is a diagnosis made when no abnormalities of the female and male reproductive systems are identified. The management of UI is traditionally empirical due to the absence of an identified cause. The guideline aims to provide clinicians with evidence-based information on the optimal diagnostic work-up for infertile couples and the optimal therapeutic approach considering issues like live birth rates, safety, patient compliance, and individualization. The guideline acknowledges that each medical decision needs to consider individual characteristics, preferences, beliefs, and values.

The guideline discusses unexplained infertility (UI) and covers four chapters including the definition of UI, diagnostic tests, treatment, and comparison of quality of life between couples with explained and unexplained infertility. The guideline is intended for general practitioners, gynaecologists, andrologists, infertility specialists, and reproductive surgeons. The guideline applies the terms and definitions as described in the international glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. The guideline focuses on outcomes of relevance, accuracy, acceptability, reliability, feasibility, value for the diagnostic tools, and on outcomes of efficacy, safety and patient-related outcomes for the treatment. The critical outcomes are live full-term singleton birth, live birth, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancies/multiple births, and the important outcomes are clinical symptoms, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness value. Other outcomes are clinical pregnancy rate, adverse pregnancy outcome, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, fetal abnormalities, feasibility, acceptability. The guideline includes a list of recommendations for the diagnosis of unexplained infertility.

Vaginal microbiota testing for unexplained infertility should only be considered in a research setting. Testicular imaging, anti-sperm antibody testing, sperm DNA fragmentation testing, sperm chromatin condensation test, sperm aneuploidy screening, serum hormonal testing, HPV testing, and microbiology testing of semen are not recommended when semen analysis is normal. Testing for anti-sperm antibodies in serum or coeliac disease in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. TSH measurement is good practice in pre-conception care but additional thyroid evaluation is not recommended if TSH is within normal range. Testing for thrombophilia, genetic or genomic tests, vitamin D deficiency, or prolactin in women with unexplained infertility is not recommended. BMI evaluation is good practice in pre-conception care. IUI with ovarian stimulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with unexplained infertility. IVF is not recommended over IUI. ICSI is not recommended over conventional IVF. Hysteroscopy for intrauterine abnormalities and endometrial scratching are not recommended. HSG with an oil-soluble contrast medium is preferable. Adjunct oral antioxidant therapy, acupuncture, and inositol supplementation are not recommended. Psychological support, healthy diet, and regular exercise are recommended. Couples should have at least 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse before fertility interventions may be initiated. Sexual intercourse at least every 2-3 days within the fertility window is advised.

The guideline discusses the impact of age on Unexplained Infertility (UI). Analysis of 237 studies showed that age, especially in females, can influence the definition of UI. The ICMART definition of UI doesn't reference duration of unprotected intercourse or female partner's age. However, after 40 years of age, the false positive diagnosis of UI increases to 80%. Male age could also affect fertility potential but to a lesser extent. 

The guideline also discusses the inclusion of mild infertility factors in the definition of UI. For males, the initial fertility evaluation should include at least one basic semen examination and a reproductive and medical history. Results below the lower 5th percentile reference limit should be considered clinically relevant for further investigation. Any abnormalities found should prompt a repeat of the semen analysis. For females, any factors present exclude the diagnosis of UI.

The guideline defines UI as infertility in couples with normal reproductive functions, age ≤ 40 years and with adequate coital frequency. Couples should have at least 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse before investigations are initiated. The guideline recommends taking a medical, reproductive and sexual history from both partners. A regular menstrual cycle is defined as 24 to 38 days, up to 8 days in duration and shortest to longest cycle variation of less than 7 to 9 days. At least one basic semen examination should be performed. If the result is below the lower 5th percentile reference limit, a second analysis should be performed after a 3-month interval.

The guideline discusses the reliability and convenience of methods to confirm regular ovulation in infertile women with regular menstrual cycles. No relevant papers were found to compare menstrual history or changes in cervical mucus with other methods to predict/confirm ovulation. 

In studies including urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) measurements, agreement and accuracy with ultrasound monitoring were high (98-100% and 97% respectively). Basal Body Temperature (BBT) and luteal-phase serum progesterone measurements had estimated accuracies between 70% and 80%. 

The guideline recommends that in women with regular menstrual cycles, tests for confirmation of ovulation are not routinely recommended. If confirmation is warranted, tests such as urinary LH measurements, ultrasound monitoring, or mid-luteal progesterone measurement can be used. 

While BBT presented with lower accuracy and was found to be less acceptable to patients, the documentation of an ovulation episode in one specific menstrual cycle is not a surrogate marker of regular ovulation. The convenience of self-administered testing strategies in infertile population is yet to be adequately tested.

The clinical guideline discusses the reliability of parameters for detecting good oocyte/corpus luteum quality. A cohort study found the lowest progesterone threshold for conception cycles was 8.5 ng/ml, but it is suggested not to routinely measure midluteal serum progesterone levels in women with regular menstrual cycles. There is no evidence showing an increase in live birth rates with exogenous progesterone administration. 

Regarding endometrial biopsy, studies show it does not discriminate between fertile and infertile women, hence it is not recommended in the absence of other indications. 

No relevant papers could be identified investigating the reliability of fertilization failure or euploid embryo rate to determine good oocyte or corpus luteum quality. 

In terms of ovarian reserve, a cohort study suggested lower anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly associated with unexplained infertility (UI), while antral follicle count was not. Women with low AMH values or high serum FSH values had similar predicted probability of conceiving as those with normal values.

Multiple studies have found no predictive value of AMH, basal FSH or the AFC for time to ongoing pregnancy. Similar AMH levels and AFC were reported in female partners of infertile couples and women with no history of infertility. Serum AMH and FSH levels, as well as AFC were similar between women who achieved a spontaneous pregnancy and those who did not. AMH alone was a poor predictor of live birth. Low AMH levels had similar fecundability to medium levels, while high AMH levels had lower fecundability. AMH, FSH and AFC were compared between women with strictly defined UI and control women, with similar levels found in both groups. Serum AMH level was not a significant predictor of natural conception. AFC was not predictive of spontaneous pregnancy. Women with UI had lower AFC than the male factor group. Women aged between 25 and 40 years in the UI group had significantly lower AFC than similarly aged women in the community group. There were no differences in FSH concentrations between groups in women who were 36 –40 or 41– 45 years of age.

Women with unexplained infertility (UI) showed similar levels of FSH, estradiol, ovarian volume, and inhibin B compared to those with male factor infertility. A study found that 52% of women with UI had an abnormal Clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT), compared to lower percentages in other infertility categories. Women with abnormal CCCT were less likely to conceive. Inhibin B was found to be a poor predictor of live birth in 5 years. In women with regular menstrual cycles, ovarian reserve testing is not required for identifying the cause of infertility or predicting the probability of spontaneous conception over 6 to 12 months. Studies consistently show that ovarian reserve status is not predictive of spontaneous conception over the subsequent 6-12 months. Ovarian reserve testing may not be informative to predict the success of expectant management over such a period. Ovarian reserve status may determine the probability of pregnancy with OS-IUI cycles or IVF. However, diverting women with low ovarian reserve directly or rapidly to IVF is questionable.

The text discusses the accuracy of hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy/HyFoSy) versus laparoscopy and chromopertubation for diagnosing tubal pathology in subfertile patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 1977 patients found that 2D-HyCoSy had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.86 and 0.94 respectively, while 3D/4D-HyCoSy had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 and 0.89 respectively. Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 1553 patients found that 3D- and 4D-HyCoSy had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.92. The unadjusted pooled accuracy of HyCoSy showed a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.83.

A systematic review and meta-analysis including seven studies with 4521 women investigated the sensitivity and specificity of hysterosalpingography (HSG) in the diagnosis of tubal pathology using laparoscopy with chromopertubation as the reference standard. The sensitivity of HSG for any tubal pathology ranged between 46% and 100% and specificity between 73% and 100% across the studies. The unadjusted pooled accuracy of HSG showed a sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.66 – 0.74) and a specificity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.75 –0.80). After imputation of missing laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.53 (95% CI 0.50 –0.57) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.86 –0.88) for sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

In women with a low-risk clinical history, the sensitivity of HSG for detecting unilateral tubal pathology was 38% versus 61% in women with a high-risk history. For bilateral tubal pathology, sensitivity ranged between 0% and 100% and specificity ranged between 87% and 97% across the individual studies. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 –0.75) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89 –0.93), respectively. After imputation of laparoscopy results, these rates were 0.46 (95% CI 0.41 –0.51) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94– 0.95).

To support the systematic review, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of these additional 18 studies were 0.86 (95% CI 0.78 –0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.72–0.86), respectively.

The clinical guideline suggests Hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) as valid tests for tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and chromopertubation. The selection between these two techniques depends on the clinician and patient's preference. High risk for tubal occlusion includes past chlamydia infection, PID, peritonitis, known endometriosis and/or pelvic surgery including salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy. 

HyCoSy has a high specificity and sensitivity for tubal patency, but no recommendation can be made regarding the use of contrast medium, foam or saline due to lack of studies. 

HSG is a valid test for tubal patency and less costly and harmful than laparoscopy. HSG has limited ability to detect abdominal adhesions compared to laparoscopy. 

HyCoSy is less harmful than laparoscopy or HSG, as it allows immediate assessment after ultrasound, with no need for general anaesthesia or radiation exposure. 

Chlamydia antibody testing (CAT) for tubal patency can be considered a non-invasive test to differentiate between patients at low and high risk for tubal occlusion. In patients at high risk for tubal abnormality, visual demonstration of tubal patency is necessary.

The sensitivity of Chlamydia antibody testing (CAT) is lower compared to HSG and HyCoSy, but its specificity is generally good. The validity of CAT varies according to the assay used, with a reported discrepancy in 21% of patients between MIF and ELISA assays for IgG. CAT does not allow evaluation of the degree of occlusion or occlusions due to other infections than Chlamydia trachomatis. 

Data suggests a role for CAT in clinical practice, with a low false negative rate. A negative result combined with a low-risk medical history could be considered specific for tubal patency. However, due to the somewhat low positive predictive value for CAT, both a positive and a negative test combined with a high-risk medical history should be confirmed with visual methods like HyCoSy, HSG or laparoscopy. 

Tubal pathology was reported in 84.3% of patients with a high-risk medical history. Newer antibodies and more specific CAT have emerged with improved performance, but limitations with sensitivity still remain. 

The table shows the accuracy of Chlamydia antibody testing compared to gold standard laparoscopy and dye for tubal patency testing, including true and false positive and negative data, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios.

The texts discuss the diagnostic value of various methods for assessing tubal patency and tubal factor infertility in women, including hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy), hysterosalpingography, diagnostic laparoscopy, and Chlamydia antibody testing. It is suggested that Chlamydia antibody testing may be more accurate than hysterosalpingography in predicting tubal factor infertility. The role of Chlamydia genus-specific and species-specific IgG antibody testing in predicting tubal disease in subfertile women is also discussed. The predictive value of medical history taking and Chlamydia IgG ELISA antibody testing (CAT) in the selection of subfertile women for diagnostic laparoscopy is examined. The studies also discuss the potential of HyCoSy as an alternative to laparoscopy in the evaluation of tubal obstruction in infertile patients. The accuracy of hysterosalpingography versus laparoscopy in the evaluation of infertile women is compared, as well as the potential causes of misdiagnosis in assessing tubal patency by transvaginal real-time three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography. The value of sonohysterography in the diagnosis of tubal patency among infertile patients is also discussed. The potential of serum CA-125 concentrations and Chlamydia trachomatis antibody in predicting tubal pathology at laparoscopy is examined. The comparison of hysterosalpingography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography in the evaluation of tubal patency is also discussed.

The text discusses various studies on the diagnosis of female infertility, particularly focusing on the assessment of the fallopian tubes and uterine structure. Techniques such as hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, hysterosonosalpingography, and serological tests for Chlamydia trachomatis are mentioned. Studies compare the effectiveness of 2D and 3D ultrasound in detecting uterine anomalies. The recommendation is to use preferably 3D ultrasound to exclude uterine anomalies in women with unexplained infertility. Despite 2D-US being a valid diagnostic tool, 3D-US showed superior results. The cost per scan for both techniques is the same and the test is not more painful or invasive.

MRI is not recommended as a first-line test to confirm a normal uterine structure and anatomy in women with unexplained infertility due to lack of evidence on its usefulness, cost, and time consumption. It should be considered as a second-line diagnostic tool for specific conditions. 

A study including 678 asymptomatic subfertile women with normal 2D-US showed 11% of women with normal 2D-US having abnormal findings on hysteroscopy. However, due to the cost, routine hysteroscopy was not recommended as a second-line assessment. 

Other studies found additional uterine findings in subsequent hysteroscopy or HyCoSy procedures in women with normal ultrasonography findings, but most diagnoses were polyps or a septum that likely will not have a major effect on pregnancy outcomes. 

The recommendation is that if ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity is normal, no further evaluation is needed. In cases where further assessment for uterine cavity is needed, HyCoSy should be prioritized due to its good performance, availability, and cost profile compared to hysteroscopy.

The guideline discusses the role of laparoscopy in diagnosing unexplained infertility (UI). Studies found that laparoscopy often did not necessitate a change in the original treatment plan. One study found that in 63 patients, only three required a change in treatment plan based on laparoscopic findings. Another study found that laparoscopy changed the initial treatment plan in 25% of 495 women, but it's unclear whether treating the abnormalities increased the success of subsequent intrauterine insemination (IUI). A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in overall pregnancy rate between immediate laparoscopy and immediate IUI. The guideline concludes that routine diagnostic laparoscopy is not recommended for diagnosing UI. 

The guideline also discusses the Post-Coital Test (PCT) for UI. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported varying predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity for normal and abnormal PCT. A randomized controlled trial found similar cumulative pregnancy rates at 24 months with and without PCT. A retrospective cohort study found higher spontaneous and overall pregnancy rates after a positive PCT compared to a negative test. Another retrospective study investigated the predictive value of normal and abnormal PCTs on pregnancy rates, with varying results.

In a retrospective re-analysis of 207 couples, it was found that in couples with less than 3 years of infertility and positive PCT, 68% conceived within 2 years compared with 17% of those with negative result. After 3 years of infertility, corresponding rates were 14% and 11%. The post-coital test is not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility. The meta-analysis showed that PCT has poor discriminating capacity. Cumulative pregnancy rates seem to be similar after a positive or a negative test. Importantly, it is an invasive test for the patient and does not change further management. Therefore, PCT is not recommended in infertility investigations.

Several studies have investigated the role of vaginal microbiota in unexplained infertility. Differences in the abundance of certain bacterial species and diversity metrics were observed between infertile and fertile women. However, there were no significant differences in vaginal microbiota between unexplained and explained infertility couples. Vaginal microbiota testing could be considered in couples with unexplained infertility only in a research setting. It is difficult to compare studies investigating the role of vaginal microbiota, due to the different detection methods used and the timing of sample collection. There is currently insufficient evidence of a role of abnormal vaginal microbiota in unexplained infertility. Furthermore, there is no evidence suggesting that correcting abnormal vaginal microbiota improves fertility outcomes.

The clinical guideline discusses the diagnostic procedures for men with unexplained infertility (UI). It suggests that men should not undergo additional diagnostic procedures to confirm normal genito-urinary anatomy if semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. This is because there is no additional benefit on performing scrotal colour Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) on male partners with normal semen parameters. However, CDUS can be helpful to identify scrotal abnormalities and to assist in better understanding the pathophysiology of sperm abnormalities and male infertility.

The guideline also discusses the added value of additional tests in males with normal WHO semen analysis. It acknowledges that UI is a diagnosis by exclusion and supports the urgent need to develop robust standardised methods for establishing etiological diagnosis in the male partner. The guideline considers that some adverse reproductive outcomes may indicate the use of further tests to assess sperm function. 

The guideline also presents evidence on the effect of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) in infertile men. It suggests that significantly more ASA is found in the infertile group compared to the controls. The relative infertility risk for Mixed antiglobulin reaction (MAR) ≥50% was found to be 8.38. In ASA- positive men, acrosome reaction was decreased, DNA fragmentation increased and higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) were found. 

The guideline recommends that further research is needed to develop sound evidence for routine use of these tests in clinical practice.

Couples with unexplained infertility (UI) and less than 50% sperm antibody bound had a higher pregnancy rate than those with more than 50% sperm antibody bound. However, testing for anti-sperm antibodies in semen is not recommended when semen analysis is normal due to insufficient evidence of benefit and lack of standardized cut-off values. 

Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) tests cannot be used interchangeably. Studies have found varying effects of SDF on reproductive outcomes, including higher live birth rates in low SDF groups and higher miscarriage rates in high SDF groups. However, testing for SDF is not recommended when semen analysis is normal due to varying predictive accuracy of different SDF assays and lack of standardized methodologies and cut-offs. 

No studies were found to support the use of sperm chromatin condensation tests or sperm aneuploidy screening in men with UI and normal semen analysis. Therefore, these tests are not recommended. 

At least 15% of male factor infertility can be attributed to genetic factors. Azoospermia, the absence of sperm in semen, is the category with the highest frequency of known genetic factors contributing to male infertility.

The number of genes linked with male infertility is constantly expanding. Men with higher sperm output have a lower risk of carrying genetic anomalies. Sperm aneuploidy is rare in fertile men and is most commonly observed in men with spermatogenic failure, oligozoospermia or oligoasthenozoospermia, and in normozoospermic men with partners who experience recurrent pregnancy loss. Aneuploidy is not indicated for routine testing in men with normal semen parameters. 

Serum hormonal testing is not recommended when semen analysis is normal according to WHO criteria. Hormonal profile can be helpful in diagnosing underlying conditions associated with abnormal semen parameters. However, endocrine testing is not recommended as a first line of investigation for males with unexplained infertility (UI) and normal semen analysis. 

HPV testing of semen is not recommended when conventional semen analysis is according to WHO criteria is normal. The presence of HPV in semen and its effects on reproductive outcomes are still unclear, making routine screening not recommended. 

Microbiology testing of semen is not recommended when semen analysis according to WHO criteria is normal. In cases of a normal physical examination and absence of symptoms associated with genitourinary tract infection, further microbiological culture of the semen is not usually warranted. Tests for specific leukocyte types are not part of the routine semen analysis and their clinical value is unclear.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing is recommended for sperm donor banks. Infectious HPV virions in semen can reduce clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing intrauterine insemination. The presence of HPV in semen can also affect semen quality. 

Genetically determined dosage of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) can affect male reproductive parameters. Polymorphism of FSH beta-subunit promoter may have implications for male infertility. 

A systematic review of validated monogenic causes of human male infertility was updated in 2020. Male infertility can have genetic causes. 

In-vitro fertilization can be performed in the presence of antisperm antibodies. Severe male immunological infertility can be treated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Antisperm autoantibodies can affect in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. 

Sperm DNA fragmentation can negatively influence the cumulative live birth rate in intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles of couples with unexplained infertility. Increased sperm nuclear DNA damage can be seen in normozoospermic infertile men. 

Fluorescence in situ hybridization can detect increased sperm aneuploidy in men with recurrent pregnancy loss. 

Large-scale analyses of the X chromosome in infertile men can discover recurrently affected genes associated with spermatogenic failure. 

A treatment algorithm for couples with unexplained infertility can be based on sperm chromatin assessment. 

Pharmacogenetics of FSH action in males and genomic regions determining FSH levels can be significant in idiopathic/unexplained infertile men. 

Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men should follow AUA/ASRM guidelines. 

Comparative analysis of three sperm DNA damage assays can be beneficial.

The text discusses research studies on the impact of various factors on unexplained infertility (UI). These include the presence of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), coeliac disease, and thyroid antibodies. Studies show a correlation between UI and ASA. The presence of ASA in females can slightly lower fertilisation rates after IVF but still result in successful pregnancies. In men, high agglutinin titers can significantly reduce pregnancy rates. The risk of coeliac disease in UI is also higher, and the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies can lower clinical pregnancy rates.

A cross-sectional study found no significant difference in thyroid peroxidase-antibodies between unexplained infertility (UI) patients and controls. Other autoimmune tests were also examined, but data was too sparse to draw conclusions. The recommendation is against testing for anti-sperm antibodies, thyroid antibody and other autoimmune conditions in women with UI, but testing for coeliac disease can be considered. 

In relation to thyroid hormones, slightly higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 were found in women with UI than controls in a case-control study. Another study found higher median TSH levels in the UI group compared to the male infertility group. The recommendation is that TSH measurement is good practice in pre-conception care, but no additional thyroid evaluation is recommended if TSH is within the normal range.

A small cross-sectional study found no significant differences between UI and controls for any of the isolated or combined thrombophilia markers. A large case-control study found that activated protein C resistance (APCR) and/or Factor V Leiden (FVL) were significantly more prevalent in UI women, but this was not significantly associated with lower fertility success rate. Another case-control study found significant differences in the frequency of the MTHFR C677T genotype between UI women and controls.

A higher prevalence of thrombophilia was found in women with unexplained infertility (UI) compared to controls (13% vs. 7.1%). A significantly higher prevalence of prothrombin gene mutation was found in the UI group compared to controls (5.7% vs. 2.1%). However, the presence of Factor V Leiden (FVL) and anticoagulant protein deficiencies was not significantly higher. In another study, no significant difference between UI and control groups for any of the thrombophilia was found. MTHFR C677T was the only gene to show a significant difference between women with UI (22%) and controls (0%). Significantly more mutations in FVL were found in the UI group compared to controls (30.6% vs. 0%), but no significant differences were found in MTHFR or FII mutations. A significant difference in PAI-1 4G-675 allele frequency was found between UI and fertile controls. Testing for thrombophilia in women with UI is not recommended due to the low quality of evidence and high cost compared to potential benefit.

In males with UI, a significantly higher percentage of DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was found compared to controls. Seminal plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl group (PC), and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were significantly elevated in UI versus control group. The ROS-TAC score was significantly lower in UI vs. control groups. ROS negatively correlated with fertilisation and embryo quality. ROS was significantly increased in UI males compared to fertile controls. Seminal MDA, serum MDA, serum nitric oxide, serum 8-OhdG/106dG and leukocyte 8-OhdG/106dG were significantly higher in UI males. ROS was significantly higher in UI males compared to controls, both in neat and washed semen. Lipid peroxidation levels in blood plasma were found to be significantly higher in the UI males group compared to controls. Significant higher ROS was found in UI males compared to fertile sperm donors.

In male patients with unexplained infertility (UI), increased levels were found in semen compared to controls (Desai et al., 2009). However, no significant differences were found between UI and control males for total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) or sperm DNA damage (Verit et al., 2006). A metabolomic analysis found significant differences between UI and fertile males (Zhang et al., 2014). 

In women with UI, oxidative stress markers in the serum and follicular fluid were significantly different compared to controls (Pekel et al., 2015). Oxidant status in follicular fluid and systemic levels were higher in the UI group than the control group (Şentürk et al., 2021). A study found significant differences in the concentrations of 27 metabolites in follicular fluid between infertile females and controls (Lazzarino et al., 2021). Serum nitrite was lower and serum MDA levels were higher in UI compared to controls (Veena et al., 2008). 

In couples, a significant difference was noted only for the eNOS gene, with an increased risk of infertility associated with homozygosity for the 894G-eNOS allele (Faure et al., 2014). 

Measurement of oxidative stress in semen of males with UI should only be considered in the context of research. Measurement of oxidative stress in women with UI is not recommended. 

In genetic tests, abnormalities were found in 3% of patients with UI (Ertosun et al., 2022). Carriers of the FSHB-211 T-allele had significantly higher serum FSH and LH concentrations, and this allele was enriched among infertility patients (Rull et al., 2018). No relationship was found between pregnancy rate and genetic polymorphisms in the PPAR gamma gene (Sahmani et al., 2011). Frequency of genetic polymorphisms of CIAS1 was not significantly different between groups (Witkin et al., 2010). Chromosomal polymorphisms were found in some normozoospermic men with female partners with UI (Suganya et al., 2015). No significant differences in allele frequencies between males with UI and controls were found for genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR (Vani et al., 2021).

The association between chromosome abnormalities and infertility was studied in 1206 women. No association was found between the cause of infertility and prevalence of chromosome abnormalities. However, a higher prevalence of chromosome abnormalities was found in women with secondary infertility compared to those with primary infertility. Genetic or genomic tests are currently not recommended in couples with unexplained infertility due to the lack of specific benefit and high cost.

In a study of 58 men with unexplained infertility (UI), lower vitamin D levels were found compared to fertile men. However, the cumulative live birth rate in the vitamin D-deficient group was lower than the non-deficient group. Despite this, testing for vitamin D deficiency is not recommended for diagnosis of UI as the evidence is of low quality and treatment efficacy is unproven.

The association between prolactin and UI was investigated in several studies, with mixed results. Prolactin testing in women is not recommended due to the poor quality of data and lack of clear benefit.

The effect of body weight on the success rate of IVF in women with UI was studied, finding a higher live birth rate in women with normal weight and slight overweight compared to women with a BMI ≥27 kg/m².

Estradiol was lower on the day of hCG in overweight/obese women under 35 years. In older women, estradiol, progesterone, and LH were lower in those with greater weight. BMI evaluation in women is considered good practice in pre-conception care. While reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs, active weight loss treatment in assisted reproduction has not yet shown a benefit in getting pregnant. This applies equally to patients with unexplained infertility (UI) as to any other causes of infertility.

Metabolic patterns correlate with female infertility and the success of in vitro fertilization. Factors such as subfertility cause, smoking, and body weight can impact the success rate of IVF. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Brazilian women of reproductive age. Ovarian autoimmunity is more frequently found in premature menopause and unexplained infertility than in the general population. Different types of antibodies can influence IVF results. Oxidative stress markers are associated with unexplained male infertility. Antisperm antibodies can influence sperm-cervical mucus interactions and subsequent fertility. Underdiagnosed nutrition imbalances may be responsible for a portion of unexplained infertility. Higher TSH levels within the normal range are associated with unexplained infertility. Anti-endometrial autoantibodies are found in women with a diagnosis of infertility. Changes of sFas and sFasL, oxidative stress markers in serum and follicular fluid can impact patients undergoing IVF. Thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity are found in infertile women. Predictive serum markers for unexplained infertility have been identified. Oxidative stress and altered thyroid hormones are involved in unexplained infertility. Vitamin D levels can influence IVF outcomes. Certain genetic modulators can impact reproductive physiology and health in childbearing age women. Polymorphisms in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ gene may improve fertilization in IVF. Spermatozoa from fertile and infertile individuals convey a distinct miRNA cargo. Increased sperm DNA damage in relation to seminal oxidative stress can negatively impact fertility. Oxidant status plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of unexplained infertility and the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer.

Couples with Unexplained Infertility (UI) can achieve spontaneous pregnancy. Prediction models like the Hunault model have been developed to estimate the chance of spontaneous pregnancy, using factors such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment and previous pregnancy. However, these models are not fully evolved and can only be used once at the point of diagnosis. More dynamic models have been developed, but they are yet to be validated widely or implemented in clinical practice. The effectiveness of a treatment for UI can vary. For instance, one study found no difference in live birth rate when comparing ovarian stimulation and IUI to expectant management in good-prognosis patients. However, another study reported a significant benefit of treatment over expectant management in poor-prognosis patients. Young women with a short duration of infertility have a high prognostic index and the added benefit of active treatment is small. However, with longer duration of infertility and older age, the benefit of active treatment increases. Prognostic models can help in decision-making for treatment plans in couples with UI, but patient preferences should also be considered.

This guideline discusses the management of unexplained infertility (UI). It does not consider timed intercourse without hormonal stimulation as an active treatment. 

Several treatment approaches were compared to expectant management:

- Clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse: One RCT found that the birth rate was slightly lower with this treatment (13%) compared to expectant management (16%). No cost-benefit was found for clomiphene citrate over expectant management.
- Letrozole with timed intercourse: No relevant studies were found.
- Gonadotropins with timed intercourse: No relevant studies were found.
- Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle: One RCT found no significant difference in live birth rates between IUI and expectant management.
- Ovarian stimulation with IUI: A systematic review and meta-analysis found a higher odds ratio for live birth rate in couples with poor prognosis using this treatment compared to expectant management.
- IVF: A systematic review and meta-analysis found a higher odds ratio for live birth with IVF compared to expectant management, although the evidence quality was low.

The guideline recommends IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with UI. It also suggests that the decision to start active treatment should be based on the couple's prognosis. The guideline concludes that IVF is recommended over expectant management, but this decision should be based on patient characteristics and preferences due to high physical and psychological burdens associated with IVF.

The clinical guideline discusses various treatment options for unexplained infertility (UI). In a study comparing Clomiphene Citrate (CC) and letrozole for timed intercourse, no significant differences were found in pregnancy rates. Another study found a higher clinical pregnancy rate with letrozole. No studies were found comparing timed intercourse with letrozole or gonadotropins to Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle. 

A study comparing CC and timed intercourse to IUI found higher live birth rates with IUI. No studies were found comparing timed intercourse with letrozole or gonadotropins to IUI in a natural cycle. 

In a study comparing CC and timed intercourse to Ovarian Stimulation (OS) and IUI, conception rates were not significantly different. No studies were found comparing timed intercourse with letrozole to OS and IUI. 

A systematic review comparing OS with timed intercourse to OS and IUI found uncertain results regarding live birth rates and multiple pregnancy rates. Another systematic review found higher live birth rates with OS and IUI compared to IUI in a natural cycle. 

A systematic review compared In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) with IUI in a natural cycle and found higher live birth rates with IVF. Another systematic review found significantly higher live birth rates with IVF compared to IUI with OS, with no significant difference in multiple pregnancy rates. 

The overall recommendation is to use IUI with ovarian stimulation as a first-line treatment for couples with UI, with care needed to avoid multiple pregnancies and Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). IVF is probably not recommended over IUI with ovarian stimulation, with the decision to use IVF being individualized by patient characteristics such as age, duration of infertility, previous treatment, and previous pregnancy.

There is a lack of high-quality RCTs on the topic. IUI in combination with OS is not inferior to IVF. Considering the additional costs and risks of IVF, IUI in a stimulated cycle for three to six cycles is viewed as the first-line treatment in couples with unexplained infertility. The decision to use IVF is individualized by patient characteristics. IVF is as effective as IUI with OS in treatment-naïve patients, but IUI is recommended as the first-line treatment due to lower costs and invasiveness.

An RCT compared IVF with ICSI in couples with unexplained infertility and found no differences in live birth rate. Given comparable live birth rates and additional resources and costs associated, ICSI is not routinely recommended for unexplained infertility. 

In an RCT, 200 women with at least two years of unexplained infertility and without suspicion of uterine abnormalities were randomly assigned to have office microhysteroscopy or not. In the microhysteroscopy group, the ongoing pregnancy rate was higher.

In a study on fibroid removal, it's uncertain if surgical removal of fibroids improved clinical pregnancy rates or had any impact on miscarriage rates. Hysteroscopy for the detection and correction of intrauterine abnormalities is not recommended due to insufficient evidence. The effectiveness of hysteroscopic surgery in unexplained infertility is unclear and surgery is only advised in a controlled research setting. 

For treatment of uterine fibroids in unexplained infertility, there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation. 

Tubal flushing with oil-soluble contrast media (OSCM) may increase the odds of live birth and clinical pregnancy. It is uncertain whether flushing with water-soluble contrast media (WSCM) increases live birth or pregnancy rate. OSCM probably increases the odds of clinical pregnancy compared to WSCM. 

HSG (tubal flushing) with an oil-soluble contrast medium is preferable over a water-soluble contrast medium. 

In a study on minimal to mild endometriosis, laparoscopic surgery showed an improvement in clinical pregnancy rate. If minimal to mild endometriosis is found incidentally at laparoscopy, it is not considered unexplained infertility. 

Finally, a recent trial in women with unexplained infertility showed no difference in the outcomes of live birth after endometrial biopsy or placebo procedure.

An RCT with 234 women with unexplained infertility (UI) showed a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate in women receiving endometrial scratch compared to mock biopsy. However, there was no significant difference in miscarriage rate. 

In an RCT with 96 women with UI, there was no statistical difference in ongoing pregnancy rate between women undergoing endometrial scratch or not. 

In a trial of 150 women with UI, there was no difference in ongoing pregnancy rate or multiple pregnancy rate between those who received a scratch on day 6 -7 of their treatment cycle and those who did not. 

An RCT with 120 women with UI showed no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate between women undergoing endometrial injury or not. 

Another RCT with 80 women with UI also found no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rate between women undergoing endometrial scratch or not. 

An RCT with 154 women with UI showed a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate in women receiving endometrial injury compared to controls. However, there was no statistical difference in multiple pregnancy rate or abortion rate.

The guideline recommendation is that endometrial scratching should not be offered for unexplained infertility. This is because, although endometrial scratching or injury has been proposed to increase the probability of pregnancy, the evidence does not show better pregnancy outcome if scratching was performed before intercourse or before intrauterine insemination in couples with UI.

The Unexplained Infertility guideline 2023 discusses the effectiveness of alternative therapeutic approaches such as antioxidants, acupuncture, nutraceuticals (inositol), psychotherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy. 

The evidence shows no significant benefit of antioxidant treatment in males or females with unexplained infertility. Similarly, the evidence on acupuncture is limited and of low quality, therefore it cannot be recommended for patients with unexplained infertility. 

As for nutraceuticals, there is no convincing evidence of benefit. The guideline also mentions that no relevant studies were identified investigating the effect of psychotherapy in couples with unexplained infertility. However, psychotherapy can help infertility patients to improve health-related quality of life, anxiety and/or depression. 

One uncontrolled study was identified regarding TCM, where Onkyeong-tang and herbal medicine for ovulation and implantation were administered to women with unexplained infertility. The live birth rate was 7.8%, ongoing pregnancy per clinical pregnancy was 53.85% and 37% of women experienced adverse events, but none were serious. 

There is also mention of diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy, but no specific evidence or recommendations are provided in the guideline.

No studies were found investigating the effect of diet, exercise or behavioural therapy in couples with unexplained infertility (UI). However, a healthy diet and regular exercise, with behavioural therapy when necessary, are recommended. This is because reproductive outcomes are known to be impaired in men and women with low and high BMIs. Patients generally value advice about lifestyle and healthy alternatives to maximise fertility.

In terms of quality of life (QoL), there is likely no difference between women with unexplained infertility and those with known causes of infertility, except when the cause is PCOS, where QoL is lower. For men with unexplained infertility, QoL is likely higher than those with known causes of infertility, except when the cause is a partner with PCOS. It is possible that QoL is impaired in the partner who is perceived to be responsible for infertility.

The guideline development group (GDG) from various universities and hospitals worldwide has declared potential conflicts of interest. These include honoraria, speaker's fees, consulting fees, research grants, and positions in advisory boards or societies. The GDG has identified research gaps in the area of unexplained infertility and recommends that future research should focus on developing a predictive model to compare outcomes of different management strategies for couples with unexplained infertility, determining the optimal assisted reproductive technology for unexplained infertility, and assessing the value of current methods to evaluate sperm DNA integrity in predicting clinical outcomes in couples with unexplained infertility. The GDG also emphasizes the importance of research on male infertility, given the global decline in sperm quality.

The text proposes a paradigm shift in the treatment of male factor infertility, focusing on identifying new causes, clinical diagnostics, and treatment options. This will allow for more personalized therapeutic options to improve reproductive outcomes. Research gaps identified include the role of vaginal microbiota, predictive models for fertility, causes of Unexplained Infertility (UI), the impact of sperm DNA damage, the value of sperm function tests, the role of lifestyle intervention, and the role of oxidative stress markers in semen and endometrial implantation. Other areas of interest include the relationship between regular menstrual cycles and proof of ovulation, and the impact of hysteroscopic removal of endometrial polyps or resection of a uterine septum on live birth rates. The text also questions if age-related infertility can be prevented.

A guideline development group (GDG) organized online meetings to discuss and redefine key questions through the PICO process, resulting in a list of 21 key questions. Literature searches were performed by a methodological expert, using key words in PUBMED/MEDLINE and the Cochrane library. Searches were initially for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, then randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case reports if necessary. Papers that were withdrawn or had a note of concern were excluded. The quality of the selected papers was assessed using a quality assessment checklist. Key outcomes for this guideline were full-term singleton birth, live birth, ongoing pregnancy rate, and multiple pregnancies/births. GDG meetings were held to discuss draft recommendations and reach a consensus. Recommendations were labeled as either ‘strong’ or ‘conditional’ according to the GRADE approach. The final guideline draft was published on the ESHRE website for review. A standard dissemination procedure for all ESHRE guidelines includes publishing and announcement. Patient versions of the guideline will be developed to help patients understand the guideline’s recommendations and aid in clinical decision-making.

The current guideline will be considered for revision in 2027, four years after publication. An intermediate search for new evidence will be performed two years after publication, which will inform the GDG of the necessity of an update. Corrections to the publication will be updated on the web version of the document. The guideline draft was open for review for 6 weeks, between 12 December 2022 and 30 January 2023. All reviewers, their comments and the reply of the guideline development group are summarized in the review report, which is published on the ESHRE website.
