Key recommendations
•
•
The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) should be considered
in pregnant women who have itching in skin of normal appearance and raised
peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more. [Grade D]
Additional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended
unless itch is associated with atypical clinical symptoms, the presence of relevant
comorbidities, or in early onset severe ICP. Consider additional postnatal
investigations in women in whom resolution of abnormal liver function tests is
delayed or does not occur. [Grade C]
⚫ Consider discussing the care of women with severe, very early or atypical presentation
of what appears to be ICP with a hepatologist. [Grade D]
•
• Confirm the diagnosis of ICP in the postnatal period at least 4 weeks after birth,
with resolution of itching and liver function tests returning to normal (including
bile acids). [Grade D]
Advise women with isolated ICP and a singleton pregnancy that the risk of
stillbirth only increases above population rate once their serum bile acid
concentration is 100 micromol/L or more.
o In women with peak bile acids 19-39 micromol/L (mild ICP) and no other risk
factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk.
Consider options of planned birth by 40 weeks' gestation or ongoing antenatal
care according to national guidance.
o In women with peak bile acids 40-99 micromol/L (moderate ICP) and no other
risk factors, advise them that the known risk of stillbirth is similar to the
background risk until 38-39 weeks' gestation. Consider planned birth at
38-39 weeks' gestation.
o In women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more (severe ICP), advise them
that the risk of stillbirth is higher than the background risk. Consider planned
birth at 35-36 weeks' gestation. [Grade A]
Advise women with ICP and a twin pregnancy that the risk of stillbirth is higher
compared with a twin pregnancy without ICP. [Grade D]
Clinicians should be aware that fetal ultrasound and/or cardiotocography (CTG)
do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP. [Grade D]

Advise women with ICP that the presence of risk factors or co-morbidities (such as
gestational diabetes and/or pre-eclampsia and/or multifetal pregnancy) appear to
increase the risk of stillbirth and may influence decision-making around timing of
planned birth. [Grade D]
• Advise women that there are no treatments that improve pregnancy outcome (or
raised bile acid concentrations) and treatments to improve maternal itching are of
limited benefit. [Grade A]
• Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for the purpose of reducing adverse
perinatal outcomes in women with ICP. [Grade A]

1 | PURPOSE AND SCOpe
This guideline summarises the evidence regarding the di-
agnosis, and the maternal and fetal risks of intrahepatic
cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), previously called obstetric
cholestasis. It provides guidance regarding the different care
options available. These should be considered in conjunc-
tion with the wishes of the woman, as part of shared and
informed decision-making.
While some high quality randomised controlled trials
in ICP have now been completed, many publications do not
have such a rigorous design, and this limits the ability to pro-
vide detailed evidence-based recommendations for specific
aspects of care. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted along
with recommendations for future research in this field.
Within this document we use the terms pregnant woman
and women's health. However, it is important to acknowl-
edge that it is not only people who identify as women for
whom it is necessary to access care. Obstetric and gynaecol-
ogy services and delivery of care must therefore be appropri-
ate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals
whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were
assigned at birth.
2 | INTRODUCTION
The care of women and pregnant people with ICP is driven
by concern from women and from healthcare professionals
over the potential increased risk of stillbirth. Reduction of
stillbirth is a priority in maternity care in the UK.'
Prevalence is influenced by genetic and environmental
aspects and varies between populations. In the UK, ICP af-
fects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and
1.2%-1.5% of women of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian
2,3
origin.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a multifactorial
condition. It is characterised by pruritus in the absence of
a primary skin condition, with abnormal maternal bile
acid concentrations. The onset of symptoms is most com-
mon in the third trimester, but can be earlier in pregnancy.*
Alternative diagnoses (such as pre-eclampsia) should always
be considered before a diagnosis of ICP is made; it is also
possible for other conditions to co-exist. Pruritus and raised
bile acid concentrations should return to normal after birth.
Ideally, all women with ICP should have liver function
tests (including bile acids) checked after birth, as a propor-
tion may have persistent abnormalities suggestive of addi-
tional or alternative comorbidities (such as non-alcoholic
fatty liver). Few studies have reported comprehensive post-
natal follow-up of women to assess for additional diagnoses.
There are no clinical features or laboratory patterns that
are unique to ICP, as other conditions can cause itching, or
raised bile acid concentrations in pregnancy. Around 25% of
pregnant women develop itching 2,5; the majority of these do
not have and do not develop ICP.
6
Historically, ICP has been diagnosed in women on the
basis of self-reported itching together with elevation of any
of a wide range of liver function tests beyond pregnancy-
specific limits. There is now increasing evidence that in
singleton pregnancies, most liver function tests do not re-
flect risk of fetal demise and that only maternal total bile
acid concentrations results are associated with the risk of
stillbirth.
A meta-analysis of 23 studies involving 5557 women
with ICP and 165 136 healthy controls, and the first indi-
vidual patient data analysis of 5269 women with ICP from
27 studies has been published since this guideline was last
updated. In singleton pregnancies, stillbirth was associated
with maximum total bile acid concentration, especially over
100 micromol/L. In pregnancies with co-morbidities that
themselves may impact on pregnancy outcome (such as mul-
tifetal, diabetic, pre-eclamptic pregnancies), these must be
taken into account when considering risks and care options.
Bile acid concentrations are not associated with intensity
of itching. Other liver blood tests, such as alanine trans-
aminase or aspartate transaminase are not associated with
pregnancy outcome." In light of this, the consensus is now
that the diagnosis of ICP requires elevated maternal bile
acid concentrations, and that women and pregnant people
with itching and isolated raised transaminases alone (with
normal bile acid concentrations) should not be given a di-
agnosis of ICP. This is supported by the recent systematic
review described above, in which there was no association
between abnormal maternal transaminase concentrations
and stillbirth.

INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY
2.1 What terminology should be used to
describe the conditions?
Most published studies to date have included women with ICP
diagnosed on the basis of itch and elevated bile acids above the
laboratory reference range. In a study of 560 women a preg-
nancy specific reference range for non-fasting bile acids was
calculated with an upper limit of normal of 18 micromol/L.10
In light of the meta-analysis and individual patient data
analysis showing that stillbirth risk is not linked with alanine
transaminase levels, but is linked with peak bile acid concen-
tration, the suggested terminology for pregnant women with
otherwise unexplained itching is outlined in Table 1.
2.2 | What are the clinical issues for women
with ICP?
The clinical issues for women and pregnant people with
ICP may include coping with the itching, monitoring op-
tions during the pregnancy, options for controlling mater-
nal symptoms, reducing fetal risk, preterm birth, difficulty
sleeping, anxiety about the condition, and optimal timing
of birth. Itching varies in nature between different women
and for some women at different times, from mild to un-
bearable and from focal to widespread, and for some women
this can have an adverse impact on their mental wellbeing.
Liver failure (impaired synthetic function such as prolonged
prothrombin time, or metabolic dysfunction such as hypo-
glycaemia) is not a typical feature of ICP.

The diagnosis of ICP should 4
be considered in pregnant
women who have itching in
skin of normal appearance
and raised peak random
total bile acid concentration
of 19 micromol/L or more.
The diagnosis is more
likely if it is confirmed that
itching and raised bile acids
resolve after birth
If a diagnosis of ICP is
suspected, carry out a
structured history and
examination, so that other
causes of itching and liver
dysfunction can be excluded
Offer repeat liver function
tests and bile acid
measurement (depending
on gestation and clinical
context) in women with

New onset pruritus in pregnant women, if associated
with rash is unlikely to be ICP. If the itchy skin looks
abnormal (other than excoriations) then another cause
should be considered. Liver function tests and bile acids
are not required routinely. Clinicians should be aware
however, that skin conditions (e.g. eczema) and ICP can
co-exist.

Obstetrics and Gynaecology
If the itchy skin looks normal, or there is only skin
trauma due to scratching, the diagnosis may include ges-
tational pruritus, or ICP (see Table 1); measurement of
bile acid concentrations and liver function tests should be
undertaken. Raised bile acid concentration of 19 micro-
mol/L or more in pregnancy supports a diagnosis of ICP.
[Evidence level 4]
When clinically indicated, bile acid measurements should
be taken at a convenient time, and do not need to be per-
formed fasting. By taking a non-fasting upper limit of nor-
mal up to 19 micromol/L for bile acid concentrations, almost
20% of women previously considered to have ICP (as their
bile acid concentrations are below 19 micromol/L but above
the standard laboratory cut off) do not have this diagnosis.
Published data indicate that pregnant women with raised
bile acids less than 19 micromol/L are not at increased risk
of stillbirth.10 In addition, as prandial readings are higher
than fasting, this approach maximises the chance of detect-
ing peak bile acid readings that are of greater clinical impor-
tance for preventing adverse pregnancy outcome.
Itching of normal skin, liver dysfunction and elevated bile
acid concentrations are non-specific and have a wide range
of causes. A healthcare professional should carry out a struc-
tured history and examination, and consider other potential
diagnoses: these may be pregnancy specific (including pre-
eclampsia) or coincidental to the pregnancy (comprehen-
sively reviewed by Walker et al). 12 Drug reactions, allergic
reactions, and urticaria should form part of the differential
diagnosis. [Evidence level 4]
13
In women and pregnant people with persistent itch of
normal skin and normal blood results, an initial diagnosis of
gestational pruritus should be considered. Women can go on
to develop ICP up to 15 weeks after a diagnosis of gestational
pruritus. If itching continues for these women, they should
be offered review with repeated liver function tests and bile
acid measurement as clinically indicated. The frequency and
duration of review and tests should be determined on an in-
dividual basis, but might be based around scheduled care. The
gestational age is also relevant in determining test frequency,
particularly later in the third trimester when a diagnosis of ICP
may change care around the timing of birth (aiming to reduce
the risk of stillbirth) [see Section 5.2]. Use pregnancy-specific
reference ranges for liver function tests. [Evidence level 4]
6
Pruritus and biochemical abnormalities usually persist
throughout pregnancy in women with ICP, although it
is very common for them to fluctuate. However, in a few
women, pruritus and biochemical abnormalities will re-
solve completely for the remainder of the pregnancy; clini-
cians may then need to reconsider the cause of the original
symptoms and why resolution has occurred. There are
many causes of transient liver function test abnormalities,
such as drug reactions (e.g. to antibiotics) or non-specific
viral illnesses. When resolution occurs during pregnancy,
it is unlikely that the original diagnosis was correct. In dis-
cussion with the woman or pregnant person, ongoing care
can usually return to normal, and decisions about timing of
birth should be based on usual obstetric practice, although
GREEN-TOP GUIDELINE NO. 43
there should be greater caution if bile acid concentrations
have been markedly raised (e.g. 100 micromol/L or more).

Rationale for the
Strength recommendation
A cohort study
showed that
the likelihood
that routine
investigations
would identify
other causes of the
clinical picture was
extremely low
Previous RCOG guidelines ¹ have recommended rou-
tine laboratory and imaging investigations to exclude
other causes for the clinical picture of ICP, including
viral and autoimmune tests and liver ultrasound. A re-
cent retrospective review of over 500 pregnant women
with raised bile acid concentrations suggests that the
likelihood of identifying a viral, autoimmune, or struc-
tural cause for the itching and liver derangement that
was not suspected on other clinical grounds is extremely
low as no new diagnoses were made following investi-
gations. Therefore, routine use of other investigations
is no longer recommended. The UK National Screening
Committee does not recommend routine screening for
hepatitis C in pregnancy due to lack of evidence of ben-
efit; the same uncertainties apply to pregnant women
with ICP. Routine hepatitis C testing is therefore not cur-
rently recommended in women with suspected or proven
ICP. Additional investigations (including for hepatitis
C) should be considered in women and pregnant people
with an atypical or uncertain picture of ICP. This may
include women with markedly elevated transaminases,
early onset of ICP in the first or second trimester, a rap-
idly progressive biochemical picture, any features of liver
failure or evidence of acute infection, or if resolution does
not occur after birth. [Evidence level 2+]

Three cohort studies of 223 women, 17 531 women¹ and
745 women with ICP who had routine coagulation testing
reported no cases of prolonged prothrombin time in women
with uncomplicated clinical presentations. The small num-
ber of abnormal results were in women with alternative di-
agnoses (such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy). Coagulation
testing is therefore not recommended routinely for women
and pregnant people with uncomplicated ICP. It should be
considered on an individual basis especially when failure of
liver synthetic function or failure of fat absorption is sus-
pected. [Evidence level 2+]

For many women with ICP, itching will stop very soon
after birth; in the majority it stops in the first few hours or
days.
Liver function tests are non-specific and can become ab-
normal during birth. Alanine transaminase and aspartate
transaminase are found in smooth muscle, breast and red
blood cells and may be elevated for other reasons in the im-
mediate post-partum period. [Evidence level 4]
19
Women with ICP who have no other diagnoses are usu-
ally clinically well; liver function tests and bile acids should
not be measured until at least 4 weeks after birth, to allow
time for levels to return to a normal range. If the woman
or pregnant person is clinically unwell, other or additional
diagnoses should be suspected and liver function testing
should be repeated sooner, as clinically indicated. [Evidence

Women who develop pruritus and abnormalities in
liver function and bile acids in the first or second trimes-
ter and especially in the first trimester are more likely to
have an underlying genetic predisposition or an alterna-
tive or additional diagnosis. Input from a hepatologist
and/or a clinician with a special interest in cholestasis to
discuss investigations and treatment options should be
considered. A postnatal referral should also be considered

Itching is the main symptom of ICP. The itching is not
specific to any single location; it is often generalised and may
affect the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet; it
ay vary in intensity.² For women and pregnant people with
gestational pruritus or ICP, there is poor correlation between
severity of itch and level of bile acids,³ and regardless of the
diagnosis, itch can be very severe for some women and may
negatively impact their emotional wellbeing and mental
health. The itching is often more pronounced at night, which
can interfere with sleep. [Evidence level 2+]

[Evidence level 2+]
The incidence of pre-eclampsia was higher in women
with ICP (odds ratio [OR] 3.7 [95% CI 3.2-4.3]): 12.2%
of women with ICP had pre-eclampsia compared
with 3.4% of women without ICP (228/1876 versus
3385/94 386). As pre-eclampsia can be diagnosed at any
gestation from the mid-second trimester, healthcare
professionals should ensure that women and pregnant
people with ICP receive ongoing blood pressure and
urinalysis screening for pre-eclampsia alongside review
for ICP.21 [Evidence level 1+]
In a meta-analysis of more than 5000 women with ICP,
rates of gestational diabetes were higher in women with
ICP (OR 2.4 [95% CI 2.1-2.8]): 13.2% of women with ICP
had already been diagnosed with gestational diabetes com-
pared with 5.9% of women without ICP (239/1806 versus
5571/94384). Additional testing for gestational diabetes is
not currently recommended; risk assessment and testing
for gestational diabetes should follow national guidelines.²

A large Swedish population-based study of 11388
women with ICP and 113 893 controls found that women
who have had ICP had an increased likelihood of later
being diagnosed with hepatobiliary disease (hazard ratio
(HR) 2.62 [95% CI 2.47-2.77]); 15% in women with ICP
versus 6.3% in controls), predominantly due to gall-
stone disease (HR 2.72 [2.55–2.91]; 11.6% versus 4.6%). 23
However gallstones are common, affecting 5-25% of
adults in high income countries, and it is unclear
whether gallstone disease predates ICP in such women.
[Evidence level 2-]
24
The same study found an association between ICP
and immune-mediated diseases later in life (HR 1.28
[1.19-1.38]; 7.2% versus 5.8%). These included diabetes
(HR 1.47 [1.26–1.72]; 1.7% versus 1.2%), thyroid disease
(HR 1.30 [1.14–1.47]; 2.5% versus 2.0%), psoriasis (HR
1.27 [1.07–1.51]; 1.4% versus 1.1%), inflammatory poly-
arthropathies (HR 1.32 [1.11–1.58]; 1.3% versus 0.9%)
and Crohn's disease (HR 1.55 [1.14-2.10]; 0.4% versus
0.3%), but not ulcerative colitis (HR 1.21 [0.93–1.58];
0.6% versus 0.5%). 25 Most of these conditions remain at
low absolute incidence. The benefit of routine regular
screening for these conditions is not proven in women
and pregnant people after ICP and is not currently rec-
ommended. [Evidence level 2-]
Women with ICP have a reported small increased
chance of a subsequent diagnosis of other conditions,
such as hepatitis C. The UK strategy for hepatitis C de-
tection is based on additional investigations on high-risk
groups (e.g. those who have hepatitis B) and does not at
present include women with current or previous ICP.26
In general, after an episode of ICP women do not require
additional screening nor follow up.

Stillbirth remains the major concern for women and

titioners. A large systematic review and individual patient
data meta-analysis of women with ICP reported that, for
singleton pregnancies, the risk of stillbirth only increased
above population rate once serum bile acid concentrations
were 100 micromol/L or more (Table 2).7
The national stillbirth rates from 28 weeks' gestation for
2015 for countries contributing to these ICP data varied
from 0.18% to 0.72% depending on country; the UK still-
birth rate was 0.29%.7
The pathophysiology of stillbirth in ICP is uncertain, but
it is thought that bile acids may cause an acute fetal anoxic
event possibly due to fetal arrhythmia27 or acute placental

In singleton pregnancies, stillbirth was as-
sociated with peak total bile acid concentration but not with
alanine transaminase." [Evidence level 1+]
A 12-month UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)
study in 2010-2011 reviewed 669 cases of ICP in singleton
pregnancy with bile acids 40 micromol/L or more across
the UK which included 10 stillbirths. 29 Of these, seven had
coexistent pregnancy complications (three had gestational
diabetes; two had pre-eclampsia; two had non-specified
complications). These differences remained significant
against national data and suggest that women with ICP
and other comorbidities warrant additional surveillance.
[Evidence level 2+]
The aetiology of adverse perinatal outcomes, including
stillbirth, in multifetal pregnancies is multifactorial. The
risk of stillbirth in multifetal pregnancies is higher than in
singleton pregnancies.30 [Evidence level 2-]
31
One retrospective cohort study from China specifically
evaluated ICP in twin pregnancies.³¹ They reviewed 129 twin
pregnancies complicated with ICP and 1793 twin pregnan-
cies without ICP (2006-2014). There was an increased risk of
stillbirth in twin pregnancies with ICP compared with twin
pregnancy without ICP (3.9% versus 0.8%, aOR 5.75 [95%
CI 2.00-16.6]). This was further stratified as a stillbirth risk
of 3.3% in women with bile acids of 10-39 micromol/L and
5.1% in women with bile acids of 40 micromol/L or more.
Stillbirths with ICP in twin pregnancies occurred between
33-35 weeks' gestation, compared to 36-38 weeks' gestation
among singletons. [Evidence level 2-]

management' with planned early birth (despite a limited ev-
idence base for this approach). 32 The percentage of women
with singleton pregnancies who gave birth before 37 weeks
increased with increasing bile acid concentration: 16.5%
of women with bile acids below 40 micromol/L (373/2264),
19.1% of women with bile acids 40–99 micromol (261/1368),

Fluctuating bile acid concentrations but peak concentra-
tions within the boundaries for their current diagnosis.
[Evidence level 4]
All women with itch and an initial raised bile acid level,
should have a second bile acid measurement repeated around
1 week later before any diagnostic or care decisions are deter-
mined, as it is common for women with bile acid levels over
100 micromol/L and 40-100 micromol/L to have subsequent
bile acid concentrations that are much lower.³
The subsequent frequency at which women and pregnant
people have biochemical assessment will be determined on
an individual basis and according to the impact that the re-
sult might have on further care (see Section 8.1):
• If the woman has mild ICP with peak bile acids 19-39 mi-
cromol/L, they could have weekly testing as they approach
38 weeks' gestation in order to inform timing of birth.
• If the woman has moderate ICP with peak bile acid 40-99 mi-
cromol/L, especially if they are approaching 35 weeks' gesta-
tion, weekly testing should be considered, as timing of birth
may be influenced if levels rise to 100 micromol/L or more.
• If the woman has severe ICP with peak bile acid 100 mi-
cromol/L or more, further routine testing of bile acids
might not impact on decision making and therefore may
not be routinely required. [Evidence level 4]

ICP is not associated with fetal growth restriction, with
no difference in birthweight centiles compared with babies

Chlorphenamine has antihistamine properties and may
have sedative side-effects in some women. The effective-
ness of the treatment is uncertain in women and pregnant
people with ICP, and relief may be more related to its seda-
tive action than a direct effect. There is experience of using
chlorphenamine in other conditions in pregnancy (such as
hay fever) and harmful effects have not been reported. Other
common antihistamine agents including loratadine and ce-
tirizine are also used in pregnancy for other indications but
do not have sedative side-effects. [Evidence level 4]
Ursodeoxycholic acid
The role of drug treatment in ICP is to try to reduce ma-
ternal itching (which may be of variable intensity and is un-
related to bile acid concentrations). There is no evidence that
routine medical treatment improves maternal raised bile acid

Although there is minimal high-quality evidence to en-
dorse topical emollient treatment in women with ICP and it
is not a disease-modifying drug, there is consensus that such
treatment may relieve some of the discomfort associated
with itching and has no known harmful effects. [Evidence

Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that
there is no reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes in women
prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid, compared to women in the
39,40
placebo group. No sub-group (e.g. based on maternal bile
acid concentrations, or gestational age at presentation) was
identified that might benefit. [Evidence level 1+]

There is a small (around 5 mm, on a linear 0 to 100 mm
itch scale with 0 'no itch' and 100 'worst imaginable itch') re-
duction in maternal itch in women taking ursodeoxycholic
acid. 39 Women and clinicians considered that a reduction of
at least 30 mm on the itch scale would be clinically relevant
and worthwhile; the majority of women would therefore
not consider this a useful treatment. It remains possible
that some women's and pregnant people's itching may re-
duce with ursodeoxycholic acid, but it is not clear how such
women might be identified. A recent secondary analysis of
the largest trial could not identify a cohort based on bile acid

A systematic review and individual participant meta-
analysis of ursodeoxycholic acid in ICP included four ran-
domised controlled trials of over 800 women (of whom 183
had bile acid of 40 micromol/L or more) with a primary
outcome of stillbirth and a composite secondary outcome
of stillbirth and preterm birth.ª¹ Ursodeoxycholic acid had
no impact on the primary endpoint. Spontaneous preterm
birth under 34 weeks' gestation was not reduced (5/387
women taking ursodeoxycholic acid versus 6/366 women
taking placebo, aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23-2.51, p 0.65).
Spontaneous preterm birth under 37 weeks' gestation was
reduced in women taking ursodeoxycholic acid compared
with placebo (18/387 versus 32/366 aOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-
0.86, p = 0.015).

In women with bile acid concentrations 40 micromol/L
or more who are 34-36 weeks' gestation, ursodeoxycholic
acid may offer some benefit in reducing late preterm birth.
However, as with other circumstances where preterm birth
occurs it is not clear that this reduction results in any ben-
efit to the baby. The optimal starting gestation and dosing
regimen are unclear. Some women and pregnant people with
bile acid concentrations of 40 micromol/L or more may wish
to take ursodeoxycholic acid with a view to prolonging ges-
tation, but as this does not prevent stillbirth, the advantage
of doing so may be less clear, especially for those with bile
acids over 100 micromol/L.
In the largest trial, maternal bile acid concentrations
were found to be higher in the group treated with ur-
sodeoxycholic acid,39 possibly as a result of standard
laboratory assays being unable to distinguish between
endogenous and exogenous sources. Ursodeoxycholic acid
cannot therefore be recommended for the purpose of re-
ducing this biochemical marker of disease. In the same
trial, women treated with ursodeoxycholic acid had lower
alanine transaminase levels than those taking placebo,
but the clinical implications of this are uncertain, as al-
anine transaminase levels have no association with still-
birth. [Evidence level 1+]

Active care in ICP, usually referring to planned birth
around 38 weeks' gestation, came into practice in many set-
tings, including the UK, despite inadequate evaluation of
its benefit or an understanding of which women with ICP
might be at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.
Previous studies had reported on cohorts of women with
ICP, often after introduction of active care, and speculated
that low stillbirth risk is related to such a policy, but few
had evaluated prognostic factors to allow better stratifica-
tion to tailor timing of birth. [Evidence level 1+]

A large systematic review and individual patient data
meta-analysis of women with ICP has reported that the
risk of stillbirth is 0.13% in women with peak bile acids less
than 40 micromol/L, which is not higher than background
population risk. Although the risk of stillbirth remains
low throughout gestation for these women, the benefits of
continuing the pregnancy after 40 weeks' gestation may be
outweighed by the risk, therefore it is reasonable to discuss
with the woman or pregnant person whether they wish to
continue the pregnancy or have a planned birth. [Evidence

The risk of stillbirth in women with peak bile acids of 40-
99 micromol/L was 0.28%. This was not higher than over-
all background population risk, but did appear to increase
at around 38-39 weeks' gestation. Although the number of
affected pregnancies is small and the confidence intervals
wide, it is reasonable to offer planned birth at this gesta-
tion for women and pregnant people with peak bile acids of
40-99 micromol/L, or earlier if other comorbidities (such as
gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia) are present. [Evidence

For women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or
more, the risk of stillbirth is 3.44%, which is higher than
background population rate, and the risk appears to in-
crease from 35-36 weeks' gestation. This information
should be shared with the woman or pregnant person and
planned birth considered, based on other factors and the
woman's preferences. This is in keeping with other studies
using different methodologies, including a retrospective
cohort study of 1604386 pregnancies assessing compos-

If the woman or pregnant person has existing obstet-

with mild ICP (peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L) and no

of continuous electronic fetal monitoring is uncertain;
the presence of any other risk factors should be taken
into account. In women with severe ICP (peak bile acids
100 micromol/L or more), in light of evidence that there
is a risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in these women,
continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered.
Women with moderate and severe ICP are more likely to

algesia and anaesthesia for birth and national guidance
should be followed. 33 Three cohort studies of 223 women,'
531 women¹5 and 745 women¹8 with ICP described above in
Section 4.2, who had routine coagulation testing reported no
cases of prolonged prothrombin time in women with uncom-
plicated clinical presentations. The small number of abnor-
mal results occurred in women with alternative diagnoses
(such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy). [Evidence level 4]

INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY
In women who have had ICP, itch usually stops after
birth, often in the first few days, and liver function tests and
bile acid concentrations should return to normal within a
few weeks. At postnatal follow-up, the healthcare profes-
sional should ensure that itching has resolved and should
confirm that maternal bile acid concentrations and liver
function tests have normalised. If itching or biochemical
abnormalities persist beyond 6 weeks postpartum, consider
other diagnoses depending upon the history and examina-
tion findings. Referral to a hepatologist may be required.

methods
BJOG
An International Journal of
Obstetrics and Gynaecology
e107
Combined hormonal contraception can be used in
women with ICP (UKMEC 2) provided they do not also
have a history of contraception related cholestasis. It was
previously thought that women with a history of ICP may
have an increased risk of developing cholestasis when using
oestrogen-containing hormonal contraception, but this is
unlikely for the majority of women. The 2016 UKMEC states
that in women who have had ICP the advantages of using
these oestrogen-containing methods outweigh this theoreti-
cal risk (UKMEC category 2)53 and women may thus choose
to use this method. Resolution of itching and liver function
tests and bile acid concentrations returning to normal lev-
els should be confirmed before commencing this method.
[Evidence level 4] Advise women to attend for review if recur-
rence of itch and abnormal liver function tests occur while
using combined hormonal contraception, this would give a
diagnosis of contraceptive-related cholestasis (UKMEC 3)
and alternative contraception options should be discussed.
[Evidence level 4]
For women with an atypical presentation of ICP, atypi-
cal postnatal clinical course, where other diagnoses are sus-
pected, or where itching and liver function tests have not
resolved, a personalised approach to contraceptive choice
should be undertaken, with provision of information about
avoidance of pregnancy with active liver disease.
For menopausal women considering hormonal replace-
ment therapy (HRT), national recommendations should be
followed.54 Current UKMEC guidance is that oestrogen-
containing contraception can be used in women with a
history of ICP. It therefore seems reasonable to offer the
lower physiological dose of oestrogen found in HRT, with
review of use if women develop itching or other signs of
cholestasis.

from UKMEC
guidance on
exogenous
oestrogen use
As with all women and pregnant people, discussion about
methods of contraception should begin during the antenatal
period²¹ and continue in the early postpartum days. 52 This
should include the health benefits of spacing pregnancies,
consideration of medical conditions and/or patient char-
acteristics affecting contraceptive choice (such as venous
thromboemblism risk factors, breastfeeding, medical his-
tory), the reliability and benefits of long-acting reversible
contraceptive methods, and the additional use of condoms if
there is a risk of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. 53
[Evidence level 4]
The 2016 UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC) for
Contraceptive Use advises that copper-bearing intra-uterine
devices, levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine systems,
progestogen-only implant, progestogen-only injectable, and
progestogen-only pill can be used without restriction in
women with a history of ICP (UKMEC category 1).53

population, but the precise magnitude of this is unclear, as
quoted rates of recurrence are based on small studies (e.g. of 18
women 55 and 69 women 56) and the results may not be general-
izable to a wider UK population with ICP. At booking in subse-
quent pregnancies, baseline measurement of liver function tests
and bile acid concentrations should be performed in order to
establish that these are normal. They should only be repeated if
clinically indicated. [Evidence level 3]
10 | RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
FUTURE RESEARCH
• In women with ICP:
。 Which maternal or fetal prognostic tools and/or mon-
itoring modalities predict adverse perinatal outcome
(including preterm birth and stillbirth)?
。 Should women with ICP be tested for gestational dia-
betes (and by what method)?
。 What is an effective treatment for itching?
。 What is an effective treatment to prevent adverse peri-
natal outcomes?
• In pregnant women with raised bile acids, what is the nat-
ural history of bile acid concentrations without treatment?
What is the ongoing risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in
women whose bile acid concentrations normalise?
•
• What is the cause of itching in women without raised bile
acids, and what is an effective treatment for their itching?
.

| AUDITABLE TOPICS
Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations
offered timing of birth in line with RCOG Green-top
Guideline. (>90%)
Proportion of women with uncomplicated raised bile acid
concentrations having additional investigations routinely
performed. (<10%)
Proportion of women with raised bile acid concentrations
offered ursodeoxycholic acid in line with RCOG Green-
top Guideline. (<5%)
Proportion of women with severe ICP (peak bile acids
≥100 micromol/L) offered continuous electronic fetal
monitoring during labour. (>90%)
These targets have been set in recognition of the need for
individualised care particularly in women with comorbidi-
ties and atypical ICP.

APPENDIX 1
Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed state-
ments which assist clinicians and patients in making deci-
sions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions.
Each guideline is systematically developed using a standard-
ised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found
in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at
BJOG
An International Journal of
Obstetrics and Gynaecology
el11
http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These recom-
mendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of
management or treatment. They must be evaluated with refer-
ence to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique
to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped
that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these
guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of
clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the
scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

GESTATIONAL PRURITUS
Retest if ongoing itch; bile acids
may increase and the woman
develop ICP.
No effect on stillbirth.
No impact on preterm birth.
No impact on birth timing.
MILD ICP
Retest as clinically indicated if
ongoing itch; bile acids may increase
and the woman develop moderate/
severe ICP.
No effect on stillbirth.
16% preterm birth rate.
Consider birth by 40 weeks.

MODERATE ICP
Stillbirth risk similar to general
population until 38-39 weeks.
19% preterm birth rate.
Consider birth by 38-39 weeks.
SEVERE ICP
Stillbirth risk higher than
general population at 35-36
weeks.
30% preterm birth rate.
Consider birth by 35-36 weeks.
Figures above relate to singleton pregnancy with no other risk factors.
Comorbidities (particularly pre-eclampsia and diabetes) or other obstetric risk factors (such as multifetal pregnancy),
are associated with increased risk of stillbirth and should be taken into consideration when planning management.
Additional liver investigations may be considered in women with atypical features (e.g. early onset, marked
transaminitis, jaundice, fever, or in whom postpartum resolution does not occur). These investigations may include liver
ultrasound, viral hepatitis screen, liver autoimmune tests, and/or coagulation screen.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educa-
tional aid to good clinical practice. They present
recognised methods and techniques of clinical
practice, based on published evidence, for consid-
eration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and
other relevant health professionals. The ultimate
judgement regarding a particular clinical proce-
dure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor
or other attendant in the light of clinical data pre-
sented by the patient and the diagnostic and treat-
ment options available.
pro-
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike
tocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they
are not intended to be prescriptive directions de-
fining a single course of management. Departure
from the local prescriptive protocols or guidelines
should be fully documented in the patient's case
notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
The guideline will be considered for update 3 years after
publication, with an intermediate assessment of the need to
update 2 years after publication.
