BMS Guideline on Management of Unscheduled Bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

Key Messages:
- Clinical assessment should start with a review of bleeding patterns, HRT preparations, and cancer risk factors.
- Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered for 6 months if unscheduled bleeding persists.
- Endometrial assessment should be considered if bleeding continues after 6 months.

Assessment:
- Assess cancer risk factors and bleeding pattern.
- Identify HRT regimen, duration, and compliance.
- Offer examinations and investigations if indicated.

Ultrasound:
- Offer referral for endometrial assessment if endometrial thickness exceeds certain measurements.

Optimise HRT:
- Consider adjustments in progestogen and offer reassurance based on endometrial assessment.

Introduction:
Unscheduled bleeding on HRT is common and can lead to repeat consultations. The guideline aims to provide recommendations for managing unscheduled bleeding based on endometrial cancer risk.

Methodology:
Expert panel developed evidence-based recommendations for managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT. The guideline focuses on efficient resource utilization and standardized management.

Suggested topics for audit are included. Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.

Section 1: Assessment of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT
When women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index.

History
• Last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed
• Bleeding pattern before starting HRT
• Pelvic pain and / or deep dyspareunia
• Discharge
• Vulvovaginal and / or urinary symptoms
• Bleeding pattern details
• HRT use details
• Application details
• Pregnancy risk and contraceptive usage
• Cervical screening history
• Sexual history
• Drug interactions
• Endometrial cancer risk factors

Examination and initial investigations
Offer assessments such as abdominal, vulvo-vaginal, cervical appearance, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, and pregnancy test.

Section 2: Endometrial cancer risk factors in women taking HRT
Major and minor factors affecting risk of endometrial cancer in women taking HRT are outlined. Genetic factors, BMI, and HRT preparations can impact risk. Tables provide information on estrogen dosages and progestogen doses based on risk factors.

Endometrial cancer risk factors independent of HRT use
Identifying risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia is important. Factors such as BMI, hereditary conditions, diabetes, and PCOS can increase risk. Optimizing modifiable factors can reduce episodes of unscheduled bleeding on HRT and endometrial cancer risk.

It is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium if unscheduled bleeding occurs. If new unscheduled bleeding develops at 4 years of use, a change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered. There are insufficient data to guide whether a malpositioned 52 mg LNG IUD provides adequate endometrial protection when used as part of HRT. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. Normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT should be understood. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is important. Clinical pathways for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed within specified time frames.

Conservative management strategies for unscheduled bleeding on HRT include adjusting progestogen or preparation, with referral for ultrasound if bleeding persists. Women with risk factors for cancer should be referred for urgent assessment. HRT can be continued during assessment, with adjustments to progestogen if necessary. Recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options are provided based on ultrasound findings. Endometrial assessment options include blind biopsy or hysteroscopy, depending on the clinical scenario.

Recommendations for management of unscheduled bleeding in menopausal women include offering reassurance and adjustments in progestogen for 3 months after a normal blind endometrial biopsy. If unscheduled bleeding persists or becomes heavy/prolonged, hysteroscopic assessment should be offered on an urgent pathway. In cases of insufficient samples on blind biopsy, hysteroscopy should be discussed. Adjustments in HRT and non-hormonal alternatives should be considered if hyperplasia with atypia or endometrial cancer is reported. Additionally, recommendations for reducing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT include assessing compliance, offering the 52 mg LNG-IUD, and adjusting progestogen doses based on individual factors. Other strategies include weight management, changing to a different HRT preparation, or offering non-hormonal alternatives.

Counsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors about progestogenic component use. Assess contraceptive needs to prevent unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding with sequential preparations by timing the start based on the natural cycle. Consider adjusting progestogen dose or type for better symptom control. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other management options. Discuss reducing estrogen dose and non-hormonal alternatives if unscheduled bleeding persists.
