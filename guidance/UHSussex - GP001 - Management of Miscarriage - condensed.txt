Management of Miscarriage

Key Principles
These guidelines are designed to assist in decision making and should be used in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues. Evidence used to inform these guidelines is drawn from national/RCOG guidelines. The guidelines have been reviewed by all clinicians involved in early pregnancy care.

Scope
These guidelines apply to women with a confirmed diagnosis of miscarriage.

Responsibilities
Nurses, Midwives, Gynaecologists, and Obstetricians should follow and understand this guidance. The management team should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Introduction
Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before viability, typically before 22 weeks gestation. Common symptoms include bleeding and pelvic pain.

Threatened Miscarriage
If bleeding worsens or persists beyond 14 days, further assessment is needed. If bleeding stops, antenatal care should continue.

Using Ultrasound for Diagnosis
Offer a trans-vaginal ultrasound scan to identify the location of the pregnancy and fetal pole. Consider a trans-abdominal ultrasound for certain cases. Repeat scans may be necessary before a diagnosis can be made.

Management of Confirmed Miscarriage Pregnancy
Provide verbal and written information to patients with a miscarriage and send blood tests. 

Conservative Management
Offered as a first-line option in early first-trimester miscarriage. Offer information about what to expect and when to seek help. Rescan in 3 weeks if needed.

Medical Management
Offered when conservative management is not appropriate. Offer information about the treatment and when to seek help. Offer pain relief and anti-emetics as needed.

Surgical Management
Provide information to women undergoing surgical management. Complete necessary consent forms and inform women about the procedure.

Anti-D rhesus Prophylaxis
Offer anti-D rhesus prophylaxis to certain women undergoing surgical procedures for miscarriage.

Follow-Up
Offer follow-up appointments to women after miscarriage.

Terminology
Use sensitive language when discussing miscarriage with parents.

Paperwork to be Completed
Complete necessary forms for pregnancy losses and ensure proper disposal of remains.

There is a chapel at both the Royal Sussex County Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital. Please ask a member of staff about how to make an entry, or contact the chaplaincy office at the hospital. There is no charge for making an entry. There is also a memorial service held every year for families to remember their babies who have died. You will be sent information about this nearer the time, unless you ask us not to do this. You will need to arrange a funeral with a Funeral Director of your choice. The Bereavement office will have a list of local funeral directors to help you if you wish. The funeral can take the form of a cremation or of a burial. The funeral director you approach will be able to help you with all the arrangements. Most funeral directors will not charge for a funeral, if you decide on a cremation, you will need to check before you go ahead. However if you are wanting a burial and headstone you will need to discuss this with the funeral director. The funeral does not need to be a religious service – you can say goodbye in whatever way feels best for you. If you or your funeral director have not contacted the bereavement office/mortuary within 30 days of signing the P2 form the hospital will arrange a cremation. The hospital will arrange a cremation of your baby but there will be no service for you or others to attend and no ashes to collect.
