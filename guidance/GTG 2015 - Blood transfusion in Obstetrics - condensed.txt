Executive summary of recommendations 
Optimisation of haemoglobin in the antenatal period
Diagnosis
Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as first trimester haemoglobin (Hb) less than 110 g/l, second/third 
trimester Hb less than 105 g/l, and postpartum Hb less than 100 g/l.
For normocytic or microcytic anaemia, a trial of oral iron should be considered as the first step.
Pregnant women should be offered screening for anaemia at booking and at 28 weeks.
Treatment and management
Oral iron should be the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency.
Parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed.
Women should receive information on improvement of dietary iron intake.
Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to minimise blood loss.
General principles of blood transfusion
Consent for blood transfusion
Valid consent should be obtained where possible prior to administering a blood transfusion.
In an emergency, where it is not feasible to get consent, information on blood transfusion should 
be provided retrospectively.
Requirements for group and screen samples and cross-matching 
All women should have their blood group and antibody status checked at booking and at 28 weeks 
of gestation.
Group and screen samples used for provision of blood in pregnancy should be less than 3 days old.
Blood product specification in pregnancy and the puerperium  
ABO-, rhesus D- (RhD-) and K- (Kell-) compatible red cell units should be transfused.
Cytomegalovirus- (CMV-) seronegative red cell and platelet components should be provided for 
elective transfusions during pregnancy.
What are the strategies to minimise the use of banked blood?
Is there a role for preoperative/predelivery autologous blood deposit?
Predelivery autologous blood deposit is not recommended.
Is there a role for intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS)?
Cell salvage is recommended for patients where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to 
induce anaemia.
Management of obstetric haemorrhage with blood components
There should be a clear local protocol on how to manage major obstetric haemorrhage.
Are there mechanical strategies that can be employed?
Clinicians should familiarise themselves with mechanical strategies that can be employed to 
reduce postpartum blood loss.
What blood components can be used for obstetric haemorrhage?
When should red cells be used?
The decision to provide blood transfusion should be made on clinical and haematological grounds.
In an extreme situation, group O RhD-negative red cells should be given.
When should fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate be used?
FFP at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg should be administered for every 6 units of red cells during major 
obstetric haemorrhage.
Cryoprecipitate at a standard dose of two 5-unit pools should be administered early in major 
obstetric haemorrhage.
When should platelets be used? 
Aim to maintain the platelet count above 50 x 109/l in the acutely bleeding patient.
Is there a role for near patient testing of coagulation?
Centres using thromboelastography or rotation thromboelastometry for guiding blood transfusion 
during major obstetric haemorrhage must ensure that their transfusion algorithm protocol has 
been validated.

Iron from the diet is mainly non-haem, with vitamin C aiding absorption and tea and coffee inhibiting it. rHuEPO is used in end-stage renal disease anemia, with potential use in non-end-stage renal anemia under controlled conditions. Active management of the third stage of labor reduces postpartum blood loss. Maternal deaths from hemorrhage have decreased, with high-risk women advised to deliver in units with immediate access to care. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained, with clear documentation of discussions. Group and screen samples should be taken regularly, and red cell antibodies tested. ABO-, RhD-, and K- compatible red cell units should be transfused, with CMV-seronegative components for elective transfusions. Preoperative autologous blood deposit is not recommended, but cell salvage is recommended for significant blood loss. Local protocols for managing obstetric hemorrhage should be in place and practiced regularly. Mechanical strategies can be employed to reduce postpartum blood loss. Red cell transfusion should be based on clinical and hematological grounds, with group O RhD-negative red cells given in extreme situations. FFP should be administered during major obstetric hemorrhage, guided by clotting tests.

- Maintain PT and APTT ratios at less than 1.5 x normal during major obstetric hemorrhage.
- Regular full blood counts and coagulation screens should be performed.
- Administer cryoprecipitate early in major obstetric hemorrhage and guide subsequent transfusions by fibrinogen levels.
- FFP and cryoprecipitate should ideally be of the same blood group as the recipient.
- No anti-D prophylaxis is required for RhD-negative women receiving RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate.
- Aim to maintain platelet count above 50 x 10^9/l in acutely bleeding patients.
- Platelets should ideally be group compatible, and RhD-negative women should receive RhD-negative platelets.
- Consider using tranexamic acid during major obstetric hemorrhage.
- Intrapartum anemia should be managed based on individual medical history and symptoms.
- Consider iron therapy to reduce the need for blood transfusion in postpartum anemia.
- Antenatal planning is essential for women declining blood products, with careful multidisciplinary input.
- Advance directive and informed consent should be obtained for women refusing blood transfusion.

PBM involves an approach to avoid unnecessary transfusion by optimizing preoperative/predelivery Hb, avoiding overtransfusion, using cell salvage, accepting evidence-based lower transfusion triggers, and using iron supplements in stable women. Evidence supports the use of autologous blood from IOCS in decreasing allogeneic transfusion requirements. Recommendations for future research include defining coagulation abnormalities during major obstetric hemorrhage and determining optimal transfusion timing. Auditable topics include standards for audit of documentation and practice in managing obstetric hemorrhage.
