This guideline provides advice on the investigation and care of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and growth-restricted fetuses. Recommendations include assessing women for risk factors, reducing smoking, and monitoring fetal growth. Differentiating between SGA and fetal growth restriction (FGR) is crucial, with FGR indicating a pathological restriction of genetic growth potential. Surveillance and management strategies vary based on the gestational age of onset of FGR. Serial ultrasound scans and Doppler assessments are recommended for monitoring fetal growth and wellbeing. Maternity providers should use standard protocols for ultrasound scanning and ensure accurate plotting of measurements on growth charts. Maternal history, symptoms, and Doppler velocimetry should also be considered in assessing fetal growth. Early and late onset FGR have different clinical characteristics and require tailored management approaches. Maternity providers should be aware of the definitions and criteria for diagnosing FGR in both current and previous pregnancies. Suboptimal fetal growth, low birthweight, and static growth are additional terms used to describe fetal growth patterns. Maternal factors, medical conditions, and placental dysfunction can all impact fetal growth, with early onset FGR associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes compared to late onset FGR. Effective surveillance and management strategies are essential for improving outcomes in pregnancies with FGR.

Low sensitivity for detecting SGA/FGR fetuses. Suspicion of a fetal growth disorder relies on ultrasound measurement of fetal AC or estimation of fetal weight. Care is directed at timely birth. Several surveillance tests are available, but there is controversy about which test or combination should be used. The NHS England SBLCB focuses on detection and management of SGA and recommends birth at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks. The SpiRE evaluation of the SBLCB version 1 showed an increase in USS and inductions of labor at early term. Version 2 of the bundle addresses different management strategies for SGA and FGR. SBLCBv3 and this guideline focus on detecting FGR and targeting intervention for those at increased risk of perinatal death.

Risk assessment is crucial in maternity care and should be dynamic throughout pregnancy. All pregnant women should have a risk assessment for FGR by 14 weeks of gestation. Risk factors for FGR include previous medical history, obstetric history, and current pregnancy history. Risk assessment is challenged by the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR, which may underestimate the risk of adverse outcomes. Tools used to assess risk should provide a structured approach and support decision-making. Future research should focus on developing prediction models specifically for FGR.

Known risk factors for FGR include previous FGR/SGA newborn, previous stillbirth, previous preterm birth, previous pregnancy loss, and previous pregnancy with placenta-mediated complications. Maternal characteristics and medical history, such as diabetes, renal impairment, and maternal congenital heart disease, are also associated with an increased risk of FGR. Aspirin may be recommended in certain cases to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorders related to placental dysfunction. Maternal medication use should also be considered when assessing the need for growth scans. Associations with asthma, anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and depression are weaker.

Advanced maternal age, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, excessive weight gain, bariatric surgery, and ethnicity are all associated with an increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses. Maternal exposures such as alcohol consumption, drug misuse, smoking, and caffeine consumption also play a role in SGA risk. Biochemical markers such as low pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels or raised alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels can indicate a higher risk of SGA and fetal growth restriction (FGR) and may require additional surveillance. Paternal factors and fertility treatments may also influence the risk of SGA. Overall, it is important for healthcare providers to assess and address all modifiable risk factors for SGA during pregnancy.

Women with low PAPP-A, raised AFP, or inhibin A should undergo uterine artery Doppler screening for fetal growth disorders. Although these biomarkers are associated with SGA and FGR, they are not recommended as primary detection tools. Uterine artery Dopplers should be done for high-risk women between 18-24 weeks. Findings at the midtrimester anomaly scan should be used to assess fetal growth risk. Fetal echogenic bowel and single umbilical artery are associated with an increased risk of SGA. Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy should be assessed for fetal growth disorders. Prediction models for SGA have limited clinical utility and should not be the sole method for determining ultrasound surveillance. Smoking cessation and balanced energy/protein supplementation can reduce the risk of SGA.

High protein supplementation is not recommended due to low-quality evidence. Structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness did not show significant benefits in reducing SGA. Omega-3 supplementation did not reduce SGA. Multiple micronutrient supplementation may reduce SGA risk. High dose folic acid did not reduce SGA rates. Calcium supplementation did not show a significant effect on SGA. Vitamin D supplementation benefits remain uncertain. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of SGA. Aspirin at 150mg daily can reduce the risk of SGA and FGR. LMWH is not recommended to reduce the risk of SGA or FGR. Progesterone and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant benefits in preventing FGR. Antihypertensive use does not seem to increase the risk of SGA. Abdominal palpation is not accurate for predicting SGA, serial measurement of SFH is recommended. Abnormal SFH measurements should prompt ultrasound assessment. Women with factors affecting SFH accuracy should have serial ultrasound assessments. Staff should be trained in using SFH charts and incorporate them into electronic records.

Maternal obesity, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios, and fetal head engagement contribute to the limited predictive accuracy of SFH measurement. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular chart for recording SFH. Studies have shown that abdominal palpation has limited accuracy in detecting SGA newborns, with SFH measurement being superior to palpation in detecting fetuses at risk. NICE reviewed the evidence for SFH and fetal biometry using ultrasound to predict birthweight at term in low-risk pregnancies. SFH should be measured from the fundus to the symphysis pubis, and women with a single SFH below the 10th centile should be referred for further investigation with ultrasound assessment. Standard, population, and customised charts for plotting SFH are available, but evidence for their effectiveness on outcomes is lacking.

Routine measurement of fetal AC or EFW in the third trimester does not reduce the incidence of an SGA newborn or improve perinatal outcomes. Universal late pregnancy ultrasonography has not shown beneficial effects and should not be offered routinely. Maternity providers should ensure guidance for standard planes of acquisition and calliper placement when performing USS for fetal growth assessment. Women in the moderate-risk category require serial assessment of fetal growth starting at 32 weeks, with a scan interval of 4 weeks being appropriate. Maternity providers should monitor the number of fetuses below the 3rd centile to ensure the growth pathway and chart are appropriate. Ultrasound is a core component of fetal growth surveillance and management, and serial scanning is recommended for women at increased risk of fetal growth disorders. Surveillance for late FGR and SGA should commence at 32 weeks, with an interval between scans no more frequent than every 14 days.

False positive rates for diagnosing FGR can be minimized by ensuring that two measurements used to estimate velocity are at least 3 weeks apart. AC is comparable to EFW in predicting SGA, with AC growth velocity being the only biometric measure to identify babies at increased risk of neonatal morbidity. The Hadlock equation is recommended for estimating fetal weight. Maternity providers should ensure appropriate training, quality assurance, and audit for USS biometry. Customised fetal growth charts may better predict adverse outcomes, but concerns exist about normalizing pathology. Maternity providers should monitor the number of fetuses considered <3rd centile and evaluate the impact of different reference charts in their local population. Uterine artery Doppler should be carried out in high-risk populations at 20+0–24+6 weeks to determine when ultrasound surveillance of fetal growth should commence. Subsequent repeating of uterine artery Doppler is of limited value in this situation. Women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler should commence serial scanning for fetal biometry at 24+0–28+6 weeks, while those with normal Doppler can commence at 32 weeks. Uterine artery Doppler is useful in predicting early onset SGA and identifying women at risk for early-onset pre-eclampsia.

Uterine artery Doppler can be used in the second trimester to determine the risk of placental dysfunction and hypertensive disorders for high-risk women. Serial scans are recommended for women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler. Placental morphometry may help predict early and late FGR, but its clinical applicability is limited. Biomarkers like PlGF and s-flt1 can aid in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia but their use in predicting FGR in non-hypertensive women is uncertain. Serial ultrasound measurements remain the best diagnostic tool for identifying SGA neonates. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for interpreting fetal growth measurements.

Inclusive assessment by maternal risk factors and biophysical markers. Offer referral to fetal medicine if EFW is below the 3rd centile or below the 10th centile with abnormal uterine artery Doppler at the midtrimester anomaly scan. Invasive diagnostic testing should be offered in severely SGA fetuses with structural anomalies and considered in non-anomalous fetuses detected before 23 weeks of gestation. Testing for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasmosis infection should be offered in severe SGA. Testing for malaria and Zika should be considered in high-risk populations. In fetuses undergoing invasive testing for FGR with no other structural anomalies, there was a 4% incremental yield of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) over karyotyping. Prenatal exome sequencing has limited incremental yield over standard karyotyping and microarray in fetuses with isolated FGR. Invasive testing should be considered in the context of severe SGA due to the possibility of other chromosomal abnormalities. Follow-up scans should be arranged given the association with subsequent birth of an SGA infant. LMWH should not be prescribed to women in whom fetal growth disorders have been diagnosed. Women should not be prescribed phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors to treat FGR outside of RCTs. Experimental treatments under investigation in early phase clinical trials/studies include maternal VEGF gene therapy, melatonin, and statins. Ultrasound biometry should be carried out every 2 weeks in fetuses identified to be SGA. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool and should be undertaken at the point of diagnosis of SGA and during follow-up as a minimum every 2 weeks. In fetuses with an EFW between the 3rd and 10th centile, other features must be present for birth to be recommended prior to 39 weeks. IOL is not contraindicated in the SGA fetus.

For SGA fetuses, recommendations for birth are based on findings from the DIGITAT study, showing no difference in severe neonatal morbidity or cesarean birth between induction and expectant management. Induction at 38 weeks was associated with lower costs. IOL between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks should only be considered for fetuses at significantly increased risk of perinatal mortality. For FGR fetuses, differentiation between early and late FGR is important for surveillance. Maternity providers should ensure consistency in Doppler charts used. Early FGR requires multidisciplinary care and monitoring every 2 weeks. Assessment of fetal wellbeing in early FGR should include cCTG and ductus venosus. Birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessment or maternal indication. The TRUFFLE study guides management of early FGR, with triggers for birth based on specific parameters. Monitoring in early FGR has not been studied prospectively, but sudden deterioration can occur. Umbilical artery Doppler changes should prompt assessment of ductus venosus waveform.

95th centile (borderline), absent end diastolic flow (EDF) (pre-critical), reversed EDF (critical).
Ductus venosus Doppler changes are defined as: raised PIV above the 95th centile (borderline), absent ‘a’ wave to baseline (pre-critical), or reversed ‘a’ wave (critical).
Repeat umbilical and ductus venosus Doppler ultrasound and CTG monitoring weekly for borderline changes, and alternate daily for pre-critical changes in early onset FGR. Daily monitoring is indicated for critical changes to prevent sudden deterioration.
Plan birth when Ductus venosus ‘a’ wave is absent or below baseline, or with abnormal CTG findings, based on specific criteria for gestational age.
Counselling by experienced obstetrician and neonatologist is recommended for preterm FGR before 28 weeks. Birth decisions should consider predictors of survival and morbidity.
In late and term FGR, assessing ductus venosus waveform is unlikely to be informative for severe abnormalities. Birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessments or maternal indication. Birth should be initiated from 37+0 weeks to be completed by 37+6 weeks.
Abnormal umbilical artery Doppler, absent end diastolic flow, or raised PI can prompt further assessment in late FGR pregnancies. Cerebral Doppler abnormalities can inform monitoring strategy but should not solely determine birth decisions.
Assessment with cCTG is recommended for reduced fetal movements in late FGR. Antenatal corticosteroids, intrauterine transfer, and magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection should be considered based on gestational age. Mode of birth recommendations vary based on fetal growth and Doppler findings.

Histopathological examination of the placenta may be useful where FGR is diagnosed prenatally or at birth to understand the underlying causes and guide management in a subsequent pregnancy. Women who have given birth to a growth-restricted infant should be offered an appointment for postnatal counseling, review of placental histology, and consideration of investigations of underlying causes as appropriate. A plan for future pregnancies and preventative strategies should be recorded in the notes and discussed with the woman. Modifiable risk factors should be addressed, such as lifestyle factors and medical conditions optimized. Plans for prevention and monitoring in future pregnancies should be discussed. Following the birth of a baby with FGR, investigations should be offered to try to determine the underlying cause and help provide an opportunity to discuss the risk of recurrence and possible interventions to reduce risk at a pre-pregnancy appointment.

Condensed Version:
Several studies have been conducted on monitoring pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction and extreme preterm birth. Doppler ultrasound measurements of various arteries have been found to be predictive of adverse outcomes in growth-restricted fetuses. Antenatal corticosteroids and induction of labor methods have also been studied in these cases. Further research is ongoing to assess the impact of these interventions on neonatal outcomes.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised methodology. These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources, and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme. Surveillance pathway following risk assessment for Fetal growth Fetal medicine refers to a clinician with fetal medicine expertise. The risk factors listed in Appendix I constitute those routinely assessed at booking and at mid-trimester scan. Other risk factors exist, and risk assessment must always be individualized taking into account previous medical and obstetric history and current pregnancy history. For women with maternal medical conditions and individuals with disease progression, or institution of medical therapies, an individual's risk may increase and necessitate monitoring with serial scanning. For women with a previous stillbirth, management must be tailored to the previous history i.e. evidence of placental dysfunction or maternal medical conditions. Serial measurement of SFH should be performed as per NICE guideline [CG62]. AC and/or EFW <10th centile at the anomaly scan is a high-risk factor. An individualized plan of care should be made. Refer to risk assessment and screening section for advice on scan interval. Management of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Consider after 30+0 weeks; Consider after 32+0 weeks; EFW, estimated fetal weight; UA, umbilical artery; DV, ductus venosus; cCTG, computerised cardiotocograph; STV, short-term variation; ms, milliseconds; AC, abdominal circumference; PI, pulsatility index; AREDF, absent reversed end-diastolic flow. The guideline will be considered for update 3 years after publication, with an intermediate assessment of the need to update 2 years after publication.
