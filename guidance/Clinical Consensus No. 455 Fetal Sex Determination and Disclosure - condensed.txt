Clinical Consensus No. 455: Fetal Sex Determination and Disclosure

- Determination of fetal sex is an important component of obstetric ultrasound examination and should not be considered optional.
- Health care providers need to consider parental wishes regarding disclosure or nondisclosure of fetal sex when reporting ultrasound findings or reviewing the findings with parents.
- Health care providers need to be cognizant of increasing direct access of patients/parents to their ultrasound reports.

Objective: To provide guidance on ultrasound review of the fetal perineum as well as fetal sex determination and disclosure.
Target Population: All individuals with ongoing pregnancies.
Options: To include a review of the fetal perineum and determination of fetal sex as a component of the anatomic review during the routine second-trimester obstetric ultrasound and adhere to patient wishes regarding the disclosure of fetal sex.
Outcomes: Prenatal diagnosis of fetal genital and sex anomalies or variants, parental and pregnancy caregiver knowledge of fetal sex, and adherence to parental wishes regarding knowledge of fetal sex.
Beneﬁts, Harms, and Costs: Beneﬁts include the potential to improve perinatal outcomes through the diagnosis of fetal genital anomalies and respect for women’s rightful autonomy over personal health information. Potential harms or costs include a possible error in fetal sex determination, increased time for patients and health care providers in scheduling and performing the imaging, and the minimal risk of patients choosing to abort a pregnancy if the fetus is not the desired sex.
Intended Audience: All care providers for pregnant individuals in Canada.

Key Messages:
- Diagnostic imaging providers and other health care providers should respect parental wishes regarding the disclosure of fetal sex.
- Diagnostic imaging providers should make every effort to determine fetal sex during an obstetric ultrasound examination from the second trimester onwards and should include this information in the ultrasound report.
- If fetal sex cannot be determined, re-examination or appropriate referral is recommended.
- The obstetric ultrasound examination reports should contain a visible alert at the beginning of the report regarding the presence of information on fetal sex, thus giving parents the option of not reading any further.
