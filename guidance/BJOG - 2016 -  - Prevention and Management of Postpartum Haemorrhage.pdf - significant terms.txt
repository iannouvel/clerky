- Secondary PPH

Investigation:
- Full blood count
- Coagulation screen, including fibrinogen
- Renal and liver function for baseline
- Vaginal microbiology (high vaginal and endocervical swabs)
- Pelvic ultrasound

Management:
- Use of prophylactic uterotonics
- Use of oxytocin for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour
- Use of intravenous tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss
- Use of intrauterine balloon tamponade
- Use of surgical interventions such as brace suture technique and hysterectomy
- Use of blood transfusion and blood components like fresh frozen plasma (FFP), fibrinogen and platelets
- Use of antimicrobial therapy for suspected endometritis
- Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue
- Use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy
- Multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH
- Training for PPH management
- Formal clinical incident review for cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml
- Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH
- Debriefing sessions for the woman and her birthing partner/s.
