Disclaimer  
The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (hereinafter referred to as 'ESHRE') 
developed the current clinical practice guideline, to provide clinical recommendations to improve the quality of healthcare delivery within the European field of  human reproduction and embryology. This 
guideline represents the views of ESHRE, which were achieved after careful consideration of the scientific 
evidence available at the time of preparation. In the absence of scientific evidence on certain aspects, a 
consensus between the relevant ESHRE stakeholders has been obtained.  
The aim of clinical practice guidelines is to aid healthcare professionals in everyday clinical decisions about appropriate and effective care of their patients.  
However, adherence to the se clinical practice guidelines does not guarantee a successful or specific 
outcome, nor does it establish a standard of care. Clinical practice guidelines do not override the healthcare professional's clinical judgment in the diagnosis and treatment of particular patients. 
Ultimately, healthcare professionals must make their own clinical decisions on a case- by-case basis, 
using their clinical judgment, knowledge, and expertise, and taking into account the condition, circumstances, and wishes of the individ ual patient, in consultation with that patient and/or the 
guardian or carer.  
ESHRE makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the clinical practice guidelines and specifically

Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  6 
Introduction  
Clinical need  
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrium -like tissue 
outside the uterus (Kennedy , et al. , 2005 ). Establishment and growth of such endometriotic tissue is 
estrogen -dependent  (Kitawaki , et al. , 2002) , thus it is mostly found in women of reproductive age 
although the clinical consequences of endometriosis and its manag ement can last well into post-
menopause.  
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown,  but estimates range from 2 to 10% within the 
general female population but up to 50% in infertile women (Eskenazi and Warner, 1997 , Meuleman , 
et al. , 2009) . Thus, it is estimated that currently at least 190 million  women  and adolescent girls 
worldwide are affected by the disease  during reproductive age although some women may suffer 
beyond menopause  (Gemmell , et al. , 2017 , Zondervan , et al. , 2020 ). Whilst not all women with 
endometriosis are symptomatic, endometriosis -associated pain and infertility are the clinical hallm arks 
of the disease affecting not only women with endometriosis, but also their partners  and families . An 
impact of endometriosis, and particularly pain symptoms, has been shown on quality of life, but also 
on a range of activities and life domains includi ng physical functioning, everyday activities and social 
life, education and work , sex, intimacy and intimate partnerships , and mental health and emotional 
wellbeing  (Culley , et al. , 2013) . The same review also reported an imp act of infertility and  concerns 
about possible infertility on the patient and the relationship with their partner ( Culley , et al. , 2013 ). 
Finally, endometriosis has a  bearing   on society in general  e.g. through direct and indirect healthcare 
costs which  are comparable to other common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,  
and Crohn’s disease (Zondervan, et al. , 2018 ). Despite all of this, there still exists a large diagnostic void 
between the onset of symptoms and a reliable diagnosis averaging between 8 -12 years.  Therapeutic 
options range from improving pain symptoms and fertility prospects by means of hormone  suppression 
of endogenous estrogen levels, pro -apoptotic and anti -inflammatory effects on end ometriotic tissue, 
surgical removal, or destruction of endometriotic lesions and division of adhesions to management of 
chronic pain syndromes.  
Whilst there still exists a great unmet clinical need for improving many aspects of the diagnosis of the 
disease  and the treatment of endometriosis -associated symptoms, there is a slowly growing body of 
studies which found the basis for the use of evidence- based recommendations which are compiled 
here.  
Previous versions and significant changes  
This document is the s econd update of the ESHRE Guidelines on Endometriosis ( Dunselman , et al. , 
2014 , Kennedy , et al. , 2005) . Where available, peer -reviewed evidence formed the basis of our 
recommendations. However, there still remain many unanswered questions for which no, or only poor 
quality or little data are available. We have highlighted such areas by making research recommendations (see page 18 and 19 ) and good practice points that were developed based on clinical 
expertise by experts in the field of endometriosis and patient representat ives. 
Whilst most of the more recent studies confirm previous ESHRE recommendations, there are five topics in which significant changes in clinical practice are to be expected.  Additionally, some important gaps 
in the previous version of the guideline have been added. An overview is presented in Table I.  
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  7 
Table I. Overview of changes to the guideline recommendations as compared to the previous version 
(Dunselman, et al., 2014).  
Chapter  Changes in the current version  
Diagnosis of 
endometriosis  ! Laparoscopy is no longer the diagnostic gold standard and it is now only recommended 
in patients with negative imaging results and/or where empirical treatment was 
unsuccessful or inappropriate .  
Treatment of 
endometriosis -
assoc iated pain  ! Studies on GnRH antagonist treatments support their  use as an additional (second line) 
treatment option . 
! Recent data indicate that postoperative medical treatment may be beneficial towards 
pain management and support a recommendation to offer it  in women not desiring 
immediate pregnancy .  
Danazol and anti -progestogens, laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA), presacral 
neurectomy (PSN) and anti -adhesion agents are no longer included in recommendations , but 
still covered in the text  
Treatment of 
endometriosis -
associated infertility  ! The extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART treatment to improve live 
birth rate in infertile women with endometriosis (ultralong protocol) is no longer 
recommended due to unclear benefits.  
! The Endometriosis Fertility Index ( EFI) was added as a step in the treatment as it can 
support decision- making for the most appropriate option to achieve pregnancy after 
surgery.  
NEW   Information on pregnancy and fertility preservation  was added.  
Endometriosis 
recurrence  Information is included as a separate chapter to highlight its importance and challenges  
Endometriosis and 
adolescence  NEW   This topic was not included in 2014  and is now extensively covered.  
Endometriosis and 
menopause  NEW   More extensive information compared to 2014  
Asymptomatic 
endometriosis  Update without major changes  
Extrapelvic 
Endometriosis  Update without major changes  
Primary prevention 
of endometriosis  Update without major changes  
Endometriosis and 
cancer  NEW   More extensive information compared to 2014  
Target users of the guideline  
The guideline covers the care provided by secondary and tertiary healthcare professionals who have 
direct contact with, and make decisions concerning, the care of women with endometriosis. Although 
primary healthcare providers are not the main target users  of this guideline, it may be of interest for 
them too.  
This guideline is of relevance to European health care providers and women with endometriosis. To 
assist patient education and shared decision -making, a patient version of this guideline will be 
deve loped.   
Guideline scope  
This guideline offers best practice advice on the care of women with suspected and confirmed 
endometriosis. Recommendations are provided on diagnosis and treatment for both relief of painful  
symptoms and for infertility due to endometriosis.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  8 
Specific recommendations are provided on management of patients in whom endometriosis is found  
incidentally (without pain or infertility),  adolescents and menopausal women with endometriosis.  
Information  on risk factors for endometriosis and associations with other diseases is provided, with 
recommendations on prevention and monitoring.  
Adenomyosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue (endometrial stroma and glands) 
within the myometr ium (International working group of AAGL ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2021) . 
Adenomyosis is not considered a form or subtype of endometriosis and hence not covered in the 
current guideline. Specific recommendations for management of adenomyosis will be prepared as a separate guidance.  
The members of the guideline development gro up are listed in Annex 1.  
Patient population  
The current guideline focusses on women with endometriosis ; either diagnosed or strongly suspected.  
This guideline, in line with e ndometriosis research, terminology and discussion is focused on  females 
and menst ruation. The guideline group re cogni ses that there are individuals living with endometriosis 
who are transgender , who do not menstruate, who do not have a uterus or who do not identify with 
the terms used in the literature. For the purposes of this guideline, we use th e term “women with 
endometriosis” , however, it is not intended to isolate, exclude,  or diminish any individual’s experience  
nor to discriminate against any group.  
Terminology and definitions   
This guideline uses terms and definitions as recently defined in an International Terminology  on 
Endometriosis, published by an international working group of AAGL, ESGE, ESHRE and WES  
(International working group of AAGL ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2021 ) . The terminology  includes 
definitions on endometriosis and its subtypes, disease locations, interventions,  and outcome 
parameters.   
Endometriosis is defined as a disease characteri sed by the presence of endometrium -like epithelium 
and/or stroma outside the endometrium and myometrium, usually with an associated inflammatory process (International working group of AAGL ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2021 ).

List of all recommendations  
Diagnosis of endometriosis  Level of 
evidence1  Chapter I  
Signs and symptoms  
1 The GDG recommends that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of endometriosis in 
individuals presenting with the following cyclical and non -cyclical signs and symptoms: 
dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding or haematuria, shoulder tip pain, catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough/haemoptysis/  
chest pain, cyclical scar swelling and pain, fatigue, and infertility.  G PP 
A
lthough currently no evidence exists that a symptom diary/questionnaire/app reduces 
the time to diagnosis or leads to earlier diagnosis, the GDG considers their potential 
benefit in complementing the traditional history taking process as it aids in objectifying pain and empowering women to demonstrate their symptoms.  GDG 
STATEMENT  
Clinical examination and diagnostic tests  
2 Clinical examination, including vaginal examination where appropriate, should be 
considered to identify deep nodules or endometriomas in patients with suspected 
endometriosis, although the diagnostic accuracy is low.  ⊕  Strong 
recommendation  
3 In women with suspected endometriosis, further diagnostic steps, including imaging, 
should be considered even if the clinical examination is normal.  ⊕⊕  Strong 
recommendation  
4 Clinicians should not use measurement of biomarkers in endometrial tissue, blood, 
menstrual or uterine fluids to diagnose endometriosis.  ⊕⊕⊕ Strong 
recommendation  
5 Clinicians are recommended to use imaging (US or MRI) in the diagnostic work -up for 
endometriosis, but they need to be aware that a negative finding does not exclude 
endometriosis, particularly superficial peritoneal disease.  ⊕⊕  Strong 
recommendation  
6 In patients wit h negative imaging results or where empirical treatment was unsuccessful 
or inappropriate, the GDG recommends that clinicians consider offering laparoscopy for 
the diagnosis and treatment of suspected endometriosis.  G PP 
7 The GDG recommends that laparoscopic identification of endometriotic lesions is 
confirmed by histology although negative histology does not entirely rule out the disease.  G PP 
Both diagnostic laparoscopy and imaging combined with empirical treatment ( hormonal 
contraceptive s or progestogens) can be considered in women suspected of 
endometriosis. There is no evidence of superiority of either approach  and pros and cons 
should be discussed with the patient .  GDG 
STATEMENT  
8 Follow -up and psychological support should be considered in women with confirmed 
endometriosis, particularly deep and ovarian endometriosis, although there is currently 
no evidence of benefit of regular long -term monitoring for early detection of recurrence, 
complications, or malignancy.  ⊕  Weak  
recommendation  
9 The appropriate frequency and type of follow -up or monitoring is unknown and should 
be individuali sed based on previous and current treatments and severity of the disease 
and symptoms.  G PP 
1 The level of evidence reports on the quality of the supporting evidence for each recommendation. More information is 
available in Annex 4 (page 166). GPP refers to good practice point and is applied for recommendations based primarily on 
expert opinion.    
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  10 
 Although no adequate studies exist to support the benefits of early versus late diagnosis, 
the GDG recommends that in symptomatic women, attempts should be made to relieve 
symptoms, either by empirical treatment or after a diagnosis of endometriosis.   GDG 
STATEMENT  
 
Treatment of endometriosis -associated pain   Chapter II  
Analgesics  
10 Women may be offered NSAIDs or other analgesics (either alone or in combination with 
other treatments) to reduce endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕ Weak 
recommendation  
Hormone  treatments  
11 It is recommended to offer women hormone treatment (combined hormonal 
contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists) as one of the options 
to reduce endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕⊕⊕ Strong 
recommendation  
12 The GDG recommends that clinicians take a shared decision -making approach and take 
individual preferences, side effects, individual efficacy, costs, and availability into

It can be concluded that LUNA is not beneficial as an additional procedure to conventional 
laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis, as it offers no additional benefit over surgery 
alone. PSN is beneficial for treatment of endometriosis -associated midline pain as an 
adjunct to conventional laparoscopic surgery, but it should be stressed that PSN r equires 
a high degree of skill and is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as 
intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative constipation, urinary urgency and painless

List of research recommendations  
  Diagnosis of endometriosis  
R1 Randomised research studies are recommended to verify whether symptom diaries or questionnaires lead 
to improved or earlier diagnosis of endometriosis.  
R2 The GDG recommends large, multi -centre prospective studies with independent validation sample sets to 
investigate the potential benefit of biomarkers in the detection and prognosis of endometriosis.  
R3 The GDG recommends research into the development of comprehensive and inclusive consensus criteria 
for the diagnosis of endometriosis, as an alternative or adjunct to diagnosis via laparoscopy /histology.  
R4 The GDG recommends large longitudinal intervention studies to investigate the potential benefits and best 
long -term management approaches for women with endometriosis.  
R5 The GDG recommends large longitudinal studies to investigate the eff ect of early diagnosis on the quality 
of life of women with endometriosis.  
  Treatment of endometriosis -associated pain  
R6 Research should investigate the effect of surgery on pain and quality of life ( QoL) parameters in different 
subtypes, preferably via longitudinal population studies.  
R7 The GDG recommends sufficiently powered prospective, randomised and ideally blinded studies to 
unequivocally determine whether surgical treatment of superficial peritone al endometriosis improves 
short and long -term clinical outcomes , such as a reduction in pain symptoms and improvement in quality 
of life.  
R8 The GDG recommends that nerve -sparing laparoscopy should be performed in centres of expertise and 
that data are co llected in a standardised fashion to assess its potential benefits and risks.  
R9 Studies should evaluate factors that can be assessed prior to surgery and can predict a clinically meaningful 
improvement of pain symptoms. Such prognostic markers can be use d to select patients that may benefit 
from endometriosis surgery.  
R10 The GDG recommends sufficiently powered randomised clinical trials in different countries and cultural 
backgrounds to directly compare the risks, costs, and clinical outcomes of laparoscopy and empirical 
treatment.  
R11 Adequately designed trials are needed to define the potential benefits of non -medical interventions 
(nutrition, Chinese medicine, electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychological 
interventions) in endometriosis. Further research into such interventions for women with endometriosis 
that employ evidence -based protocols with high intervention integrity is recommended.  
  Treatment of endometriosis -associated infertility and Medically assisted reproduction  
R12 In patients without a clear indication for ART, the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis and 
its effect on natural pregnancy rates should be evaluated. Such studies should consider patient age, 
endometrioma bilater ality and size, previous surgeries, adenomyosis and other factors affecting fertility.  
R13 It is suggested that the EFI is used for better patient phenotyping in studies on surgical treatment and/or 
the place of MAR in endometriosis -related infertility. The role of the EFI as a pre -surgical triage tool should 
be validated.  
R14 Studies should clarify whether IUI with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women with 
(different subtypes of) endometriosis.  In addition, the value of EFI to predict the relevance of IUI could be 
further investigated.  
R15 Studies evaluating IUI and ART should report clinically relevant outcomes (live birth rates and cumulative 
data), and ideally perform subgroup analysis by st age of endometriosis and type of disease.  
R16 Further studies of both medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis -associated infertility are 
required to clarify the relative effectiveness of treatments, in particular trials comparing ART and IUI to 
other treatments.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  19 
R17 The impact of the extent of disease on the outcome of ART should be further studied, as it could provide 
data for selection of patients that could benefit from ART.  
R18 RCTs are required to answer the question whether surgery for  endometrioma prior to ART improves 
reproductive outcomes.   
R19 Adequately designed trials are needed to define the magnitude of the benefit of non -medical interventions 
(nutrition, Chinese medicine, electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychological 
interventions) in endometriosis -associated infertility . Further research into non -medical interventions for 
women with endometriosis that employ evidence -based protocols with high intervention integrity is 
recommended.  
  Impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and pregnancy outcome  
R20 Studies should focus on identification of women with endometriosis who have higher chances of becoming 
infertile in the future due to endometriosis or endometriosis surgery (and/or who will need ART anyway). 
These women may have a true benefit from fertili ty preservation and this evidence would support a future 
recommendation supporting fertility preservation in selected women with endometriosis.  
R21 Observational studies should be conducted to assess natural evolution of pre -existing endometrioma or 
othe r endometriosis lesions during pregnancy.  
R22 There is a need for prospective, well -designed studies to assess the impact of surgery on subsequent 
pregnancy evolution, disease phenotype and presence of adenomyosis on the rare complications observed 
during  pregnancy in women with endometriosis.  
R23 Larger studies on the evolution of early pregnancy in women with endometriosis versus controls are 
necessary, particularly with more precise phenotyping including adenomyosis, the role of surgery prior to 
concep tion and the mode of conception.  
R24 Prospective observational studies are needed in pregnant women with endometriosis versus controls to 
better define obstetric risks for women with endometriosis and the potential usefulness of interventions 
to prevent them.

R27 Research should further consider the genetic background of endometriosis, which may not be a 
monogenic disorder, and translate findings into validated tests that can be used in diagnosis and 
prevention.  
  Endometriosis and cancer  
R28 Future studies should investigate the association between endometriosis and cancer using a prospective 
design, with a long duration of follow -up to take into account the temporality of the association, a 
population -based sample with standardised collection of data and recognised criteria for the definition of 
endometriosis, evaluate potential confounding and mediation, and, also importantly, explore 
heterogeneity by reporting associations according to a) endometriosis and cancer subtypes, and b) patient 
characteristics (age, menopausal status, etc). When exploring  endometriosis macro -phenotypes, results 
from both exclusive and non -exclusive subtypes should be reported.  
R29 More research needs to be performed on the mutational and epigenetic profile of endometriosis tissue, 
endometrium from endometriosis patients a nd normal endometrium from women of different ages and 
reproductive histories. Among women with endometriosis, exclusive macro -phenotypes of endometriosis 
should be investigated.  
R30 More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and  endometriosis in general 
to guide the need for monitoring.

I. Diagnosis of endometriosis  
The diagnostic delay of endometriosis is a hallmark of a disease that can have at times crippling effects 
on individuals suffering from its associated symptoms and i mpact on their lives. However, the growth 
rate and potential progression pattern of endometriotic lesions, cysts and nodules remain unclear. This 
is partially the result of a lack of sufficient understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, non-
standardised clinical outcome measures and not- fit-for-purpose staging systems.  For example, data 
from women in the placebo arm of medical trials or from those in the sham  operation arm of surgical 
trials suggest that within six to twelve months endometriosis may progress in about one -third of 
patients whilst similar fractions are seen in non -progressive or even regressive disease ( Evers, 2013 ). 
However, these reports have to be addressed carefully as the numbers are small and because they do 
not take into account the biological activity of individual lesions.  
There exists no convincing correlation between the extent of the disease categorised by the most 
widely used revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) classification and the severity of symptoms. Assuming disease progression in at least some individual s, it is conceivable that early 
diagnosis of endometriosis may also be associated with less extensive disease spread and thus possibly 
better clinical outcomes, for example reduced anatomical distortion of pelvic and reproductive 
structures, thus less requ irement for MAR, fewer pain episodes etc.  
Multiple studies have demonstrated a significant time period between the onset of first symptoms and 
a reliable diagnosis ( Ghai , et al. , 2020 , Hudelist , et al. , 2012 , Staal , et al. , 2016 ). These studies rely on 
data which use mostly surgical confirmation as the gold standard. However, no convincing data exist 
that take empirical treatment as the potential endpoint into account, i.e.,  medical treatment for 
suspected  endometriosis. After considering a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis, the option of 
further diagnostic confirmation or (empirical) treatment should be discussed. Patient preference is a 
relevant issue to be considered here. In this respect, diagnosis of certain presentations of endometriosis 
for example ovarian endometrioma and deep disease by ultrasound or MRI (see below) can be 
considered without laparoscopy and histological confirmation.  
Laparoscopic identification o f endometriotic lesions with histological verification has been described as 
the diagnostic gold standard in the past. (Kennedy , et al. , 2005 ) (Dunselman , et al. , 2014 ). However, 
advances in the quality and availability of imaging modalities for some forms of endometriosis on the 
one hand and the operative risk, limited access to highly qualified surgeons and financial implications 
on the other , call for the urgent need for a refinement of this outdated dogma. Furthermore, 
development of novel and improvement of existing non- invasive methods to reliably detect or exclude 
endometriosis is of paramount importance.  
Other factors may contribute to the delay including lack of awareness both in the general population 
but also in the medical community. Despite its high prevalence, the severity of symptoms and its high 
socioeconomic impact many people have not heard of en dometriosis, let alone the association with 
pain  symptoms  or infertility . Whilst a few countries have put endometriosis on their national agenda, 
it is unlikely that public awareness and consequently clinical outcomes will improve unless 
endometriosis, abn ormal menstrual bleeding and pain form a routine part of the school curriculum.

I.1. Signs and symptoms  
PICO  QUESTION : CAN CLINICAL SYMPTOMS PREDICT THE PRESENCE OF ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
 
In a large retrospective analysis of the UK general practice research database concerning the prevalent 
symptoms within 3 years before the diagnosis of endometriosis (n=5540 each matc hed (year -of-birth 
and practice) to four controls), women with subsequent diagnosis of endometriosis had higher 
proportion of abdominopelvic pain or heavy menstrual bleeding (73 vs. 20%) (Ballard , et al. , 2008) . 
When compared with controls, women with endometriosis had odds ratios ( OR) for the following 
symptoms: abdominopelvic pain 5.2 (4.7  to 5.7), dysmenorrhea 8.1 (7.2  to 9.3), heavy menstrual 
bleeding 4.0 ( 95%CI 3.5 to 4.5), infertility 8.2 ( 95%CI 6.9 to 9.9),  dyspareunia/postcoital bleeding 6.8 
(95%CI 5.7 to 8.2), urinary tract symptoms 1.2 (1.0  to 1.3). In addition, history of being diagnosed with 
an ovarian cyst 7.3 ( 95%CI 5.7 to 9.4), with irritable bowel syndrome 1.6 ( 95%CI 1.3 to 1.8), with pelvic 
infla mmatory disease 3.0 ( 95%CI 2.5 to 3.6) or with fibrocystic breast disease 1.4 ( 95%CI 1.2 to 1.7) 
were risk factors for subsequent diagnosis of endometriosis. Increasing the number of symptoms 
increased the chance of having endometriosis. Furthermore, women  with eventual diagnosis 
endometriosis had consulted the doctor more frequently and  were twice as likely to have had time off 
from work. Finally, the more symptoms were present, the higher the odds of being diagnosed with 
endometriosis were (1 symptom: OR 5.0; 95%CI 4.4 to 5.7; 7 symptoms: OR 84.7; 95%CI 58.8 to 121.8) 
(Ballard , et al. , 2008 ). 
A large prospective multi -centre, observational, two -phase study in 13 countries was conducted to 
generate and validate symptom -based models with the aim to predict endometriosis among 
symptomatic premenopausal women prior to undergoing their first laparoscopy for pain or fer tility 
investigation (Nnoaham, et al. , 2012 ). The study included clinical symptoms, medical history and 
preoperative ultrasound findings and was divided into a first phase focussing on model development 
followed by a second, validation phase. For any (rASRM) stage endometriosis the predictive power of any model without ultrasound was poor ( Area under the curve [ AUC ] 68.3) but  could be improved by 
adding the ultrasound parameter (AU C 80.0). For stage III/IV endometriosis the AUC was reasonable 
(84.9, with a sensitivity of 82.3% and specificity of 75.8% at optimal cut- off at 0.24) when ultrasound 
was included (without ultrasound: 83.3, 70.9% and 84.7%, respectively). Whilst these resul ts are not 
unexpected for stage III/IV endometriosis where ultrasound scan has a high sensitivity and specificity particularly for ovarian endometrioma, the results for endometriosis overall are disappointing (with and 
without ultrasound scan).  
In another prospective study, women undergoing laparoscopy for various gynaecological indications 
were asked about signs and symptoms including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non- cyclical pelvic pain, 
and infertility. However, none of these symptoms were predictive of en dometriosis (Eskenazi , et al. , 
2001 ). 
Forman et al . found in a prospective study in women undergoing laparoscopy for subfertility that only 
severe dysmenorrhea was predictive of endometriosis (RR 1.7) supporting other studies that increased 
severity of dysmenorrhea may indicate the presence of endometriosis ( Eskenazi , et al. , 2001 , Forman , 
et al. , 1993, Hsu, et al. , 2010 ). 
   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  22 
Recommendation (1) 
The GDG recommends that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of endometriosis in 
individuals presenting with the following cyclical and non -cyclical signs and symptoms: 
dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding or 
haem aturia, shoulder tip pain, catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough/  
haemoptysis/chest pain, cyclical scar swelling and pain, fatigue, and infertility.  GPP  
Justification  
Overall, evidence to predict endometriosis based on clinical symptoms alone is weak and incomplete. 
In women seeking help from general practitioners, the following symptoms were found to be risk 
factors for endometriosis: abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding and/or a previous diagnosis of ovarian cyst, irritable bowel 
syndrome or pelvic inflammatory disease. Reporting multiple symptoms increases the chance of 
endometriosis. In specialist health care, severe dysmenorrhea was found to be predictive of a diagnosi s 
of endometriosis in infertile women, but this was not found in all studies.  
Thus, endometriosis should be considered a possible diagnosis in women presenting with such clinical symptoms as it may result in an earlier diagnosis of endometriosis and in an improved quality of life for 
the patients.

PICO  QUESTION:  DOES THE USE OF SYMPTOM DIARIES OR QUESTIONNAIRES COMPARED TO 
TRADITIONAL HISTORY TAKING LEAD TO IMPROVED OR EARLIER DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
 
Pain is a cardinal symptom for many individuals suffering from endometriosis. Pain perception can vary 
individually in intensity, location, time of occurrence and duration.  In addition, pain quality and 
associated sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions may differ at times. Getting a doctor’s 
appointment can often take many weeks or even months after the onset of the pain symptoms.  As 
such, some patients present with summa ries of their symptomatic experiences to their appointment in 
the form of a diary or by answering a questionnaire.  
Pain symptoms in endometriosis patients are rather unspecific and their severity does generally not 
correlate well with the extent of disease  according to the widely used rASRM classification system 
(Vercellini , et al. , 2007) . This may be a reflection of the limitation of this and other available staging 
systems which are primarily designed to d escribe disease extent and location for surgical purposes and 
do not take biological aspects such a disease activity into account (Johnson , et al. , 2017 ). Other staging 
systems await large scale validation (Haas , et al. , 2013) . 
There exists a n unmet  clinical need for a reproducible and easy -to-use objective patient -reported 
outcome (PRO) tool of endometriosis -associated symptoms primarily for therapeutic studies ( Gater , et 
al., 2020 , Jones , et al. , 2006) . Similarly, such measures may prove helpful in advancing diagnostic 
accuracy of existing methods and avoid inter - and intra -rater  variability (Deal , et al. , 2010 , van Nooten , 
et al. , 2018 , Wyrwich , et al. , 2018 ). Whilst there are different PRO tools  available, to date no study has 
assessed whether their use or the use of symptom diaries compared to traditional history takin g 
techniques has shortened or improved the diagnosis of endometriosis neither for screening nor for triaging of symptomatic patients (Surrey , et al. , 2017). However , it is likely that objective assessment 
tools will facilitate large scale studies into this.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  23 
Conclusion  
Although currently  no evidence exists that a symptom diary/questionnaire/app reduces the time to 
diagnosis or leads to earlier diagnosis, the GDG considers their potential benefit in complementing the 
traditional history taking process  as it aids in objectifying pain and empowering women to de monstrate 
their symptoms.  
Research recommendation  (R1) 
Randomised research studies are recommended to verify whether symptom diaries or questionnaires 
lead to improved or earlier diagnosis of endometriosis .

I.2. Diagnostic work -up 
I.2.a Clinical examination  
PICO  QUESTION : DOES CLINICAL EXAMINATION OF SYMPTOMATIC WOMEN RELIABLY PREDICT THE 
PRESENCE OF ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
 
Endometriosis is predominantly an intra -abdominal disease (for extrapelvic endometriosis , see C hapter 
VII). Clinical examination in women suspected with abdominal endometriosis includes physical 
examination of the pelvis but also the inspection and palpation of the abdomen with the aim to facilitate 
diagnosis and to optimise treatment decisions. Where appropriate, vaginal inspection should include a 
speculum as well as bimanual and rectovaginal palpation (Bazot, et al. , 2009 , Chapron , et al. , 2002 ). A 
prospective study has demonstrated that reliability of the  clinical examination in detecting pelvic 
endometriosis is improved during menstruation ( Koninckx , et al. , 1996) . 
For women with peritoneal endometriosis and adhesions one study suggested a similar diagnostic accuracy of bimanual examination and transvaginal ultrasound in women with an immobile uterus and adnexal mass or tenderness (Nezhat , et al. , 1994 ). Uterine mobility or rather a lack thereof was found 
as a predictive marker in another retrospective study of almost 800 infertile women with  surgica lly 
confirmed endometriosis (Khawaja , et al. , 2009 ). In another retrospective study of 284 women with 
chronic pelvic pain, anterior vaginal wall tenderness had a sensitivity of 17% in women with endometriosis without interstitial cystitis (Paulson and Paulson, 2011 ).  
In a prospective study involving 129 women with superficial, ovarian,  and deep endometriosis, the 
prevalence and accuracy of diagnosing endometriosis by clinical examination were investigated. The 
sensitivity/specificity were reported for endometriosis on the ovary 44%/99%, uterosacral ligaments 
50%/80%, pouch of Douglas 76%/92%, vagina 73%/98%, rectovaginal space 78%/98%, urinary bladder 
25%/100%, and rectosigmoid 39%/97%, respectively. . Values for transvaginal ultrasound ( TVUS) were 
similar for most locations but  were superior to vaginal examination in cases of ovarian, uterosacral 
ligament and rectosigmoid endometriosis (Hudelist , et al. , 2011 ). 
For deep endometriosis, vaginal examination can facilitate the detection of infiltration or nodules of 
the vagina, uterosacral ligaments,  or pouch of Douglas , whereas sensitivity was poor for endometriosis 
of the vagina, uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum,  and intestine (50%, 73%, 18% ad 46%, 
respectively) (Bazot, et al. , 2009 ). 
Rectovaginal digital examination may allow the detection of infiltration or mass involving the 
rectosigmoid colon or adnexal masses ( Bazot , et al. , 2009 , Condous , et al. , 2007 , Eskenazi , et al. , 2001 , 
Koninckx , et al. , 1996 , Ripps and Martin, 1992 ). 
Recommendations (2-3) 
Clinical examination, including vaginal examination where appropriate, should be 
considered to identify deep nodules or endometriomas in patients with suspected 
endometriosis, although the diagnostic accuracy is low.  ⊕ 
 
In women with suspected endometriosis, further diagnostic steps, including imaging, 
should be considered even if the clinical examination is normal.  ⊕⊕  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  25 
Justification  
Overall, the evidence suggests that clinical examination of symptomatic women does not reliably 
predict the presence of endometriosis in the abdomen and pelvis.  
In the first (strong) recommendation,  the GDG weighed the benefits of clinical examination versus the 
burden for patients. Clinical examination may be useful for a diagnosis of endometriosis  and/or other 
diseases  and it may lead to further, more specific diagnostic approaches e.g., using medi cal 
technologies (see below). The financial burden of clinical examination is minimal as it can be performed 
at low costs.  In the second (strong) recommendation, further diagnostic steps are recommended. The 
evidence level for this recommendation is derive d from the evidence for diagnostic imaging.  
Vaginal and/or rectovaginal  examination might be inappropriate in certain situations and in 
adolescents. Furthermore, it can be very painful in some women. In these women, with high burden/discomfort (adolescent s, due to religion, painful examination, sexual abuse in the past, virgo 
intacta etc.) vaginal examination should ideally be omitted and other medical technologies, as described below, should be used as a first step towards diagnosis.  Clinical examination in adolescence 
is discussed in chapter V.

I.2.b Medical technologies  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES RELIABLE IN DIAGNOSING ENDOMETRIOSIS AND 
ESTABLISHING THE EXTENT OF THE DISEASE ? 
 
The significant delay in diagnosing endometriosis is ubiquitously evident and poses an enormous 
burden on affected women worldwide. Currently, pelvic/abdominal disease is clinically subdivided into superficial (peritoneal/serosal) lesions, ovarian endometriosis cysts (endometrioma) and deep 
endometriosis  (by arbitrary definition more than 5 mm below the serosal/peritoneal surface)  (Cornillie , 
et al. , 1990 ). However, it is likely that with further insight into the underlying disease processes using 
new technologies and large -scale studies, in the future more distinct classification systems will emerge 
with the aim of improv ing both diagnostic accuracy and th erapeutic efficacy.  
Medical technologies are successfully used in many conditions to identify or rule out disease. Similarly, 
such approaches have been studied in endometriosis patients. These include imaging technologies, 
biomarkers,  and surgery alone and in combination. Applying imaging methods and the interpretation 
of their results can be dependent on a clinician’s experience and skill (e. g. ultrasound, surgery) and the 
availability of the imaging equipment (e. g. MRI). Thus, the transferability of data from published studies 
performed by experts to the general medical community has to be considered and potentially adapted 
to the local situation. Similarly, biomarkers require standardised collection and storage protocols for 
biological samples, accompan ying clinical and surgical data needs to be of the highest standard using 
evidence -based tools ( Becker , et al. , 2014 , Casper, 2014, Fassbender , et al. , 2014 , Rahmioglu , et al. , 
2014 , Vitonis , et al. , 2014 ) and clinical studies adequate outcome measures  (Duffy , et al. , 2020 ). 
Over the years, a dogma has emerged that a laparoscopy is the gold standard to diagnose 
endometriosis. However, although routinely performed in most countries, it remains an invasive 
procedure with potential morbidity and even mortality  (Byrne , et al., 2018a , Chapron, et al. , 1998 ). 
Thus, a reliable, ideally inexpensive non -invasive approach with high sensitiv ity and specificity would be 
the preferable approach.  To move away from the reliance of invasive diagnostic means such as  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  26 
laparoscopy, large scale international, multi -centre studies are urgently needed using novel 
technological platforms, meticulous stand ardised phenotyping, sufficient funding and an open mind.  
 
I.2.b.1 Biomarkers  
There exists a multitude of published studies which tested potential biological markers for their 
predictability of the presence or absence of endometriosis, mostly in symptomatic patients. It is highly likely that negative results could not be published s uggesting a high rate of publication bias in this field. 
May et al . first systematically summarised the available data on potential blood, urine,  and endometrial 
biomarkers (May , et al. , 2010, May , et al. , 2011 ). A recently updated review of available studies us ing 
the Cochrane Collaboration tool set confirmed the initial findings that currently there are no reliable 
biomarkers available for clinical use (Gupta , et al. , 2016, Liu, et al. , 2015 , Nisenblat, et al. , 2016a ). 
Unfortunately, all studies included were found to be of poor methodological quality. The group 
assessed these studies for their value as a replacement or triage test against the existing standard of 
laparoscopy (Wykes , et al. , 2004 ). 
For blood tests, the authors concluded that, although a subset of biomarkers could prove useful in detecting endometriosis or differentiating ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian tumours, there was insufficient evid ence to draw meaningful conclusions  (Nisenblat, et al. , 2016a ). 
Similarly, studies on urinary markers did not show sufficient quality for recommendation for routine clinical use  (Liu, et al. , 2015) . 
The group then looked at available studies on endometrial markers. A meta -analysis of seven studies 
found, that the histologica l assessment of the neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) 
would potentially meet the criteria for a replacement test for laparoscopy (sensitivity 0.96 ; 95%CI 0.91 
to 1.00; specificity 0.86 ; 95%CI 0.70  to 1.00) (Gupta, et al. , 2016 ). However, the studies demonstrated 
considerable heterogeneity. Other neuronal markers including vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), 
substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP), and a combination of 
PGP 9.5, SP, and VIP were thought to show promise as potential markers, but the evidence was either 
poor quality or insufficient (Gupta , et al. , 2016 ). 
Another systematic review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CA -125 for endometriosis  (Hirsch , et al. , 
2016 ). This review included 19 prospective and three retrospective observational studies involving a 
total of 3626 participants. By including only studies with histologically confirmed endometriosis as the 
reference standard using a threshold of 30 units/ml, Hirs ch et al . calculated a pooled specificity of 93% 
(95%CI 89 to 95%), but only a sensitivity of 52% (95%CI  38 to 66%) for all endometrioses . Previously, 
Mol et al.,  by focussing on women undergoing fertility and pelvic pain investigation, found that the 
performance of serum CA -125 was low to detect any form of endometriosis, but better for stage III/IV 
endometriosis  (Mol, et al. , 1998 ). The latter finding was also confirmed in a systematic review and meta -
analysis  (Hirsch , et al. , 2016) . However, Mol et al . also included studies with only visual confirmation of 
endometriosis which may partially explain the lower performance  (Fernando , et al. , 2013 , Kazanegra , 
et al. , 2008) . 
More recently, miRNAs which are known to regulated genes crucial for processes involved in the 
pathogenesis of endometriosis have been assessed for their clinical potential as biomarkers. A pilot 
study was followed by a small validation study assessing the use of a microRNA panel as a non -invasive 
diagnostic method for detecting endometriosis  (Cosar , et al. , 2016 , Moustafa , et al. , 2020 ). Serum from 
women undergoing surgery for suspected be nign indications was tested for miR -125b -5p, miR -150-5p, 
miR-342-5p and miR -451a. Using an algorithm for combining the expression values this set of miRNAs 
could differentiate between 41 women with confirmed endometriosis and 59 controls and confirmed in an independent but previously used data set (n=24 for both groups). Interestingly, neither menstrual  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  27 
status nor hormonal medication appeared to influence the outcome significantly, although the number 
of included participants in these subgroup analyses was very small. Overall, confirmation in larger, 
independent studies is required before routine clinical use can be advised. In another study set using 
sequencing, model building and then testing of the model identified miRNAs failed the test of validation  
(Vanhie , et al. , 2019 ).  
Recommendation  (4)  
Clinicians should not use measurement of biomarkers in endometrial tissue, blood, 
menstrual or uterine fluids to diagnose endometriosis.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Overall, no biological markers currently exist that reliably can rule in and rule out endometriosis.  
From the literature, CA -125 can be considered as a screening marker for symptomatic patients, it is also 
inexpensive and widely available. It may convince primary care physicians that endometriosis is a 
possible reason for the symptoms prompting further investigation.  
However, a negative result does not rule out the disease which bears the risk that patients who have a 
negative CA -125 are dismissed.  Furthermore, it is co nsidered that even a positive test is not clinically 
relevant, and may cause anxiety in the patient, and possible overtreatment. As such, CA -125 testing is 
not considered relevant in the diagnosis of endometriosis.  
Research recommenda tion (R2) 
The GDG recommends large, multi -centre prospective studies with independent validation sample sets 
to investigate the potential benefit of biomarkers in the detection and prognosis of endometriosis.

I.2.b.2 Imaging techniques in the diagnosis of endometriosis  
Imaging techniques commonly applied in benign gynaecology  include (where appropriate) transvaginal 
ultraso und scan (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whilst most ultrasound scans are part of 
routine initial investigations in primary care, more advanced ultrasound scan and MRIs are usually only 
available through secondary and tertiary care routes.  
As pa rt of a set of Cochrane reviews on diagnostic tools for endometriosis, existing evidence of various 
imaging modalities for the non -invasive diagnosis of endometriosis was published in 2016 (Nisenblat, 
et al. , 2016b ). The diagnostic accuracy of superficial, ovarian,  and deep endometriosis was compared 
with surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. Altogether, results from 49 studies involving 4807 
women were included.  
Pelvic (superficial) endometriosis:  
For overall pelvic endometriosis, none of the imaging modaliti es showed superior sensitivity and 
specificity to laparoscopy (Wykes , et al. , 2004 ). Reported findings were heterogeneous with wide 
confidence intervals. However, transvaginal ultrasound scan showed  good specificity (95% ; 95%CI 89 
to 100%), but poor sensitivity  (65% ; 95%CI 27% to 100%) . MRI showed both poor specificity and 
sensitivity (72% and 79%, respectively) as well as strong heterogeneity between studies. Two small studies , included in the review,  using 3.0 tesla MRI reported specificity of 100% and sensitivity between 
81-95% (Manganaro , et al. , 2012 , Thomeer , et al. , 2014) . However, because of the small size of the 
studies  and large confidence intervals interpretation of the data was cautioned. Studies using other 
imaging techniques such as PET -CT did not meet inclusion criteria  (Nisenblat, e t al., 2016b ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  28 
Ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma):  
For ovarian endometriotic cysts, studies assessing transvaginal ultrasound showed good mean 
specificity and sensitivity with reasonable confidence intervals and heterogeneity ( specificity 96%, 
95%CI  92 to 99%;  sensitivity  93%, 95%CI  87 to 99%)  (Nisenblat, et al. , 2016b ). 
For MRI, mean specificity and sensitivity were similar to those from transvaginal ultrasound scan studies (91% and 95%, respectively). One study compared MRI directly with transvaginal and transrectal 
ultrasound (Bazot , et al. , 2009) . Whilst transrectal ultrasound scan had a lower specificity and sensitivity 
(77% and 89%, respecti vely), results for transvaginal ultrasound (86% and 94%, respectively) and MRI  
(88% and 92%, respectively)  were similarly promising.  
Deep endometriosis  
Deep endometriosis can involve many areas in the pelvis such as visceral organs ( e.g.,  bowel, bladder), 
the pelvic wall and its retroperitoneal structures (ureters, nerves, blood vessels etc.). For transvaginal 
ultrasound (including conventional ultrasound, 3 -D ultrasound and sonovaginography) overall 
specificity and sensitivity estimates h ave been reported as 94% and 79%, respectively, whereas 
sensitivity may be slightly improved with 3 -D ultrasound (87%) (Guerriero , et al. , 2014 ). However, no 
data were available on the minimum size of the lesions detectable. Furthermore, even in exper ienced 
hands both sensitivity and specificity can vary depending on the location of the disease in the pelvis 
with the poorest accuracy probably for deep endometriosis involving either uterosacral ligaments or 
the vagina ( Bazot, et al. , 2009 ). 
Studies assessing the role of MRI in diagnosing deep endometriosis of the pelvis reported an overall 
mean specificity of 77% (95%CI 44 to  100%) and a mean sensitivity of 94% (95%CI 90 to  97%)  (Nisenblat , 
et al. , 2016b ). 
Deep endometriosis ; Rectosigmoid  
For endometriosis of the rectosigmoid a more recent systematic review of eight studies comparing MRI and transvaginal US reported a pooled specificity and sensitivity for MRI of 96% (95%CI 94 to 97%) and 
90% (95%CI 87 to 92%), respectively , and for transva ginal ultrasound 96% specificity ( 95%CI  94 to 97%) 
and 90% sensitivity (95%CI 87 to 92%). There was no significant difference between both methods 
(Moura , et al. , 2019 ). 
Overall, these data suggest that transvaginal ultrasound and MRI have a similar or slightly better 
specificity and sensitivity than surgery  for ovarian and deep endometriosis. When it comes to superficial 
disease, these or any other imaging modalities do not seem to have a superior diagnostic value 
compared to laparoscopic surgery (Wykes , et al. , 2004 ). However, one has to take a few points into 
account when addressing the question of whether imaging should replace surgery as the gold standard 
for endometriosis . Firstly, the results from the systematic review by Wykes et al ., which is often used 
as the standard , are based on four studies including 413 patients. Secondly, in the published studies , 
imaging was performed by experts in the field and therefore the res ults have to be interpreted  with 
caution when they are translated into real world scenarios , even if t his applies to both approaches  (US 
and MRI) . Thirdly, the methodological quality of some of the data were generally deemed as low and 
only few studies cou ld be included in the systematic reviews. Fourthly, one has to take into account the 
pros and cons of an invasive procedure such as a laparoscopy ( e.g.,  the associated morbidity and 
mortality ) versus the possibility of treatment and empowerment of women who have been suffering 
from often debilitating symptoms to objectify and demonstrate the disease. Costs, availability of 
equipment and expertise for both imaging and surgery need to be included into the decision -making 
process.  
 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  29 
Recommendations (5-7) 
Clinicians are recommended to use imaging (US or MRI) in the diagnostic work -up for 
endometriosis, but they need to be aware that a negative finding does not exclude 
endometriosis, particularly superficial peritoneal disease.  ⊕⊕ 
 
In patients with negative imaging results or where empirical treatment was unsuccessful 
or inappropriate, the GDG recommends that clinicians consider offering laparoscopy for 
the diagnosis and treatment of suspected endometriosis.  GPP  
 
The GDG recommends that laparoscopic identification of endometriotic lesions is 
confirmed by histology although negative histology does not entirely rule out the 
disease.  GPP 
Justification  
Taking the factors discussed by Wykes et al. and available data into account, it is likely that particularly 
dedicated transvaginal ultrasound in experienced hands but also MRI can replace surgery are the gold 
standard for the diagnosis of ovarian endometr iosis cysts and deep endometriosis in the pelvis. 
However, the non -invasive diagnosis of superficial disease remains a significant challenge and can 
currently not accurately diagnosed or ruled out by the available imaging modalities.  The GDG 
formulated a s trong recommendation for using imaging in the diagnostic work -up with a sidenote on 
false -negative results. Two further good practice points were formulated to support clinical practice.  
Research recommendation  (R3) 
The GDG recommends research into the de velopment of comprehensive and inclusive consensus 
criteria for the diagnosis of endometriosis, as an alternative or adjunct to diagnosis via 
laparoscopy/histology.

I.2.c Diagnostic laparoscopy or empirical treatment  
PICO  QUESTION : DOES DIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY COMPARED TO EMPIRICAL MEDICAL 
TREATMENT RESULT IN BETTER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN WOMEN SUSPECTED OF 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
 
As established above, there exist copious diagnostic challenges for endometriosis in general, in 
particular for superficial pelvic disease due  a variety of factors including the lack of clinically relevant 
biomarkers, lack of specific symptoms and the inability of current imaging techniques to reliably identify 
or rule out small lesions ( Zondervan, et al. , 2020 ). 
There exists the widespread concept that laparoscopy is the accepted standard to diagnose abdominal endometriosis which was formulated in the first edition of this guideline (Kennedy , et al. , 2005 ). 
However, laparoscopic surgery, albeit its widespread use, is expensive, invasive,  and associated with 
morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, direct, photo graphic,  and histological proof of lesions could 
potentially be an important psychological factor for women who have been suffering from the 
symptoms of an otherwise invisible disease creating a platform of acceptance for themselves and their  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  30 
environment. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery need to be weighed up against its risks ( Bafort, et 
al., 2020 , Byrne , et al. , 2018b , Chapron , et al. , 1998) . 
Practically, a two -step approach should be sought which would include a transvaginal (where 
appropriate) ultrasound followed by empirical treatment (if the patient is not trying to conceive) . 
Particularly in the primary care setting if endometriosis is suspected , imaging results are negative  and 
the affected person is not acutely trying to conceive, symptomatic patients usually are offered 
hormonal treatment mostly in the form of the oral contraceptive pill or pro gestogens as a first -line 
treatment (Kuznetsov , et al. , 2017 ). If symptoms improve, endometriosis is presumed the main 
underlying condition, although other clinical causes can (co -)exist. This ‘blinded’ approach is widely 
known as empirical treatment.  
Conclusion  
Both diagnostic laparoscopy and imaging combined with empirical treatment ( hormonal  contraceptive s 
or progestogens) can be considered in women suspected of endometriosis. There is no evidence of 
superiority of either approach  and pros and cons should be discussed with the patient .

I.3. Long term m onitoring  
PICO  QUESTION : IS LONG TERM MONITORING OF WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS BENEFICIAL IN 
PREVENTING ADVERSE OUTCOMES (RECURRENCE , COMPLICATIONS , MALIGNANCY ) ? 
 
In order to answer the question whether long term monitoring of women with endometriosis is 
beneficial, one needs to understand the natural course of the disease. Endometriosis is generally 
considered to have a ch ronic course. However, there exist only few reports on disease progression. 
Women included in clinical trials for medical or surgical treatment who were randomised to the placebo/sham operation arm of the studies had progression (higher rASRM score) in approximately 
29% of cases at second look laparoscopy after 3 -6 months (Evers, 2013 ). No change or a lower rASRM 
score were reported in 29% and 42%, respectively.  
Irrespective of treatment approach, data suggest a recurrence rate of 20 -50% within five years (Guo, 
2009 ). However, data on whether these numbers constitute recurrence of symptoms and/or disease 
remains unclear.  
Whilst an ovarian endometrioma can be monitored fairly easily by ultrasound, superficial peritoneal 
disease is usually not detectable without surgery. In addition, as neither the occurrence, magnitude nor 
the speed of any change in disease extent is clear and the correlation between disease stage and 
symptom severity is poor, the question arises whether monitoring of endometriosis is feasible and of 
any benefit. Early detection could lead to early and potentially less complex treatment and potentially 
a red uced risk of the development of chronic pain. On the other hand, it could lead to unnecessary 
additional invasive procedures and treatment side effects.  
In a small study evaluating the potential use of serial CA -125 serum concentrations to monitor 
endometr iosis, a subgroup of women had a second look laparoscopy. In 24/26 of these women changes 
in CA -125 correlated with surgical findings ( Pittaway, 1990 ). Matalliotakis et al . monitored CA -125 in 
women with endometriosis who were treated with Danazol and found a significant reduction of serum 
levels after 3 months of treatment. However, no confirmation/change of  disease status was reported 
(Matalliotakis , et al. , 1994 ). 
Another group used serum CA -125 levels as a surrogate marker for disease progression ( Chen , et al. , 
1998 ). Involving 75 women with ‘advanced’ endometriosis who were treated with surgery and 
postoperative danazol , the authors concluded that CA- 125 was not a reliable marker to monitor 
therapy. However, in a small subset of patients who underwent second look laparoscopy after one year, 
CA-125 levels were higher in women with recurrence (n=15) than in those without recurrent 
endometriosis (n=9).  
Endometriosis can have a different effect on each individual. Therefore, monitorin g should not be 
purely focussed on imaging and blood tests. Physical examination and assessment of the mental impact 
should be considered.  
Recommendations (8-9) 
Follow -up and psychological support should be considered in women with confirmed 
endometriosis, particularly deep and ovarian endometriosis, although there is currently 
no evidence of benefit of regular long -term  monitoring for early detection of recurrence, 
complications,  or malignancy.  ⊕ 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  32 
The appropriate frequency and type of follow -up or monitoring is unknown and should 
be individuali sed based on previous and current treatments and severity of the disease 
and symptoms.  GPP 
Justification  
There currently exist no studies of sufficient quality or size to address the question of whether patients 
with endometriosis should be monitored long term.

Research re commendation  (R4) 
The GDG recommends large longitudinal intervention studies to investigate the potential benefits and 
best long -term management approaches for women with endometriosis.

I.4. Impact of the time of diagnosis on quality of life  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : DOES EARLY DIA GNOSIS OF ENDOMETRIOSIS VERSUS LATE DIAGNOSIS LEAD 
TO BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE ? 
 
In many cases, endometriosis can have a detrimental effect on the lives of affected women, their 
partners, and families ( Culley , et al. , 2013b ). The negative impact of endometrios is-associated 
symptoms is complex and multidimensional which should be assessed using validated tools ( Jones , et 
al., 2004 , Jones , et al. , 2001 ). A retrospective 15 -year follow- up study demonstrated that half of women 
with surgically confirmed endometriosis reported a negative impact on different aspects of their life (education, work ability, relationship, and social life ) (Ballard , et al. , 2006 ). It is conceivable that an early 
diagnosis, ideally followed by early, adequate treatment will reduce pain, reduce the risk of infertility, and deliver patients an explanation for their symptoms. To date, no adequate studies so far exist 
assessing whether an early versus late diagnosis leads to change in quality of life. However, women may 
experience benefits from the diagnosis (and adequate treatment) of endometriosis. Qualitative studies have demonstrated that diagnosis of the dise ase can result in feelings of relief, legitimation, liberation 
and empowerment as it can enable women and their partners to better understand the reason for their 
symptoms, to accept the situation and to be able to make sense of their circumstances. Furthe rmore, 
reliably identifying endometriosis may have other, far -reaching consequences including enhanced 
access to support services and awareness in the workplace which may lead to positive adjustments 
improving not only the lives of affected women but also of employers by managing expectations and 
goals (Culley , et al. , 2013a , Culley , et al. , 2013b ). 
Conclusion  
Although no adequate studies exist to support the benefits of early versus late diagnosis, the GDG 
recommends that in symptomatic women, attempts should be made  to relieve symptoms, either by 
empirical treatment or after a diagnosis of endometriosis.  
Research recommendation  (R5) 
The GDG recommends large longitudinal studies to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on the 
quality of life of women with endometriosis.

restricted to these terms. In the searches, quality of life was included, although this was found as an 
outcome in only a limited number of studies.  
This chapter on the treatment of endometriosis -associated pain is s ubdivided into sections on empirical 
treatment, medical treatment, surgical treatment, pre - or postoperative medical treatment (including 
secondary prevention after surgery) and non- medical management strategies. It has to be noted that 
endometriosis is a chronic and incurable disease in a significant number of women. The treatments described in this section can offer (partial, often only temporary) relief of pain symptoms, but 
symptoms often recur after discontinuation of therapy.  
 
II.1. Analgesics  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE ANALGESICS EFFECTIVE FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF OF PAINFUL SYMPTOMS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
 
Most women with suspected or known endometriosis who would like pharmacological analgesia will 
buy over -the-counter medications or be prescribed s imple analgesics, such as paracetamol and non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the available evidence to support their use is of 
very low quality and based on one study ( Brown , et al. , 2017, Kauppila and Ronnberg, 1985 ). There is 
also some limited evidence that NSAIDs might inhibit ovulation if taken continuously during the cycle (making conception less likely) (Norman, 2001 ).  
Neuromodulators ( e.g., anti-depressants, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors or anticonvulsants) are 
used mainly by pain medicine specialists and primary care physicians in the management of chronic or persistent pain. Neuromodulators differ from conventional analgesics, such  as NSAIDs, in that they 
primarily affect the central nervous system’s modulation of pain rather than peripheral meditators of 
inflammation. Tricyclic antidepressants ( e.g.,  amitriptyline, nortriptyline), selective serotonin uptake 
inhibitors ( e.g., duloxe tine) and anticonvulsants ( e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin) have all shown 
promise in the treatment of endometriosis -associated pain . However, in randomised clinical trials for 
the management of chronic pelvic pain, they have not been proven to be clearly superior to placebo and are sometimes associated with severe, dose -limiting side effects ( Horne , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendation  (10) 
Women may be offered NSAIDs or other analgesics (either alone or in combination 
with other treatments) to reduce endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕ 
Justification  
The evidence for use of NSAIDs for management of pain symptoms related to endometriosis is scarce 
and limited to one small RCT. There is a general anti -inflammatory effect of some analgesics, they can  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  36 
be used in conjunction with surgery and/or hormonal tre atments and they may possibly prevent of 
complications of chronic pain ( e.g.,  peripheral,  and central sensitisation). However, analgesics may also 
have side effects, and NSAIDs specifically may have some gastrointestinal side effects. There is no 
evidence that analgesics have an effect on disease progression. Overall, with limited risks and 
considering the wide availability and use of analgesics, the GDG concluded that NSAIDs or other analgesics may be offered for the treatment of endometriosis -associated pain  (weak recommendation) .

II.2. Hormone treatments  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE HORMONE THERAPIES EFFECTIVE FOR PAINFUL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
 
Hormone therapy is based on the evidence that endometriosis is a ‘steroid dependent’ condition.  
Treatments are often started when endometriosis is suspected in young women prior to surgical 
confirmation of lesions and are also offered after surgery when symptoms persist after surgical 
intervention e.g.,  for persistent or recurrent disease. The most commonly prescribed treatments for 
endometriosis include drugs that modify the hormonal environment either by suppressing ovarian 
activity or acting directly on steroid  receptors and enzymes found in the lesions. These include 
progestogens , anti -progestogens , combined oral contraceptives, gonadotrophin releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system  (LNG -IUS), danazol and 
aroma tase inhibitors ( e.g.,  letrozole).  
All of the above hormone treatments lead to a clinically significant reduction in pain when compared 
to placebo (when visual analogue scales for dysmenorrhea and non -menstrual pelvic pain are used) 
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2017 ). In clinical trials, the  magnitude of this 
treatment effect has been shown to be similar for all treatments, ( suggesting that there is little 
difference between them in their capacity to reduce pain ) and none of the hormone treatments free 
of side effects. In clinical practice, the efficacy and side -effect profiles of these therapies a re highly 
individual, and unfortunately finding a good therapy is often ‘trial and error’. . In addition, the 
contraceptive properties of the hormones may be unwanted if fertility is an issue, or may be welcome, if the woman does not wish to become pregnant . 
Recommendations (11-12) 
It is recommended to offer women hormone treatment (combined hormonal 
contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists) as one of the options 
to reduce endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that clinicians take a shared decision -making approach and take 
individual preferences, side effects, individual efficacy, costs,  and availability into 
consideration when choosing hormone treatments for endometriosis -associated pain.  GPP 
Justification  
There is moderate quality evidence of benefit for all listed hormone treatments for relief of painful 
symptoms related to endometriosis. As there is no evidence that hormone treatments have a negative 
effect on disease progression and they generally have limited side effects, prescribing hormone 
treatment is recommended  (strong recommendation) . Moreover, hormone treatments, such as the 
contraceptive pill, may be indicated for contraception anyway. As there is no evidence of superiority of one hormone treatment compared to others, the GDG recommends a shared decision -making  
approach.  
These overarching recommendations should be read and applied in consideration of the remainder of 
this section  which provides more detailed information on the different medical treatments including 
their efficacy and side -effect profile.

II.2.a. Combined hormonal contraceptives.  
II.2.a.1 Efficacy (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea,  and non -menstrual pain)  
The data on the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) on endometriosis -related pain 
have recently been summari sed in three systematic reviews.  
The review of Grandi et al , summarizing data on several OCPs but also other agents such as progestin 
only contraceptives, concluded that OCPs result in a statistically significant reduction in endometriosis -
related pain, resulting in improvement in quality of life (QoL) (Grandi , et al. , 2019 ). 
The review of Jensen et al . included RCTs and other studies and concluded that OCP treatment results 
in clinically important and statistically significant reductions in endometriosis -related pain. They 
reported clinically significant reductions in dysmenorrhea according to 100 -mm VA S scores in all the 
reviewed studies using this scale. With regards to noncyclic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, the reviewers 
also reported clinically significant reductions. OCP treatment further resulted in improvements in QoL 
in most studies that measured  this outcome ( Jensen , et al. , 2018)   
A Cochrane review by Brown et al , based on 5 RCTs comparing combined OCP with placebo (2 RCTs) 
and other medical treatments (3 RCTs) (Brown , et al. , 2018 ). From the trials comparing OCP with 
placebo, the review concluded that OCP was associated with improvements in self -reported pain 
(dysmenorrhea ), cyclical non -menstrual pain, dyspareunia and dyschezia. From the trials comparing 
OCP with another medical treatment, data suitable for meta -analysis were only available from one trial 
that compared the OCP with goserelin ( Vercellini , et al. , 1993 ). There was no clear evidence of a 
difference between groups for dysmenorrhea pain reduction or non- menstrual pain reduction.  
II.2.a.2. Continuous vs cyclic use  
Continuous use of the OCP and the associated achievement of amenorrhea, rather than standard c yclic 
use, has been suggested as an effective treatment for endometriosis -associated dysmenorrhea 
(Vercellini , et al. , 2003 ). Additionally, it was hypothesi sed that continuous treatment with OCP may 
homogeni se the hormonal milieu and increase the efficiency of therapy (Vercellini , et al. , 2003 ). 
Efficacy  
A systematic review and meta -analysis by Muzii and colleagues compared continuous versus cyclic OCP 
use for the treatment of endometriosis -associated pain and reported that the continuous regimen 
appears to be more efficacious with regards to dysmenorrhea recurrence (RR 0.24; 95%CI  0.06 -0.91) 
(Muzii , et al. , 2016 ). Nonsignificant differences between continuous and cyclic OCP use were reported 
for chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, and a trend toward lower cyst recurrence rates for a 
continuous OCP (RR 0.54; 95%CI 0.28  to 1.05).  
Safety  
In a review on OCP use, continuous treatment did not seem to affect coagulation, metabolism, or bone 
metabolism and bone mineral density more than conventionally taken OCPs (Hee, et al. , 2013 ). The 
review did not find  any comparative studies on the risk of arterial complications with conventional OC P 
use vs. continuous OC P use. 
II.2.a.3. Mode of administration  
In the review of Grandi et al , studies reporting on the efficacy of the vaginal ring and transdermal patch 
were summari sed (Grandi , et al. , 2019 ). The review reported two  studies. A patient preference trial  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  39 
show ed that continuous 48 -week treatment with a vaginal ring (ethinylestradiol (EE) 15 mg + 
etonogestrel 120 mg/d) was more effective than a transdermal patch (EE 20 mg + norelgestromin 150 
mg/d) (Vercellini , et al. , 2010 ). The second study compared desogestrel -only contraceptive pill versus 
sequential contraceptive vaginal ring in the treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis infiltrating the 
rectum. At 48 weeks of follow -up, women using the desogestrel -only contraceptive pill group reported 
a significantly highe r rate of treatment satisfaction and they were significantly more satisfied with 
changes in gastrointestinal symptoms. No difference was  reported regarding the reduction in nodule 
volume, the rate of withdrawal after the completion of the study and the rate of women who decided 
to undergo surgery ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2014 )  
Recommendations (13-14) 
It is recommended to prescribe women a combined hormonal contraceptive (oral, 
vaginal ring or transdermal) to reduce endometriosis -associated dyspareunia, 
dysmenorrhea,  and non -menstrual pain.  ⊕⊕ 
 
Women suffering from endometriosis -associated dysmenorrhea can be offered the 
continuous use of a combined hormonal contraceptive pill.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The Cochrane review on OCP for endometriosis -associated pain reported the OCP to be more effective 
than placebo for treatment of endometriosis -associated pain (Brown , et al. , 2018 ). Another review, 
including both RCTs and observational studies, reported clinically important and statistically significant 
reductions in endometriosis -related pain with OCP treatment (Jensen , et al. , 2018 ). As OCP is cost -
effective (cheap), considered safe and often required for contraception, the GDG formulated a strong recommendation for the use of the OCP. Only 2 patient preference trials provided data on the comparison of different modes of adminis tration (OCP, vaginal contraceptive ring, transdermal patch). 
With sparse data, preference one mode of administration could not be recommended over another.  
In the comparison of continuous versus cyclic OCP use, the data for efficacy are deduced from few small 
studies, although summari sed in a meta -analysis. Data show that continuous OCP use may be superior 
for dysmenorrhea recurrence (Muzii , et al. , 2016 ). A review by Hee et al . reported no difference in the 
safety profile of both regimens (Hee, et al. , 2013 ). As such, continuous OCP  use can be offered  (weak 
recommendation) , for instance when patients with endometriosis prefer a regimen that induces 
amenorrhea.  The occurrence of breakthrough bleeding and possible consequential adaptations to the 
medical treatment should be discussed with the patient.

II.2.b. Progestogens (including progest ogen-only contraceptives) and anti -
progestogens.  
II.2.b.1 Efficacy  
The Cochrane review of Brown et al . is the most recent Cochrane review reporting on the effectiveness 
of progestogens  (including progest ogen-only contraceptives) and anti -progestogens  in the treatment 
of endometriosis -associated pain (Brown , et al. , 2012) . Interventions included in the review are depot 
medroxyprogesterone acetate, cytoproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone/norethisterone acetate, desogestrel (both commonly also prescribed as progest ogen- 
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  40 
only contraceptives) and dieno gest. Gestrinone was the only anti -progest ogen ( i.e., a substance that 
prevents cells from making or using progesterone) included. The conclusion from this literature review 
is that both continuous progestogens  and continuous gestrinone  are effective therapies for the 
treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. There was no overall evidence of a 
benefit of one oral progestogen over another. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the paucity of data and lack of placebo -controlled studies.  
Only 1 more recent review was found evaluating the efficacy of progestogens (dienogest) (Andres Mde , 
et al. , 2015 ). For the efficacy, it referred to the same studies already included in the Cochrane  review 
(Brown , et al. , 2012 ). The majority of the other ‘progest ogen’ studies published over the last few years 
have focused mainly on dienogest but are limited to small retrospective and prospective studies.  
II.2.b.2. Safety  
The Cochrane review of Brown included both efficacy and safety. Adverse effects reported with 
dydrogesterone use included severe headaches and cycle irregularity, while acne and oedema were 
reported with medroxyprogesterone use. Patients receiving depot progestogens  had significantly more 
injection site reactions (OR 20.64, 95%CI 1.19 to 358.23) th an with other treatments. They also 
experienced more bloating (OR 4.39, 95%CI  1.71 to 11.30), intermenstrual bleeding (OR  20.56, 95%CI 
6.44 to 65.56), weight gain  (OR 2.58, 95%CI 1.03 to 6.46), amenorrhea (OR 21.18, 95%CI  1.18 to 380.9), 
and nausea (OR 3.8 6, 95%CI  1.12, 13.26) compared with other treatments. Amenorrhea (OR 4.95, 
95%CI 2.88 to 8.52) and bleeding (OR 4.69, 95%CI  2.47 to 8.90) were reported more frequently with 
the use of oral progest ogen. Hirsutism and seborrhoea  (greasy skin) have been repor ted with the use 
of anti -progestogens  (gestrinone).  
The review of Dragoman et al . summari sed the data on the safety of subcutaneously  (SC) administered 
depot medroxyprogesterone acetate  (DMPA)  (Dragoman and Gaffield, 2016 ). The review included 14 
studies:  10 on DMPA users of varying age or with obesity, endome triosis,  or HIV and four on the safety 
of DMPA -SC and DMPA -IM in healthy women. The review reported no differences in bone mineral 
density among adult DMPA- SC and DMPA -IM users at two years of follow- up (based on one trial). 
Women with endometriosis using DMPA -SC over six months had minimal decreases in bone mineral 
density, weight gain, few serious adverse events and experienced improved pain symptoms.  
II.2.b.3. Long term use  
In the review by Andres 2015, two studies were included reporting on the longer -term  use of dienogest . 
In an extension study, following up on the study of Strowitzki et al , patients were assigned to treatment 
with dienogest 2mg/day for 36 weeks (n=17) or 52 weeks (n=135) (Petraglia , et al. , 2012 , Strowitzki , et 
al., 2010 ). The study reported an improvement in pain for both the group previously treated with 
dienogest and for the group previously treated with placebo (from 40.73 ± 21.14 to 13.49 ± 14.14mm 
versus 27.89 ± 20.24 to 9.72 ± 7.44mm, respectively). Adverse effects were reported in 27 of 168 women, including breast discomfort (n=7 ; 4.2%),  nausea (n=5 ; 3.0%) and irritability (n=4 ; 2.4%).  
In another longer -term  study, the use of 52 weeks of dienogest (2mg/day) was evaluated  (Momoeda , 
et al. , 2009 ). A reduction in VAS score for pelvic pain was noted after 24 and 52 weeks of treatment ( -
22.5 ± 32.1 and - 28.4 ±  29.9mm, respectively). All patients experienced some side effects, such as 
vaginal bleeding (71.9%), headache (18.5 %), constipation (10.4%), nausea (9.6%) and hot flushes (8.9%). The percentage of patients with amenorrhea was 7.4% within 5 –8 weeks and 40.5% at 49 –52 
weeks of treatment.  
II.2.b.4. Mode of administration ( intrauter ine system /subdermal implant ) 
A systematic review of RCTs comparing the levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS) with 
GnRH agonist included five trials with a total of 255 women (Lan, et al. , 2013) . In three of the trials  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  41 
reporting on VAS scores, LNG -IUS was found to reduce pain scores, with no difference compared to 
GnRH agonist (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.03: 95%CI  -0.53 to 0.59). In a fourth trial, LNG -IUS 
treatment decreased ASRM staging scores and improved HRQoL similar to GnRH -agonist. One study 
reported reduced cardiovascular risk factors (low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and total 
cholesterol (TC)) compared to GnRH -agonist. Irregular bleeding, simple ovarian cysts and one -sided 
lower abdominal pain o ccurred more commonly in the LNG -IUS group while vasomotor symptoms and 
amenorrhea were observed more frequently in the GnRH agonist group.  
A recent RCT randomised  103 women with endometriosis -associated chronic pelvic pain and/or 
dysmenorrhea to an etono gestrel -releasing subdermal implant (ENG)  or a 52 -mg levonorgestrel -
releasing intrauterine system ( Margatho , et al. , 2020) . The study reported that both the ENG implant 
and the LNG -IUS significantly reduced endometriosis -related pain, dysmenorrhea,  and chronic pelvic 
pain. However, the study reported a high rate of discontinuation and loss to follow- up at 24 months in 
both arms: 65% for the ENG implant and  63% for the 52 -mg LNG -IUS. 
II.2.b.5. Danazol  
Danazol, a synthetic steroid derived from ethinyl testosterone, was used for many decades for the 
treatment of endometriosis -associated symptoms and was the standard control medication in many 
clinical drug trials. It has a high affinity to the androgen re ceptor and moderate affinity to progesterone 
and glucocorticoid receptors which is the cause of unwanted side effects. The GDG strongly believes 
that oral danazol should not be used unless no other medical therapy is available, due to its severe side 
effec ts (acne, oedema, vaginal spotting, weight gain, muscle cramps, deepening of voice, increase in 
facial hair). For this reason, danazol is no longer described as a medical treatment for endometriosis -
associated pain in the current guideline. Whether transva ginal application of danazol has a more 
favourable side effect profile whilst keeping its clinical efficacy as suggested in smaller studies, would need to be assessed in larger RCTs in the future  (Godin and Marcoux, 2015 ). 
Recommendations (15-17) 
It is recommended to prescribe women progestogens to reduce endometriosis -
associated pain.  ⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that clinicians take the different side  effect profiles of 
progestogens into account when prescribing them .  GPP  
 
It is recommended to prescribe women a levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system 
or an etonogestrel -releasing subdermal implant to reduce endometriosis -associated 
pain.   ⊕⊕⊕ 
Justification  
There is sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of progestogens  and anti -progestogens , including the 
levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system and the etonogestrel -releasing subdermal implant, to 
support their use in reducing pain in women with endometriosis  (strong recommendation) . The GDG 
stresses that clinicians should consider the side-effect profiles to tailor the medical treatment towards 
improving symptoms and quality of life.  The GDG does not recommend danazol as a treatment for 
endometriosis -associated pain and  considered it no longer relevant to include anti -progestogens in the 
recommendations .  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  42 
With regards to the LNG -IUS, a review of five  trials showed that the clinical  efficacy was equivalent to 
that of GnRH  agonist , but also that LNG -IUS may have some clinical advantages. LNG-IUS and ENG were 
shown to be equally effective in one study. A strong recommendation was formulated for both LNG -
IUS and ENG as progestogen -treatment.   
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question II.2)  
II.2.c. GnRH agonists  
II.2.c.1 Efficacy   
A Cochrane review published in 2010 compared GnRH agonist at different doses, regimens,  and routes 
of administration, with danazol, with intrauterine progestogens , and with placebo/no treatment for 
relieving endometriosis -associated pain symptoms ( Brown , et al. , 2010 ). The results suggest that a 
GnRH agonist  is more effective than placebo but inferior to the levonorgestrel -releasing intraute rine 
system or oral danazol. No difference in effectiveness exists whether GnRH agonists  are administered 
intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intranasally.  
A RCT by Tang and colleague s randomised  50 women with stage III -IV endometriosis to either 3.75mg 
(full dose) or 1.88mg (half dose) of GnRH agonist (Leuprorelin) (Tang , et al. , 2017) . Surgery combined 
with the 3.75 -mg GnRH  agonist  or with the 1.88 -mg GnRH  agonist  relieved the degree of dysmenorrhea, 
although one case of light dysmenorrhea occurr ed in each group. There was no significant difference 
between treatments after resumption of menstruation.  
II.2.c.2. Safety  
The review by Brown et al . found a poor side effect profile for GnRH agonists  in all studies (Brown , et 
al., 2010 ). Five of the most reported  side effects were vaginal dryness, hot flushes, headaches, weight 
gain and acne. In studies compar ing different routes of administration, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, 
headaches,  and decreased libido were reported, but there was no difference between intramuscular, 
subcutaneous,  or intranasal administration.  
In the RCT by Tang and colleagues, the bone mineral density (BMD) was decreased in both groups (3.75 
mg and 1.88 mg leuprorelin) at 20 weeks after treatment, but the degree of loss of BMD was 
significantly higher in the full dose group (5.6% vs 1.2%)  (Tang , et al. , 2017 ). 
II.2.c. 3. Add -back therapy.  
Reduction of bone mineral density is one of the undesirable effects of long -term  GnRH -agonist 
treatment. There are many combinations of add -back regimens that are effective in preventing bone 
loss when administered with GnRH agonists. These add -back regime ns include progestin monotherapy 
such as norethisterone/norethindrone acetate (NETA), estrogen -progestin combinations, selective 
estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, tibolone, and testosterone (Sauerbrun- Cutler and 
Alvero, 2019) .  
A meta -analysis of Wu et al . included 13 RCTs comparing efficacy of GnRH  agonist or GnRH  agonist plus 
“add -back” therapy for endometriosis ( Wu, et al. , 2014) . Lumbar spine BMD after treatment (12 RCTs ; 
mean difference MD -0.03 ; 95%CI  -0.05  to -0.02) and at 6 months of follow- up (MD - 0.02 ; 95%CI  -0.03  
to -0.01; 6 RCTs ) were superior with GnRH  agonist + add -back therapy than with GnRH  agonist alone. 
Femoral neck BMD after treatment was assessed in 3 trials, but there were no significant differences 
between GnRH  agonist + add -back therapy and GnRH  agonist alone (MD - 0.01 ; 95%CI  -0.02  to 0.01; 3 
RCTs ). There was no statistically sign ificant difference in dysmenorrhea scores (MD –  0.27 ; 95%CI  -0.93   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  43 
to 0.39; 5 RCTs ) or dyspareunia scores after treatment (MD 0.05 ; 95%CI -0.37 to 0.47; 4 RCTs ) when 
comparing GnRH  agonist and add-back therapy with GnRH  agonist alone (Wu, et al. , 2014 ). 
Recommendations (18-20) 
It is recommended to prescribe women GnRH agonists to reduce endometriosis -
associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment.  ⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that GnRH agonists are prescribed as second line  (for example if 
hormonal contraceptives or progestogen s have been ineffective) due to their side -effect 
profile.  GPP  
 
Clinicians should consider prescribing combined hormonal add -back therapy alongside 
GnRH agonist therapy to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms.  ⊕⊕⊕  
Justification  
From the Cochrane review, it can be concluded that GnRH agonists are effective in the relief of 
endometriosis -associated pain  (strong recommendation) , but evidence is limited regarding dosage or 
duration of treatment. Based on the evidence to date, no specific GnRH agonist  can be recommended 
over another in relieving endome triosis -associated pain.  There is evidence of considerable side effects 
with GnRH agonists , which should be discussed with the patient when offering this treatment.  
There is moderate quality evidence, summari sed in a systematic review (Wu, et al. , 2014 ), that addition 
of add -back therapy when prescribing GnRH agonist treatment prevents bone loss, while it does not 
affect the efficacy of the GnRH agonist treatment. As such, add -back treatment is recommended  
(strong recommendat ion).  
Considering the possible impact on BMD, The GDG recommends that in young women and adolescents, 
GnRH agonist should be used after careful consideration and as second line of therapy and after 
discussion with a practitioner in a secondary or tertiary care setting, considering potential side effects 
and long -term health risks ( e.g.,  bone health).  
More information is covered in chapter V.2 Treatment for endometriosis in adolescents.

II.2.d. GnRH antagonists  
GnRH antagonists have been added to this update of the medical treatment options for endometriosis.  
Data on efficacy can be deduced from a report on the two simil ar multicentre, double -blind, 
randomised , placebo -controlled, phase three trials of six -month treatment with oral elagolix at two 
doses in women with moderate or severe endometriosis -associated pain. The two primary efficacy 
endpoints were the proportion o f women who had a clinical response with respect to dysmenorrhea 
and the proportion who had a clinical response with respect to non -menstrual pelvic pain at three 
months (measured as a clinically meaningful reduction in the pain score (and a decreased or s table use 
of rescue analgesic agents). The proportion of women who met the clinical response criteria for each of the two primary end points was significantly greater among women who received each elagolix dose  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  44 
(46.4% in the lower dose group, 75.8% in the higher dose group) than among those who received 
placebo (19.6%). The reductions in dysmenorrhea and non- menstrual pelvic pain were apparent at 1 
month and were sustained at 6 months. More than 70% of women in each trial group reported at least 
one adverse  event, with a significant difference in frequency between those receiving the higher dose 
of elagolix and those receiving placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events were hot flushes, 
headache, and nausea (Taylor , et al. , 2017 ). 
Two smaller RCTs support the efficacy of other GnRH antagonists ( Donnez , et al. , 2020 , Osuga , et al. , 
2020 ). Compared with placebo, oral doses of ≥75mg of linzagolix resulted in a significantly greater 
reduction in overall pelvic pain at 12 weeks (34.5%, 61.5%, 56.4%, and 56.3% for placebo, 75, 100, and 200mg, respectively) (Donnez , et al. , 2020 ). Similarly, oral administration of relugolix at 10, 20 and 40mg 
alleviated endometriosis -associated pain in a dose -response manner and was generally well tolerated 
(Osuga , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendation  (21-22)  
It can be considered  to prescribe women GnRH antagonists to reduce endometriosis -
associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that GnRH antagonists are prescribed as second line (for example 
if hormonal contraceptives or progestogen s have been ineffective) due to their side -
effect profile.  GPP 
Justification  
Emerging evidence from RCTs o n oral GnRH antagonists (elagolix, relugolix and linzagolix) suggest that 
they are effective in the relief of endometriosis -associated painThe evidence remains limited regarding 
dosage or duration of treatment, the need for add- back therapy  and no specific GnRH antago nist can 
be recommended over another in relieving endometriosis -associated pain. Hence, a weak  
recommendation was formulated. Like, GnRH agonists, there is evidence of considerable side effects 
with these drugs  (including potential impact on bone density) , and they should be discussed with the 
patient when offering this treatment.  
Similar as for GnRH agonists, the GDG recommends that in young women and adolescents, GnRH antagonist should be used after careful consideration and discussion with a practitione r in a secondary 
or tertiary care setting, considering potential side effects and long -term health risks ( e.g.,  bone health).

II.2.e. Aromatase inhibitors  
II.2.e.1 Efficacy   
The most recent systematic review available on aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of 
endometriosis -associated pain was published in 2011. Ferrero et al . included 7 studies, 2 of which were 
from the authors’ own group (Ferrero , et al. , 2011 ). The minimum number of individuals in each trial 
was 10. The review found that treatment with oral letrozole plus norethisterone acetate (NEA) or 
desogestrel, or anastrozole as vaginal suppository (250μg daily) or orally (1mg daily) in combination 
with OCP resulted in a significant decrease of endometriosis -associated pain in premenopausal women. 
The same appears to be true for letrozole plus either NEA or triptorelin, although letrozole plus  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  45 
triptorelin resulted in more side effects than NEA. The author s concluded that aromatase inhibitors 
should be investigated long -term to see if they are superior to currently available endocrine therapies 
in terms of improvement of pain, adverse effects,  and patient satisfaction.  
One RCT and one prospective cohort study were published after the inclusion deadline for the review 
of Ferrero and colleagues. The RCT included 51 women with pelvic endometriosis and endometriotic 
pain (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) score of 5 or  more (for at least one of these 
endometriotic pain), after laparoscopic diagnosis and conservative laparoscopic surgery. Patients were treated for 4 months with letrozole plus OCP (n=25) or only OCP (n=26) ( Almassinokiani , et al. , 2014 ). 
The study showed a declin e in VAS score, the score of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea,  and pelvic pain, but 
reported no difference between the groups.  
The prospective cohort study assessed the impact of 3 months aromatase inhibition (letrozole 5mg/d) together with progestin add -back on  ovarian endometrioma size and symptoms (Agarwal and Foster, 
2015 ). The study compared the size of 14 endometriomas in 8 consecutive women before and after 
treatment. The mean endometrioma diameter decreased 50% from 4.6±1.6 cm to 2.3±1.6 cm (mean ± SD). The study also reported a reduction in patient reported symptom end points of the Biberoglu and 
Behrman scale, with mean dyspareunia score decreasing from 2 to 0 and mean dyspareunia and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores decreasing from  1 to 0.  
II.2.e.2. Safety and availability  
We acknowledge that aromatase  inhibitors are not available (even off -label) in some countries. The 
most common third -generation aromatase inhibitors letrozole and anastrozole are reversible inhibitors 
of the enzyme aromatase, competing with androgens for aromatase binding sites. The side effects are 
mostly hypoestrogenic in nature and include vaginal dryness, hot flushes,  and diminished bone mineral 
density. Due to the reduction of estrogen- driven negative feedback at the hypothalamic pituitary axis, 
aromatase inhibitors are used for ovulation inducti on. Therefore, pregnancies with higher rates of 
multiples are a potential complication of this treatment. Earlier reports of increased cardiovascular risks 
have not been substantiated.  
Recommendation  (23) 
In women with endometriosis -associated pain refractory to other medical or surgical 
treatment, it is recommended to prescribe aromatase inhibitors, as they reduce 
endometriosis -associated pain. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination 
with oral contraceptiv es, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The evidence consists of a systematic review from 2011 , including mostly non- randomised controlled 
studies and case reports in women with rectovaginal endometriosis or women that are refractory to 
previous surgical and medical treatment, and 2 more recent studies. Evidence on the long -term effects 
of aromatase inhibitors is lacking. Due to the severe side effects (vaginal dryness, hot flushes, 
diminished bone mineral density), aromatase inhibitors should only be prescribed to women after all other options for medical or surgical treatment are exhausted. Considering these aspects, aromatase 
inhibitors should be preserved for women with endometriosis -associated pain refractory to other 
medical or surgical treatment (strong recommendation) .  
Medical treatments adjunct to surgery to improve surgical outcomes, or to prevent recurrence are 
described  in sections II.4 and chapter IV, respectively.

II.3. Surgical treatment  
Surgical treatment to eliminate endometriotic lesions and divide adhesions has long been an important 
part of the management of endometriosis. Historically, surgical approaches were achieved at open surgery, but in recent decades, laparoscopy has dominated . Elimination of endometriosis may be 
achieved by excision, diathermy,  or ablation/vaporisation. Division of adhesions aims to restore pelvic 
anatomy. In addition, some clinicians use interruption of pelvic nerve pathways with the intention of improving pa in control.  
The current section focuses on the efficacy and safety of surgery for management of pain in women with endometriosis. Technical guidance on surgical techniques for surgery in endometriosis has been previously published by a working group of ES GE, ESHRE and WES ( Working group of ESGE ESHRE and 
WES , et al. , 2020a , b, Working group of ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2017a , Working group of ESGE 
ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2017b ).  
 
PICO  QUESTION : IS SURGERY EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH 
ENDOMET RIOSIS ? 
II.3.a. Surgery versus diagnostic laparoscopy/medical treatment  
The efficacy of laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis has been compared against diagnostic laparoscopy or medical treatment. A recent Cochrane review analysed only 2 of the published R CTs 
(Abbott , et al. , 2004 , Jarrell , et al. , 2005 ) that compared surgical treatment of endometriosis with 
diagnostic laparoscopy only ( Bafort, et al. , 2020a ). The reviewers concluded that they were uncertain 
of the effect of laparoscopic surgery on overall pain score and quality of life due to low or ver y low 
quality of these studies. In the included trials the method of treatment was either excision, coagulation,  
or CO
2 laser vaporisation of endometriotic lesions. Another  study included and analysed  in the previous 
version of the Cochrane review  by Sutton et al . (n=63) , included laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation 
(LUNA) in addition to  CO 2 laser vaporisation of endometriotic lesions and adhesiolysis in the treatment 
arm (Sutton , et al. , 1994 ). They found that laparoscopic surgery was better than diagnostic laparoscopy 
in re ducing overall pain at 6 months. Abbott et al . randomised 39 women with endometriosis to 
immediate excision or diagnostic laparoscopy (or  delayed excision ) groups and found that a significantly 
greater number of women in the immediate excision reported overall pain improvement at 6 months 
(Abbott , et al. , 2004 ). Jarrell et al . (n=16, excision vs diagnostic laparoscopy) showed again that surgery 
was more effective than diagnostic laparoscopy in reducing overall pain at 6 months (mean difference 
[MD] 0.90 ; 95%CI  0.31 to 1.49) and 12 months  (MD 1.65 ; 95%CI  1.11 to 2.19)  (Jarrell , et al. , 2005 ). It is 
worth noting that there were relatively few patients with stage III/IV endometriosis in these trials. The 
studies included in this review reported no major complications. When different types of pain were 
considered, including pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, there was insufficient 
evidence to determine which pain type responded best to laparoscopic surgery  (Bafort , et al. , 2020a ). 
II.3.a.1 Impact of surgery on QoL  
A recent systematic review and meta -analysis  reported on the impact of surgery for endometriosis on 
major domains of QoL as assessed by SF -36, SF -12, EHP -30 or EQ -5D (Arcoverde , et al. , 2019 ). Of the 
38 included studies 8 including 983 patients with all types of endometriosis with follow- up of 3-37 
months analysed the effect of surgery. Three studies with a total of 269 patients were meta -analysed 
for Mental Component Score (MCS) and Physical Component Score (PCS) , surgery significantly  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  49 
improved MCS (OR 0.21, 95%CI  0.05 -0.38), but not PCS (Abbott , et al. , 2004 , Abbott , et al. , 2003 , Soto , 
et al. , 2017 ). A fourth RCT by Vercellini et al . with 180 patients showed significant improvement of 
health related  QoL, psychiatric profile and sexual satisfaction scores  (Vercellini , et al. , 2003 ). Two 
studies using EQ -5D including 443 patients showed improvements in all domains, except anxiety  (M F, 
et al. , 2017, Roman, 2010 ). One study looked at benefit of laparoscopic surgery in 161 women with 
minimal endometriosis and found significant improvement in both PCS (49.4 ± 9.8 vs 52.3 ±  7.8; 
p=0.002) and MCS (40.6 ± 12.21 vs 45.0 ±  11.3; p< 0.001), but only 16% of women had a 5 po int or more 
improvement in their scores  (Valentin , et al. , 2017 ).  
Franck et al . carried out a systematic review o f the studies which reported quality of sexual life (QoSL) 
before and after laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis  (Franck , et al. , 2018 ). They could not perform 
a meta -analysis due to heterogeneity b etween the 12 included studies. They did however note that six 
of the seven validated questionnaires used in the  12 studies identified improvements in sexual function 
following laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis regardless of location, severity of the disease and 
hormon e treatment.  
Recommendations (24) 
It is recommended to offer surgery as one of the options to reduce endometriosis -
associated pain.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Although summari sed in a Cochrane review, there are only a few small trials comparing pain outcomes 
after diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic interventions, and meta -analysis could not be 
performed. This limits the group to make any valid conclusions on the benefit of surgery for the 
treatment of endometriosis -associated pain.  
Before and after studies assessing the effect of surgical intervention on pain and quality of life have been summari sed in another review, reporting that surgery for endometriosis resulted in overall 
improvement in most health domains of health related  QoL, with the greatest improvement found in 
the Bodily Pain domain  (Arcoverde , et al. , 2019 ). A similar conclusion was reported for quality of sexual 
life (Franck , et al. , 2018 ). It must be considered that surgical trials mostly use a follow up of 6 to 12 
months, although some studies followed up patients up to 3 years.  Surgery for endometriosis is 
considered a relatively safe procedure, based on studies showing low numbers of (severe) complications (Bafort, et al. , 2020b , Byrne , et al. , 2018b , Chapron , et al. , 1998) . Considering these data, 
a strong recommendation was formulated  stating that  clinicians should offer surgical treatment as one 
of the options to relief e ndometriosis -associated pain.  
Laparoscopy is usually associated with less pain, shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery and better 
cosmesis, hence it is usually preferred to open surgery. If the relevant experience with laparoscopy is 
not available, the patient should be referred to a centre of expertise.   
Specific data and recommendations on surgery for subtypes of endometriosis are discussed below.   
Research recommendation  (R6) 
Research should investigate the effect of surgery on pain and QoL parameters in different subtypes , 
preferably  via longitudinal population studies.

II.3.b. Ablation versus excision of endometriosis  
A systematic review and meta -analysis (Pundir , et al. , 2017 ) identif ied three RCTs (Barton -Smith, 2010 , 
Healey , et al. , 2010, Wright , et al. , 2005 ) comparing excision with ablation of endometriosis. The study 
by Wright et al . was not included in the meta -analysis because of incomplete data but showed that 
excision and ablation equally improved pelvic pain associated with mild endometriosis (Wright , et al. , 
2005 ). Meta -analysis of the other two RCTs showed that laparoscopic excision was significantly superior 
to ablation in reducing symptoms of EHP -30 core pain score, dyschezia , and chronic pelvic pain (Pundir , 
et al. , 2017 ). There was also a trend in reduction of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia scores after excision 
compared to ablation, but this did not reach statistical significance. One of these three RCTs later 
published their 5 year follow up data and it showed that excision was better than ablation in treating 
deep dyspareunia (Healey , et al. , 2014) .   
Another systematic review and meta -analysis was published recently , aiming to update the literature 
on the surgical management of minimal to mild endometriosis  (Burks , et al. , 2021 ). The study identified 
four RCTs (Healey , et al. , 2010 , Radosa , et al. , 2010, Riley , et al. , 2019 , Wright , et al. , 2005 ), out of which 
three were compared and analysed for meta -analys is (Healey , et al. , 2010, Riley , et al. , 2019 , Wright , 
et al. , 2005 ). The review  examined mean reduction of visual analogue scale (VAS) score from baseline 
to 12 months postoperative, or mean VAS score at 12 months postoperative for dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dyspareunia  and concluded that there are no significant differences between excision and 
ablation groups  with regard s to improving pain measured with the above parameters.  
Recommendation  (25) 
When surgery is performed, clinicians may consider excision instead of ablation of 
endometriosis to reduce endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The evidence for ablation versus excision is based on studies that include women with heterogeneous 
forms of endometriosis. Some of these studies excluded women with deep endometriosis, in which 
ablation is not usually applied anyway. The excisional approach is likely to be more suitable for deep 
endometriosis lesions, as it is impossible to know if the entire lesion is destroyed with ablati ve 
techniques.  
II.3.c. Superficial peritoneal endometriosis  
Some consider superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE) as a separate entity than ovarian endometriomas and deep endometriosis. However, others argue that they are frequently found 
together, and  are likely to be different forms of the same condition.  
There are no trials specifically studying the effect of surgery for SPE on pain symptoms. Some studies 
included only women with ASRM stage I and II and majority of these may have SPE. However, ASRM I  
and II disease may also have women with ovarian endometriomas smaller than 1cm or deep 
endometriosis, hence it would be impossible to generalise the results of these studies to women with 
SPE only.  
Research rec ommendation  (R7) 
The GDG recommends sufficiently powered prospective, randomised and ideally blinded studies to 
unequivocally determine whether surgical treatment of superficial peritoneal endometriosis improves short and long -term clinical outcomes such as a reduction in pain symptoms and i mprovement in quality 
of life.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  51 
II.3.d. Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways  
The effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary 
dysmenorrhea was analysed  in a Cochrane review that included six  RCTs on women with endometriosis 
(Proctor , et al. , 2005 ). Three of these RCTs evaluated the effect of laparoscopic uterosacral nerve 
ablation (LUNA) together with conservative laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis  (Johnson , et al. , 
2004 , Sutton , et al. , 2001, Vercellini , et al. , 2003 ); the other three (Candiani , et al. , 1992 , Tjaden , et al. , 
1990 , Zullo , et al. , 2003 ) studied the effects of presacral neurectomy (PSN) (two at laparotomy, one at 
laparoscopy) in addition to conservative (organ or fertility preserving) surgery for endometriosis. The 
RCTs on LUNA showed that this technique did not offer any additional benefit as an adjunct to 
conservative surgery one year after surgery. The assessment at 6 months did not show any benefit 
either, but this included one additional trial studying patients who had fibroids. There were s ignificant 
benefits of PSN at 6 months (1 RCT) and 12 months (2 RCTs).  One of the RCTs included in the Cochrane 
review above reported 24 -month follow -up results of PSN in addition to laparoscopic surgery for 
endometriosis compared to laparoscopic surgery o nly for the treatment of severe dysmenorrhea, 
dyspareunia,  and pelvic pain due to endometriosis (Zullo , et al. , 2004 ). Frequency and severity of 
dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic  pain; and quality of life were evaluated. PSN group had 
better improvement of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain,  and quality of life compared to 
laparoscopic surgery only .  
However, PSN is associated with increased risk of adverse effects such as ble eding, constipation, urinary 
urgency and painless first stage of labour (Proctor , et al. , 2005 ). The data suggest that the effect of PSN 
may be specific to midline pain only.  
A more recent systematic review and meta -analysis of 7 controlled studies - including the 3 RCTs 
summari sed in Proctor et al . - reported on treatment failure and complications. They  concluded that 
whilst PSN may be beneficial in selected patients with midline pain , based on a l ower risk of treatment 
failure  in these patients  (RR 0.43; 95%CI  0.30 to 0.60) , the published data come from older and low-
quality  studies  (Miller , et al. , 2020 ). As endometriosis surgery improved in the recent decades , the place 
of PSN needs to be confirmed in patients who undergo r adical excision of deep endometriosis.  
Conclusion  
It can be concluded that LUNA is not beneficial as an additional procedure to conventional laparoscopic 
surgery for endometriosis, as it offers no additional benefit over surgery alone.  
PSN is beneficial for treatment of endometriosis -associated midline pain as an adjunct to conventional 
laparoscopic surgery, but it should be stressed that PSN requires a hi gh degree of skill and is associated 
with an increased risk of adverse effects such as intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative 
constipation, urinary urgency and painless first stage of labour.  
II.3.e. Surgery for ovarian endometrioma  
To our knowledge, t here are no  RCTs comparing cystectomy versus no treatment in women with 
endometrioma and  measuring the effect on pain  symptoms . 
II.3.e.1 Surgical technique  
A Cochrane review by Hart and co -workers (Hart , et al. , 2008)  reviewed two RCTs comparing 
laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriotic cysts (3 cm or larger) to drainage and coagulation by bipolar diathermy ( Alborzi , et al. , 2004 , Beretta , et al. , 1998 ). Both studies demonstrated lower 
recurrence of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after cystectomy compared to drainage and coagulation  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  52 
only. There were fewer cyst recurrences with the excisional approach. Need for fur ther surgery and 
recurrence of non -menstrual pain were less likely after cystectomy (Hart , et al. , 2008 ).  
An additional  RCT, published after the Cochrane review , randomised  90 women to cystectomy or CO 2 
laser vapori sation . The trial  showed that recurrence of cysts was more common at 12 months, but not 
at 60 months, after  CO 2 laser vapori sation, and that the time to recurrence was shorter, compared to 
cystectomy (Carmona , et al. , 2011 ). In a retrospective study of 125 women, Candiani et al . showed that 
recurrence rates after an average of 29 -month follow up were similar after CO 2 fibre laser vapori sation 
and cystectomy for endometriomas (Candiani , et al. , 2020 ). The most important indicator for 
recurrence was endometriomas larger than  5 cm  (OR 2.21; 95%CI  1.19  to 3.32) . 
A small multicentre RCT (n=51) compared stripping and combined excision/ablation techniques for the 
treatment of bilateral ovarian endometriomas larger than 3 cm ( Muzii , et al. , 2016 ). Similar recurrence 
rates were observed for the two techniques at 6 -month  follo w-up. Recurrence rates were 5.9% for the 
stripping technique versus 2.0% for the combined technique ( OR 3.00; 95%CI  0.24 to 157.5).   
A recent RCT compared four groups of women with endometrioma who underwent drainage (with 
bipolar coagulation) or cystectomy with or without oxidi sed regenerated cellulose (ORC, Surgicel) for 
haemostasis to study effect on ovarian reserve and endometrioma recurrence rates (Shaltout, et al. , 
2019 ). They found that use of ORC  reduced recurrence rates with the lowest recurrences seen in the 
cystectomy + ORC group followed by drainage + ORC.   
Two RCTs looked at direct stripping of endometrioma at the original adhesion site compared to circular 
excision at the initial adhesion site followed by stripping ( Mossa , et al. , 2010 , Muzii , et al. , 2005 ). Muz ii 
et al . found that it was easier to remove the cyst with the circular excision technique but duration of 
operation, intraoperative complications and postoperative endometrioma recurrence rates were 
similar (Muzii , et al. , 2005) . Mossa et al . showed that initial circular excision followed by stripping was 
quicker, had shorter haemostasis times and had higher complete excision rates (Mossa , et al. , 2010 ). 
However, the recurrence rates were not different. The average cyst size was bigger in the direct 
stripping group and blinding was unclear, hence the results should be interpreted with caution.  
A prospective cohort study was conduct ed, and postoperative follow- up visits were scheduled every 3 
months following complete laparoscopic excision of endometriosis including endometriomas to identify 
pain and/or endometrioma recurrence for a minimum of 3 years (Porpora , et al. , 2010 ). Dysmenorrhea, 
dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain recurred in 14.5%, 6%, and 5.4% of women, respectively.  Ovarian 
endometrioma recurred in 9.6% of cases.  
The risk of ovarian f ailure after bilateral ovarian endometrioma removal is reported to be 2.4% 
(Busacca , et al. , 2006 ). The impact of ovarian surgery on ovarian reserve has been ass essed as a 
secondary outcome in several of the above -mentioned  studies. In studies comparing  AFC and ovarian 
volume at 6-month  follow -up, AFC was similar, but ovarian volume was lower in ovaries where 
endometrioma were treated with a combined excision/abla tion technique compared to stripping 
(Muzii , et al. , 2016 ). Shal tout and colleagues reported a similar impact of drainage or cystectomy (with 
or with ORC) on ovarian reserve, but also reported that drainage + ORC has the least impact on AMH, and that drainage had a significantly higher impact of AFC compared to cystectomy + ORC ( Shaltout , et 
al., 2019 ). A prospective study showed that surgery for recurrent endometriomas is more harmful to 
healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserve than first surgery as demonstrated by removal of larger ovarian tissue at histology and a trend towards lower AFC at follow up  (Muzii , et al. , 2015) . A recent 
systematic review and meta -analysis confirmed that cystectomy, particularly for bilateral 
endometriomas, ha s a deleterious and sustained effect on ovarian reserve ( Younis , et al. , 2019 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  53 
Recommendations (26-28) 
When performing surgery in women with ovarian endometrioma, clinicians should 
perform cystectomy instead  of drainage and coagulation, as cystectomy reduces 
recurrence of endometrioma and endometriosis -associated pain.  ⊕⊕ 
  
When performing surgery in women with ovarian endometrioma, clinicians can consider 
both cystectomy and CO 2 laser vapori sation, as both techniques appear to have similar 
recurrence rates beyond the first year after surgery. Early post -surgical recurrence r ates 
may be lower after cystectomy.  ⊕ 
 
When performing surgery for ovarian endometrioma, specific caution should be used to 
minimi se ovarian damage.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Cystectomy is probably superior to drainage and coagulation in women with ovarian endometrioma (≥ 
3cm) regarding  the recurrence of endometriosis -associated pain and the recurrence of endometrioma  
(Hart , et al. , 2008 ), which supports the formulation of a strong recommendation.  Longer follow- up data 
show similar recurrence rates for cystectomy and CO 2 laser vapori sation .  
Whilst superiority of excision over drainage and coagulation/ablation can be expected, possible 
difficulties in removal of very small endometriomas should be kept in mind due to lack of a clear surgical 
plane. With regards to ovarian reserve, data show tha t ovarian surgery may have an impact on ovarian 
reserve, but the data comparing the impact of different techniques should be interpreted with caution. 
When contemplating  surgery for endometriomas, particularly for recurrent endometriomas , ovarian 
reserve a nd ovarian damage should be carefully considered . 
For the comparison of cystectomy and CO 2 laser vapori sation, one RCT and one retrospective study 
were available ( Candiani , et al. , 2020 , Carmona , et al. , 2011 ), both concluding that there are similar 
recurrence rates beyond the first year for the treatment of endometriomas both techniques, Carmona 
et al . also reported that the recurrence rates may be lower after cystectomy in the first year.  A weak 
recommendation was formulated.  
In the included studies, patients were included with endometriomas and endometriosis -associated 
symptoms (pain and/or infertility). The guideline group would like to clarify that in women with a 
diagnosed endometrioma and pain symptoms, other forms of endometriosis including deep 
endometriosis is commonly detected  during surgery. Although not discussed, nor considered in most 
of the studies, this needs to be considered in clinical practice.  
Information on diagnosis of deep endometriosis is covered in chapter I . Treatment for asymptomatic 
endometriosis is covered in chapter V III.  
II.3.f. Surgery for deep endometriosis  
Deep endometriosis (DE) extends beneath the peritoneum and may affect the uterosacral ligaments, pelvic side walls, rectovaginal septum, vagina, bowel, bladder,  or ureter. Excision of these nodules is 
usually performed when  surgical treatment is chosen. Colorectal involvement is not rare with deep 
endometriosis, Deep endometriosis involving the bowel has been reported in  5-12% of women affected 
by endometriosis (Wills , et al. , 2008 ). The term ‘bowel endometriosis’ is used when endometrial -like 
glands and stroma infiltrate the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (Chapron, et al. , 2003) . In case of bowel  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  54 
infiltration, about 90% is locali sed on the sigmoid colon or the rectum. Other locations such as small 
bowel, appendix, and cecum are less frequent. Colorectal involvement could lead to change in bow el 
habits, such as constipation, diarrhoea , tenesmus, dyschezia, and rectal bleeding. These symptoms may 
vary depending on location and menstrual cycle (Kaufman , et al. , 2011 ). Therefore, precise diagnosis 
about presence, location, and extent of endometriosis is necessary to plan surgical treatm ent.  
Treatment approaches for colorectal endometriosis include superficial shaving, discoid resection,  and 
segmental resection of the bowel to remove the deep endometriosis nodules. Many  case series have 
been published for these methods since the late 1980s.  
A systematic review and meta -analysis by Arcoverde et al . analysed 8 articles which included 673 
patients with deep endometriosis some including bowel endometriosis and 22 articles with 1580 
patients with bowel endometriosis  (Arcoverde , et al. , 2019 ). In the DE analysis , 3 articles (Angioni , et 
al., 2015 , Hong , et al. , 2014 , Mabrouk , et al. , 2011 ) which used SF -36 and one study (Garry , et al. , 2000 ) 
which used SF -12 included 504 patients. Health -related Quality of Life ( HRQoL ) scores improved 
significantly in all domains , with the highest improvement in bodily pain. Two studies which used either 
EHP-30 (Vercellini , et al. , 2013 ) or EHP -5 (De la Hera -Lazaro , et al. , 2016)  showed improvement in all 
domains.  
A systematic review by Meuleman and co -workers looked at 49 papers on DE with colorectal 
involvement, including laparoscopic, laparotomic, transvaginal or combined approaches  (Meuleman , et 
al., 2011b ). Although less than 50% of these pain- reporting studies had a median follow- up of more 
than 2 years, improvement of pain and digestive symptoms after surgery for colorectal endometriosis was report ed. They found that pain and quality of life improvement was reported in most studies, the 
complication rate was 0 -3% and the total recurrence rate  (recurrence of symptoms or lesions)  was 5 -
25%. However, they noted that most data were collected retrospectively, and study designs and 
reporting methods were variable. As it was impossible to make comparisons between different surgical 
techniques, a checklist was developed to standardise the repo rts of surgical trials for deep 
endometriosis (Meuleman , et al. , 2011b ).  
Another systematic review by De Cicco and co -workers included 34 articles on bowel resection for 
colorectal endometriosis  (De Cicco , et al. , 2011 ). This r eview found excellent pain relief in most studies. 
They concluded that segmental bowel resection for deep endometriosis with colorectal involvement 
seemed to be a widely acceptable option. The decision to perform resection seemed to be based on 
preference rather than data; complication rates were similar to resections for other indications, and 
data on sexual dysfunction were lacking. They suggested that to  permit meta -analysis, journals should 
adopt a standard way of reporting indications, surgery, outcome, size,  and localisation of nodules. The 
common use of bowel resection may be due to bowel surgeons who are used to resections for cancer treatment (De Cicco , et al. , 2011 ).   
More recently Arcoverde et al . analysed articles which reported HRQoL after surgery for bowel 
endometriosis  (Arcoverde , et al. , 2019) . Majority of these articles were published after the reviews by 
Meuleman et al . and De  Cicco et al . (De Cicco , et al. , 2011 , Meuleman , et al. , 2011b ). In 12 studies 
which included 750 patients us ing SF -36 or SF -12 data, pooled results showed significant improvement 
of HRQoL in all 8 domains, MCS, PCS and total score  (Arcoverde , et al. , 2019 ). Four studies which use d 
endometriosis specific EHP -30 (Kent , et al. , 2016 , Meuleman , et al. , 2011a , Meuleman , et al. , 2014 ) or 
EHP5  (Bailly , et al. , 2013 ) showed improvement in most domains studied. Studies which used specific 
urinary or gastrointestinal QoL  questionnaires showed significant improvements as well.  
The largest multicentre prospective case series to date published (BSGE Endometriosis Centres data, 
(Byrne , et al. , 2018a )) reported the  6, 12 and 24 -month follow up outcome on nearly 5000 women  
undergoing laparoscopic excision of deep rectovaginal endometriosis . This showed significant  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  55 
reductions in premenstrual, menstrual,  and non- cyclical pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, low 
back pain and bladder pain. In addition, there were significant reductions in voiding difficulty, bowel 
frequency, urgency, inco mplete emptying, constipation and passing blood. These reductions were 
maintained at 2 years, except for  voiding difficulty. Global quality of life significantly improved from a 
median retreatment score of 55/100 to 80/100 at 6 months. There was a signific ant improvement in 
quality of life in all measured domains and in quality -adjusted life years. These improvements were 
sustained at 2 years. All analgesia use was reduced and, in particular , opiate use fell from 28.1% prior 
to surgery to 16.1% at 6 months.  The overall incidence of complications was 6.8% (321/4721). 
Gastrointestinal complications (enterotomy, anastomotic leak or fistula) occurred in 52 (1.1%) 
operations and of the urinary tract (ureteric/ bladder injury or leak) in 49 (1.0%) procedures  (Byrne , et 
al., 2018a ).  
Only one retrospective study reported outcome of patients with bowel endometriosis in whom a 
resection was not performed. Stepniewska et al . studied 155 patients: 60 underwent a segmental 
resection, 40 had no bowel resection, and 55 patients had deep endometriosis  without bowel 
involvement  (Stepniewska , et al. , 2010 ). Apart from significant lower recurrence rates and higher 
pregnancy rates in the group of patients with a segmental resection, there also was a significant 
regression of pain scores in that group co mpared to the group that had no bowel resection, because of 
lack of consent. Therefore, possibility of bowel resection should be discussed upfront with the patient.   
Recommendations (29-31) 
Clinicians can consider performing surgical removal of deep endometriosis, as it may 
reduce endometriosis -associated pain and improves quality of life.  ⊕⊕

The GDG recommends that patients undergoing surgery particularly for deep 
endometriosis are informed on potential risks, benefits,  and long -term effect on quality

Justification  
Overall,  data show that surgery improves pain and quality of life in women with deep endometriosis. 
Still, the l iterature regarding treatment and outcome of deep endometriosis surgery should be 
interpreted with caution. It is of paramount importance that type of study, surgical approach, surgical 
technique, and the way outcome is measured is taken into account. Ther e is a lack of consistency in the 
way the studies reported outcome, and the systematic review on this topic was based on small studies 
and case reports. These limitations are reflected in the evidence level.  As surgery in women with deep 
endometriosis is p ossibly associated with significant intraoperative and postoperative complication 
rates, the recommendation was formulated as a weak recommendation and complemented with a GPP 
suggestion that such surgery is ideally performed in a centre of expertise, and only after the patient is 
informed on potential risks, benefits,  and long -term effects.

II.3.f.1. Surgical approach  for bowel endometriosis   
In 2007, a systematic review reported outcome of laparoscopic colorectal resection for endometriosis 
as an alternative to laparotomy (Darai , et al. , 2007 ). With a conversion rate of 7.8%, this review showed 
feasibility and safety of a laparoscopic approach with markedly improvement of pain and gynaecolo gical  
and digestive symptoms. A relatively small RCT (26 patients in each group) showed that laparoscopy 
was as effective as laparotomy for colorectal resection for endometriosis, in improving pain symptoms and quality of life  (Darai , et al. , 2010b ) . 
In another study, the sa me authors  retrospectively studied 29 patients who underwent radical en bloc 
hysterectomy and colorectal resection (Darai , et al. , 2010a ). Thirteen patients had an open approach 
and 16 were done laparoscopically. In both groups there was a significant improvement of 
dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, asthenia, and quality of life. The laparoscopic approach had better short -
term outcomes. Although this study advocated the  laparoscopic approach, with comparable efficacy, it 
can be questioned whether hysterectomy is  the treatment of choice  (also see section on hysterectomy) . 
Discoid excision  
In 4 medium- sized non -comparative prospective studies (range n=25 to n=111) outcome of discoid 
excision of rectal endometriosis was evaluated ( Ercoli , et al. , 2017 , Roman , et al. , 2015 , Roman , et al. , 
2017 , Spagnolo , et al. , 2014 ). Spagnolo et al. studied 36 patients and reported outcome of 25 patients  
(11 patients were lost to follow- up) (Spagnolo , et al. , 2014 ). Median follow- up was 7 months. Discoid 
excision had no impact on urodynamic or anorectal function, but pain scores improved postoperatively. 
Ercoli et al. prospectively studied 33 patients and reported outcome  in 30 patients, who underwent so -
called laparoscopic robotic -assisted rectal nodulectomy  (Ercoli , et al. , 2017) . After mean follow- up of 
27.6 months mean VAS -scores decreased significantly for dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, 
dysuria, and chronic pelvic pain. Two prospective studies from the same group reported outcome of discoid excision with staplers ( Roman , et al. , 2015 , Roman , et al. , 2017 ). Improvement of 
gastrointestinal function and pain scores were observed in both studies. Although the authors concluded that discoid excision is a valuable alternative to colorectal resection in both papers, no direct 
comparison was made to this technique.  
Segmental resection  
Twelve other studies (1 RCT, 7 prospective, 4 retrospective) reported outcome of pain in patients (n=7 
to n=900) after colorectal resection for deep endometrios is (Bassi , et al. , 2011 , Garavaglia , et al. , 2018 , 
Kent , et al. , 2016 , Lyons , et al. , 2006, Mabrouk , et al. , 2012 , Meuleman , et al. , 2011a , Ribeiro , et al. , 
2014 , Riiskjaer , et al. , 2018, Roman , et al. , 2013, Ruffo , et al. , 2014 , Silveira da Cunha Araujo , et al. , 
2014 , Touboul , et al. , 2015 ). In all of these studies, significant improvement of all variables studied was 
reported. All pain -related VAS scores concerning dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, 
(chronic) pelvic pain, and bodily pain significantly decreased in the postoperative course. Postoperative 
follow- up ranged from 1 year to more than 4 years. Moreover, improvement of gastrointestinal 
symptoms, quality of life, sexual function, and fertility  rates were also observed in these studies. In view 
of this, many authors conclude that laparoscopic colorectal resection improves outcome. One 
retrospective study further investigated the role of a radical (24 patients) versus a symptom -guided 
approach (5 1 patients) to treat rectal endometriosis in a before -after study design setting ( Roman , et 
al., 2013) . In both study arms , there was a significant improvement in bowel function scores (KESS, 
GIQLI, and FIQL), and the authors concluded that a conservative approach should be chosen whenever 
possible. In fact, this study does not conflict with previous studies regarding radical ity of treatment. 
Radical resection of all endometriosis nodules does not mean that a conservative attitude towards surgical technique/options could be maintained. A least traumatic, but radical resection with a more tailored  /patient -centred  approach with  perioperative decision -making is preferred.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  57 
Comparisons between shaving,  discoid excision and segmental resection  
There is an ongoing d ebate in the literature whether shaving, discoid excision, or segmental resection 
with anastomosis should be used for colorectal endometriosis. Moreover, the use of electrocautery or  
CO 2 laser is also matter of debate and is beyond the scope of this guideline . (For surgical techniques 
please see (Working group of ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2020a , b)). In many of the studies, patient 
selection is questionable, because it is not always clear that both surgical options would be feasible in 
the presented cohort of patients.  
Conservative surgery (Shaving and/or discoid excision) compared to segmental resection  
In 2 studies, segmental resection versus more conservative -like approaches such as shaving were 
compared (Bourdel , et al. , 2018 , Roman , et al. , 2018 ). Roman et al. performed the only published 
randomised  controlled trial in the literature with direct comparison of 2 techniques for rectal  
endometriosis up to 15cm in 60 patients  (Roman , et al. , 2018 ). In a multicentre  study, patients were 
randomised  to receive either segmental resection, or conservative surgery  (shaving or discoid excision) . 
The p rimary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing one of the following symptoms at 
24 months follow -up: constipation, frequent bowel movements, defecation pain, anal incontinence, 
dysuria, or bladder atony requiring self -catherisation . At intention- to-treat analysis, there were no 
significant differences in functional gastrointestinal or urinary outcomes. Th e authors concluded that 
conservative surgery is feasible for large nodules of the rectum. However, this rather small study could 
not draw conclusions on small nodules (<20mm). Of note, temporary stoma rate was around 60% in both study arms. Bourdel et al.  retrospectively analysed  195 patients with endometriosis of the 
rectovaginal septum (>2 cm in diameter). A total of 172 patients underwent rectal shaving and 23 had 
a segmental resection  (Bourdel , et al. , 2018) . Mean VAS scores dropped from 5.5 to 2.3 (p<0.001) for 
shaving  and from 7.3 to 2 (p<0.001) for resection, respectively. Moreover, the authors observed 
significant improvement of dysmenorrhea, but no differences in quality of life. They concluded that 
whenever possible, shaving is the preferred technique to apply.  A recent retrospective single centre 
series of 232 patient analysis showed that segmental resection was associated with higher complication 
rates compared to conservative surgery, although the difference became non- significant when 
corrections were made for p atient characteristics  (Bafort, et al. , 2020b ). 
Discoid excision compared to segmental resection  
In three studies, discoid excision versus segmental resection (1 prospective, 1 case -control, and 1 
retrospective study) was compared (Fanfani , et al. , 2010, Hudelist , et al. , 2018a , Roman , et al. , 2010 ). 
Hudelist et al. compared 32 discoid exci sions with 102 segmental resections for rectosigmoidal 
endometriosis up to 25  cm from the anal verge  (Hudelist , et al. , 2018a ). They showed improvement of 
pain and fertility in both cohorts, with equal postoperative morbid ity. Roman et al. studied 41 patients 
with rectal endometriosis retrospectively. Sixteen patients underwent nodule excision and 25 had a 
resection  (Roman , et al. , 2010 ). After a mean follow- up of 26 (12 -53) months they observed no 
significant differences in improvement of pain, but worse  functional outcome after resection. Fanfani 
et al.  mainly studied feasibility of discoid excision with a stapler compared to segmental resection  
(Fanfani , et al. , 2010 ). Although they observed improvement of endometriosis -related symptoms, no 
data on pain was reported.  
It has been suggested that  discoid resection should be the first choice in rectal endometriosis patients 
with unifocal endometriotic lesions less then 3 cm, while segmental resection should be chosen in high 
bowel lesions, and when the disc oid resection is not feasible  (de Almeida , et al. , 2014 ). 
Shaving vs discoid excision vs segmental resection  
In 3 retrospective studies, a comparison was made between 3 surgical techniques (Abo, et al. , 2018 , 
Afors , et al. , 2016 , Mabrouk , et al. , 2018 ). Abo  et al. studied 364 patients but only reported short -term 
postoperative outcome without comparing pain scores or recurrence rates  (Abo, et al. , 2018) . Another  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  58 
study by Mabrouk et al. included 392 patients with rectosigmoid endometriosis. Shaving was performed 
in 76%, discoid excision in 8%, and resection in 16%, respectively  (Mabrouk , et al. , 2018) . After mean 
follow of 43 months (12 -163), there were significant ly less complications in the shaving group (5.4%), 
versus discoid excision (9.1%), and resection (17.7%), respectively (p=0.004). However, no significant 
difference was observed in recurrence rates. The authors concluded that conservative surgery (shaving) 
is associated with fewer short- term complications and sim ilar recurrence rates. Although this seems to 
be an attractive conclusion, the retrospective nature of the study will have inherent selection bias and 
compared groups were rather small. Afors et al. studied 92 patients with bowel endometriosis and 
compared  shaving (n=47), discoid excision (n=15), and segmental resection (n=30)  (Afors , et al. , 2016 ). 
Follow- up was minimum 24 months and the authors observed higher recurrence of dysmenorrhea 
and/or dyspareunia, and a higher re -intervention rate  in the shaving group . They concluded that 
shaving should be avoided in big nodules, because relative risk was 2.5 for bowel resection for nodules 
>3 cm. A recent meta -analysis corroborates this observation in an elegant way. Risk of hi stologically 
proven recurrence for colorectal endometriosis was significantly lower after both segmental resection 
and discoid excision compared to rectal shaving  (Bendifallah , et al. , 2020 ). The authors concluded that 
this important message should guide decision -making in the choice for the most appropriate surgical 
management.  
In summary, literature is unambiguous regarding some aspects of treatment of women with colorectal 
endometriosis. It should be done in a multidisciplinary setting with a minimally invasive approach 
aiming to radically remove all endometriosis lesions. Apar t from significant improvement of pain, 
radical treatment of deep endometriosis also positively impacts fertility outcomes (Daraï , et al. , 2017 ). 
For lesions on the sigmoid colon, a segmental resection should be performed. For dee p endometriosis 
involving the rectum, a more tailored approach can be chosen. A laparoscopic approach is preferred, 
because it is associated with better postoperative recovery, shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic 
outcome. If relevant laparoscopic ex perience is not available, it is recommended to refer the patient to 
an expert cent re.  
II.3.f.2. Complications of surgery for bowel endometriosis  
Surgery for deep endometriosis appears possible and effective, but this is associated with significant 
complication rates, particularly when rectal surgery is required. The reported total intraoperative 
complication rate was 2.1%, and the total postoperati ve complication rate was 13.9% (9.5% minor, 4.6% 
major) (Kondo , et al. , 2011) . There is an ongoing debate about the indication for shaving nodules as 
opposed to segmental resection ( Donnez and Squifflet, 2010 , Meuleman , et al. , 2011b ).  
The reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis in the studies with longer 
than 2 years follow up were 5 –25% (Meuleman , et al. , 2011b ); the recurrence rates were higher in 
studies that repor ted symptomatic recurrence than in studies that reported histological recurrence ( De 
Cicco , et al. , 2011 ).  
II.3.f.3. Surgery for posterior  compartment endometriosis excluding bowel endometriosis.    
Endometriosis of the uterosacral ligaments and vagina  
These two locations of deep endometriosis are of great clinical interest because they can be diagnosed 
during a clinical examination . One hist oric case series reports pain score  at baseline and 12 -month 
follow- up for 28 women who had complete excision of uterosacral ligament endometriosis along with 
excision of all of all other endometriotic lesions, including vaginal endometriosis  (Chapron and 
Dubuisson, 1996 ). No complications were reported. Sixteen out of 19 women with dysmenorrhoea and 
16 out of 17 women with deep dyspareunia improved. Chronic pelvic pain improved in seven out of nine cases.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  59 
Angioli et al . describe d a three -step vagino -laparoscopic approach to treatment of vaginal 
endometriosis  (Angioli , et al. , 2014) . The authors reported no major complications but superficial 
vascular injury in two cases (5.9%), ureteral stenosis two weeks after surgery in one patient (2.9%), and 
bowel obstruction for paralytic ileus in one patient (2.9%). A de novo endometrioma was found at 12 
months after surgery and a recurrent endometrioma was evident at 24 months. For all symptoms evaluated, there was a significant improvement within 3 months after surgery (p<0.05) and no 
statistically significant difference during follow- up (at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months).   
Endometriosis of the cul -de-sac 
Reich et al . reported a series of 100 women with cul -de-sac obliteration from retro -cervical deep 
fibrotic endometriosis and described their operating technique  (Reich , et al. , 1991 ). Forty -one of the 
46 women with pain had reported improvement, (48 % partial, 52 % complete). Hong et al . reported the 
quality of life and pain o utcomes for 390 patients with histologically proven deep endometriosis in the 
cul-de-sac who underwent laparoscopic excision (Douglasectomy) in a non -randomised comparative 
study  (Hong , et al. , 2014 ). Results were stratified by whether or not concurrent hysterectomy was 
performed . The VAS score for pain decreased significantly after surgery in both groups (follow up time 
not stated), but the non -hysterectomised women (who according to the authors had a higher disease 
burden) had fewer significant improvements in the SF -36 subscale s.   
Conclusion  
Due to the heterogeneity of patient populations, surgical approaches, preferences,  and techniques, the 
GDG decided not to make any conclusions or recommendations on the techniques to be applied for 
treatment of pain associated with deep endometriosis.  
Endometriosis of the bladder and ureters   
Surgical treatment of bladder endometriosi s is usually excision of the lesion and primary closure of the 
bladder wall. Ureteral lesions may be excised after stenting the ureter; however, in the presence of intrinsic lesions or significant obstruction , segmental excision with end -to-end anastomosis  or 
reimplantation may be necessary.  
Information on bladder endometriosis treatment was derive d from small to medium size case series 
(Goncalves  et al.,  2019 , n=10 ; Chapron  et al.,  2010 , n=75 ; Pontis et al.,  2016 , n=16 ; Kovo or et al.,  2010 , 
n=21 ; Scho nman  et al. , 2013 , n=69). Excision of endometriosis either by partial cystectomy or shaving 
was associated with significant improvement of pain symptoms with low complication and recurrence 
rates in all five  case series  (Chapron , et al. , 2010 , Goncalves , et al. , 2019 , Kovoor , et al. , 2010, Pontis , et 
al., 2016 , Schonman , et al. , 2013 ). 
A systematic review of 17 cohort studies including 700 women analysed the laparoscopic management 
of ureteric endometriosis  (Cavaco -Gomes , et al. , 2017) . Typically, women with ureteric endometriosis 
did not complain of sympto ms specific to the urinary tract. The left ureter was affected in 53.6%, 
bilateral disease was present in 10.6% of cases. Ureterolysis alone was performed in 579  patients , 89 
underwent ureteral resection and re -anastomosis, and 32 had ureteroneocystostomy. Rectovaginal 
and uterosacral involvement w ere present in 58.8% and 47.9% of patients, respectively and 
concomitant ureteral and bladder endometriosis in 19.8% of patients. Conversion to laparotomy was reported in six studies in 3 -6,7%  of patients. Major postoperative complications occurred in 3.2% and 
the need for reoperation during follow- up period because of ureteral endometriosis persistence or 
recurrence was 3.9%. The authors felt a more conservative approach (ureterolysis) was app ropriate in 
most patients with ureteral endometriosis.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  60 
Hudelist et al . 2018 reported pain and fertility outcomes in a series of 50 women with ureteric 
endometriosis/hydronephrosis (n=23) and bladder (n=27) endometriosis and 3 with both pathologies  
(Hudelist , et al. , 2018b ). Patients were treated with either segmental bladd er excision, 
ureterolysis/decompression, ureteric resection and end -to-end anastomosis or ureteroneocystostomy 
(17 women had concomitant bowel resections). After a median follow- up of 23 months , there was 
significant improvement in the pain symptoms and Qo L.  
For further surgical details of the management of bladder and ureteric endometriosis the reader is 
referred to the recommendations by the Working Group of ESGE, ESHRE and WES (Working group of 
ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2020a , b). 
II.3.g. Nerve -sparing laparoscopy  
A systematic review of four RCTs comparing conventional to nerve -sparing operative laparoscopy in 
painful deep endometriosis investigates the rate of urinary retention, defined as the need to self -
catheterise at discharge and 90 days after surgery for pain ful deep endometriosis (de Resende , et al. , 
2017 ). The relative risk of requiring self -catheterisation at discharge after nerve sparing surgery 
compared to the conventional technique wa s 0.19 ( 95%CI  0.03  to 1.17) . Based on two studies, common 
RR for persistent urinary retention (after 90 days) was 0.16 (95%CI  0.03  to 0.84].  
Since then,  an additional cohort study was published on 34 women who had laparoscopic surgery for 
posterior compartment endometriosis ( Uccella , et al. , 2018 ) reported no cases of self -catheterisation 
at 6-and 12 -month follow -up and urinary function was not impaired by surgery. Median VAS s core levels 
of pelvic pain were significantly decreased after surgery both at 6 (median 3, range 0 -7 and 2, 0 -7, 
respectively) and at 12 months (3, 0 -8 and 2, 0 -7), compared to preoperative levels (9, 1 -10 and 3, 0 -7, 
respectively) (p < 0.0001).  
Research r ecommendation  (R8) 
The GDG recommends that nerve- sparing laparoscopy should be performed in centres of expertise and 
that data are collected in a standardised fashion to assess its potential benefits and risks.  
II.3.h. Hysterectomy for endometriosis -associated pain  
There are no RCTs on hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy) for the treatment of 
endometriosis -associated pain; most published articles are retrospective case series, and there are only 
a few prospective studies. A non -systematic review by Martin concluded that hysterectomy for chronic 
non-specified pelvic pain associated with endometriosis was a successful approach in many women  
(Martin, 2006 ). It also stated that some women did not obtain any relief of pain after hysterectomy and 
suggested focused prospective research to determine specifi c response patterns. This article listed 
several  difficulties in evaluating hysterectomy for endometriosis -associated pain, including lack of 
differentiation between cyclical and non -cyclical pain, difficulty in establishing whether endometriosis 
is the ca use of pain or a co -incidental finding in a woman with chronic pelvic pain, and high variability 
in the rates of success among the studies.  
The conclusions of this review were supported by two further publications. Shakiba et al . found that 
women who unde rwent hysterectomy with or without removal of the ovaries were significantly less 
likely to require further surgery, compared to those who underwent conservative surgery  (Shakiba , et 
al., 2008 ). A population -based study from Sweden also showed that hysterectomy with preservation or 
removal of ovaries resulted in a significant and long -lasting  reduction in the pain symptoms  (Sandström , 
et al. , 2020) .  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  61 
Other important aspects to consider are effective removal of endometriotic lesions and removal of 
ovaries. Many clinicians believe that surgical castration would lead to regression of remaining 
endometriotic lesions. Furthermore, hysterectomy with ovarian conservation was reported to have a 
6-fold risk for development of recurrent pain and an 8.1 -times greater risk of reoperation  (Martin, 2006 , 
Namnoum , et al. , 1995 ). This would need to be weighed against the need for hormone replacement 
and potential long -term  impact of oophorectomy.  
Recommendations (32-34) 
Clinicians can consider hysterectomy (with or without removal of the ovaries ) with 
removal of all visible endometriosis lesions, in those women who no longer wish to 
conceive and failed to respond to more conservative treatments. Women should be 
informed that hysterectomy will not necessarily cure the symptoms or the disease.  ⊕⊕ 
 
When a decision is made whether to remove the ovaries, the long -term consequences 
of early menopause  and possible need for hormone replacement therapy should be 
considered.  GPP  
 
The GDG recommends that when hysterectomy is performed, a total hysterectomy is 
preferred.  GPP 
Justification  
Hysterectomy for endometriosis -associated pain seems to be effective for relieving symptoms and 
significantly reduces the need for re -operation. This may be a particularly good option in women with 
significant concomitant adenomyosis. It should be consider ed that hysterectomy, especially when 
combined with bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy, is not an option for women still wishing to conceive. 
Additi onally, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy may have a significant long -term  
impact and may create a need for hormone replacement therapy.  
The GDG stresses that women with endometriosis may still experience pain symptoms after hysterectomy, due to residual endometriosis or centralisation of pain.   
The GDG recommends that when hysterectomy is performe d, a total hysterectomy ( i.e., removal of 
uterus and cervix ) is preferred.  This recommendation is based on possible risk of  persistent 
endometriosis and adenomyosis within the retained cervix and/or adjacent to it with subtotal 
hysterectomy .

II.3.i Patient selection for surgery  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : IS THERE A SUBGROUP OF WOMEN WITH CONFIRMED ENDOMETRIOSIS WHO 
RESPOND BETTER TO SURGERY THAN OTHERS ? 
 
There are few studies addressing this question. A recent systematic review identified papers  that 
reported on the prognostic factors which were associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in 
endometriosis -assoc iated pain after laparoscopic surgery  (Ball, et al. , 2021)  and included two  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  62 
retrospective (Chopin , et al. , 2005 , Ghai , et al. , 2020 ), and three prospective studies  (Abbott , et al. , 
2003 , Banerjee, et al. , 2006 , Milingos , et al. , 2006) . Four of the five included studies indicated that 
stronger pain relief after endometriosis surgery was related to more severe disease prior to surgery  
(Banerjee, et al. , 2006 , Chopin , et al. , 2005 , Ghai , et al. , 2020 , Milingos , et al. , 2006 ). There is a 
knowledge gap on this specific question and further research is required.   
Research recommendation  (R9)  
Studies should evaluate factors that can be assessed prior to surgery and can predict a clinically 
meaningful improvement of pain symptoms. S uch prognostic markers  can be used to select patient s 
that may benefit from endometriosis surgery.

II.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  
The question on whether medical therapies are effective as an adjunct to surgical therapy considers 
both therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes, and therapies aimed at secondary prevention, 
being prevention of recurrence of disease and/or symptoms.  
A good practice point in this respect was formulated in the previous ESHRE guideline for endometriosis 
(Dunselman , et al. , 2014 ): “The GDG recommends that clinicians clearly distinguish adjunctive short-
term (< 6 months) hormone treatment after surgery from long -term (> 6 months) hormone treatment; 
the latter is aimed at secondary prevention. ” 
The evidence and recommendations are therefore separated into ‘therapies to improve immediate 
surgical outcomes’ and ‘therapies for secondary prevention’.  The latter is discussed in chapter IV. 
Endometriosis and recurrence . 
 
PICO  QUESTION : ARE MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT TO SURGICAL THERAPY ?  
 
The Cochrane review considering both pre - and postoperative treatment in relation to the management 
of cysts, pain,  and infertility ( Yap, et al. , 2004 ) was updated in 2020 ( Chen , et al. , 2020 ). 
II.4.a Preoperative medical treatment  
With regards to preoperative treatment, the updated review shows no benefit with regards to pain, 
dysmenorrhea,  or dyspareunia recurrence. With regards to disease recurrence, no new data were 
included compared to the previous version of the review . Chen et al. reports uncertainty regarding a 
difference in pelvic pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) between presurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (RR 1.10; 95%CI  0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT; n=262) ( Chen , et al. , 
2020 ). The same statement was formulated for dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,  and disease recurrence.  
Recommendation  (35) 
It is not recommended to prescribe preoperative hormon e treatment to improve the 
immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The guideline group confirms the recommendation from the  previous ESHRE  guideline (Dunselman , et 
al., 2014) . Considering this (strong) recommendation, the GDG acknowledges that in clinical practice, 
surgeons prescribe preoperative medical treatment with GnRH agonists as this can facilitate surgery due to reduced inflammation, vascularisation of endometriosis lesions and adhesions. However,  there 
are no controlled studies supporting this. From a patient perspective, medical treatment should be offered before surgery to women with painful symptoms in the waiting period before the surgery can 
be performed, with the purpose of reducing pain bef ore, not after, surgery.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question II. 4). 
   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  68 
II.4.b Postoperative medical treatment  
The review from Chen et al.  presents the data for pain and disease recurrence in the short -term (≤12 
months) and similar to the previous guideline, the data summari sed for ≤12 months are considered 
relevant to assess the efficacy of postoperative medical treatment to improve immedia te surgical 
outcomes (Chen, et al. , 2020 ). The interventions included were GnRH agonists, danazol, letrozole, OCP, 
and progestogens. Compared to surgery alone, postsurgical medical therapy may decrease pain 
recurrence at 12 months or less (RR 0.70; 95%CI  0.52 to 0.94; 5 RCTs; 657  patients ) (Chen, et al. , 2020) . 
With regards to disease recurrence, there may be a decrease in favour of postsurgical medical therapy, 
compared to no therapy (RR 0.30; 95%CI  0.17 to 0.54; 4 RCTs; 433 patients ). 
Postoperative levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system  (LNG -IUS) was not included as an 
intervention in the review ( Chen , et al. , 2020 ). In a randomised controlled trial, 55 patients with 
endometriosis and moderate -to-severe dysmenorr hea were randomised after surgery to LNG- IUS or 
expectant management. At 12 months follow -up, patients in the LNG -IUS group had significantly lower 
median value s of dysmenorrhea and noncyclic al pelvic pain score , a greater reduction in dysmenorrhea 
visual analogue  scale  (VAS) score  (-81.0 compared with - 50.0 mm) and pelvic pain VAS score (-48.5 
compared with - 22.0 mm). The reduction in dyspareunia VAS was comparable between the groups. 
Two patients in the LNG -IUS gro up and (7.4%) and nine in the expectant management group (39.1%) 
had recurrent dysmenorrhea within 1 year postoperatively (Tanmahasamut , et al. , 2012 ). 
Recommendation (36) 
Women may be offered postoperative hormon e treatment to improve the immediate 
outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis  if not desiring immediate 
pregnancy.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Based on the current evidence from the Cochrane review by Chen et al ., the GDG concluded that there 
is only a very moderate benefit of postoperative hormone therapy (within 6 months after surgery) if 
this treatment is prescribed with the sole aim of improving the outcome of surgery. Furthermore, there is inconsistency betwee n the studies on whether postoperative hormone treatment has a favourable  
effect on pain recurrence or disease recurrence after surgery. With no proven harm, postoperative hormone therapy may  be prescribed for other indications, such as contraception or se condary 
prevention (weak recommendation).   
Medical therapies aimed at prevention of recurrence after surgery (secondary prevention) are 
discussed in chapter IV. Endometriosis recurrence.

II.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE SURGICAL THERAPIES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MEDICAL THERAPIES FOR 
WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS WITH PAIN SYMPTOMS ?   
  
The question on whether surgical therapies are more effective than medical therapies for 
endometriosis -associated pain is an im portant clinical question. However, it has not been fully 
addressed in research.  
Our literature search retrieved two  cohort study from the same research team. In the first parallel 
cohort study , 154 patients were followed up for 12 months after choosing hormone treatment 
(progestin) or surgery for deep dyspareunia and rectovaginal endometriotic lesions. The study showed 
that both treatment options were effective (Vercellini , et al. , 2012) . The cohort study included 87 
women with a diagnosis of DE and indication for surgical excision of intestinal endometriosis. Of the women, 50 opted for medica l treatment (OCP [n=12] or progestin [n=38]) while 37 had surgery. Six 
women in the medical therapy group requested surgery because of drug inefficacy (n=3) or intolerance 
(n=3). Seven major complications were observed in the surgery group (19%). At 12 -mon th follow- up, 
39 (78%) women in the medical therapy group were satisfied with their treatment, compared with 28 
(76%) in the surgery group (adjusted OR 1.37; 95%CI  0.45 to 4.15; intention -to-treat analysis). 
Corresponding figures at final follow- up assessm ent were 72% in the former group and 65% in the latter 
one (adjusted OR 1.74; 95%CI  0.62 to 4.85) ( Vercellini , et al. , 2018 ). Based on the high satisfaction in 
both groups, the authors advocated for a shared- decision approach.  
For endom etrioma, there are no randomised studies that compare surgery to treatment with 
medication, but a protocol for an RCT to answer this question was recently published. The results of the trial will provide evidence for future recommendations on whether surgi cal or medical therapies 
are more effective for endometrioma -associated pain (van Barneveld , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendation  (37)  
The GDG recommends that clinicians take a shared decision -making approach and take 
individual preferences, side effects, individual efficacy, costs,  and availability into 
consideration when choosing between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for 
endometriosis -associated pain.  GPP 
Justification  
There is no conclusive evidence to make any definite recommendation on whether medical therapies 
or surgery are more effective for relieving pain in women with endometriosis. Surgery is a potential 
‘instant’ treatment,  but surgical complications are possible and often give only temporary pain relief 
with a considerable risk of recurrence. Medical management does not require general anaesthesia  and 
hospitalisation , but it can be associated with short and long -term side e ffects and patients may need to 
use medical treatments for a long period.  
Research recommendation  (R10)  
The GDG recommends sufficiently powered randomised clinical trials in different countries and cultural 
backgrounds to directly compare the risks, costs , and clinical outcomes of laparoscopy and empirical 
treatment.

II.6. Non -medical management  strategies  
Non-medical management strategies are widely used by women with endometriosis. In a recent 
questionnaire study, it was shown that 62.5% of Swiss, Austrian,  and German endometriosis patients 
used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The study also reported a link between higher 
usage of CAM and dissatisfaction with health care (Schwartz, et al. , 2019 ).  
Amour et al . provided a description of ‘self -management strategies’ highlighting that at least 70% of 
people with endometriosis use heat, diet, meditation, breathing, non -prescribed drugs and alcohol 
(Armour , et al. , 2019b ).  
Cox et al . also noted a large uptake of complementary therapies and concluded that people with 
endometriosis have a high need for ‘regaining control’ and develop self -management strategies  (Cox, 
et al. , 2003) .  
Such data show that there is a place for  non-surgical and non -pharmacological alternatives for women 
diagnosed with endometriosis. The interventions and approaches will depend on the impact of the 
conditions, the patients’ priorities and preferences and the availability of services.  
Greco et al . described several  different treatments such as Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation 
(TENS),  and psychological and physical therapies being offered to adolescents with endometriosis in 
Boston, though they did not evaluate the outcomes  (Greco, 2003 ).  
Self-help group s can improve quality of life , as suggested by a study  in which among a  group of people , 
9 out of the 171 chronic pain sufferers were specifically diagnosed with endometriosis (Barlow , et al. , 
2005 ).  
Even with the large uptake, there are very few studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of non -medical 
management strategies in women with endometriosis . This is also  reflected in 2 key priorities (or 
‘unanswered research questions’) identified in the  James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for 
Endometriosis (Horne , et al. , 2017 ).  
• What is the most effective way of managing the emotional and/or psychological and/or fatigue 
impact of living with endometriosis (including medical, non -medical, and self -management 
methods)?  
• What are the most effective non -surgical ways of managing endom etriosis -related pain and/or 
symptoms (medical/non -medical)?  
The previous version of this ESHRE guideline concluded that the limited research and papers did not support the use of nutritional, alternative , and complimentary therapies  (Dunselman, et al. , 2014 ). This  
chapter elaborate s on recent data for  non-medical management strategies for relieving endometriosis -
associated pain, and improving quality of life by including more recent studies on  acupuncture, physical 
therapies, psychological interventions, electrotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine and nutrition.  
Especially on psychological therapy and exercise, studies have emerged over recent years.  We did not 
identify evidence in women wi th endometriosis for other alternative or complementary therapies.  
Non-medical management strategies for endometriosis -associated infertility are discussed in Chapter 
III.7.

PICO  QUESTION : WHAT NON -MEDICAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR SYMPTOMS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS (PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE)? 
II.6.a. Acupuncture  
Acupuncture is considered a complementary and non -invasive treatment.  It is integrated in Chinese  
medicine whereas in Western medicine different theories and outcomes are applied and most often 
acupuncture is classif ied as CAM.  
A Cochrane review in 2011 found only 1 single study that met the inclusion criteria ( Xiang , et al. , 2002 , 
Zhu, et al. , 2011 ). The RCT compared auricular acupuncture to Chinese herbs in 67 women with 
endometriosis and reported a significant reduction in pain scores for patients with severe 
dysmenorrhea receiving acupuncture compared to Chinese herbs. However, no difference was seen in 
mild -to-moderate dysmenorrhea. The review concluded that there was insufficient high -quality  
evidence to recommend acupuncture for patients with endometriosis. They also established that a trial 
would need several hundred patients to reach a clinically credible estimate of efficacy.  
A meta -analysis from  2016 included 2 randomised controlled trials and 1 case report describing 2 
adolescents with endometriosis  (Lund and Lundeberg, 2016 ). One included RCT ( cross -over trial ) 
compared ‘sham’ acupuncture (non- specific acupuncture points) with verum acupuncture (Chinese 
approach) and included 101 women with endometriosis and a VAS pain score of ≥ 5 divided into 2 
groups  (Rubi -Klein , et al. , 2010 ). They received 10 treatments over 5 weeks and they had a break of 2 
menstrual cycles before they crossed over. Patients receiving verum acupuncture reported significantly 
less pain and improved psychological well -being compared to the ‘sham’  group . However, 18 patients 
dropped out and there was no blinding. The other RCT included a very small sample of 18 adolescent s 
(13–22-year -olds) comparing Japanese acupuncture (smaller needles and h erbs) with sham 
acupuncture (not penetrating the skin)  (Wayne , et al. , 2008 ). They concluded that Japanese 
acupuncture is a safe and effective adjunct therapy for endometriosis -related pain.  
Another review by Xu et al . also included  the study of Wayne et al. in addition to 9  small  Chinese studies , 
of which 3 were not peer -reviewed  publications  (Xu, et al. , 2017 ). According to the authors, only one 
study i ncluded a placebo group and blinding but the sample was too  small to draw any conclusions. The 
included studies compared Chinese acupuncture to Chinese medicine, sham acupuncture,  and Western 
medicine. The reviewers were able to perform a meta -analysis for the effect on pain  (based on 6 
studies)  and concluded that there was  consistent evidence to support acupuncture to alleviate 
dysmenorrhea and pain (VAS) , regardless of the comparison. Meta -analysis for  quality -of-life outcomes 
was not feasible due to the variation between the studies. Overall, it was a safe treatment with little or no reported adverse effects and there are grounds to believe that acupuncture could be used as an adjunct to alleviate pain  in women with endometriosis.  
Although summarised in several meta -analyses, the studies on acupuncture in women with 
endometriosis are small, non -specific,  and non- blinded. The papers included had mixed outcomes and 
different types of acupuncture making it  difficult to evaluate  them . Furthermore, questions  may be 
raised regarding the placebo groups as any needle to skin intervention provides sensory stimulation 
and it is not possible to present a valid inert placebo.  
Considering these aspects, only one small, non -specific,  and non- blinded study of low quality could be 
included for supporting a recommendation on acupuncture.  
It was therefore concluded that based on the current literature, no recommendation can be made 
about the use of acupuncture to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with endometriosis.

II.6.b Physical therapies  
II.6.b.1 Physiotherapy, massage,  and trigger point release therapy  
Publications focussing on women with endometriosis did not yield a lot of relevant literature to guide 
clinicians in terms of effectiveness and indications for physiotherapy interventions. Given the need for 
non-medical and alternative interventions the GDG have referred to relevant guidelines related to 
pelvic floor dysfunction, and a systematic review for pain relief and physiotherapy interventions for 
general pelvic pain. This may provide some guidance when  discussing appropriate physiotherapy 
services with patients even though very little research was identified specifically looking at the 
endometriosis population.  
Physiotherapy is not ‘a treatment’ in itself but a profession addressing human movement and f unction 
affected by injury or disease . Consequently , approaches and therapeutic options may vary. Pelvic health 
physiotherapists (often based in Women’s health settings) may focus specifically on pelvic floor 
dysfunction , such as bladder, bowel, sexual and musculoskeletal issues. P hysiotherapists are likely to 
support women  with activity management such as exercises, pacing strategies and goal setting. When 
working with persistent pelvic pain conditions, it becomes more important to identify fears, beliefs and 
other psychological issues including social barriers. Physiotherapists working in pain management are 
likely to have developed further skills in behavioural approaches and multidisciplinary working focussing 
less on the end organ or tissue dysfunction,  and more on responses in the nervous system and quality 
of life.  As such, it is very difficult to extract specific components of physiotherapy treatments as the 
human interaction, communication skills and patient centred care will affect all interventions . 
Moderate evidence exists for the effectiveness of pelvic floor exercises addressing pelvic floor 
dysfunction for urinary incontinence  (Dumoulin , et al., 2018 ) and this approach is also recommended 
by NICE for fa ecal incontinence  (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2007 ). NICE 
guidelines for pelvic floor dysfunct ion will shortly publish their recommendations looking at supervised 
pelvic muscle training to improve issues such as pelvic organ prolapse, stress and mixed urinary 
incontinence as well as faecal  incontinence  (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2021 ). 
Clinicians should be aware that non -medical strategies such as pelvic floor training are available for 
these issues that can be associated with complications from endometriosis, but no specific research was identified for pelvic floor training for women with endometr iosis.  
Physiotherapists may use passive approaches such as massage and trigger point release therapy. 
However, a literature review of trigger point manual therapy (TPMT) for reducing chronic noncancer pain found 2 pelvic pain trial s that met the inclusion criteria (Denneny , et al. , 2019 ). These studies  did 
not demonstrate any significant reduction in pain compared to general massage  (as control 
intervention) , and overall, the review concluded that trigger point therapy cannot be recommended 
for chronic pain.  
In a review about physiotherapy in women with pelvic pain, it was concluded that recommendations for physiotherapy should be given with caution. The review found six RCTs with significant heterogeneity  and often combined with psychological and medical mana gement making it impossible 
to establish the ‘stand alone’ value of physiotherapy input (Loving , et al. , 2012) . 
Two studies were retrieved evaluating manipulations and massage for relief of endometriosis -
associated pain, but both were of too low quality to support any recommendations ( Darai , et al. , 2015 , 
Valiani , et al. , 2010 ). 
II.6.b.2 Exercise  
Exercise has a large range of benefits including improvement in mental health and decreased risk of a large number of medical conditions as described and reco mmended by WHO  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  74 
(https://www.who.int/news -room/fact -sheets/detail/physical -activity ). Supporting patients staying 
active and exercising are key elements of pain management pr ogrammes  (British Pain Society, 2019 ) 
for people with persistent pain conditions, but the research into the specific effects on exercise on 
endometriosis has not been well documented.   
A Cochrane review on dysmenorrhea (not speci fic for endometriosis) found low- quality evidence 
suggesting that exercise, performed  at least  three times per week for about 45 to 60 minutes, 
regardless of intensity, may provide a clinically significant reduction in menstrual pain intensity of 
around 25  mm on a 100 mm VAS. Given the overall health benefits of exercise, and the relatively low 
risk of side effects reported in the general population, women may consider using exercise, either alone or in conjunction with other treatments  (Armour , et al. , 2019a ).  
Bonocher et al . could not make any firm recommendations from their literature review on 
endometriosis and physical exercises  as included studies reported a mixture of outcomes. They 
primarily examined the risk of recurrence of endometriosis and were not able to draw any conclusion 
regarding pain relief or quality of life measures. The 6 studies included were poor quality, did not 
include any randomised controlled trials and 4 were case studies  (Bonocher , et al. , 2014 ). One of the 
included studies, looked at various forms of physical activity in a retrospective study and concluded that there is a link between increased physical activity and less effectiveness from medication. They theorised that it may be related to the pain -relieving  effect of exercise itself which meant patients found 
the medication did not have the same effectiveness ( Koppan , et al. , 2010) . 
Awad et al . looked at posture, stretch and relaxation classes but demonstrated only a trend towards 
pain relief with no control group  (Awad , et al. , 2017 ). Goncalves et al . used yoga as the primary 
intervention , in a small sample of 16 patients doing yoga and 12 patients receiving medication and one 
individual physiotherapy session per week  (Goncalves , et al. , 2017 ). The study did show that the yoga 
group improved more in terms of pain re lief and quality of life, but 12 patients dropped out as they 
could not commit to the 2 months of 4 weekly hours of yoga. The improvements may also be related 
to the effect of being in a group  (Goncalves , et al. , 2016 ). 
It was encouraging that it demonstrated that following people with endometriosis over the years 
demonstrate that over 80% report improvement in symptoms but the variety of activity that were 
reported means no recommendations or conclusions can be drawn from that study . Carpenter et al . 
similarly foun d that patients taking danazol reported less side -effects when they exercised, but no 
change in reported pain levels  (Carpenter , et al. , 1995 ). 
Conclusion  
In summary and b ased on the current literature, no recommendation can be made about physical 
therapies or exercise and their benefit with regards to improving quality of life and reducing pain in 
women with endometriosis  
Overall, evidence is very poor for benefit of physiotherapy in women with pelvic pain, and adverse events are unclear. Additionally, i t is very difficult to ext ract specific components of physiotherapy 
interventions as the human interaction, communication skills and patient centred care will affect all 
interventions . As such, no recommendation was formulated on physiotherapy, massage,  and trigger 
point release th erapy.  
For exercise and activity, there is also insufficient literature to make a firm conclusion of its benefit for relieving chronic pelvic pain or endometriosis -related pain. However, exercise and activity are 
considered part of a healthy lifestyle in g eneral. The GDG decided a cautious recommendation, with a 
note on the need for further studies.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  75 
II.6.c Electrotherapy  
A Cochrane review on Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain (not 
endometriosis specific) concluded that published literature on the subject lacks the methodological rigour or robust reporting needed to make confident assessments of the role of TENS in chronic pain 
management  (Nnoaham and Kumbang, 2008 ). 
One RCT looked at electrotherapy using self -applied  TENS and acupuncture -like TENS  for treatment of 
chronic pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia in women with deep endometriosis.  (Mira , et al. , 2015 ). It 
demonstrated that both groups had significant improvements in terms of stress reduction and 
improvements in quality of life apart from sexual function on EHP -30. 
Bi et al . treated 83 women with endometriosis with neuromuscular electrical stimulation and compared 
their outcomes after 10 weeks to 71 patients on a waiting list (Bi and Xie, 2018 ). No improvements were 
detected after 5 weeks , but after 10 weeks there was a statistically significant difference in pain on a 
numerical scale, Endometriosis Symptom Severity Scale and SF -36 in favour of th e treatment group.  
Thabet et al . examined the effect of pulsed high -intensity laser therapy  (3 sessions per week for 8 
weeks) compared to sham laser treatment, both in addition to standard hormon e treatment in 2 groups 
of 20 women with endometriosis ( Thabet and Alshehri, 2018 ). 85% of patients in the active treatment 
group reported ‘complete’ or ‘excellent’ pain relief, and there was a significant increase in quality of life 
on Endometriosis Health profile (EHP -5).  
For all 3 studies, the conclusions should be considered with caution based on the design of the studies 
and th e small number of patients included.   
In summary, n o recommendation can be made based on these studies regarding electrotherapy and 
the effect on quality of life or pain in women with endometriosis.  
II.6.d Psycholog ical interventions  
Overall, 3 reviews were included that considered the impact of psychological interventions for 
symptoms associated with endometriosis (and/or in addition to surgery/other medical treatment). Trials were designed with different methodologies and based on different psy chological frameworks 
and types of intervention. Although it is possible to investigate the validated outcomes ( e.g., pain, 
quality of life, infertility, anxiety,  and depression), it is also difficult to separate effects, as these 
outcomes may overlap and interact.  
The reviews did not yield conclusive findings. Buggio et al ., in a narrative review , discuss ed the 
importance of integrating psychological interventions, including psychotherapy, in endometriosis treatment  (among diet, dietary supplements, physic al exercise, osteopathy, massage, acupuncture, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and Chinese herbal medicine, sexual therapy) ( Buggio , et 
al., 2017 ). The authors suggest that women may benefit from supportive –expressive psychotherapeutic 
interventions (either individual or in group) aimed at facilitating the expression of dee pest thoughts 
and feelings about endometriosis, as well as at empowering their female identity.  Van Niekerk et al.  did 
a systematic review, with narrative data synthesis, on psychological interventions for endometriosis -
related symptoms. They found 11 full -text studies that met the inclusion criteria, although the overall 
quality of studies was found to be ‘weak’, with a ‘high’ risk of bias (Van Niekerk , et al. , 2019 ). Evans et 
al. performed  a systematic review on psychological and mind -body interventions for endometriosis  
(Evans , et al. , 2019) . They included 12 s tudies, which overlap with those  included by Van Niekerk  et al. , 
with exception of two qualitative studies. The reviewers  also note that no study has used gold- standard 
methodology, thus limiting the validity.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  76 
As no meta -analysis was performed, relevant individual studies included in the review are described 
below (Beissner , et al. , 2017 , Hansen , et al. , 2017 , Lorençatto , et al. , 2007 , Meissner , et al. , 2010 , 
Meissner , et al. , 2016 ).   
The first study was of moderate quality and randomised patients with a history of endometriosis and 
chronic pelvic pain to either psychotherapy with somatosensory stimulation or waiting list control for 
3 months ( Meissner , et al. , 2016 ). In comparison with waiting list controls, treated patients showed 
improvements after 3 months in maximal and average glo bal pain, pelvic pain, dyschezia, physical 
quality of life and mental quality of life. Improvements in the intervention group remained stable at 6 
and 24 months, and control patients showed comparable symptom relief after delayed intervention.  
Beissner et al.  conducted a randomised controlled trial, including 67 patients with severe 
endometriosis -associated pain randomly allocated to a novel combination of psychotherapy and 
somatosensory stimulation ( n=35) or waiting list control ( n=32) (Beissner , et al. , 2017 ). Resting -state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess brain connectivity of these patients at 
baseline, after 3 months of therapy, and after 6 months. The analysis focused on the hippocampus. 
Regression analysis showed that reduction in con nectivity predicted therapy -induced improvement in 
patients' anxiety.  
Another study included in this review supported multidisciplinary group interventions in reducing pain and depression (Lorençatto , et al. , 2007 ). This was supported by Hansen et al . who looked at long term 
outcomes after a 10 -week psychological mindfulness -based programme. They found sustainable 
improvements on almost all scales of the endometriosis specific questionnaire EHP -30 and the generic 
form SF -36 in a six -year follow- up on the pilot study with 10 women ( Hansen , et al. , 2017 ).  
Two additional studies were  retrieved from the literature. Friggi Sebe Petrelluzzi et al.  studied 26 
women with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Participants  took  part in a therapeutic protocol 
involving physical and psychological therapy  of 2.5 -h sessions, once a week for 10 weeks. (Friggi Sebe 
Petrelluzzi , et al. , 2012 ). Treatment was effective in reducing perceived stress, normalizing cortisol 
levels, increasing vitality and improving physical functio ning , but no control group was included.  Farshi 
et al.  conducted an RCT to determine the effects of selfcare counselling on depression, anxiety and on 
quality of life with 76 women with endometriosis. Participants were randomly assigned to either 
intervent ion group (seven weekly self -care group counselling sessions) or control group. Participants 
were interviewed by the researcher before and after 4 weeks using BDI, STAI and SF -36 Quality of Life 
Questionnaire. Women in the counselling group showed signific ant lower anxiety values and a 
significantly higher quality of life after the intervention, compared to the control group. However, 
participants were included up to 5 years after their (laparoscopic) diagnosis, the majority indicated their 
post -endometriosis -treatment condition as “recovered” and no current symptoms were collected; thus 
limiting the significance of the found efficacy.  
In summary, n o recommendations can be made regarding the effectiveness of psychological 
approaches to improve pai n and quality of life in women with endometriosis. However, it is vital that 
clinicians are aware of the psychological impact of living with pain, infertility and functional pelvic issues 
and consider what access there is to psychological support.  
Overall , 2 reviews and 2 additional studies were included that considered the impact of psychological 
interventions for symptoms associated with endometriosis (and/or in addition to surgery/other medical 
treatment). The findings in both reviews regarding the effe ctiveness of psychological and mind -body 
interventions for endometriosis -related symptoms remain inconclusive. Mostly, the studies  were of low 
quality. Trials were designed with different methodologies and based on different psychological 
frameworks and ty pes of intervention. Although it is possible to investigate the various outcomes ( e.g.,   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  77 
pain, quality of life, infertility, anxiety,  and depression) separately, it is also difficult to separate effects, 
as these outcomes may overlap and interact.  
II.6.e Nutrition  
There has been much postulation that diet may affect endometriosis  symptoms, which may be based 
on observation that diet can affect several processes such as inflammation, prostaglandin metabolism 
and estrogen activity. Still, there are very limited studies, of limited quality, evaluating the benefit of 
dietary interventions and their effect on endometriosis symptoms.  
A review by Hansen et al , included six studies reporting that  omega -3 fatty acids have a positive effect 
on dysmenorrhoea with reduced pain intensity, duration,  and lower use of painkillers ( Hansen and 
Knudsen, 2013 ). In the review of Huijs and Nap, 4 studies were included, all showing significantly 
decreased pain scores after use of fatty acids, which were not found in controls ( Huijs and Nap, 2020 ). 
With regards to vitamin D, the review included 2 studies with opposite results. A small more recent RCT 
comparing the effect of a vitamin D supplement, fish oil (Omega -3 fatty acids  supplement) and placebo, 
on pain scores, reported a  significant improvement in pain scores after vitamin D supplementation, but 
reported a similar effect in the placebo group ( Nodler , et al. , 2020 ). A more modest improvement was 
observed in patients receiving fish oil.  
The review of Huijs and Nap. further reported that antioxidants, gluten,  and soy were not well studied. 
They concluded that nutrients with direct or indirect anti -inflammatory properties might have an effect 
on endometriosis -related pain,  but evidence is not yet available for development of a specific 
endometriosis diet (Huijs and Nap, 2020 ).  
When looking at the literature for diet it must be kept in mind that women with endometriosis may change their diets to ameliorate the symptoms . With regards to dietary intake, the study of Savaris et 
al. found a significantly lower intake of poly -unsaturated fatty acids and a significantly higher intake of 
fibre in women with endometriosis (Savaris and do Amaral, 2011 ). In the same study, the authors did 
not find any difference in antioxidants in the diet of women with or without endometriosis, whereas 
Mier -Cabrera et al . in a reasonable sized study (n=163) found lower dietary intake of antioxidant  
vitamins A, C and E in women with endometriosis ( Mier -Cabrera , et al. , 2009 ). 
The study of S chink et al . provides a detailed and differentiated analysis of the nutrient intake in women 
with endometriosis and controls, as well as information on food intolerances, allergies,  and 
gastrointestinal symptoms. The study show ed a higher prevalence of food intoleranc es (25.6% vs 7,7%) , 
allergies (57% vs 31%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (77% vs 29%) in women with endometriosis 
compared to controls. The nutrient intake also differed significantly with lower intake of animal proteins, vitamin C, vitamin B12 and magnesi um. The authors suggested that a dietary intervention by 
a professional nutritionist may help to reduce disease burden in women with endometriosis  (Schink , et 
al., 2019 ).  
Finally, the data of a qualitative study  provides insight in the motivation of women with endometriosis 
to make and maintain dietary changes (Vennberg Karlsson , et al. , 2020 ). The participants (n=12) made 
individual dietary changes, mainly consisting of excluding or decreasing their intake of gluten, dairy 
products and increasing their intake of carbohydrates, and increasing  fruit, vegetables,  and fish. From 
a thematic analysis , the authors concluded that the participants experienced decreased symptoms of 
endometriosis (pain and fatigue) and gained a greater understanding of their bodies after making 
individual dietary change s.   
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  78 
II.6.f Traditional Chinese Medicine  
The evidence for Chinese Medicine (CM) from the reviewed literature was not robust and studies were 
generally poorly constructed. There is the associated problem with Western society clinicians applying CM therapy in a Western medical setting. Only two stu dies were reviewed as they were better quality, 
but both had a high dropout rate, thus rendered the study by Flower et al . too small to apply any 
statistical analysis (Flower , et al. , 2011 ). The second study did not find any significant difference 
between the pain scores in the two groups CM and diet however there was no blinding and no placebo 
(Zhao , et al. , 2013 ) 
In summary , based on the current literature, no recommendation can be made about the use of 
nutrition or Traditional Chinese Medicine to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with 
endometriosis . Based on a few studies clinicians may suggest fish oils as an alternative to more harmful 
anti-inflammatories.  
The literature and research into Chinese Medicine are primarily concerned with interventions and outcomes that are not commonly used in Western medicine. The studies are very heterogeneous and 
no recommendations can be made.  With regards to nutrition, data are summari sed in well constructed 
systematic review, but the included data ar e derived from small studies without proper controls, 
limiting meta -analysis and any firm conclusions.   
Overall recommendation  (38) 
The GDG recommends that clinicians discuss non -medical strategies to address quality 
of life and psychological well -being in women managing symptoms of endometriosis. 
However, no recommendations can be made for any specific non -medical intervention 
(Chines e medicine, nutrition, electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise,  and 
psychological interventions) to reduce pain or improve quality of life measures in women 
with endometriosis, as the potential benefits and harms are unclear.  GPP 
Justificati on 
Though there is a lack of research specifically addressing the impact of non -medical strategies in the 
treatment of endometriosis -related symptoms, more studies are emerging. It seems evident that 
women  are searching for alternative ways of managing and coping without or alongside surgical and 
pharmacological interventions.  
Women  diagnosed with a condition with an unclear aetiology and prognosis can experience life 
changing consequences reporting pelvic  pain, painful periods and subfertility often needing long term 
support to manage and cope (NICE, 2017). Given the lack of literature mentioned above, it would seem 
reasonable to draw on some of the recommendations in chronic pelvic pain. EAU guidelines (2 018) 
strongly recommend the provision of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management in the 
gynaecological aspect of the management of chronic pelvic pain. It is important that women with endometriosis have options addressing psychological, sexual , and physical factors to improve quality of 
life even when pain cannot be reduced. No specific pain management programmes for endometriosis have  been identified, and the very limited literature supporting specific programmes for pelvic pain do 
not include any trials but show a trend of improvements in both pain and quality of life measures in small samples pre - and post intervention.  
This highlights the importance of giving the woman  the opportunity to gain information about non-
medical strategies in specialist pain management services with the expertise in managing complex 
abdomino -pelvic pain, and the potential benefits of local support groups which is also recommended 
by NICE (2017).   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  79 
Research recommendation  (R11)  
Adequately designed trials are needed to defi ne the potential benefits of non -medical interventions 
(nutrition, Chinese medicine, electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise,  and psychological 
interventions) in endometriosis.  
Further research into such interventions for women with endometrio sis that employ evidence -based 
protocols with high intervention integrity is recommended.

III. Treatment of endometriosis -associated 
infertility  
Women with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis 
associated pain, infertility, or both  (Tomassetti and D'Hooghe, 2018 ). For clarity, the GDG decided to 
separately discuss the evidence on pain as the outcome in chapter II ; infertility as an outcome is 
addressed in this chapter.  
For the literature searches, the outcomes included were live birth rate , pregnancy  rate, multiple 
pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, ectopic pregnancy, teratogenicity,  and side effects of treatment. It 
should be noted that although live birth rate is the most relevant outcome, most studies only report 
on (biochemical or clinic al) pregnancy rates. An increase in pregnancy rate could be an indication of 
live birth rate but  does not necessarily translate to an increase in this outcome.  
The first part of th is chapter deals with treatments (medical, surgical , non-pharmacological ) for 
endometriosis -associated infertility, that is, treatments that improve the spontaneous pregnancy 
rate. Medically assisted reproduction and adjunctive treatments are discussed in the second part of 
the chapter ( section  III.4). In th e last part of the chapter, the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy 
and obstetric outcome is  discussed, as well as indications for ART after surgery, and indications for 
fertility preservation . 
III.1. Medical treatment  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE HORMON E/MEDICAL T HERAPIES EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF 
ENDOMETRIOSIS -ASSOCIATED INFERTILITY ? 
III.1.a . Ovarian suppression  
The question as to whether hormone  therapy has any role in the treatment of endometriosis associated 
infertility has been thoroughly evaluated in a systematic Cochrane review ( Hughes , et al. , 2007 ). The 
review does not evaluate individual hormon e treatments used in the treatment of pain associated with 
endometriosis but considers as a group all therapies that result in ovarian suppression. Thus, strictly 
speaking, the as sessment is confined to the role of ovarian suppression as a therapeutic modality to 
improve fertility.  
In the analysis evaluating the effect on (clinical) pregnancy rate after the use of any ovulation suppression agent versus placebo or no treatment 12 t rials were included  (Hughes , et al. , 2007 ). The 
review  reported 88 pregnancies in 420 women who received an ovarian suppression agent compared 
with 84 pre gnancies in 413 women receiving no treatment or placebo, and thus concluded that there 
is no evidence of benefit on pregnancy outcomes, although data on live birth are not available. The OR for pregnancy across trials was 0.97 ( 95%CI  0.68 to 1.37) for all women randomised, and 1.02 ( 95%CI  
0.69 to 1.50) for women clearly identified as subfertile (80 pregnancies in  287 women  receiving 
treatment vs  73 in 270 controls , i.e. w omen receiving placebo or no treatment). Furthermore, also 
other comparisons (all ovarian suppression agents versus placebo or no treatment, all drugs with the exception of danazol versus placebo or no treatment, danazol versus other ovarian suppression, G nRH 
agonists versus oral contraceptives) failed to show any differences in pregnancy rate, even though the 
authors stated that there is a reasonable body of evidence with little inconsistency and minimal  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  82 
evidence of heterogeneity. The published evidence do es not report on more severe disease, as well as 
on live birth since surrogate markers were evaluated only. Similarly, there is a significant lack of 
reported data on adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Most 
included arti cles were published before 2000, but also at a revision in April 2009 no new relevant data 
were identified, and the review was therefore closed and will no longer be updated.  
Thus, it is clear that as sole treatment for endometriosis -associated infertility , recogni sed therapies that 
suppress ovulation in general are ineffective and should not be used.  
Recommendation  (39)  
In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian 
suppression treatment to improve fertility.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Based on the results of the Cochrane review, s uppression of ovarian function (by means of danazol, 
GnRH agonists , progest ogens, OCP) to improve fertility in women with endometriosis is not effective 
and should not be offered for this indicati on alone  (strong recommendation) .  
It should be noted that several patients included in the Hughes  et al. review had undergone surgical 
treatment before randomi sation for ovarian suppression or no treatment. This observation 
complicates any recommendations regarding ovarian suppression and post -surgical ovarian 
suppression, discussed in the following section.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study an d evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question III.1)  
III.1.b. Hormon e or medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy  
Although ovarian suppression in general does not appear to have an advantage on subsequent fertility 
as pointed out above  (see III.1.a) , and surgery does increase natural fertility  (see III.2) , it is still of interest 
to evaluate whether in the perioperative period ovarian suppression may have an added benefit. The 
effectiveness of medical therapies for horm one suppression before, after, or both before and after 
therapeutic surgery for endometriosis for increasing pregnancy rates (next to for improving painful 
symptoms and reducing disease recurrence) has been assessed in a Cochrane review by Chen and 
colleag ues (Chen , et al. , 2020 ), which included a total of 25 trials in 3378 women with endometriosis. 
This review replaces the one by Furness et al . cited in the previous version of this guideline, and it 
considered RCTs on any form of systemic medical therapy for hormone suppression (GnR H agonist , 
danazol, OCP, progestogens, gestrinone or combinations) at any dosage for a period of at least three months before or after surgery  (Yap, et al. , 2004 ). 
The effect of pre- surgical (hormon e suppres sion) medical therapy for the improvement of pregnancy 
rates - as compared to surgery alone -  was found to be uncertain (RR 1.18, 95%CI  0.97 to 1.45), as it 
was based on only one RCT (n=262) of very low quality (Chen, et al. , 2020 ).  
The difference in pregnancy rate between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormon e suppression 
therapy in the review by Chen et al . was found to be uncertain (RR 1.08, 95%CI  0.90 to 1.30:  1 RCT, 273  
patients ). The evidence suggests that if the pregnancy rate is assumed to be 60% among women with 
postsurgical medical hormon e suppression alone, the chance following presurgical medical h ormon e 
suppression would be between 54% and 78%. No trials were identified to compare pre - and postsurgical 
medical therapy with surgery alone or post- surgical medical therapy (Chen, et al. , 2020 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  83 
The review by Chen et al . concludes that surgery plus postsurgical medical therapy probably increases 
pregnancy rate compared to surgery plus placebo or no medical therapy (RR 1.19, 95%CI  1.02 to 1.38; 
11 RCTs, 955  patients ; I2=27%). This suggests that if the chance of pregnancy following surgery is 34%, 
the chance following surgery and postsurgical medical therapy would be between 35% and 48% (Chen , 
et al. , 2020) . The review included a mix of studies assessing pregnancy rates both after natural 
conception and MAR, and does not report on time to pregnancy, nor on the duration of hormon e 
treatment.  
Recommendations (40-41) 
Women seeking pregnancy should not be prescribed postoperative hormon e 
suppression with the sole purpose to enhance future pregnancy rates.  ⊕⊕ 
 
Those women who cannot attempt to or decide not to conceive immediately after 
surgery may be offered hormon e therapy as it does not negatively impact their fertility 
and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Although the review by Chen concludes that there is moderate quality evidence supporting postsurgical 
medical therapy for improving pregnancy rates, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. Firstly, the review provides indirect evidence for the cu rrent question, as the meta -analysis includes 
studies reporting on pregnancy rates after both spontaneous conception and MAR, while the PICO focusses specifically on natural conception rates. The evidence was downgraded for indirectness. 
Secondly, rather t han pregnancy rates, the total time to pregnancy should be considered as the primary 
outcome. Chen et al . acknowledges that women with subfertility due to endometriosis may not accept 
treatment that may reduce or delay their chance of conceiving after a surgical treatment. It is clear that 
a delayed start of attempted conception due to hormone  suppression sho uld be considered in decision-
making. Thirdly, the GDG challenges the conclusion of the review and considers the reported RR of 1.19 
(1.02 to 1.38), should be interpreted as evidence of no harm of ovarian suppression after surgery rather 
than benefit. Fina lly, the GDG questions the quality of some of the included studies in the review.  
Based on these considerations, the GDG considered that ovarian suppression after surgical treatment 
for endometriosis should not be prescribed to improve pregnancy rates (str ong recommendation). The 
GDG also considered that ovarian suppression after surgical treatment does probably not have a 
negative effect on the chances of pregnancy, and therefore, it may be prescribed  for pain management, 
or in women that cannot attempt to  conceive immediately after surgery, but not with the sole aim of 
improving pregnancy rates  (weak recommendation) . This is consistent with the earlier 
recommendation “ Women may be offered postoperative hormone treatment to improve the 
immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis.”

III.1.c. Other medical treatment s 
As endometriosis is associated with inflammation, anti -inflammatory drugs are potentially of interest 
to be evaluated as an alternative approach. The effects of pentoxifylline, which has anti -inflammatory 
properties, in subfertile premenopausal women were evaluated in a recent updated Cochrane 
systematic review ( Grammatis , et al. , 2021 ). In this review, based on three RCTS in 285 patients, the  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  84 
evidence of the effect of pentoxifylline versus placebo on clinical pregnancy rates is very uncertain (OR 
1.38; 95%CI 0.91 to 2.10), no trials reported the effects of pentoxifylline on the odds of li ve birth rate 
or adverse events. Data on the improvement of endometriosis -related symptoms i .e. overall pain, were 
equally very uncertain.   
Since endometriosis is an estrogen -dependent disease, Alborzi et al . performed a RCT to assess the 
effect of the an ti-estrogen (aromatase inhibitor) letrozole on natural pregnancy rates after surgical 
treatment of endometriosis (Alborzi , et al. , 2011 ). This study included 144 infertile women, randomised 
into 3 groups: group 1 (47 cases) received letrozole for 2 months, group 2 (40 patients) received 
triptorelin for 2 months and group 3 (57 patients, control group) did not receive any medication. All patients were followed up for at least for 12 months after re storation of a regular cycle. P regnancy 
rates were similar in all groups (23.4% , 27.5% and 28.1% , resp. ), the authors concluded that there was 
no benefit of the administration of letrozole to improve pregnancy rates . Of note, it is not stated 
whether some patients received medically assisted reproduction treatment during the follow- up 
period . Also, the use of letrozole for the purpose of ovulation induction was not examined.
 
Recommendation  (42) 
In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not pr escribe pentoxifylline, 
other anti -inflammatory drugs or letrozole outside ovulation -induction to improve 
natural pregnancy rates.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Studies show no benefit of pentoxifylline , postoperative aromatase  inhibitor (letrozole), or 
postoperative GnRH agonist (triptorelin) to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. 
Therefore, the intervention is not recommended  (strong recommendation) .

III.2. Surgical treatment  
The current section focusses on the efficacy and safety of surgery for increasing the chance of 
pregnancy in women with endometriosis. Technical guidance on surgical techniques for surgery in endometriosis has been previously published by a working group o f ESGE, ESHRE and WES (Working 
group of ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2020a , b, Working group of ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2017a , 
Working group of ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2017b ).  
 
PICO  QUESTION : IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS , IS SURGERY EFFECTIVE TO INCREASE THE 
CHANCE OF NATURAL PREGNANCY ?  
 
The question on whether surgery is effective to increase the chance of natural pregnancy was covered 
in a recent Cochrane review ( Bafort , et al. , 2020 ). Based on moderate quality evidence from 3 RCTs  
mainly on peritoneal endometriosis (see also III.2.a) , the review concluded that laparoscopic surgery 
increases viable intrauterine pregnancy rates confirmed by ultrasound compared to diagnostic 
laparoscopy only (OR 1.89; 95%CI  1.25  to 2.86).  
A similar conclusion was formulated from a recent network meta -analysis showing that pregnancy rate 
was significantly increased following surgical laparoscopy compared with placebo (OR 1.63; 95%CI  1.13 
to 2.35) (Hodgson , et al. , 2020 ). 
Jin et al . reported that live birth rate was significantly increased after laparoscopic surgery (relative risk 
[RR] 1.52; 95%CI  1.26  to 1.84, 4 studies ; 741 patients ) (Jin and Ruiz Beguerie, 2014 ). 
III.2.a Peritoneal endometriosis  
Although the Cochrane review does not specifically address endometriosis subtypes, it could only identify and include trials on rASRM stage I/II endometriosis  (Bafort, et al. , 2020 ). Therefore, their 
findings could be extrapolated to peritoneal endometriosis (or  at least the absence of large 
endometrioma and/or deep lesions with extensive adhesions). Although laparoscopic surgery was found to increase (natural) viable intrauterine pregnancy rates, no data were found on live birth rates. It should also be noted that none of the studies discussed were stratified according to the 
Endometriosis fertility Index ( EFI). 
III.2.b. Ovarian endometriosis  
We did not find any RCTs comparing fertility outcomes after surgery for endometrioma in comparison 
with expectant management , nor studies exploring the indication for surgery depending on the size of 
the cyst .  
A review by Alborzi et al . reported that, based on the combined results of 8 studies, the pregnancy rate 
after surgery for endometrioma was 43.8% ( 95%CI 22.5  to 66.4) and showed this was not significantly 
different from other treatments, such as surgery combined with ART, ART only or aspiration ± sclerotherapy + ART (Alborzi , et al. , 2019 ). 
Surgical treatment of endometriomas is mainly performed by 2 types of procedures: cystectomy (excision of the cyst wall) and ablation (destruction of the inner surface of the cyst wa ll in situ). 
Regarding  surgical technique, a review from 2013 reported that pregnancy rates were higher in patients  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  86 
that underwent cystectomy when compared to fenestration/coagulation (RR 2.64; 95%CI  1.49  to 4.69)  
and compared to  CO 2 laser vapori sation (RR 0.92; 95%CI  0.30  to 2.80) (Dan and Limin, 2013 ). 
A recent comparative study reported pregnancy rates that were similar after laparoscopic stripping 
technique (72.2%) or cyst vapori sation with CO 2 fibre  laser (74.3%). However,  spontaneous pregnancy 
rate was higher after laparoscopic stripping (55.5% vs 35.9%)  (Candiani , et al. , 2020 ).  
It should be noted that none of the studies discussed were stratified according to the Endometriosis Fertility Index ( EFI). 
III.2. c. Deep endometriosis  
In a systematic review by Meuleman  et al. , it was shown that only a minority of surgical studies on deep 
endometriosis (with bowel involvement) report on postoperative pregnancy rates (37% , 18/49 studies)  
(Meuleman , et al. , 2011 ). Unfortunately, in most studies, the number of patients wishing to conceive 
prior to or after surgery is not clear, the distinction between active child wish, passive child wish, 
completed child wi sh and absent child wish is not made and likewise the mean period for conception 
following surgery and the spontaneous/assisted reproduction nature and outcome of the pregnancies 
are often not reported (Meuleman , et al. , 2011 ). The review of Cohen et al . reported the preoperative 
and postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rates in women with DE with and without bowel involvement. In women without bowel involvement, there we re no data on preoperative pregnancy 
rates, but postoperative pregnancy rates were 50.5% ( 95%CI  46.8  to 54.1). In women with DE and bowel 
involvement, the postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rate was 28.6% ( 95%CI  25 to 32.3) (Cohen , et 
al., 2014 ). Similar data were reported by Iversen et al , who also reported a difference based on the 
study types, spontaneous pregnancy rate was 49% (n=136) and 21% (n=184) in 4 retrospective and 3 
prospective studies respectively (Iversen , et al., 2017 ).  
Vercellini et al . focused on spontaneous pregnancy rates after surgery for rectovaginal and 
rectosigmoid endometriosis in women that were infertile before surgery. Based on 11 studies, a mean 
postoperative conception rate (infertile and spontaneous PR) of 24% ( 95%CI  20 to 28%; 123/510) was 
reported, while the mean postoperative conception rate was 39% ( 95%CI  35 to 43%; 223/571) when 
preoperative fertility status and IVF performance were not considered (OR 0.50, 95%CI  0.38  to 0.65%)  
(Vercellini , et al. , 2012 ).  
Again, it should be noted that none of the studies discussed were stratified acco rding to the EFI.  
Recommendations (43-46) 
Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis -
associated infertility in rASRM  stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing 
pregnancy.  ⊕⊕ 
 
Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma -
associated infertility as it may increase their chance of natural pregnancy, although no 
data from comparative studies exist.  ⊕ 
 
Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for DE improves 
fertility, operative laparoscopy may represent a treatment option in symptomatic 
patients wishing to conceive.    ⊕ 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  87 
The GDG recommends that the decision to perform surgery should be guided by the 
presence or absence of pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous 
surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated EFI.  GPP 
Justification  
In the review of Bafort  et al. , surgery in women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis improved the rate 
of ongoing pregnancy . The GDG formulated a weak recommendation to offer operative laparoscopy. 
However, the GDG also acknowledges that data on live birth rates and direct comparison with medically 
assisted reproduction are lacking  (Bafort, et al. , 2020 ). 
Similar considerations were made for endometrioma and deep endometriosis surgery ; with a lack of 
comparative studies evaluating spontaneous conception after surgery compared to no surgery, no 
strong recommendations could be formulated.  
The GDG added clarification that the decision to perform surgery should be guided by other factors.   
The role of diagnostic laparoscopy in the context of the fertility work -up will be covered in the ESHRE 
Guideline on Unexplained infertility (in developme nt).   
Research recommendation  (R12)  
In patients without a clear indication for ART, the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis and its effect on natural pregnancy rates should be evaluated. Such studies should consider patient age, endometrio ma bilaterality and size, previous surgeries, adenomyosis and other factors affecting 
fertility.

III.3 Assessing the need for assisted reproduction after surgery  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : WHICH PATIENTS NEED TREATMENT WITH ASSISTED REPRODUCTION 
TECHNOLOGY AFTER SURGERY ? 
 
Before and after surgery for endometriosis, those individuals who wish to become pregna nt should be 
counselled objectively on their subsequent chances of achieving a pregnancy. To this purpose, the 
Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) was developed (Adamson and Pasta, 2010 ) as an end -of-surgery 
scoring system that predicts non- ART pregnancy rates  (natural conception or  IUI) after  surgery. It was 
derived from prospective analysis of clinical data and  has since been (externally) validated in over 30 
studies, of which the majority were evaluated in a meta -analysis (Vesali , et al. , 2020 ) confirming its 
good performance despite substantial heterogeneity between studies. By scoring patient -related 
factors (age, duration of subfertility and history of prior pregnancy) and surgical factors  (‘least function 
score’ of the tubes and ovaries, endometriosis lesion and total score as extracted from the rASRM staging) factors, a score between 0 and 10 is generated. This score is strongly correlated with 
postoperative non- ART pregnancy rates and  can therefore be used to counsel patients on their 
reproductive options, although it assumes normal gamete function. Its high reproducibility ( Tomassetti , 
et al. , 2020 ) further supports its use as an important clinical decision tool. When used as a system to 
decide on postoperative ART, healthcare costs have also been shown to be reduced through optimal 
patient selection (Ferrier , et al. , 2020) . 
Additionally, as it has been shown that the end -of-surgery EFI can be estimated accurately prior to 
surgery, this estimation could be used as an instrument to guide joint physician –patient decision -
making between surgery, ART,  or other fertility management  options for the individuali sed treatment 
of women with endometriosis -related infertility  (Tomassetti , et al. , 2021) , although this is the only study 
to date on this s ubject.  
Conclusion  
Women should be counselled  of their chances of becoming pregnant after surgery. To identify 
patients that may benefit from ART after surgery, the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) should be 
used as it is validated, reproducible and cost -effective. The results of other fertility investigations such 
as their partner’s sperm analysis should be taken into account.  
Research recommendation  (R13)  
It is suggested that the  EFI is used for better patient phenotyping in studies  on surgical treatment and/or 
the place of medically assisted reproduction ( MAR ) in endometriosis -related infertility . The  role of the 
EFI as a pre -surgical triage tool should be validated .

III.4. Medically assisted reproduction  
PICO  QUESTION : IS MEDICALLY ASSISTED REPRODUCTION EFFECTIVE FOR INFERTILITY ASSOCIATED 
WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
III.4.a. Intrauterine insemination in women with endometriosis  
There are very few studies assessing the efficacy of intrauterine  insemination (IUI), with or without 
ovarian stimulation (OS), in women with endometriosis. In one RCT live birth rates were compared in  
women with minimal to mild endometriosis; 53 patients underwent ovarian stimulation with 
gonadotrophins and IUI treatment and 50 expectant management. The live birth rate was 5.6 -times 
higher in the treated couples than in the control group ( 95%CI  1.18 to  17.4) (Tummon , et al. , 1997 ). In 
an initially randomised  and subsequently longitudinal study, Nulsen and co -workers compared 
gonadotrophins + IUI with urine LH -timed IUI alone. In 57 couples with m inimal or mild endometriosis 
the biochemical pregnancy rate (PR) was 5.1 -times higher than with IUI alone ( 95%CI  1.1 to 22.5) 
(Nulsen , et al. , 1993 ).  
Indirect evidence can be derived from studies comparing the outcomes of IUI in women with 
endometriosis to couples with (unexplained) infertility.  
In a cohort study, Omland and colleagues compared one cycle of clomiphene citrate + HMG/FSH against HMG/FSH with artificial insemination with partner’s sperm (IUI with or without intraperitoneal insemination  (IPI)) in couples with unexplained infertility (119 couples) or with stage I/II endometriosis 
(49 couples, diagnostic laparoscopy only). PRs were significantly higher in the women with unexplained 
infertility (33.6% vs  16.3%) (Omland , et al. , 1998 ). In a case control study, PRs following OS + 
homologous insemination were as high in women with stage I/II endometriosis within 6 months of 
surgical treatment as in women with unexplained infertility (PR/cycle 20 % vs 20.5%) (Werbrouck , et al. , 
2006 ).  
In a retrospectively analysis of 65 patients with surgically confirmed ASRM stages III/IV endometriosis with at least one patent tube, IUI with OS up to a maximum of six cycles compared to three times IUI 
without OS followed by up to three times IUI with O S significantly increased cumulative ongoing 
pregnancy rate (40.0% vs 15.6%) (van der Houwen , et al. , 2014 ).  
Kim and co -workers, in an  RCT, compared the use of long OS protocol (LP) and ultralong OS protocol 
(ULP) of GnRH agonist prior to IUI in 80 women (all stages of endometriosis). No difference in the clinical PR was found between protoco ls in women with minimal or mild endometriosis. In women with stage 
III/IV endometriosis, the clinical PR per cycle was significantly higher in the ULP group (50.0% (10/20)) 
compared with the LP group (19.0% (4/21)) (Kim, et al. , 1996) .  
Recommendations (47-48) 
In infertile women with rASRM  stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may perform 
intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation, instead of expectant 
management or IUI alone, as it increases pregnancy rates.  ⊕ 
 
Although the value of IUI in infertile women with rASRM stage III/IV endometriosis with 
tubal patency is uncertain, the use of IUI with ovarian stimulation could be considered.  ⊕ 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  91 
Justification  
In women with AFS/ASRM stage I/II endometriosis, IUI with ovarian stimulation may be effective in 
increasing live birth rate, compared with expectant management and effective in increasing 
biochemical pregnancy rate, compared to IUI alone  (weak recommendation) . In these women, 
clinicians m ay consider performing intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation within 6 months 
after surgical treatment, since pregnancy rates are similar to those achieved in unexplained infertility 
(Werbrouck , et al. , 2006 ). 
All studies in endometriosis mostly used gonadotrophin for OS.  Anti -estrogen therapy (clomiphene 
citrate and letrozole) could be an option, based on indirect evidence from studies of unexplained 
infertility (Danhof , et al. , 2018 , Diamond , et al. , 2015 ), but anti -estrogen therapy for OS prior to IUI has 
not been studied in women with endometriosis.  
Although one small sized RCT suggests higher clinical pregnancy rate with prolonged GnRH agonist 
suppression prior to IUI  (Kim, et al. , 1996 ), this approach cannot be recommended due to the relatively 
low success rate of IUI after such a prolonged treatment and the associated side effects.  
In patients with moderate to severe endometriosis, the benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI is unclear 
as only retrospective low evidence data are available  (weak recommendation) . 
Research recommendation  (R14)  
Studies should clarify whether IUI with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women 
with (different subtypes of) endometriosis. In addition , the value of EFI to predict the relevance of IUI 
could be further investigated.

III.4.b. Assisted reproductive technology in women with endometriosis.  
To our knowledge, there are currently no randomised  trials evaluating the efficacy of ART  versus no 
intervention  in women with endometriosis. Indirect evidence can be derived from studies comparing 
the outcomes of ART in women with endometriosis to women without endometriosis.  
In a systematic review and m eta-analysis from 2013, Harb and colleagues included 27 observational 
studies and a total of 8984 women and reported significantly lower fertili sation rates  (relative risk [RR] 
0.93; 95%CI  0.87 to 0.99; 7 studies; 2044 patients ), with no significant reduction in implantation, clinical 
pregnancy,  or live birth rates in women with ASRM stage I/II endometriosis  compared to women 
without endometriosis  (Harb , et al. , 2013 ). In women with stage III/IV endometriosis, a reduced 
implantation rate (RR 0.79; 95%CI  0.67 to 0.93; 8 studies; 923 patients) and clinical pregna ncy rate (RR 
0.79; 95%CI  0.69 to 0.91; 14 studies; 521 patients ) was observed, and a trend towards reduced live 
birth rates (RR 0.86; 95%CI  0.68 to 1.08; 9 studies; 312 patients ).  
Another systematic review and meta -analysis made similar conclusions based on similar studies 
(Hamdan , et al. , 2015) . They investigated the influence of endometriosis on ART outcom es reported no 
difference in live birth rates per woman when comparing women with versus without endometriosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95%CI  0.84 to 1.06; 13 studies; 12,682 patients). The clinical pregnancy rates (OR 
0.78; 95%CI  0.65 tot 0.94; 24 studies; 20757 patients) and the mean number of oocytes retrieved per 
cycle (mean difference [MD] - 1.98; 95%CI  -2.87 to - 1.09; 17 studies; 17593 cycles) were lower in 
patients with endometriosis. Subgroup analysis revealed that all of the outcomes were comparable i n 
women with stage I/II endometriosis and no endometriosis; live birth rate (OR 0.96; 95%CI  0.82 to 1.12; 
8 studies; 4,157 patients), clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.84; 95%CI  0.69 to 1.03; 15 studies; 9,692  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  92 
patients), and mean number of oocytes retrieved pe r cycle (MD –0.58; 95%CI , 21.16 to 0.01; 11 
studies). In contrast, in women with stage III/IV endometriosis a significantly lower mean number of 
oocytes retrieved (MD 21.76; 95%CI  22.73 to 0.79; 14 cycles; 9172 patients), pregnancy rate (OR 0.60; 
95%CI  0.44 to 0.81; 15 studies; 9,471 patients) and live birth rate (OR 0.77; 95%CI  0.64 to 0.92; 8 
studies) were reported.  
A total of 347,185 autologous fresh and frozen cycles from The Society for Assisted Reproductive 
Technologies (SART) database were analy sed to assess the impact of endometriosis (alone or in 
combination with other infertility diagnoses) on ART outcomes (Senapati , et al. , 2016 ). The diagnosis of 
endometriosis was associated with a significant decrease in live birth rate (risk ratio [RR] 0.94; 95%CI  
0.91 to 0.97), lower oocyte yield (RR 0.91; 95%CI  0.91 to 0.92), and lower implantation rates (RR 0.94; 
95%CI  0.93 to 0.96) after AR T. However, the association of endometriosis and ART outcomes was 
confounded by other infertility diagnoses. Endometriosis, when associated with other alterations in the 
reproductive tract, had the lowest chance of live birth. In contrast, for the minority  of women who have 
endometriosis in isolation, the live birth rate is similar or slightly higher compared with other infertility 
diagnoses. 
In a more recent retrospective single centre cohort study comparing 531 patients with endometriosis 
to 737 with unex plained infertility after a first embryo transfer, a 24% reduction in the likelihood of a 
live birth was demonstrated  in women with endometriosis  (OR 0.76; 95%CI  0.59 to 0.98) with an 
increasing effect associated with the severity of the disease (Muteshi , et al. , 2018 ). Furthermore, 
women   with endometriosis had fewer oocytes retrieved, lower blastocyst transfer and a significantly 
reduced implantation rate.  
Murta  and colleagues conducted a retrospective study from 1995 to 2011 of patients undergoing 27294 
ART cycles using data of the Latin American Registry maintained by the Latin America Network of 
Assisted Reproduction (REDLARA) ( Murta , et al. , 2018 ). A total of 7496 patients with endometriosis 
only, tubal factor, and unexplained infertility were included in the study. Patients were divided into two 
groups: endometriosis group, comprising 1749 patients who underwent ART due to endometriosis only 
and control group, with 5747 patients subjected to ART due to tubal factor or unexplained infertility. 
They concluded that endometriosis does not affect the  outcome of patients subjected to ART and 
although patients with endometriosis present lower number of oocytes and higher cancelation rate, 
these shortcomings do not reduce pregnancy and live birth rates.  
The impact of endometrioma on ART reproductive outcomes was summari sed in a recent review 
(Alshehre , et al. , 2020 ). The number of oocytes (weighted means difference; WMD - 2.25; 95%CI  3.43 
to - 1.06) and the number of MII oocytes retrieved (WMD - 4.64; 95%CI  5.65 to - 3.63) were significantly 
lower in women with endometrioma versus controls  (women without endometrioma and/or tubal or 
male -factor infertility) . All other outcomes, includin g gonadotrophin dose and duration, the total 
number of embryos  and high -quality embryos,  clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate  and live birth 
rate were similar in women with endometrioma and controls . 
III.4.b.1 Type of OS protocol  
Several trials and studies evaluated GnRH agonist versus GnRH antagonist ovarian stimulation protocols 
in women with endometriosis. An RCT including 246 women with stage I/II endometriosis and endometrioma showed that the implantation rate and clinical PR after OS in a GnRH antagonist cycle 
were not inferior to those for a GnRH agonist protocol ( Pabuccu , et al. , 2007 ). An observational 
retrospective analysis of 1180 cycles with the propensity score matching failed to demonstrate a 
difference in clinical PR between GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist protocols in patients with stage I -
IV endometriosis ( Rodriguez -Purata , et al. , 2013 ).   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  93 
In studies comparing the long GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist protocols, no difference in ongoing 
PR was observed  between the 2 OS protocols   in patients who previously underwent laparoscopic 
endometrioma resection surgery ( Bastu , et al. , 2014 ). Kolanska et al . performed  a retrospective analysis 
of 284 IVF cycles, and reported that women with endometriosis experienced higher pregnancy and live 
birth rates after fresh embryo transfer but not after frozen cycle when long GnRH agonist protocols 
were compared to GnRH antagonist protocols ( Kolanska , et al. , 2017 ). The cumulative live bi rth rates 
per cycle were not different between the two groups. Comparison of long GnRH agonist  and GnRH 
antagonist ART  protocols was further conducted in an observational retrospective cohort study 
including 386 women subdivided into two groups (endometrio sis stage I/II and endometriosis stage 
III/IV) (Drakopoulos , et al. , 2018 ). A tendency toward higher biochemica l and clinical pregnancy and live 
birth rates (42.8% vs. 26.7%) was noted in favour of GnRH agonist in patients with stage I/II 
endometriosis whereas no difference was observed in the endometriosis stage III/IV group.  
III.4.b.2 MAR and risks  
In a systematic review, low quality evidence suggested that ovarian stimulation with IUI might increase 
the risk of recurrence whereas moderate quality evidence suggested that ovarian stimulation for ART 
did not increase the risk of recurrence or worsen pa in symptoms ( Somigliana , et al. , 2019) . Moreover, 
the effect on endometriomas seems minimal.  ART and endometriosis recurrence are discussed in 
section IV.1.c.  
In a series of 214 women with endometriomas undergoing oocyte retrieval for IVF/ICSI under antibiotic 
prophylaxis, no pelvic abscess was recorded (Benaglia , et al. , 2008) .  
Recommendations (49-52) 
ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis, especially if tubal 
function is compromised, if there is male factor infertility, in case of low EFI and/or if 
other treatments have failed.  ⊕⊕ 
 
A specific protocol for ART in women with endometriosis cannot be recommended. Both 
GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols can be offered based on patients ’ and 
physicians ’ preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been 
demonstrated.  ⊕ 
 
Women with endometriosis can be reassured regarding the safety of ART since the 
recurrence rates are not increased compared to those women not undergoing ART.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
 
In women with endometrioma, clinicians may use antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of 
oocyte retrieval, although the risk of ovarian abscess formation following follicle 
aspiration is low . GPP 
Justification  
Overall,  in infertile women, most of the  evidence does not demonstrate a negative impact of 
endometriosis (compared to non- endometriosis patients) on live birth rate after ART , even if the 
ovarian response and clinical pregnancy rates are lower. Therefore, ART may be effective for 
endometriosis -associated endometriosis, and is recommended (weak recommendation) in women 
with other infertility factors. The severity of the disease might play a role with stage III -IV endometriosis  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  94 
potentially decreasing the live birth rate. The available evidence fai led to demonstrate that a specific 
ART protocol should be favoured  in patients with endometriosis.  
From a systematic review including moderate quality evidence, ART was not associated with increased 
endometriosis recurrence rate.  A weak recommendation was formulated to inform and/or reassure 
patients. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometriomas 
seems reasonable  and is recommended as a good practice point.  
There is no evidence on whether IUI or ART is superior in women with endometriosis.  
Research recommendation  (R15 – R17)  
Studies evaluating IUI and ART should report clinically relevant outcomes (live birth rates and cumulative data), and ideally perform s ubgroup analysis by stage of endometriosis and type of disease.   
Further studies of both medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis -associated infertility are 
required to clarify the relative effectiveness of treatments, in particular trials comparing ART and IUI to 
other treatments.  
The impact of the extent of disease on the outcome of ART should be further studied, as it could provide 
data for selection of patients that could benefit from ART.

III.5. Medical therapies as an adjunct to MAR  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT TO MAR  FOR 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ASSOCIATED INFERTILITY ? 
 
The role of medically assisted reproduction (MAR) in the treatment of endometriosis -associated 
infertility is addressed in the previous section and its role is well established. It has been proposed, 
following numerous non -randomised studies, that medical treatment of endometriosis prior to ART 
may result in improved outcome , either because of improving oocyte quality or endometrial receptivity. 
The specific question of GnRH agonist pre-treatment  has been addressed in an older Cochrane review 
(Sallam , et al. , 2006 ) that – based on three included studies in a total of 228 patients – concluded that 
prolonged downregulation for 3 –6 month s with a GnRH agonist in women with endometriosis increases 
the odds of clinical pregnancy by more than 4 -fold.  
In contrast, the updated version of this Cochrane review ( Georgiou , et al. , 2019) , including 8 parallel -
design RCTs involving a total of 640 participants, concluded that the effect of GnRH agonist pre -
treatment (for at lea st 3 months) was very uncertain, both on live birth rate as primary outcome, as 
well as on secondary outcomes (clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos). All studies included in t his review have 
compared long -term GnRH agonist versus no pre -treatment. The authors acknowledged the very low 
quality of data, particularly for reporting live birth rate. Compared to the previous version of the review, the outcome of live birth now includ es only one new unpublished trial (NCT01581359 ) and excludes a 
previously included RCT ( Dicker , et al. , 1992 ) as this paper does not truly report on live birth as per the 
definition  of the international  glossary on infertility and fertility care (Georgiou , et al. , 2019 ). For the 
outcome of clinical pregnancy rate  (CPR) , the review includes three new RCTs, leading to the results 
being closer to the line of no effect. Further, subgroup analysis by endometriosis severity highlighted the uncertainty of the effect, and subgroup analysis by previous history of surgery was not possible due 
to a lack of data.  
A more recent RCT investigating the effect of ultralong administration of GnRH agonist, after 
cauterisation by diathermy of stage I/II endometriosis and before ART, failed to demonstrate a 
beneficial effect on implantation  rate, CPR, or embryo quality (Kaponis , et al. , 2020 ).  
A meta -analysis of studies comparing different GnRH agonist protocols (short, long, ultralong) reported 
that based on evidence from RCTs, a GnRH agonist ultra -long protocol could improve clinical pre gnancy 
rates, especially in patients with stages III /IV endometriosis (RR 2.04, 95%CI  1.37 to 3.04; 2 RCTs; 152  
patients ). However, when the meta -analysis was performed considering both RCTs and observational 
studies (n=21), the different down -regulation protocols provided no significant difference in improving 
clinical outcomes (implantation rate, fertili sation rate, CPR ) in patients with endometriosis (Cao, et al. , 
2020 ). In a recent randomised open label trial underpowered due to early termination, ultra -long 
downregulation with a GnRH agonist in previously operated patients with endometriosis compared to classic long agonist protocol failed to improve clinical pregnancy rates in the subsequent initiated fresh 
ART cycle  (Tomassetti , et al. , 2021 ). 
Pre-treatment  with continuous combined oral contraceptive (OCP) for 6 -8 weeks as compared to no 
pre-treatment before ART was only evaluated in a pilot two -cent re trial, that indirectly suggested a 
potential beneficial effect on CPR  (de Ziegler , et al. , 2010 ), however this study was not randomised .  
An RCT including 68 women with stage III/IV, administration of dienogest ( DNG ) during 12 weeks before 
IVF vs no pre -treatment revealed lower cumulative pregnancy rate and live birth rate in the DNG group  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  97 
(Tamura , et al. , 2019 ). In a non -inferiority randomised  clinical trial including 450 women with stage III/IV 
randomised  to medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)  + hMG , dydrogesterone + hMG , or progesterone 
+ hMG , the number of oocytes retrieved was higher in the MPA + hMG group but no significant 
differences in fertili sation or clinical pregnancy rate were observed (Guo, et al. , 2020 ). In a retrospective 
study including 151 patients with endometriosis and a previous failed IVF cycle, 3 months DNG pre -
treatment prior to IVF versus no pre -treatment significantly increased cumulative implantation, clinical 
pregnancy,  and live birth rates (Barra , et al. , 2020 ). 
There are no studies comparing the effect of different medical therapies for pre -treatment  prior to ART.  
Recommendations (53-54) 
The extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART treatment to improve live 
birth rate in infertile women with endometri osis is not recommended, as the benefit is 
uncertain.  ⊕ 
  
There is insufficient evidence to recommend prolonged administration of the 
COC /progestogens  as a pre -treatment to ART to increase live birth rates.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Based on the Cochrane review ( Georgiou , et al. , 2019 ), with the limitations as mentioned above , the 
merit of 3 –6 months GnRH  agonist administration to women  with endometriosis prior to ART compared 
to no pre -treatment is uncertain and requires further high- quality trials to determine its impact  With 
uncertain benefit,  the administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART treatment cannot be recommended.  
The data concerning the use of OC P or progestogens as a pre -treatment before ART for improving ART 
outcomes are very limited and do not allow to draw any conclusion. This does not preclude use of OC P 
for planning purposes.

III.6. Surgical therapies as an adjunct to MAR  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE SURGICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT PRIOR TO MAR  FOR 
ENDOMETRIOSIS -ASSOCIATED INFERTILITY ? 
 
It was mentioned (section III.2) that surgery could have a beneficial effect on spontaneous pregnancy 
rates in women with endometriosis. Thus, one could speculate that surgical treatment of endometriosis 
prior to treatment with MAR  could be effective in improving reproductive outcome.  
This section is subdivided into surgical therapy for peritoneal endometriosis, for ovarian endometrioma (ablation, cystectomy, aspiration) and for deep endometriosis prior to MAR .  
III.6.a. Surgery pr ior to MAR  in women with peritoneal endometriosis  
In a review and meta -analysis of Hamdan et al ., 12 studies were included evaluating ART outcomes 
after surgery for endometriosis. The duration from surgical treatment to ART was not specified in the 
studie s (Hamdan , et al. , 2015b ). The reviewers stated that the effect of surgery would have been best 
assessed between women with endometriosis who had received surgical treatment and those who had 
not received the treatment. However, there was only one study published wi th this comparison. In a 
group of 399 women with minimal to mild endometriosis, all visible endometriosis was completely 
removed prior to ART. In the control group (262 women) only a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. 
In the group in which surgery had t aken place prior to ART, significant higher implantation, pregnancy,  
and live birth rates (OR 1.47; 95%CI  1.01 to 2.13) were found. Moreover, the investigators reported a 
shorter time to first pregnancy and a higher cumulative pregnancy rate after surgical removal of 
endometriosis prior to ART (Opoien , et al. , 2011 ).  
The review by Hamdan et al.  further included indirect evidence from studies comparing outcomes in 
women with surgically treated AFS/ASRM stage I/II endometriosis and controls (women with no 
endometriosis). The reviewers found no difference in the live birth rate (OR 0.88 ; 95%CI  0.76  to 1.02, 4 
studies, 3492 patients),  but reported  a lower clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.69; 95%CI  0.50 to 0.96; 9 
studies; 4888 patients) and a lower mean number of oocytes retrieved per cycle (mean difference 
22.37; 95%CI  23.55 to 21.20; 11 studies; 3909 c ycles) in women with surgically treated stage I/II 
endometriosis  (Hamdan , et al. , 2015b ). In women with stage I/II endometriosis that did not have 
surg ery (or where it was not reported in the study), the review reported no differences in live birth 
rates , CPR or mean number of oocytes retrieved compared to women without endometriosis.  
Recommendations (55) 
Clinicians are not recommended to routinely  perform surgery prior to ART to improve 
live birth rates in women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis , as the potential benefits 
are unclear.   ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The evidence regarding surgery prior to treatment with ART in women with stage I/II endometriosis is 
of low quality and based on a single retrospective study. Although this study s uggests that surgery may 
have a beneficial effect on ART outcomes , the GDG considered more data are needed to confirm the 
benefit of surgery for peritoneal disease for improving ART outcomes, and to be able to recommended 
it in routine practice. A strong recommendation stating that l aparoscopy should not be routinely 
performe d prior to ART  with the aim of improving ART outcomes was formulated.

III.6.b. Surgery prior to MAR  in women with ovarian endometrioma  
Two systematic reviews and meta -analyses have evaluated the impact of endometrioma surgery on 
ART outcomes. Hamdan et al . have observed that surgical treatment of endometrioma before ART had 
no impact on live birth rate compared to conservative management (5 studies including 655 women) 
(Hamdan , et al. , 2015a ). Similarly clinical pregnancy rate, mean number of oocytes retrieved and 
cancellation rate per cycle did not differ between the two groups. However surgical treatment induced 
a reduced antral follicle count and required higher dose of FSH for ovarian stimulation  sugg esting a 
negative impact on the ovarian reserve .  
The second, more recent systematic review and meta -analysis also failed to demonstrate a significant 
beneficial effect of surgery on live birth rate (OR 1.08; 95%CI  0.80 to 1.45; 7 studies) (Nickkho -Amiry , 
et al. , 2018) .  
In women who had surgical treatment of one ovary, a lower number of oocytes was retrieved from the surgically treated ovary compared to the contralateral normal ovary without endometrioma in the same 
patient. (MD 22.59; 95%CI  24.13 to 21.05; 4 studies, 222 cycles) . The heterogeneity of data did not 
allow determining the effect of the size of the endometrioma) ( Hamdan , et al. , 2015a ). The influence 
of the size of unoperated endometrioma on ART response was evaluated in a prospective study – not 
included in the review - of 64 women with unilateral endometrioma (Coccia , et al. , 2014 ). A lower 
number of oocytes were retrieved from the ovary with an endometrioma compared to the healthy 
contralateral ovary. Endometrioma of ≥30 mm was shown to represent the most important negative 
factor associated with t he total number of follicles and oocytes retrieved.  
In a recent retrospective cohort study, ART outcomes were compared in a group of 26 women who 
underwent 44 ART cycles in the presence of ovarian endometrioma and a surgery group consisting of 
53 women who  underwent 58 ART cycles after laparoscopic removal of ovarian endometrioma(s). 
Cystectomy significantly increased the risk of cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response and/or 
failed oocyte retrieval 13.7% versus 0%) . There was no difference in the l ive birth rate  per embryo 
transfer  in both groups (23.7% versus 26.1%)  (Şükür , et al. , 2020 ). 
The effect of different surgical techniques has been evaluated only in small studies without showing a 
clear benefit for a specific approach. A meta -analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity 
between groups ( Hamdan , et al. , 2015a ). Cystectomy has the advantage of reducing the risk of 
recurrence (see chapter IV). A systematic review and meta -analysis evaluating the effect of 
sclerotherapy has shown a higher number of oocytes retrieved compared with laparoscopic cystectomy, with similar clinical pregnancy rates ( Cohen , et al. , 2017) . A recent retrospective study 
compared outcomes in 37 women who underwent ethanol sclerotherapy for endometrioma before ART with those in 37 women undergoing ART only. Ethanol sclerotherapy increased the chance of a live 
birth (OR 2.68; 95%CI  1.13 to 6.36) ( Miquel , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendations (56-57) 
Clinicians are not recommended to routinel y perform surgery for ovarian endometrioma 
prior to ART to improve live birth rates, as the current evidence shows no benefit and 
surgery is likely to have a negative impact on ovarian reserve.   ⊕⊕ 
   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  101 
Surgery for endometrioma prior to  ART can be considered  to improve endometriosis -
associated pain or accessibility of follicles.  GPP 
Justification   
Based on two systematic reviews and meta -analyses, surgical removal of endometrioma before ART 
does not appear to improve the live birth rate while it is likely reducing ovarian reserve. As such, a 
strong recommendation was formulated against surgery  with the sole aim to improv e ART outcomes. 
Additionally, a good practice point was formulated stating that surgery can be performed for other indications.  
When surgical resection of endometrioma prior to ART is necessary, no specific techniques can be recommen ded. Ovarian cystectomy has the potential of reducing the risk of recurrence.   
The c linical evidence and recommendations on surgery for pain in women with ovarian endometrioma 
are discussed in section II.3.e.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question III. 6) 
Research recommendation  (R18) 
RCTs are required to answer the question whether surgery for endometrioma prior to ART improves 
reproductive outcomes. A proposal for such study has been published (Maheshwari , et al. , 2020 ). 
III.6.c. Surgery prior to MAR  in women with deep endometriosis  
Surgical therapy for deep endometriosis is predominantly performed because of pain rather than 
infertility, hence randomised  studies focusing the direct effect of surgery on the reproductive outcomes 
of ART are non -existent.  
One prospective cohort study i n which women with deep endometriosis could choose between surgery 
prior to ART or ART directly reports higher pregnancy rates after surgery and ART (Bianchi , et al. , 2009) . 
However, the numbers of live births did not differ between groups.  
A retrospec tive matched cohort study comparing first -line surgery before ART with first- line ART in 
patient with colorectal endometriosis -associated endometriosis has observed higher cumulative live 
birth rates after surgery in the whole study population as well as i n women with good ART prognosis 
(<35 years old, AMH >2 ng/mL and no adenomyosis) as well as in women with AMH serum level <2 
ng/mL (Bendifallah , et al. , 2017 ).  
Further evidence can be derived from the review by Hamdan, comparing ART outcomes in women with 
ASRM stage III/IV attempting ART pregnancy after surgery versus women without endometriosis. This 
indirect evidence showed that women with surgically treated ASRM stage III/IV endometriosis had a 
lower live birth rate (OR 0.78; 95%CI  0.65 to 0.95; 3 studies; 2550 patients), lower clinical pregnancy 
rate (OR 0.53; 95%CI  0.33 to 0.84; 6 studies; 3470 patients,) and a lower mean number of oocytes 
retrieved per cycle (mean difference 22.46; 95%CI  23.42 to 21.51; 8 studies; 3 592 cycles) co mpared to 
women without endometriosis (Hamdan , et al. , 2015b ).  
Pregnancy and delivery rates after surgery for deep endometriosis in women with previous failed IVF cycles were evaluated in two retrospective studies. In 78 symptomatic infertile women with a mean of 
6.6 failed IVF cycles (including frozen cycles), 33 wom en (42.3%) had a live birth after deep 
endometriosis surgery (9% naturally and the remaining after ART) ( Soriano , et al. , 2016 ). In the second 
study including 73 infertile women with 2 or more unsuccessful IVF cycles, biochemical pregnancy rate  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  102 
was 43.8% after resection of endometriosis (83.6% of patients with stage III -IV) with a mean time from 
surgery to pregnancy of 11.1 months  (Breteau , et al. , 2020 ). In that group, 21.8% were natural 
pregnancies, 71.7% were obtained by ART and 3.1% by intrauterine insemination (data were missing 
for one patient).  
Recommendation  (58)  
The decision to offer surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART should 
be guided mainly by pain symptoms and patient preference as its effectiveness on 
reproductive outcome is uncertain due to lack of randomised  studies .  ⊕ 
Justification  
From the literature, there is no evidence from randomised  controlled trials to recommend performing 
surgical excision of deep nodular endometriotic lesions prior to ART to improve reproductive outcomes. However, these women often suffer from pain, requiring surgical treatment.  The GDG strongly 
recommends basing  a decision to perform surgery on pain symptoms and patient preferences. In 
symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis, surgical removal of the 
lesions m ay be (re)considered.   
More information on surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery and 
complication rates, is discussed in section II.3.f.

III.7. Non -medical treatment strategies  
PICO  QUESTION : WHAT NON -MEDICAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR INFERTILITY 
ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOS IS ? 
 
Flower et al . performed a systematic literature review looking at Chinese medicine post- surgically and 
were only able to include two studies. This review did not find any improvement  in pregnancy rates  
with the use of Chinese medicine ( Flower , et al. , 2012 ). 
Zhu et al . studied in a three -arm-trial the combination of laparoscopy with oral contraceptives (OCP) 
versus OCP with herbal medicines versus laparoscopy only. The OCP was administrated for 63 days, 
herbal medicine for 30 days, with a follow- up period of 14 months f or achieving pregnancy ( 12 months 
in the laparoscopy -only group). The herbal medicine and/or OCP treatment did not increase the chance 
of getting pregnant after surgery (pregnancy rates  (PR) 30.77% for OCP + herbal medicine, 38.46% for 
OCP, 46.15 % for lap aroscopy -only). The authors concluded that it is better to conceive straight after 
surgery (Zhu, et al. , 2014) . 
In another study by Ding et al . Chinese medicine was compared to hormon e treatment (12.5mg 
mifepristone orally every day) for six  months with a follow- up of one  year. The 80 patients were divided 
into two different groups “exactly according to the random principle” but is not described in detail. The 
study did not demonstrate any difference in pregnancy rate (52.5% with Chinese medicine versus 37.5% 
with hormone treatment) (Ding and Lian, 2015 ). 
Zhao et al . included 202 women with endometriosis, laparoscopically and histological verified  at six 
different hospitals in China . The  women were randomised through ‘central rando misation’ to either 
Chinese medicine  (CM) mixtures (two different types according to whether the woman was pre -or post -
ovulatory) or placebo  (with similar dosage, appearance, colour, weight, taste, smell, package and codes  
compared to CM) . Treatment and placebo where started  at 1 -5 days after surgery. The clinical 
pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) were significant increased in the CM group ( LBR: 34,7% 
(35/101) ) compared to placebo (LBR: 20.8% (21/101) ). This study is promising, b ut symptoms such as 
‘blood stasis’ and ‘Shen deficiency’ as well as the exact ingredients of the Chinese herbs may be difficult 
to apply in Western medicine.  
Mier -Cabrera et al . compared vitamin C and E with placebo and measured oxidative stress markers 
believed to be linked to fertility. However, there was no increase in the pregnancy rate (Mier -Cabrera , 
et al. , 2008) . 
All studies but Zhao et al . reported no harm, but the definition of “no harm” was seldom described and 
differed between the studies. Zhao et al . described that 48  adverse events occurred in 202 patients, of 
which 28 in the CM -group. Of these, only five cases of mild diarrhoea and on e case of nausea were 
considered to be related to CM.  
Conclusion  
Regarding non -medical strategies on infertility, there is no clear evidence that any non -medical 
interventions for women with endometriosis will be of benefit to increase the chance of pregna ncy. No 
recommendation can be made to support any non -medical interventions (nutrition, Chinese medicine, 
electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychological interventions) to increase 
fertility in women with endometriosis. The potentia l benefits and harms are unclear.  
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  104 
Justification  
Only small studies of low quality could be identified investigating surgery and medication and/or CM to 
improve subfertility.  
Though there is a lack of research specifically addressing the impact of non -med ical strategies in the 
treatment of endometriosis -related symptoms, more studies are emerging. It seems evident that 
patients are searching for alternative ways of managing and coping without or alongside surgical and 
pharmacological interventions.  
Resear ch recommendation  (R19)  
Adequately designed trials are needed to define the magnitude of the benefit of non -medical 
interventions (nutrition, Chinese medicine, electrotherapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychological interventions) in endometriosis -associated infertility . 
Further research into non -medical interventions for women with endometriosis that employ evidence -
based protocols with high intervention integrity is recommended.

III.8. Fertility Preservation  
PICO  QUESTION : IS ENDOMETRIOSIS AN INDICATION FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION (OVARIAN 
TISSUE / OOCYTES )? 
 
Patients with severe endometriosis, particularly bilateral endometriomas, are at high risk of premature 
ovarian insufficiency ( POI) and lower AMH levels. Surgical treatment can further impact on ovarian 
reserve and AMH levels. The relevance of pre -treatment AMH levels to predict the chance of future 
pregnancy or the need for fertility preservation is unclear, as studies reporting on this have made 
conflicting conclusions.  
A previous ESHRE guideline focusing on fertility preservation, considers that benign diseases could be 
an indication for fertility preservation, but it does not address whether endometriosis  in particular  is an 
indication for fertility preservation. That guideline did state that if AMH levels are measured in women 
with endometriosis, the levels should be assessed after surgery based on the significant negative impact 
surgery may have ( ESHRE Guideline Group on Female Fertility Preservation , et al. , 2020 ). 
A recent large retrospective study by Cobo et al . described the outcome of fertility preservation using 
vitrified oocytes in 485 patients with endometriomas of at least 1cm and an AFC of at least 3 and found 
oocyte survival rates after warming of 83.2% and a cumulative LBR of 46.4%. This led them to conc lude 
that fertility preservation is a valid treatment option in endometriosis (Cobo , et al. , 2020 ). Of 
importance is the high rate of women coming back to thaw their gametes (43%), although this does not 
equal  systematically recommending oocyte banking ( Somigliana and Vercellini, 2020 ). This high rate 
and the short period of time between storing and thawing (mean 1.5 years) suggest that a large 
proportion of the included women did not undergo proper fertility preservation but, conversely, the oocyte freezing was part of a strategy of in fertility treatment (Cobo , et al. , 2020 ). Further, a small 
retrospective study by Kim et al.  has shown that the number of oocytes retrieved was significantly lower 
in the patients with endometrioma undergoing fertility preservation compared with that in infertile 
patients without endometrioma (5.4 ± 3.8 versus 8.1 ± 4.8)  (Kim, et al. , 2020) .  
When ovarian stimulation is not possible or declined by the patient, and surgery is performed for large 
endometrioma(s), the preservation of ovarian tissue can be an alternative option for fertility 
preservation, although data in women with endometriosis are scarce (Donnez , et al. , 2018 ). 
Recommendation  (59) 
In case of extensive ovarian endometriosis, clinicians should discuss the pros and cons 
of fertility preservation with women with endometriosis. The true benefit of fertility 
preservation in women with endometriosis remains unknown.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Oocyte cryopreservation is expensive and exposes women to some clinical risks. Although the study of 
Cobo et al . shows the feasibility of fertility preservation (oocyte freezing) in women with ovarian 
endometriosis, still many questions (e.g. (cost- )effectiveness) remain unanswered, and there is 
currently insufficient data to support fertility preservation for all women with endometriosis. It is acknowledged that for some women with endometriosis, fertility preservation may increase their future chances of pregnancy, but there is no evidence on criteria to select those women.  Based on 
these considerations, the GDG f ormulated a strong recommendation for counselling and information 
provision.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  106 
For further advice on fertility preservation in women with benign diseases, the ESHRE guideline can be 
consulted (ESHRE Guideline Group on Female Fertility Preservation , et al. , 2020 ). 
Research recommendation  (R20)  
Studies should focus on identification of women with endometriosis who have higher chances of 
becoming infertile in the future due to endometriosis or endometriosis surgery (and/or who will need ART anyway). These women may have a true benefit from fertility preservation and this evidence would 
support a future recommendation supporting fertility preservation  in selected women with 
endometriosis.

III.9 Impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and pregnancy outcome  
NARRATIVE  QUESTION:  WHAT  IS THE  IMPACT  OF ENDOMETRIOSIS  ON 
PREGNANCY  AND  OBSTETRIC  OUTCOME?  
III.9.a. Effect of pregnancy on endometriotic lesions  
It is not uncommon for women with endometriosis to be advised that becoming pregnant might be a 
useful strategy to manage symptoms and reduce disease progression, as ‘pseudopregnancy’ induced  
through hormon e therapies has a positive effect on symptoms. However, the scanty low/moderate 
quality data available as reviewed by Leeners et al , show that the behaviour  of endometriotic lesions 
during pregnancy seems to be variable, ranging from complete disappearance to increased growth. 
Although endometriotic lesions in pregnancy may present a decidual reaction similar to changes in the 
eutopic endometrium, not all endometriotic lesions seem to deciduali se during pregnancy as atrophy , 
fibrosis and necrosis are also po ssible (Leeners , et al. , 2018 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016) .  
The deciduali sation of an endometrioma in pregnancy may in some cases resemble malignant ovarian 
tumours  posing a clinical diagnostic dilemma, although the true incidence of this phenomenon is 
uncertain (prevalence 0 -12%, 17 studies reporting 60 cases) (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
First- line management in these cases can be done by serial monitoring (with ultrasound, or MRI if 
necessary) and expectant management (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). When a malignancy is 
suspected a nd surgery is considered necessary, a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach is 
recommended not later than 23 weeks of pregnancy; these cases should be referred to a tertiary cent re 
with combined experience in gynaecology , oncology, gynaecologic ultrasound,  laparoscopic surgery 
and endometriosis ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ).  
This led Leeners et al . to conclude that pregnancy does not seem to systematically result in benefits for 
women with endometriosis, and women should not be advised to discontinue periodic evaluations 
and/or medical tr eatment after parturition  (Leeners , et al. , 2018 ). 
Recommendations (60-61) 
Patients should not be advised to become pregnant with the sole purpose of treating 
endometriosis, as pregnancy does not always lead to improvement of symptoms or 
reduction of disease progression.  ⊕ 
 
Endometriomas may change in appearance during pregna ncy. In case of finding an 
atypical endometrioma during ultrasound in pregnancy, it is recommended to refer the 
patient to a centre with appropriate expertise.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Although this is considered as a narrative question, recommendation s were formulated on safety 
aspects . Th e first strong recommendation is based on the evidence summari sed in high quality 
systematic reviews, showing a variable impact of pregnancy on endometriotic lesions. Patients are 
being advised to become pregnant to cure their endometriosis, and the data clearly indicate that this 
advice is incorrect. The GDG therefore considered it relevant and important to recommend that women 
with endometriosis should not be advised to become pregnant with the so le purpose of treating 
endometriosis.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  108 
For the second (strong) recommendation, there are data showing that endometrioma may change 
appearance during pregnancy, but that this is often unknown and not recogni sed. As this may lead to 
surgical intervention and termination of pregnancy, the GDG formulated a recommendation for referral 
to a centre with expertise.  
Research recommendation  (R21)  
Observational studies should be conducted to assess natural evolution of pre -existing endometrioma 
or other endometriosis lesions during pregnancy.  
III.9.b. Possible complications during pregnancy from a pre -existing 
endometriosis lesion  
III.9.b.1. Endometrioma  
Complications deriving from ovarian  endometriotic cysts, such as infected, enlarged,  and ruptured 
endometrioma, represent rare events but they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
pelvic pain during pregnancy ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). Conservative and observational 
management is mostly advisable, although surgery may be necessary in case of acute abdomen due to torsion or cyst rupture ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
III.9.b.2. Gastrointestinal  
Spontaneous intestinal perforation is a serious complication, requiring urgent surgical treatment. It has been hypothesi sed that extensive deciduali sation might weaken the bowel wall, or that adhesions 
might cause traumas during uterine growth (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 , Leone Roberti 
Maggiore , et al. , 2017 ). During and after pregnancy (mainly in the third trimester) in women with 
endometriosis, only a small number of cases have been described th at were located in the ileum, 
appendix, caecum, sigmoid and rectum ( Glavind , et al. , 2018 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
Non-specific symptoms (acute abdominal pain, nausea,  and vomiting) were experienced in 94% of the 
patients (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). Less than half of these cases had a preoperative 
diagnosis of endometriosis, and continuation of the pregnancy has been feasible (Glavind , et al. , 2018 ). 
III.9.b.3. Urinary system  
Uro(hemo)peritoneum is very rare: only 2 cases have been reported (Chiodo , et al. , 2008 , Leone 
Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2015 ). 
III.9.b.4. Uterus  
Spontaneous uterine ruptu re is also very rare and has been described in 3 cases, all with a history of 
endometriosis surgery. These ruptures were located in the posterior wall of the uterus at the lower segment level in all cases (Berlac , et al. , 2017 , Chester and Israfil -Bayli, 2015 , Fettback , et al. , 2015 , 
Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
III.9.b.5. Vascular: Spontaneous Hemoperitoneum in Pregnancy (SHiP)  
Although the aetiology  of Spontaneous Hemoperitoneum in Pregnancy (SHiP) is still mysterious, its 
occurrence seems to be increased in endometriosis. The bleeding arises from pelvic endometriotic 
implants or ruptured vessels most often situated on the posterior uterine surface o r in the 
parametrium. It occurs mostly in the third trimester of pregnancy (up to 42 days postpartum) and is 
associated with high maternal and perinatal morbi dity/ mortality (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016, 
Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2017 , Lier, et al. , 2017 ). Neither the stage of endomet riosis nor the 
previous surgical eradication of endometriotic lesions were associated with the severity of SHiP ( Lier, 
et al. , 2017 ). The usual clinical presentation includes acute abdominal pain, hypovolemic shock,  and  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  109 
signs of foetal  distress (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2017 , Lier, 
et al. , 2017 ) and leads in approximatively 94,5% of cases to emergency explorative laparotomy mostly 
combined with Caesarean section (Lier, et al. , 2017) . 
Conclusion  
Complications related directly to pre -existing endometriosis lesions are rar e, but probably under -
reported . Such complications may be related to their decidualisation, adhesion formation/stretching 
and endometriosis -related chronic inflammation (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). Although rare, 
they may represent life -threatening situations  that may require surgical management.  
Research recommendation  (R22) 
There is a need for prospective, well -designed studies to assess the impact of surgery on subsequent 
pregnancy evolution, disease phenotype and presence of adenomyosis on the rare complications  
observed during pregnancy in women with endometriosis . 
III.9.c. Impact of endometr iosis on early pregnancy (1st trimester)  
III.9.c.1. Miscarriage  
The systematic review of Leone Roberti Maggiore  et al . concluded that there was some evidence 
suggesting a possible association between endometriosis and spontaneous miscarriage, although the 
important methodological concerns regarding the included studies lead the authors to retain this as a 
controversial co nclusion  (Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
After this systematic review, other retrospective studies have been pu blished on the subject with 
conflicting results.  
Santulli et al . retrospectively compared previously pregnant women with (284) or without 
endometriosis (466) and their previous miscarriage rate: this was significantly higher in women with 
endometriosis compared with the controls (number of pregnancies : 139/478 [29 %] versus 187/964 
[19%], respectively). The same results were found in a subgroup analysis among women with or without a previous history of infertility (53 % versus 30%). Further, they observed that this association was 
consistent in a sub -analysis for differe nt endometriosis phenotypes (and somewhat higher for cases of 
superficial endometriosis) (Santulli , et al. , 2016) . 
Kohl Schwartz at al. , in a retrospective observational study found a higher miscarriage rate in women 
with endometriosis (35.8% ; 95%CI  29.6%  to 42.0% ; n=940 ) compared with disease -free control women 
(22.0% ; 95%CI  16.7%  to 27.0%). This difference was significant in the subfertile group women (50.0% 
[40.7% –59.4%]) vs. (25.8% ; 95%CI  8.5%  to 41.2%) , but  no difference appeared in the subgroup of fertile 
women (24.5% ; 95%CI  16.3%  to 31.6%) vs. disease -free controls (21.5% ; 95%CI  15.9%  to 6.8%). The 
higher miscarriage rate was observed in women with supposed milder forms (rASRM I/II 42.1% ; 95%CI  
32.6%  to 51.4% ) (Kohl Schwartz, et al. , 2017 ). 
In a large Scottish national population -based  cohor t study using record linkage to determine pregnancy 
outcomes in women with endometriosis versus controls, Saraswat at al., analysed  a cohort of 14 655 
women. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, parity, socio -economic status and year of 
delivery, the women with endometriosis (86/5375 ; 1.6%) compared to those without endometriosis 
(51/8240 ; 0.6%), presented a significantly  higher risk miscarriage with adjusted OR 1.76 ( 95%CI  1.44  to 
2.15) (Saraswat, et al. , 2017) . 
Finally, a more recent systematic review by Horton et  al. - focusing on the association of adenomyosis 
and endometriosis with fertility, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of women through both assisted  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  110 
reproduction and natural conception, as well as the impact of endometriosis disease subtypes on 
different st ages of the reproductive process -found an increased risk of miscarriage in both 
adenomyosis and endometriosis (OR 3.40 ; 95%CI  1.41 to 8.65 and OR 1.30; 95%CI  1.25  to 1 .35, 
respectively)  (Horton , et al. , 2019) . 
In conclusion, the data on miscarriage rate in women with endometriosis versus controls are somewhat conflicting, although most studies and systematic reviews observe an increased risk.  
III.9.c.2. Ectopic pregnancy  
Recently, Yong e t al., considering 15 st udies in a meta -analysis including both cohort studies and case -
control studies, observed, despite the high heterogeneity among studies, a possible evidence of an association between endometriosis and ectopic pregnancy (OR   2.16 to 2.66). There were insufficient 
data to make any conclusions with respect to anatomic characteristics of endometriosis ( e.g., stage) or 
mode of conception ( e.g.,  ART vs spontaneous)  (Yong , et al. , 2020) .  
Recommendation  (62)  
Clinicians should be aware that there may be an increased risk of first trimester 
miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Both miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy rate are increased in women with endometriosis versus 
controls, although this is based on low/moderate quality data.  Therefore, higher vigilance is required in 
case of symptoms suggestive of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, such as vaginal bleeding and 
abdominal pain in the first trimester of pregnancy  (strong recommendation).  
Research recommendation  (R23) 
Larger studies on the evolution of early pregnancy in women with endometriosis versus controls are necessary, particularly with more precise phenotyping including adenomyosis, the role of surgery prior to conception and the mode of conception.  
III.9.d. Impact of endometriosis on 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnancy and neonatal 
outcome  
There have been many studies in the literature showing an association between endometr iosis and 
adverse outcome of pregnancy (maternal, foetal  and neonatal) that are summari sed below, often with 
conflicting results. The overall low quality of the evidence, its extreme heterogeneity , mixed disease 
phenotype studied, potential association/con founding with adenomyosis, mixed modes of conception 
(non -ART and ART), choice of controls and methodology used should lead to a cautious interpretation 
of these findings ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016) . A selection of outcomes is discussed below.   
III.9.d.1. Gestational diabetes (GDM)  
In a systematic review and meta -analysis of 33 studies including 3280488 women, Lalani et al . reported 
higher odds of gestational diabetes (24 studies, OR  1.26; 95%CI  1.03  to 1.55) (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). On 
the contrary, a subgroup analysis (natural conceptions and ART pregnancies) could not confirm this association (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). Taking into account the modest effect sizes, the authors conclude that 
the findings are difficult to interpret considering  the observational nature of included studies. Indeed, 
other meta -analyses could not confirm this association  (Horton , et al. , 2019 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , 
et al. , 2016, Perez -Lopez , et al. , 2018 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  111 
III.9.d.2. Preterm birth / premature rupture of membranes  
Foetuses  and neonates of women with endometriosis were more likely to have premature rupture of 
membranes  (OR 2.33; 95%CI  1.39  to3.90 ; 7 studies ) as well as preterm birth (OR 1.70 ; 95%CI  1.40  to 
2.06; 23 studies ) (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). The latter association was also observed in both women with 
natural conception and ART ( Horton , et al. , 2019, Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). Despite these findings, it should 
be considered that the identified studies are characteri sed by marked differences in exposure 
categori sations, analytic approaches, disease phenotypes, potential confounding with adenomyosis, 
choice of controls and general methodological design, making it difficult to draw definite conclusions 
(Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016) . 
III.9.d.3. Placenta praevia  
Compared to women without endometriosis, a higher incidence of placenta praevia has been reported 
in women with endometriosis, despite the very different study designs employed (OR 3.3; 95%CI  2.37 
to 4.63 , 18 studies ) (Lalani , et al. , 2018 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). This association was 
consistent after subgro up analysis in natural conceptions and ART pregnancies (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). 
Horton et al.  made a similar conclusion (OR 3.09, CI 2.04 –4.68, 9 studies) ( Horton , et al. , 2019) . A 
possible explanation might be the abnormal frequency and amplitude of uterine contractions observed 
in women with endometriosis, leading to anomalous blastocyst implantation ( Kunz , et al. , 2000 , Leone 
Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). 
III.9.d.4. Hypertensive disorders and pre -eclampsia  
In a systematic review of 13 studies including 39816 pregnancies with endometriosis diagnosed by 
biopsy and 2831065 without endometriosis, Perez- Lopez et al . did not find any significant difference in 
the incidence of pre -eclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syn drome, nor they did any difference in 
pregnancies achieved spontaneously or by ART (Perez -Lopez , et al. , 2018 ). Leone Roberti Maggiore et 
al. also did not find an association betwee n endometriosis and hypertensive disorders / pre -eclampsia 
(Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). Different results have been reported by Lalani et al ., who found 
pooled results showing higher odds of pre -eclampsia (OR 1.18; 95%CI  1.01  to 1.39; 13 studies ), 
gestational hypertension and/or pre -eclampsia (OR 1.21; 95%CI  1.05  to 1.39  ; 24 studies ), without any 
significant difference between spontaneous and ART pregnancies (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). Horton et al.  
reported higher odds of pre -eclampsia (OR 1.18; 95%CI 1.03 to 1.36; 11 studies)  (Horton , et al. , 2019 ). 
III.9.d.5. Stillbirth  
Women with endometriosis were more likely to experience stillbirth (OR 1.29; 95%CI  1.10  to 1.52; 7 
studies) (Lalani , et al., 2018) , The OR for i ntra-uterine death was similar in the Horton paper (OR 1.25; 
95%CI 1.08 to 1.45; 5 studies) ( Horton , et al. , 2019 ). 
III.9.d.6. Caesarean  section  
The incidence of Caesarean section was  found to be higher in women with endometriosis who become 
pregnant (OR 1.86; 95%CI  1.51  to 2.29; 6 studies) (Lalani , et al. , 2018)   possibly due to the higher 
incidence of malpresentation and labour  dystocia observed in these women, as well as the potential 
influ ence of previous surgery on the mode of delivery  (Lalani , et al. , 2018 , Leone Roberti Maggiore , et 
al., 2016 ). Interestingly, endometriosis was not found to be associated with higher Caesarean section 
rate in pregnancies achieved by ART ( Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). The meta -analysis by Horton et al.  also 
reported an increase in Caesarean section rate (OR 1.98; 95%CI 1.64 to 2.38; 10 studies) in studies 
combining ART and natural conception pregnancies, and in studies reporting only on natural conception 
(OR 1.82; 95%CI 1.56 to 2.13; 2 studies) ( Horton , et al. , 2019 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  112 
III.9.d.7. Obstetric haemorrhages  (placenta l abruption , ante - and post -partum bleeding)  
The systematic review by Leone Roberti Maggiore et al.  did not observe an increased incidence of 
placental abruption or ante -partum haemorrhage  in women with endometriosis versus controls, Lalani 
et al . found an association between endometriosis and higher risk of ante -partum haemorrhage  (OR 
1.69; 95%CI  1.38  to 2.07 ; 5 studies ) but not placental abruption (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.98 to 2.19; 12 
studies)  (Lalani , et al. , 2018, Leone Roberti Maggiore , et al. , 2016 ). The risk of placental abruption was 
increase d in women with endometriosis in the other meta -analysis (OR 1.87; 95%CI 1.65 to 2.13; 8 
studies) (Horton , et al. , 2019) . With regards to post -partum haemorrhage , Lalani et al . and Horton  et 
al. concluded that the risk is not increased in women with endometriosis (both after natural and in ART 
conception) (Horton , et al. , 2019 , Lalani , et al. , 2018)   . 
III.9.d.8. Small for gestational age, admission to NICU, neonatal death  
Women with endometriosis were more likely to have babies small for gestational age  (SGA)  (intra -
uterine growth retardation [ IUGR ] <10th percentile) (OR 1.28; 95%CI  1.11 to 1.49; 19 studies ), neonatal 
death (OR 1.78; 95%CI  1,46 to 2.16; 3 studies), while the only difference of the subgroups of 
spontaneous vs ART gestations was only in the incidence of neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) 
admission (OR 0.81; 95%CI  0.28  to 2.36; 1 study)  (Lalani , et al. , 2018 ). Some evidence suggestive of 
endometriosis with IUGR has  been described in other systematic reviews ( Leone Roberti Maggiore , et 
al., 2016 ), while recently Horton et al . reported higher odds of neonatal admission following delivery in 
women with end ometriosis (OR 1.29; 95%CI  1.07  to 1.55; 5 studies ), but no increased risk of SGA 
(Horton , et al. , 2019 ). 
Recommendation (63) 
Clinicians should  be aware of endometriosis -associated  complications in pregnancy , 
although these are rare . As these findings are based on low/moderate quality studies, 
these results should be interpreted with caution and currently do not warrant increased 
antenatal monitoring or dissuade women from becoming pregnant.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
While several studies have reported a higher morbidity in 2nd/3rd trimester of pregnancy and delivery 
to be associated with endometriosis, these findings are based on low/moderate quality studies. The 
discrepancies between the meta -analyses, which are largely based on similar studies but use different 
inclusion criteria and divergent sub -analysis, limits the implications for clinical practice . Although 
clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, these findings do currently not warrant  increased 
antenatal monitoring in individuals with endometriosis, as studies on appropriate interventions for risk 
reduction are lacking.  
Research recommendation  (R24) 
Prospective observational studies are needed in pregnant women with endometriosis versus controls 
to better define obstetric risks for women with endometriosis and the potential usefulness of interventions to prevent them.

IV. Endometriosis recurrence 
Recurrence in endometriosis has been defined as recurrence of pain (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,  or 
pelvic pain), as clinical (pelvic fibrotic areas or tender nodules) or radiological detection of recurrent 
endometriosis lesions, surgically confirmed lesions  or as repeat rise of the marker CA -125 after surgery 
(Ceccaroni , et al. , 2019 ). Recently, recurrence was defined as lesion recurrence on reoperation or 
imaging after previous complete excision of the disease , with 4 subtypes:  
(1) Symptom based suspected recurrence: Symptom recurrenc e based on patient history, but not 
proven/confirmed by imaging and/or surgery  
(2) Imaging based suspected recurrence: Endometriosis recurrence based on imaging (in patients 
with or without symptoms).  
(3) Laparoscopically proven recurrence: Recurrence of visual en dometriosis without histological 
proof: during laparoscopy endometriosis is visually observed but either not biopsied or biopsied without histologically proven endometriosis.  
(4) Histologically proven recurrence: Recurrence of histologically proven endometrio sis: during 
laparoscopy endometriosis is visually observed and confirmed histologically  (International working 
group of AAGL ESGE ESHRE and WES , et al. , 2021 ). 
 
Endometriosis recurrence rates vary widely in the literature, ranging from 0% to 89.6% (Ceccaroni , et 
al., 2019 ). This variety can be attributed to different definitions, but also to the length of follow- up, the 
study design and the  sample size, the type and stage of disease, the type of surgery and the 
postoperative medical treatment ( Ceccaroni , et al. , 2019 ). 
Risk factors for recurrence include surgery -associated variables (presence and extent of adhesions, 
radicality of surgery) and patient- related factors (positive family history, lower age at surgery) 
(Ceccaroni , et al. , 2019 ). 
This chapter describes interventions aimed at prevention of recurrence, and the management of 
recurrent endometriosis.  
 
IV.1 Prevention of recurrence of endometriosis  
Interventions for secondary prevention are defined as those aimed at stopping or slowing the progress 
of the disease after the diagnosis has been established. In the context of this guideline, secondary prevention was defined as prevention of the recurrenc e of pain symptoms (dysmenorrhea, 
dyspareunia, non- menstrual pelvic pain) or the recurrence of disease (recurrence of endometriosis 
lesions documented by ultrasound for ovarian endometrioma or by laparoscopy for all endometriosis lesions) in the long -term (more than 6 months after surgery).  
 
PICO  QUESTION : IS THERE A ROLE FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE OF DISEASE AND 
PAINFUL SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS TREATED FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
IV.1.a. Surgical technique for prevention of recurrence  
In women operated on for an endometrioma (≥3 cm), clinicians should perform ovarian cystectomy, 
instead of drainage and electrocoagulation, for the secondary prevention of endometriosis -associated 
dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,  and non- menstrual pelvic pain (Hart, et al. , 2008 , Hart , et al. , 2005) .  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  115 
There are currently no studies allowing firm conclusions on the effect on recurrence for different 
surgical techniques for deep endometriosis .  
Recommendation  (64)  
When surgery is indicated in women with an endometrioma, clinicians should perform 
ovarian cystectomy, instead of drainage and electrocoagulation, for the secondary 
prevention of endometriosis -associated dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and non -
menstrual pelvic pain. However, the risk of reduced ovarian reserve should be taken into 
account.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Cystectomy is probably superior to drainage and coagulation in women with ovarian endometrioma (≥3  
cm) with regard to the recurrence of endometriosis -associated pain and the recurrence of 
endometrioma. A strong recommendation was formulated in favour of cystectomy. Whenever ovarian 
surgery is performed, the impact on ovarian reserve ( i.e., the risk) should be carefully considered 
against the benefit.  
Further information  
Details of the liter ature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question IV.1)  
IV.1.b. Medical therapies for p revention  of recurrence  
Hormon e treatment after surgery aimed at secondary prevention should be distinguished from 
adjunctive short -term (< 6 months) hormon e treatment after surgery aimed at improving the 
immediate outcomes of surgery. Postoperative adjunctive hormon e therapy within 6 m onths after 
surgery is discussed in section  II.4 Medical therapies adjunct to surgery.  
Two aspects are to be considered, the type of medical therapy and the subtype of endometriosis.  
IV.1.b. 1 Type of medical therapy  
In the review by Chen et al , data on long -term (13 -24 months) pain and disease recurrence are 
summari sed and considered relevant for the assessment of interventions aimed at secondary 
prevention  (Chen, et al. , 2020 ). The review reported uncertainty about the effect of postsurgical 
medical therapy (GnRH agonists or OCP) on pain recurrence compared to surgery alone (RR 0.70; 95%CI 
0.47 to 1.03; 3 RCTs; n=312). With regards to disease recurrence, the review showed that there may be 
a reduction of disease recurrence in favour of postsurgical hormone therapy (OCP, GnRH agonists, 
danazol) compared to no postsurgical medical therapy (RR 0.40; 95%CI 0.27 to 0.58; 4 RCTs; n=571).  
Another recent review  made a similar conclusion (based on similar studies) ( Zakhari , et al. , 2020 ), but 
also conducted an analysis per treatment (OCP, progestin, LNG -IUS and GnRH agonist) suggesting that 
the OCP had most overall benefit when compared to the other treatments.  
Hormonal contraceptives  
In the review of Zakhari et al ., a subgroup analysis for OCP showed a consistent decreased risk of disease 
recurrence, compared to controls (RR 0.32; 95%CI  0.23 to 0.44; 6 studies; n=854; fixed effect model). 
OCP was administered continuously in all but on e study ( Zakhari , et al. , 2020 ). 
A review focusing exclusi vely on postoperative OCP, showed that in women with surgically treated 
endometriosis, including ovarian cystectomy if an endometrioma was present, postoperative OCP for 
6 to 24 months can be effective for the prevention of endometriosis -associated dysmeno rrhea, but not  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  116 
for non -menstrual pelvic pain or dyspareunia. However, this effect is not sufficiently substantiated if 
postoperative OCP are used for only 6 months either cyclically (evidence not convincing) or 
continuously (evidence controversial) (Seracchioli , et al. , 2009) . Since both continuous and cyclic OCP 
admini stration regimens seem to have comparable effects, the choice of regimen can be made 
according to patient preferences. The protective effect seems to be related to the duration of 
treatment (Seracchioli , et al. , 2009 ). 
Progest ogens  
In women with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea receiving operative laparoscopy for endometriosis, 
recurrence of dysmenorrhea was lower in the group with a levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system 
(LNG -IUS) postoperatively than in the control group recei ving expectant management (Abou- Setta , et 
al., 2006 , Abou -Setta , et al. , 2013 ).  
A more recent meta -analysis on the topic incl uded 7 studies: 4 randomised  controlled trials with 212 
patients, 1 prospective cohort study with 88 patients, and 2 retrospective studies with 191 patients 
(Song , et al. , 2018 ). The meta -analysis showed that LNG -IUS was significantly effective in reducing pain 
after surgery (MD 12.97; 95%CI  5.55 to 20.39), with a comparable effect to GnRH agonist (MD 0.16; 
95%CI  2.02 to 1.70). LNG -IUS was also effective in decreasing the (pain and/or disease) recurrence rate   
(RR 0.40; 95%CI  0.26 to 0.64), with an effect comparable to OCP (OR 1.00; 95%CI  0.25 to 4.02) and 
danazol (RR 0.30; 95%CI  0.03 to 2.81). Furthermore, patients’ satisfaction with LNG -IUS was significantly 
higher than that with OCP (OR 8.60; 95%CI  1.03 to 71.86). However, vaginal bleeding was significantly 
higher in the LNG -IUS group than in the gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonist group (RR 27.0; 95%CI  
1.71 to 425.36).  
A retrospective study comparing postoperative treatment w ith dienogest (n=130), LNG -IUS (n=72) or 
no treatment (n=83), confirmed the efficacy of the LNG -IUS for postoperative pain control and 
prevention of recurrence (6, 12 and 24 months), but could not make a conclusion on the superiority of 
LNG-IUS compared to  dienogest (Lee, et al. , 2018) .  
In the review of Zakhari et al , a subgroup analysis for progestogen included a single small study showing 
a non -significant decreased risk of disease recurrence, compared to controls for (RR 0.17, 95%CI  0.02 
to 1.36, 32 patients) . (Zakhari , et al. , 2020 ). In a study by Trivedi et al, 98 patients suffering from 
minimal, mild, moderate or severe endometriosis, with or without infertility, who had undergone laparoscopy, were treated with dydrogesterone 10 mg/day (or 20 mg/day in severe cases) orally from day 5 to day 25 of each cycle for 3 to 6 months. Pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia improved significantly after the first cycle of treatment. By the end of the sixth cycle, the reduction in pelvic pain, 
dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia was 95%, 87% and 85%, respectively.  A total o f 21.1% of the patients 
were considered cured and 66.7% showed improvement ( Trivedi , et al. , 2007 ). 
GnRH agonists  
In the review of Zakhari et al ., a subgroup analysis for GnRH agonist reported a significant decreased 
risk of disease recurrence compared to controls  (RR 0.33; 95%CI  0.51 to 0.87; 7 studies; 929 patients ) 
(Zakhari , et al. , 2020 ).  
IV.1.b.2 Endometriosis subtype  
Although most studies and reviews on postoperative medical therapy evaluated its effect in an 
unselected population of women with endometriosis, few studies have specifically evaluated the 
benefit of medical therapies in women surgically treated for endome trioma or deep endometriosis.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  117 
Ovarian endometrioma  
In a review by Vercellini  et al. , two studies specifically evaluating the effect of postoperative hormonal 
contraceptives on endometrioma recurrence were summari sed (Vercellini , et al. , 2010 ). Based on the 
pooled res ults, the reviewers reported that a recurrent endometrioma developed in 26/250 women 
who regularly used oral contraceptive postoperatively (10%; 95%CI  7 to 15%) compared with 46/115 
who did not use oral contraceptive s (40%; 95%CI  31 to 50%), with a common OR of 0.16 ( 95%CI  0.04 
to 0.65) (Seracchioli , et al. , 2010 , Vercellini , et al. , 2008 , Vercellini , et al. , 2010 ). 
Another review summari sed the data for continuous versus cyclic postoperative hormone  therapy. In a 
meta -analysis of 2 studies, they reported endometrioma recurrence in 6/102 women with continuous 
use versus 12/103 women with cyclic contraceptive use (RR 0.53; 95%CI  0.22 to 1.31) (Muzii , et al. , 
2016 ). 
Deep endometriosis  
Available data about usage of hormon e treatments for prevention of deep endometriosis recurrence 
are less robust where as long -term administration of postoperative hormon e treatments seems to 
prevent recurrence of endometriosis -associated  symptoms (Koga, et al. , 2015) . The review refers to a 
single prospective study showing a n overall recurrence rate of 7% after surgical management of deep 
endometriosis  in 500 women with a follow- up of 2 to 6 years. The rate of recurrence was lower in 
women who conceived after surgery and used postpartum progestogens compared to those who had 
abandoned treatment but did not become pregnant ( Donnez and Squifflet, 2010 ). 
Recommendations (65-67) 
Clinicians should consider prescribing the postoperative use of a levonorgestrel -
releasing intrauterine system (52 mg LNG-IUS) or a combined hormonal contraceptive 
for at least 18 –24 months for the secondary prevention of endometriosis -associated 
dysmenorrhea.  ⊕⊕ 
 
After surgical management of ovarian endometrioma in women not immediately 
seeking conception, clinicians are recommended to offer long -term hormon e treatment 
(e.g. combined hormonal contraceptives) for the secondary prevention of 
endometrioma and endometriosis -associated related symptom recurrence . ⊕ 
 
For the prevention of recurrence of deep endometriosis and associated symptoms, long -
term administration of postoperative hormon e treatment can be considered.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Even if efficacy of OCP is documented for dysmenorrhea, it is not confirmed for non -menstrual pelvic 
pain or dyspareunia. Still, if they do not wish to conceive, women can use regular oral contraceptives 
for prevention of endometriosis  recurrence. For LNG -IUS, evidence shows a positive effect on 
postoperative pain, disease recurrence, and patients’ satisfaction after surgery for endometriosis -
associated pain.    
Still, there is no overwhelming evidence to support particular treatments over others with the a im of 
secondary prevention of the disease and of symptoms recurrence (in particular dysmenorrhea). 
Combined oral contraceptive s, preferably in a continuous regimen, and progestins can be considered 
feasible options as first- line treatments . For both OCP an d LNG -IUS, strong recommendations in favour  
of postoperative therapy were formulated. Still, the choice of intervention should be discussed and  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  118 
decided taking into account patient preferences, costs, availability,  risks and side effects.  When 
prescribing such treatment, their contraceptive properties should be considered and weighed against 
the wishes of the women to become pregnant.  
Although reviews and studies show a benefit of postoperative medical therapy for women with 
endometriosis,  data specified per subtype are scarce. For ovarian endometrioma, a strong 
recommendation in favour  was considered justified, while for deep endometriosis, only a weak 
recommendation could be formulated.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study  and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question IV.1)  
IV.1.c. ART and endometriosis recurrence  
The available evidence on the impact of ovarian stimulation on the progression of endometriosis or its 
recurrence was recently summari sed in a systematic review ( Somigliana , et al. , 2019 ). Based on  4 case 
reports and 12 observational studies, the review concluded that: ART does not increase the risk of 
endometriosis recurrence. Based on low to very low- quality  evidence and therefore less reliable, the 
reviewer further reported that (i) the impact of ART on ovarian endometriomas, if present at all, is mild, (ii) IUI may increase the risk of endometriosis recurrence and (iii) deep endometriosis might progress 
with ovarian stimulation.  
Recommendation  (68) 
Clinicians can perform ART in women with deep endometriosis, as it does not seem to 
increase endometriosis recurrence per se.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
Justification  
From a systematic review including moderate quality evidence, ART was not associated with an increased endometriosis recurrence rate, and therefore should not be withheld from women with 
endometriosis requiring ART to achieve pregnancy.  Patients with endometriosis can be reassured 
regarding the safety of ART.

IV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis  
PICO  QUESTION : HOW SHOULD PATIENTS WITH  REOCCURRING ENDOMETRIOSIS OR RECURRING 
SYMPTOMS BE MANAGED ?  IS REPETITIVE SURGERY EFFECTIVE FOR SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ?   
IV.2.a. Medical treatment for recurrent endometriosis  
Medical treatment of recurrent endometriosis after surgery has been described in few RCTs and 
uncontrolled observational studies.  
In an RCT, 242 women with recurrent pelvic pain within 1 year following laparoscopic surgery were 
randomised  to dienogest or depot leuprolide acetate . VAS scores for pelvic pain, back pain, dyspareunia 
or endometrioma size were significantly lower at 12 weeks follow- up, but there was no difference 
between the 2 treatment s for any of these outcomes . Dienogest and depot leuprolide  acetate showed 
a different side effect profile; fewer  hot flushes and vaginal dryness with dienogest, less vaginal 
bleeding and weight gain with leuprolide acetate (Abdou , et al. , 2018 ). 
Another RCT compared 6-month  treatment with desogestrel or OCP in 40 women with recurren t 
dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain after conservative surgery. Both treatments resulted in a significant 
decrease of VAS scores at 6 months compared to baseline. There was no difference between the 
treatments with regards to efficacy. Breakthrough bleeding was more often reported with desogestrel, 
while weight gain was reported with OCP ( Razzi , et al. , 2007 ). 
In the RCT by Vercellini and colleagues, 90 women with recurrent moderate or severe pelvic pain after conservative surgery for symptomatic endometriosis, were randomised to 6-month  treatment with 
cyproterone acetate or a continuous monophasic OCP ( Vercellini , et al. , 2002 ). The study showed no 
difference in efficacy for cyproterone acetate versus a continuous monophasic OCP. In both groups, 
about 70% of patients were satisfied with the treatment.  
In the study of Koshiba et al , dienogest  treatment immediately after recurrence was effective in 
controlling disease progression. The study consisted of a small cohort of 11 patients with 
endometrioma recurrence that received dienogest, of which 7 patients were followed up for 24 months 
and in f our of them (57.1%) complete resolution of recurrent endometrioma was achieved (Koshiba , et 
al., 2018 ).  
In the study from Lee  et al. , 121 women with surgically confirmed endometriosis and previous 
cystectomy  were  treated with dienogest (2  mg) at detection of recurrence of symptoms (dysmenorrhea 
or pelvic pain) (n=33) or disease (n=88) (new endometrioma of minimum 2cm) ( Lee, et al. , 2018 ). 
Dienogest was effective in reducing the size of endometriomas (2.74  ± 1.53 at 24 weeks versus 3.77 ± 
1.59 at baseline) and for symptomatic relief (VAS score 2.32 ± 0.95 at 24 weeks versus 5.01 ± 1.71 at 
baseline). Medical treatment for recurrent symptoms after medical treatment was described by 
Hornstein et al .  In a trial, 36 women with recurring endometriosis symptoms after 3 or 6 months 
nafarelin treatment were retreated with nafarelin (200µg twice daily for 3 months). The study reported improvements for dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, tenderness, induration,  and dyspareunia. Symptoms 
worsened after the end of the 3 months nafarelin treatment, but dysmenorrhea and pelvic tenderness 
remained improved compared to the start of retreatment (Hornstein , et al. , 1997) .  
   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  121 
IV.2.b. Surgical treatment of recurrent endometriosis  
To our knowledge, there are no studies reporting on the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment for 
recurrent endometriosis apart from one small, uncontrolled study. In the study by Candiani et al . 
surgery for recurrent endometriosis was performed in 42 women (Candiani , et al. , 1991 ). During a mean 
follow- up 41.8 ± 30.3 months, recurrence of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain were reported in 8 (19%) 
and 7 (17%) of the women, respectively. A third surgery was performed in 6 (14%) women after reappearance of symptoms or clinical signs. The study did not include a control group, and some 
patients received pre - or postoperative medical treatment.  
Specifically  for endometrioma, a small prospective study (n=11) showed that surgery for recurrent 
endometriomas is more harmful to healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserv e than first surgery as 
demonstrated by removal of larger ovarian tissue at histology and a trend towards lower AFC (3.5 ± 1.4 
after second surgery vs 5.1 ± 2.8 after the first surgery) at follow -up (3 months after surgery) ( Muzii , et 
al., 2015 ). 
Recommendation  (68)  
Any hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in 
women with endometriosis  ⊕ 
Justification  
Recurrence of endometriosis is a prevalent clinical observation, but yet, evidence specifically addressing 
are scarce and direct evidence of efficacy is only available for GnRH agonists  and dienogest. While 
acknowledging the lack of evidence, it should not be considered directive towards prioritizing certain 
treatments over others that have been shown effective in relieving endometriosis -associated pain. 
Therefore, the GDG recommends that any hormon e treatment or surgery could be offered. The 
benefits, risks and side effects of the differe nt hormon e and surgical treatments  are discussed in 
sections  II.2 and II. 3, respectively ( Healey , et al. , 2010 ). 
Even if treatment options are available, other causes for the pain symptoms  symptoms such as 
adenomyosis or pelvic floor dysfunction should be investigated, particularly if the recurrence of 
symptoms occurs soon after surgery..

V. Endometriosis and adolescence  
Limited evidence is available about endometriosis and adolescence. There are no large epidemiologic 
studies on endometriosis among adolescents.  
Dysmenorrhoea is a very common phenomenon in adolescents. I n different studies, the incidence of 
endometriosis in adolescents (defined as girls and young women under the age of 20 years) with chronic pelvic pain is reported to be ranging from 25 -73% (Brosens , et al. , 2013 , Shah and Missmer, 2011 ). The 
true disease prevalence in the general adolescent population remains unknown.  
As in adults, the pathophysiology of endometriosis in adolescents is largely unknown. Endometriosis 
has been described not only in post -menarch eal girls, possibly resulting of retrograde menstruation, 
but also in prepubertal but post -thelarch eal girls, suggesting multifactorial peripubertal aetiologies  of 
the disease in the adolescent population (Shah and Missmer, 2011 ).  
In this chapter, the evidence concerning diagnostic and treatment procedures of endometriosis specific 
for adolescents is summari sed.  
 
V.1. Diagnosis  
PICO  QUESTION : WHICH DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES SHOULD BE APPLIED IN  ADOLESCENTS WITH 
POSSIBLE ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
V.1.a. Diagnostic process  
In adults, the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosing endometriosis is reported to be approximately 7 years when onset of disease was in adults and more than 12 years if onset of disease 
was in adolescence ( Geysenbergh , et al. , 2017) . The diagnostic process in adolescents may be more 
complex and the awareness of endometriosis in adolescents in medical professionals and caregivers of 
adolescents is low. Greene and co -workers  showed in a study about the diagnostic experience among 
4334 women with surgically confir med endometriosis that women who first experienced symptoms as 
adolescents waited three times as long as those with symptoms first as adults (6 vs 2 years, p<0.0001), 
it took longer  before a diagnosis was made (5.4 vs 1.9 years, p<0.0001), and they were no t taken 
seriously (65.2% vs 48.9%, OR 1.95, 95%CI  1.69 to 2.24) or told that nothing was wrong (69.6% vs 49.8%, 
OR 2.26, 95%CI  1.97  to 2,59) more often than women experiencing first symptoms as adults (Greene , 
et al. , 2009) . 
V.1.b. Risk factors for adolescent endometriosis  
Conflicting results regarding family history, genital malformations,  and age at menarche as risk factors 
for adolescents to develop endometriosis have been described . A positive family history for 
endometriosis may ( Shah and Missmer, 2011 ) or may not (Vicino , et al. , 2010 ) be associated with 
adolescent endometriosis, genital malformations leading to outflow obstructions may ( Yang , et al. , 
2012 ) or may not (Vicino , et al. , 2010)  be present more often in adolescents with endometriosis, and 
early  age of menarche may (Brosens , et al. , 2013 , Geysenbergh , et al. , 201 7, Treloar , et al. , 2010)  or 
may not (Chapron , et al. , 2011 ) increase the risk of adolescent endometriosis.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  124 
Geysenbergh and co -workers  conducted a systematic review to develop a questionnaire in order to 
identify adolescents at risk to develop endometriosis. From five studies using questionnaires for 
identifying adult women with endometriosis, six questions were selected to pre dict the presence of 
endometriosis in adolescents. These questions were: age at menarche (earlier age at menarche is 
associated with greater incidence of endometriosis when comparing age at menarche of <10 to 12 years, 95%CI  1.0 to 1.8; p value test for tr end <0.001); cycle length (higher incidence of endometriosis 
in case of shorter cycle length during adolescence comparing cycle length <26 to 26 -31 days  (95%CI  1.1 
to 1.5); presence of dysmenorrhea; type of pelvic pain; presence of menstrual dyschezia; pre sence of 
dysuria. The authors state that this questionnaire should be pilot- tested and validated in a large 
population -based sample before it can be used for screening (Geysenbergh , et al. , 2017) . In a study 
aimed at finding risk factors for deep endometriosis, Chapron and co -workers  investigated 229 women 
with histologically confirmed endometriosis. They found that the following factors, present in adolescence, were mo re frequent in women with deep endometriosis as compared to women with 
superficial or ovarian endometriosis: a positive family history for endometriosis (p=0.02), non -
contraceptive use of oral contraceptives (p=0.001), and absenteeism from school (p=0.04) ( Chapron, 
et al. , 2011) . 
Recommendations (70-71) 
In adolescents, clinicians should take a careful history to identify possible risk factors for 
endometriosis, such as a positive family history, obstructive genital malformations, e arly 
menarche,  or short menstrual cycle.  ⊕ 
 
Clinicians may consider endometriosis in young women presenting  with  (cyclical) 
absenteeism from school, or with use of oral contraceptives for treatment of 
dysmenorrhea.  ⊕ 
Justification  
In adolescents, even more than in adults, there is a long way from onset of symptoms to a diagnosis of endometriosis To facilitate diagnosis or at least further investigation, studies have examined risk factors 
and signs in adolescents. Knowledge of these risk factors and signs in adolescents could facilitate the 
diagnostic process  and is therefore strongly recommended .  
Further information  
Details of the literatu re study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question V.1) . 
V.1.c. Clinical symptoms  
Unlike in adults, in whom diagnosis can be made based on pain or infertility, adolescents are most often 
diagnosed based on pain symptoms only.  
Some  authors state that adolescent endometriosis may be distinct from adult endometriosis. It has 
been speculated that endometriosis in adolescents may be more progressive than endometriosis in 
adults, and that clinical presentation of endometriosis in adolesc ents has a more varying pattern as 
compared to the presentation in adults. This assumption may be corroborated by the findings reported 
in a retrospective questionnaire study in over 4000 women with surgically confirmed endometriosis. Women with onset of s ymptoms during adolescence more frequently reported other symptoms over 
their lifetime compared to onset of symptoms as adults: having menstrual pain in combination with  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  125 
ovulatory as well as non -menstrual pain (71.7% vs 58.3%), heavy bleeding (63.5% vs 49. 3%), 
premenstrual spotting (37.2% vs 29.3%), bowel symptoms (99.4% vs 97.5%) and systemic symptoms 
including nausea/stomach upset or dizziness/headache during menses (55.2% vs 34.0%; p<0.0001 for 
all) (Greene, et al. , 2009) . 
DiVasta and co-workers  asked adults (n=107) and adolescents (n=295) with endometriosis about their 
endometriosis -related symptoms. No differences between adolescents and adults in severity of 
menstrual pain, taking medication for pain, and experiencing only some relief from hor mon e treatment 
for pain were reported. There were no differences between adults and adolescents in urinary and bowel symptoms. Adolescents more often experienced pain from menarche (p=0.002) than adults  although 
this may be influenced by recall bias . Both adults and adolescents experienced general pelvic pain. 
Adolescents experienced nausea with their pain more often than adults (p=0.004). From this study it 
was concluded that dysmenorrhea  and acyclic general pelvic pain are common symptoms of 
endometriosis  in adults as well as in adolescents, and that nausea in combination with pelvic pain 
should perhaps be considered a marker to raise suspicion for endometriosis in adolescents (DiVasta , et 
al., 2018 ). Resul ts of a study in which early menstrual characteristics in women diagnosed with 
endometriosis were investigated, showed that early dysmenorrhea may be a risk factor or an early sign 
of endometriosis ( Treloar , et al. , 2010 ). In a  small retrospective study among Italian adolescents with 
surgically confirmed endometriosis (n=38), all reported having chronic pelvic pain (Vicino , et al. , 2010 ). 
However, in a retrospective study among 65 Chinese adolescents in whom endometriosis was surgically 
confirmed, only 13/65 (20.6%) had chronic pelvic pain, whereas 45 women (69.2%) had cyclic pelvic 
pain. 19 women (29.2%) had acute abdominal pain, gastroi ntestinal symptoms (n=19, 29.2%), irregular 
menses (n=5, 7.7%), and dyspareunia (n=1, 1.5%) (Yang , et al. , 2012 ). In conclusion, whereas in adults 
dysmenorrhea is one of the leading symptoms, there may be a more varied clinical presentation of 
endometriosis in ad olescents.   
Recommendation  (72) 
In adolescents, clinicians should take a careful history and consider the following 
symptoms as suggestive of the presence of endometriosis:  
- chronic or acyclical  pelvic pain, particularly combined with nausea, 
dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dysuria, dyspareunia  
- cyclical pelvic pain . ⊕ 
Justification  
From the collected data, it can be concluded that a more varied pain pattern is seen in adolescents with endometriosis as compared to adults. Careful history taking and consideration of the differences 
between adult and adolescent presentation of endometriosis is  strongly  recommended.

Details of the literature study and evidence tables are  available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question V.1)  
V.1.d. Clinical  examination  
No evidence was found with regard to clinical examination in adolescents. Whether vaginal examination 
and/or rectal examination are acceptable in adolescents should be discussed with the adolescent and 
her caregiver and may be depending on age and cultural background . 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  126 
Recommendation  (73) 
In the absence of evidence for adolescents specifically, the recommendations for clinical examination 
in adults can be applied.    
- Clinical examination, including vaginal examination where appropriate, should be considered 
to identify deep nodules or endom etriomas in patients with suspected endometriosis, although 
the diagnostic accuracy is low.   
- In women with suspected endometriosis, further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be 
considered even if the clinical examination is normal . 
The GDG decided to formulate an additional good  practice point clarifying specific considerations in 
adolescents.  
The GDG recommends that before performing vaginal examination and/or rectal 
examination in adolescents, the acceptability should be discussed with the  adolescent 
and her caregiver, taking into consideration the patient ’s age and cultural background.  GPP 
V.1.e. Imaging  
Transvaginal ultrasound is a well -accepted diagnostic tool especially for ovarian endometriosis in adult 
women, but in adolescents, especially in adolescents with an intact hymen, transvaginal ultrasound 
should only be carried out after careful considerati on with the patient and her caregiver. Alternatives 
for transvaginal ultrasound may be transabdominal, transperineal or transrectal ultrasound. Based on 
the age and cultural background of the adolescent, the most appropriate method must  be selected.   
In their study about Chinese adolescents with endometriosis, Yang and co -workers  found a pelvic mass 
on ultrasound in 87.3% of women, indicating that ultrasound is a reliable method of diagnosing 
endometriosis in adolescents, but it was not clear whether trans vaginal or transabdominal ultrasound 
was used (Yang , et al. , 2012) . Martire and co -workers  conducted transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound 
in 270 adolescents having menstrual bleeding problems, endometriosis related symptoms or no 
symptoms at all. 13% of these had signs of endometriosis (signs of ovarian endometriosis 61%, 
adenomyosis 44%, deep endometriosis 28%, and in direct signs of adnexal adhesions 50%). The authors 
conclude that transvaginal and transrectal ultrasound can be used as a non -invasive  diagnostic test of 
endometriosis in adolescents ( Martire , et al. , 2020 ). Brosens and co -workers  suggest that transvaginal 
hydrolaparoscopy  may be helpful and less invasive than conventional diagnostic laparoscopy for 
diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents ( Brosens , et al. , 2013 ). However, transvaginal 
hydrolaparoscopy is not widely used.  
Recommendation  (74)  
Transvaginal ultrasound is recommended to be used in adolescents in whom it is 
appropriate, as it is effective in diagnosing ovarian endometriosis. If a transvaginal scan 
is not appropriate, MRI, transabdominal, transperineal, or transrectal scan may be 
considered.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
There is no direct evidence for the role of ultrasound in adolescents. In adults, transvaginal ultrasound 
showed good mean specificity and sensitivity for detection of ovarian cysts with reasonable confidence intervals and heterogeneity  (strong recommendation in favour ) (Nisenblat , et al. , 2016 ).   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  127 
In young women, especially  those with an intact hymen, a car eful approach is recommended, 
Transvaginal US may still be an option, but patients should be informed on what to expect, and which 
other options are available to them.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question V.1) .  
V.1.f. Laboratory parameters  
The usefulness of laboratory parameters in diagnosing endometriomas in adolescents was tested in a 
retrospective chart review in 267 women with endometriomas and 235 women with other benign 
adnexal cysts. Although significant differences were found in haem oglobin  levels, platelets, platelet- to-
lymphocyte ratio (PLR), platelet crit (PCT) and CA -125 between adolescents with endometrioma and 
adolescents with other benign cysts, the authors conclude that these parameters showed low diagnostic performance for de tecting endometriomas with AUC (Seckin, et al. , 2018 ). In a study with 
147 adolescents with surgically confirmed endometriosis and 10 controls, CA125 levels did not discriminate b etween cases and controls. Moreover, CA125 levels did not correlate with different pain 
types and severity (Sasamoto , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendation  (75)  
Serum biomarkers ( e.g.,  CA-125) are not recommended for diagnosing or ruling out 
endometriosis in adolescents.  ⊕⊕⊕ 
Justification  
In adults, clinicians are recommended not to use biomarkers in endometrial tissue, blood, menstrual or 
uterine fluids to diagnose endometriosis. In adolescents, data support the same conclusion for serum 
biomarkers, and hence assessment of serum biomarkers is not recommended (strong 
recommendation) .  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question V.1)  
V.1.f. Diagnostic laparoscopy  
Using diagnostic laparoscopy, endometriosis in adolescents may look different from adult endometriosis. In adolescents, there may be a predominance of atypical red or clear lesions as 
compared to adults (summari sed by (Shah and Missmer, 2011 )). In a review of 12 studies about the 
description of endometriotic lesions using r -AFS classification, differences between adults and 
adolescents are the presence of red, vesicular implants and the rarity of deep (>5  mm) or adenomyotic 
type of endometriosis in adolescents. Moreover, progression of disease in the adolescent seems to be primarily characteri sed by extensive adhesions and endometrioma formation (Brosens , et al. , 2013 ). In 
a retrospective clinical study of 38 women ≤ 21 years of age with surgically confirmed endometriosis, 
laparoscopic findings were: stage I: n=7 (18.4%), stage II: n=5 (13.2%), stage III: n=13 (34.2%), stage IV: 
n=13 (34.2%). Ovarian endometriosis was present in 40.6%, peritoneal in 29.7% and ovarian plus 
peritoneal in 29.7% (Vicino , et al. , 2010 ). In a retrospective analysis of 63 adolescents with 
endometriosis, 7.9% of women was diagnosed having stage I, 3.2% having stage II, 52.4% having stage 
III, and 36.5% hav ing stage IV endometriosis ( Yang , et al. , 2012 ). All rAFS stages of endometriosis can  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  128 
be present in adolescents, as well as peritoneal, ovarian,  and deep endometriosis, although the 
presence of deep endometriosis may be less frequent in adolescents.    
Recommendation  (76)  
In adolescents with suspected endometriosis where imaging is negative and medical 
treatments (with NSAIDs and/or hormonal  contr aceptives) have not been successful, 
diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Data in adolescents show that nearly two -thirds of adolescents with CPP or dysmenorrhea have 
laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis. Laparoscopy to confirm a diagnosis of endometriosis can be 
considered but  should be weighed against the risks of surgery an d postoperative complications and can 
be considered if other diagnostic options cannot be used or have failed, or if medical treatments have 
not been successful  (weak recommendation) . Diagnosis can also be confirmed through history and 
ultrasound, and trea tment should not be withheld for adolescents in which laparoscopic diagnosis was 
not (yet) performed.  
Clinicians should be aware that all forms of endometriosis have been found in adolescents, although 
some reports suggests that peritoneal endometriosis i n adolescents may have atypical appearance.

V.1.g. Histology  
PICO  QUESTION : SHOULD DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOMETRIOSIS IN ADOLESCENTS BE CONFIRMED BY 
HISTOLOGY ?  
 
In a systematic review, 15 articles were assessed in which in total 880 adolescents (defined as aged 
between 10 and 21 years, but within this range different age groups were included) underwent a  
laparoscopy (Janssen , et al. , 2013 ). Main symptoms leading to laparoscopic investigation in adolescents 
were chronic pelvic pain  (CPP) , CPP not responding to NSAIDs or oral contraceptives, or dysmenorrhea. 
The overall prevalence of endometriosis visually confirmed at laparoscopy in all patients in all studies 
was 62% (543/880; range 25- 100%). In girls with CPP resistant to treatment the preva lence was 75% 
(237/314), in girls with dysmenorrhea the prevalence was 70% (102/146) and in girls with CPP not 
resistant to treatment the prevalence was 49% (204/420). These differences between the subgroups 
were not statistically significant due to the la rge heterogeneity of studies.  
Other  studies  included in the Janssen et al . review  used  different classification system s. Considering  the 
ASRM classification, 50% of adolescents (175/349) had minimal endometriosis, 27% (69/259) had mild 
endometriosis, 18% (47/259) had moderate endometriosis and 14% (35/259) had severe 
endometriosis (Janssen, et al. , 2013 ). The overall prevalence of ASRM classified moderate to severe 
endometriosis was 32% (82/259) i n all girls, 16% (17/108) in girls with CPP resistant to treatment, 29% 
(21/74) in girls with dysmenorrhea and 57% (44/77) in girls with CPP. The authors concluded that nearly 
two-thirds of adolescents with CPP or dysmenorrhea had laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis, 
including moderate to severe disease in approximately one -third of those having endometriosis.  
The histological analysis of endometriosis biopsies was not documented or performed in 33% (5/15) of 
studies  (Janssen , et al. , 2013 ). If documented , histological confirmation rate was 93% (221/239), varying  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  129 
between 43 and 100% in the different studies. The authors advised to treat adolescents with 
dysmenorrhea or CPP with an NSAID, if necessary, in combination with hormonal  contraceptives. If pain 
persists after three to six months, they stated that a definit ive diagnosis was recommended,  and a 
laparoscopy was indicated to diagnose or exclude endometriosis.  
Recommendation  (77)  
If a laparoscopy is performed, clinicians should consider taking biopsies to confirm the 
diagnosis histologically , although negative histology does not entirely rule out the 
disease . ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Evidence shows that histological confirmation rate of suspected endometriosis at laparoscopy is high 
(93%). Also, varying patterns of adolescent endometriosis have been observed . Therefore, if diagnostic 
laparoscopy is performed, clinicians should consider to taking biopsies to histologically confirm the 
diagnosis  (strong recommendation) . Diagnostic laparoscopy with histology is expensive, but accessible 
and feasible.  
In performing histological assessment, it should be considered, as in adults , that negative histology does 
not entirely rule out the disease. This is covered in a good practice point.

V.2. Treatment  
PICO  QUESTION : WHAT IS THE BEST TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH (SUSPECTED ) 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
V.2.a Medical treatment  
High quality evidence about the efficacy of medical treatment of endometriosis in adolescents is scarce. 
The efficacy of NSAIDs or other analgesics in adolescents with endometriosis -related pain is not well 
established, because clinical studies have mostly been conducted in adult women.  
In a randomised  double -blind placebo -controlled study , 76 adolescents with moderate to severe 
dysmenorrhea were randomi sed between ethinylestradiol 20 µg/levonorgestrel 100 µg (OCP ) and 
placebo. OC P users reported a lower score (less pain) on the Moos Menstrual Distress Score (mean 
score 3.1 ± 3.2 versus 5.8 ± 4.5; 95 CI  difference  0.88 -4.53), lower worst pain (p=0.02) and a lower 
analgesic  use (p=0.05) after three months compared to the placebo group ( Davis , et al. , 2005) . 
Yoost and co -workers  investigated the effect on pain of the levonorgestrel containing intra uterine 
system (LNG -IUS). In a small retrospective chart study of 14 adolescents with histologically proven 
endometriosis, they showed that 13 experienced resolution of pain in the months after positioning the 
LNG-IUS. The results of this study have to be interpreted with caution, because almost all participants 
were using other hormon e medication together with the LNG -IUS to suppress endometriosis -related 
pain symptoms (Yoost , et al. , 2013 ). 
In a prospective open label study in 97 adolescents with clinically suspected or surgically confirmed 
endometriosis, the effect of dienogest on pain scores using the visual analogue scale (VAS), quality of 
life measured with EHP -30 and lumbar spine bone mi neral density (BMD) after one year were 
investigated. Mean VAS at baseline was 64.3 mm (SD 19.1 mm). After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean 
VAS score was 9.0 mm (SD 13.9 mm) and 81% of participants experienced a reduction in VAS of ≥ 30%. 
EHP-30 scores impro ved in all items assessed. Lumbar spine BMD decreased 1.2% (SD 2.3%) after one 
year , but partially recovered after six months . The authors concluded that dienogest is as effective for 
endometriosis -associated pain in adolescents as in adults , but the need for tailored treatment in the 
adolescent population is important (Ebert , et al. , 2017 ). 
Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonists are frequently used in adults having endometriosis 
related pain. Because of its wide range of short- term side effects including mood swings, hot flushes, 
weight gain, and long -term side effects, for example pr obably partly irreversible effects on BMD, they 
are predominantly prescribed after first line of hormon e treatment has failed. As adolescents are in the 
critical time window for the attainment of peak bone mass, it is particularly important to address this  
effect on BMD if GnRH agonists are considered for use in adolescents.  In a number of articles, the group 
of Gallagher and co-workers  have reported about their investigations on the effectiveness and safety 
of GnRH agonists in adolescents.  In a randomi sed, double -blind placebo -controlled trial, 50 adolescents 
with surgically confirmed endometriosis were treated for one year with GnRH agonists 11.25 mg/three 
months. Most of the participants had been treated with other hormon e medication before. Th ey were 
randomised  between add- back therapy consisting of norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily (NA) plus 
conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg daily (CEE) (combined add-back  group ), or NA plus placebo  
(progestogen add back group) . Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the SF -36, Menopause Rating 
Scale (MRS) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). After one year of treatment, QoL was improved in 
both groups as compared to baseline, whereas adolescents using GnRH agonists and combined add -
back had a better QoL than adolescents using GnRH agonists  with add -back of NA only. Scores on MRS 
and BSI did not change (Gallagher , et al. , 2017) .  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  131 
The same group showed in a similar study design in 65 adolescents that after 12 months total body 
bone mineral content and BMD had increased in the NA plus CEE group (bone mineral content +37g, 
p<0.001 and BMD +0.012 g/cm2, p=0.05), but not in those receiving NA plus placebo (bone mineral 
content p=0.19 and BMD p=0.95) (DiVasta , et al. , 2015 ). This suggests that with regard to BMD, GnRH 
agonists use is safe as long as add -back therapy is provided, preferably combined.  
Finally, a retrospective follow- up study was undertaken in the same study group, aimed at identifying 
short term, long term,  and irreversible side effects. Of 51 women who had been treated with GnRH 
agonists with the two different regimens of add -back (NA plus CEE or NA plus placebo) during their 
adolescence, 25 responded to the questionnaire. 96% reported short term side effec ts (during 
treatment); 80% reported long term side effects (lasting > 6 months after stopping treatment), and 45% 
reported side effects they considered irreversible, including memory loss, insomnia, and hot flashes. 
48% of adolescent women rated GnRH agoni sts plus add- back as the most effective hormon e 
medication for treating endometriosis pain. More subjects who received a combined add -back regimen 
versus standard one drug add- back would recommend GnRH agonists to others and felt it was the most 
effective hormon e medication (Gallagher , et al. , 2018 ). 
Recommendations (78-81) 
In adolescents with severe dysmenorrhea and/or endometriosis -associated pain, 
clinicians should prescribe hormonal  contraceptives or progestogens (systemically or via 
LNG -IUS) as first line hormone therapy because they may be effective and safe. 
However, i t is important to note that some progestogens may decrease bone mineral 
density.  ⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends clinicians consider NSAIDs as treatment for endometriosis -
associated pain in adolescents with (suspected ) endometriosis, especially if first line 
hormone treatment is not an option.  GPP  
 
In adolescents with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and associated pain in 
whom hormonal  contraceptives or progestogen therapy failed, clinicians may consider 
prescribing GnRH agonists for up to 1 year, as they are effective and safe when combined 
with add -back therapy.  ⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that in young women and adolescents, if GnRH agonist treatment 
is considered, it should be used only after careful consideration and discussion of 
potential side effects and potential long -term health risks with a practitioner in a 
secondary or tertiary care setting.  GPP  
Justification  
Studies on the medical treatment of endometriosis -associated pain are mostly performed in adults. In 
adolescents, we summari sed studies evaluating the use of oral contraceptives, progestogens,  and GnRH 
agonists, from which it can be concluded, also considering indirect data from adults, that these 
treatments are effective and safe . Considering the possible side effects with regards to BMD and other 
long term health risks, the GDG recommends prescribing  oral contraceptives or progestogens as first 
line (strong recommendation) , and GnRH agonist as second line treatment (weak recommendation) .   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  132 
Although there are no studies evaluating NSAIDs in adolescents with endometriosis -associated pain, 
data fr om adults and clinical expertise support a good practice point to consider recommending NSAIDs 
as an additional treatment option.

V.2.b Surgical treatment  
In two studies, symptom relief after surgery was described as well as recurrence of symptoms (Roman, 
2010 , Yeung , et al. , 2011) . In a p rospective observational case series, 17 adolescents with rASRM stage 
I-III endometriosis underwent complete laparoscopic excision of all present endometriosis. 
Dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, constipation, tender examination, painful exercise, intestinal crampin g, and 
bladder pain decreased significantly after surgical treatment. After a follow- up period of in average 23.1 
months (max 66 months), 8/17 (47.1%) had a subsequent laparoscopy for persistent pain, but in none 
of these patients endometriosis was found v isually or histologically at re peat laparoscopy (Yeung , et al. , 
2011 ). Lower numbers of recurrent symptoms were found in a  comparative cohort study of 20 
adolescents with rASRM stage I to IV endometriosis undergoing electrical excision of endometriosis (all 
patients), and additional ovarian cystectomy (2/20 patients, 10%). Dysmenorrhea  and pelvic pain 
symptoms decreased signi ficantly and quality of life increased after surgery. 2/20 (10%) adolescents 
underwent a second laparoscopy because of pain within two years after first surgical treatment, but no 
recurrent endometriosis was found ( Roman, 2010 ). 
In two other studies there was a focus on recurrence of endometriosis, but not on initial symptom relief 
after surgery (Lee, et al. , 2017, Tandoi , et al. , 2011 ). In a study of Lee and co-workers , recurrence after 
laparoscopic ovarian endometriosis cyst enucleation was investigated. Recurrence was defined as the 
sonographic presence of a cyst mass ≥20 mm after initial surgery. After follow- up of 47.3 ( ±44.3 ; 3-161) 
months, 17 (16.2%) adolescents had a cyst recurrence. Based on individual preference, some 
adolescents used OCP or GnRH agonist after surgery, with a mean duration of 5.5 ( ± 1.6) months. The 
use of postoperative hormon e suppression therapy was not a risk factor for recurrence, and no other 
risk factors were identified (Lee, et al ., 2017 ). Recurrence rates, defined as endometriosis related 
symptoms or ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian or pelvic endometriosis after initial surgery, were 
reported in a retrospective cohort stud y of Tandoi et al . Fifty -seven  adolescents (rASRM I /II 14 (24%), 
rASRM stage III/ IV 43 (76%)) underwent conservative laparoscopic or laparotomic surgery for 
endometriosis and had a follow- up of at least five years. 32 adolescents experienced a recurrence (56%, 
95%CI  43 to 68%). Part of the adolescents used OC P after surgery: 27 (47%) did not use OCP , 14 (25%) 
used OCP during less than 12 months, 16 (28%) longer than 12 months. No risk facto rs for recurrence 
were identified ( Tandoi , et al. , 2011 ). 
Recommendations (82-83) 
In adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians may consider surgical removal of 
endometriosis lesions to manage endometriosis -related symptoms . However , symptom 
recurrence rates may be considerable, especially when surgery is not followed by 
hormone treatment.  ⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that if surgical treatment is indicated in adolescents with 
endometriosis, it should be performed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon, and, 
if possible, complete laparoscopic removal of all present endometriosis should be 
performed.  GPP  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  133 
Justification  
Only small studies providing low quality evidence were identified about surgical treatment of 
endometriosis in adolescents, therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution (Lee, et al. , 
2017 , Roman, 2010 , Tandoi , et al. , 2011, Yeung , et al. , 2011 ). The studies summari sed evidence with 
regards to the relief of painful symptoms, but also on the recurrence rates. Overall, based on limited 
data, laparoscopy seems to be temporarily beneficial for pain relief. However, in a decision to proceed to surgery, the risks of surgery and postoperative complications, and considerable recurrence rates 
should be considered against the relative benefit of surgical treatment.

V.2.c Combined medical and surgical treatment.  
Seo et al . studied the effect of long -term treatment with GnRH agonists  and OCP after conservative 
surgery  for endometriosis in 34 adolescents. In this retrospective cohort study, adolescents underwent 
adhesiolysis, stripping and enucleation of ovarian cysts, excision of concurrent deep endometriosis and 
fulguration of peritoneal endo metriosis. Post -surgery, patients were treated with GnRH agonists  for 5.4 
± 1.2 months and subsequently with OCP during 47.9 ± 29.3 months. Recurrence, defined as 
sonographically observed presence of ovarian cysts ≥ 2 cm, was present in 2/34 (5.8%) of adole scents 
after a median of 41 (6 -159) months (Seo, et al. , 2017 ). 
Doyle and co-workers  investigated how endometriosis rASRM s tages developed in time in a population 
of 90 adolescents with rASRM stages I /III. They had persistent endometriosis symptoms after medical 
treatment for endometriosis and therefore underwent laparoscopy including lesion destruction by CO 2 
laser or electrocautery and adhesiolysis. After surgical treatment adolescents were treated by OC P 
(82/90, 91%), progestogen  (11/90, 12%) and/or GnRH agonists  plus add- back (70 /90, 78%). A second 
laparoscopy was performed because of increasing pain despit e medical treatment after 29 (6 -112) 
months. In 63 adolescents (70%), the same rASRM stage was found, in 17 (19%), the rASRM stage improved one stage, in 1 (1%) rASRM improved two stages, and in 9 (10%), rASRM stage worsened one 
stage. The authors conclude d that after combined surgical and hormon e treatment, progression of 
disease may be retarded in adolescents. However, in this study all adolescents underwent a second 
laparoscopy because of increasing pain symptoms despite the use of hormone  treatment (Doyle , et al. , 
2009 ). 
Recommendation  (84)  
In adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians should consider postoperative hormone 
therapy, as this may suppress recurrence of symptoms .  ⊕ 
Justification  
The recommendation to consider postoperative hormon e therapy is based on two  retrospective studies 
showing benefit in adolescents on recurrence and disease progression  (Doyle , et al. , 2009, Seo, et al. , 
2017 ). The combination of surgical and medical treatment is expensive, but it is  highly accepted by 
patients and doctors, and in line with management in adults. A strong recommendation in favour of 
postoperative hormon e therapy was formulated.

V.3. Fertility  preservation  
PICO  QUESTION : IS ENDOMETRIOSIS IN ADOLESCENTS AN INDICATION FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION 
(OVARIAN TISSUE /OOCYTES ) ?  
 
There is a lack of robust evidence concerning the usefulness of fertility preservation in women with 
endometriosis, let alone adolescents with endometriosis. Data about women with endometriosis who actually underwent fertility preservation are very scarce. Women with endometriosis may benefit from 
fertility preservation as they have an increased risk of premature ovarian exhaustion, and 
approximately half of them will face subfertility.  
In opinion papers by Somigli ana et al . and by Carillo et al ., it was speculated that for those with bilateral 
ovarian endometriomas and those operated unilaterally with a contralateral recurrence, fertility 
preservation may be particularly indicated (Carrillo , et al. , 2016 , Somigliana , et al. , 2015 ). The role of a 
woman’s age needs specific attention, as young women may have a larger risk of recurrence, and they 
are more likely to postpone pregnancy. In younger women, it is expected that the quality of the banked 
oocytes or ovarian fragments will be higher than in older women (Somigliana , et al. , 2015 ). 
In a large retrospective cohort study, 485 out of 1044 (46.5%) women with endometriosis who had 
vitrified oocytes returned for fertility treatment. Their mean age was 35.7 ± 3.7 years, they had 7.1 ±  
6.5 retrieved o ocytes per cycle, and storage time was 1.7 ± 0.4 years. Cumulative live birth rate  (CLBR) 
per patient was 46.4%. It was statistically higher in women ≤  35 years of age as compared to women > 
35 years. Women ≤ 35 years who had not undergone ovarian surgery before fertility preservation had 
a higher CLBR than women who underwent unilateral surgery and women who underwent bilateral 
surgery, respectively. In  women older than 35 years, surgery had no influence on CLBR. Based on these 
results, the authors suggest that fertility preservation  may be beneficial for women with endometriosis 
and that if fertility preservation  is considered in young women with endome triosis,  it should be done 
before ovarian surgery is carried out ( Cobo , et al. , 2020) .  
Clinical, logistic,  and financial aspects need to be further investigated before fertility preservation can 
be advised for adolescents with endometriosis.  
Recommendations (85-86) 
The GDG recommends that adolescents with endometriosis are informed of the 
potential detrimental effect of ovarian endometriosis and surgery on ovarian reserve 
and future fertility.  GPP 
 
Fertility preservation options exist and the GDG recommends that adolescents are 
informed about them, although the true benefit, safety,  and indications in adolescents 
with endometriosis remain unknown.  GPP 
Justification  
There are no studies evaluating the efficacy , or relevance of fertility preservation, namely oocyte 
cryopreservation, in adolescents with endometriosis. Data in adults are scarce as well  (see section III.8) . 
Still, clinicians can discuss fertility preserva tion in selected patients, such as those at risk of ovarian 
damage, which can include, but are not limited to, those with bilateral ovarian endometriomas or those with unilaterally operated endometrioma with a contralateral recurrence . Individual counselli ng may 
be offered taking into account age, risk of premature ovarian insufficiency because of the presence of  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  136 
endometriomas per se or because of surgery, and the success rates and risks of fertility preservation. If 
fertility preservation  is carried out in  young women ( ≤35 years), it is suggested that fertility preservation 
precedes ovarian surgery. However, u ntil now it is unclear how to identify  women who will benefit from 
fertility preservation  to render oocyte vitrification cost beneficial.

VI. Endometriosis and menopause  
Due to the steroid -dependent nature of the disease , most women with endometriosis experience 
regression of disease after menopause. Still, a number of women experience endometriosis -related 
symptoms after natural or surgical menopause ( i.e., after bilateral oophorectomy). Additionally, women 
with a history of endometriosis may experience worsening of symptoms and reactivation of residual 
disease with the  use of hormon e therapies aimed at relieving postmenopausal complaints.  
This chapter explores the connection between endometriosis and menopause, discussing whether endometriosis can still be active after menopause and whether women  with a history of endom etriosis  
are at higher risk of experiencing menopause -related major health concerns. Furthermore, the 
treatment of postmenopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis, and surgical 
treatment of endometriosis in postmenopausal women are discuss ed.   
VI.1. Endometriosis in postmenopausal women  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : IS ENDOMETRIOSIS STILL ACTIVE AFTER MENOPAUSE ?  
 
There exist only very scarce data on the prevalence of endometriosis after menopause. In four narrative 
reviews, the incidence of endometriosis in postmenopausal women was estimated to range from 2 -5% 
(Bendon and Becker, 2012 , Oxholm , et al. , 2007, Polyzos , et al. , 2011 , Streuli , et al. , 2017 ), referring 
primarily to three, very old articles ( Henriksen, 1955 , Punnonen, et al. , 1980 , Ranney, 1971 ). A more 
recent retrospective cohort study also described a 4% prevalence of postmenopausal endometriosis 
(Matalliotakis , et al. , 2019) . Because endometriosis is a  steroid dependent  disease, menopausal 
hormone therapy ( MHT ) is believed to stimulate the growth of endometriosis, especially estrogen -only 
therapies , although it is also described  in women receiving combined MHT  (Gemmell , et al. , 2017 ). 
However, endometriosis has also been reported in postmenopausal women wh o do not use hormone 
therapy, which underlines the complex pathogenesis of this disease.  Whether this is a result of extra -
ovarian estrogen production ( e.g., skin, fat tissue etc.) or lesion -specific production of estrogen due to 
local overexpression of aromatase and other steroidogenic genes and proteins is currently unclear  
(Attar a nd Bulun, 2006 , Noble , et al. , 1996 ). 
Conclusion  
Clinicians should be aware that endometriosis can still be active /symptomatic  after menopause.

VI.2. Treatment of endometriosis in postmenopausal women  
Regarding treatment of symptoms in postmenopausal women one should keep in mind the potential 
increased risk of underlying malignancy in this population and the uncertainty of the diagnosis, as pain 
symptoms may present differently in this group of women c ompared to premenopausal women.  
 
PICO  QUESTION : IS SURGICAL TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AND SAFE IN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
 
One should keep in mind the potential risk of underlying malignancy and the uncertainty of the 
diagnosis when postmenopausal women present with (chronic) pelvic pain. Hormone therapy approaches are more limited compared to premenopausal women due to the low systemic estrogen 
levels. Therefore, in review articles on this subject , it is suggested that first line tre atment for 
endometriosis in postmenopausal patients should be surgical ( Oxholm , et al. , 2007 , Pavone and Bulun, 
2012 , Polyzos , et al. , 2011 ). Also, there are very little options available for medical treatment - besides 
using analgesics or aromatase inhibitors (see  below) - due to the naturally low levels of estrogen in 
postmenopausal women.
  
VI.2.a. Surgical treatment  
We identified five cohort studies on surgery in postmenopausal endometriosis patients: three studies 
described a cohort of postmenopausal women who presented with pain and subsequently underwent 
surgery whilst two retrospective cohort studies reported on women in whom endometriosis was 
identified based on histology.   
VI.2.a.1. Efficacy of surgery in postmenopausal women  
A prospective cohort by Redwine et al.  included 75 women with previous bilateral salpingo -
oophorectomy ( BSO) who received excision of histologically confirmed  endometriosis as treatment for 
pain (Redwine, 1994 ). The control group consisted of women with biopsy -proven endometriosis who 
did not have previous BSO, hysterectomy or ovarian remnant syndrome.  Women treated surgically for 
endometriosis following BSO were significantly o lder (37.8  ± 8.1 versus 31.3 ± 6.9 years ; p<0.001)  and 
tended to have intestinal involvement (risk ratio 2.3, 95%CI  1.5 to 3.5 ). Most women had a marked 
alleviation of pain after excision of endometriosis, although only 13 patients underwent a re -operation 
due to pelvic pain. No malignancy was found in this study.  
Behera et al.  described a retrospective cohort of 124 women with c hronic pelvic pain after 
hysterectomy and BSO (Behera , et al. , 2006) . They all underwent laparoscopy and if any abnormalities 
were visuali sed, they were resected. The most common histopathologic findings included adhesions (in 
94% of patients), adnexal remnants (26%), and endometriosis (15%). Laparoscopic treatment of a ny 
pelvic pathologic condition improved pain symptoms in the majority of women (58.9%)  (follow- up of 
less than one to six years) . In 2 women (1.4%) a malignancy of the bowel was found.  
Clayton et al.  described a case series of five women with recurrent pain after BSO and hysterectomy 
who had residual endometriosis managed by laparoscopic excision ( Clayton , et al. , 1999 ). Four of the 
women had bowel endometriosis. Immunohistochemistry showed positive immunoreactivity fo r 
estrogen and progesterone receptors in all patients, suggesting that the endometriosis was active and responsive to exogenous estrogen. The women had improved pain symptoms at 4 months after surgery  
(one patient was lost to follow- up).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  140 
VI.2.a.2. Risk of malignant transformation in postmenopausal women  
Consideration of the possibility of malignancy should be taken in postmenopausal  women with 
endometriosis irrespective of symptoms. This may require transvaginal ultrasound scan or MRI or 
further imaging studies and/or the surgical exploration of the area.  
A retrospective cohort study identified 72 postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed 
endometriosis, of which 57 had endometriomas ( Morotti , et al. , 2012) . In 35% of these endometriomas 
a (pre)malignancy was found. Only 14 women (16.7%) had a previously known history of endometriosis. 
The indications for surgery were ovarian cyst (31 patients, 43.0 %), ovarian or endometrial (pre)cancer (25 patients, 35 %), or other, mostly benign indications. In none of the women pain was the indication 
for surgery.  
Sun et al.  described a retrospective  cohort study of postmenopausal patients in whom endometriosis 
was histologically  confirmed (Sun, et al. , 2013 ). Of these 69 women, 45 (65%) were referred with an 
abdominal mass without symptoms, only 8 women presented with abdominal pain. In 62 women an 
endometrioma was found and 10 women (14%) had a coexisting ovarian, endometrial,  or cervical 
malignancy.  
In conclusion, there is not enough data to accurately estimate the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal 
women with a history of endometriosis , as data are mainly based on  surgically -induced menopause. 
Women after natural menopause are generally older, and  consequently their general risk of malignancy 
will be higher. The risk of malignancy in ( premenopausal ) women with endometriosis is covered in 
Chapter X (Endometriosis and Cancer) .  
Recommendations  (87-88) 
Clinicians may consider surgical treatment for postmenopausal women presenting with 
signs of endometriosis and/or pain to enable histological confirmation of the diagnosis 
of endometriosis.  ⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that clinicians acknowledge the uncertainty towards the risk of 
malignanc y in postmenopausal women . If a pelvic mass is detected, the work -up and 
treatment should be performed according to national oncology guidelines.   GPP 
Justification  
The available, poor quality evidence from cohort studies show that surgical treatment can improve pain 
in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. In postmenopausal women with endometriosis, and 
specifically endometrioma, there seems to be a significant pr oportion with concordant malignancy. The 
GDG suggests (weak recommendation) to consider laparoscopy to treat pain and enable confirmation 
of the diagnosis of endometriosis.  
There are no data on complications of surgery in postmenopausal women, but surgery for 
endometriosis is considered a relatively safe procedure (see section  II.3.a). The benefits of surgical 
treatment with regards to pain symptoms and to reduce the risk of future malignancy, seem to outweigh the possible complications of surgery.

VI.2.b. Medical treatment  
In cases where surgery is not feasible , or symptoms persist or recur after surgery , medical treatment of 
endometriosis -associated symptoms may be indicated. However, similar to surgery, there is very little 
data on medical treatment for endometriosis in postmenopausal women.  
Estrogen is  considered to be  one of the predominant drivers of endometr iotic growth. As such, in 
postmenopausal women on MHT , one of the first therapeutic steps should be to discontinue MHT  
whilst considering the likely recurrence of menopausal vasomotor symptoms.  
Theoretically, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are able  to block e xtraovarian estrogen production which  is 
the main estrogen source for postmenopausal women. In addition, P450 aromatase  - the central 
enzyme converting androgens into estrone and estradiol  - appears to be overexpressed in 
endometriotic tissue, although no data are available in tissue from postmenopausal women  (Pavone 
and Bulun, 2012 ).AIs have been shown effective to reduce endometriosis -associated pain in 
premenopausal women with severe endometriosis (see also section II.2.e). Specifically in 
postmenopausal women`, only case reports on treatment with AIs are available. Two reviews des cribe 
six case reports to date, which mention that the administration of an AIs for 4 -18 months improved 
pain and reduced the size of endometriotic lesions  (Pavone and Bulun, 2012 , Polyzos , et al. , 2011) . One 
patient reported hot flushes and in one case AI -associated bone loss after nine months of treatment 
with anastrozole was reported. Although data are very li mited, AIs represent a medical alternative to 
surgery for the treatment of postmenopausal endometriosis.  
Recommendation  (89) 
For postmenopausal women with endometriosis -associated pain, clinicians may 
consider aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option especially if surgery is not feasible . ⊕ 
Justification  
Although evidence is limited to case reports  in postmenopausal women, the efficacy of AIs can be 
deduced from studies in premenopausal women. Based on the biological aspects, AIs are probably the 
most appropriate medical treatment for endometriosis -related pain symptoms in postmenopausal 
women and could be considered a treatment option, for instance when surgery is not feasible , contra -
indicated,  or when surgery was insufficient to res olve symptoms  (weak recommendation) .  
Research recommendation  (R25) 
More evidence is need ed on the efficacy and safety (bone health) of aromatase inhibitors or other 
medical treatments in postmenopausal women with endometriosis -related pain symptoms.

VI.3. Menopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis  
PICO  QUESTION : IS HORMON E TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AND SAFE FOR RELIEF OF MENOPAUSAL 
SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF ENDOMETRIOSIS ?  
 
This chapter evaluates whether hormon e replacement  treatment (HRT) , now called menopausal 
hormone therapy  (MHT) , in postmenopausal women with a history of endometriosis is effective and 
safe. Efficacy is assessed by the impact of treatment on menopausal symptoms and menopause -related 
quality of life, while safety is assessed by the risk of recurrence of disease or associated symptoms, and 
incidence of  cancer. A distinction is made between natural and surgical menopause.   
VI.3.a. MHT  for menopausal symptoms in women with a history of endometriosis  
No studies were available specifically evaluating the efficacy of MHT  in reducing menopausal symptoms 
or improving menopause -related quality of life in women with a history of endometriosis. Deduced 
from the recommendations for postmenopausal women in gene ral, as summari sed by the International 
Menopause Society (IMS), North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS), MHT  is considered the most effective therapy for vasomotor 
symptoms and urogenital atrophy, with possible beneficial effects on other menopause -related 
complaints and quality of life (Baber , et al. , 2016 , The ESHRE Guideline Group on POI , et al. , 2016 ).  
VI.3.b.  MHT  and recurrence of endometriosis in women after natural menopause  
Although the literature search included women with endometriosis after both surgical menopause and 
natural menopause, no evidence could be retrieved on the latter. The recommendations on surgical 
menopause could be extrapolated to women with endometriosis and natural menopause, bearing in 
mind the differences between both patient groups ( e.g., age, gradual vs. abrupt onset of menopausal 
symptoms).  
VI.3.c. MHT  and recurrence of endometriosis in women after surgical menopause  
The management of menopause in women with a history of endometriosis has been summa rised in a 
systematic review, which included only two randomised trials and 4 observational studies ( Gemmell , et 
al., 2017 ), all focusing on p atients after surgically -induced menopause (Fedele , et al. , 1999 , Matorras , 
et al. , 2002) . 
The systematic review concluded , consistently with an older Cochrane review ( Al Kadri , et al. , 2009) , 
that there appeared to be a small association between the treatment with MHT  and recurrence of 
endometriosis, although no ne of the studies found a statistically significant difference between 
treatment and control groups. In the RCT of Matorras et al. , 115 patients received continuous 
transdermal estrogen plus cyclical oral progesterone, and 57 received no hormon e treatment.  After 45 
months, 4 of the patients in the treated arm and none in the non- treated arm reported recurrence of 
pain. The authors found recurrence of the endometriosis in two of these four patients with recurrent 
pain and these two patients had to be re -oper ated (Matorras , et al. , 2002) . Based on 13 case reports 
and case series, the review counte d 17 cases of recurrent endometriosis in postmenopausal women 
taking some form of MHT  (Gemmell , et al. , 2017) . However, lack of information about the completeness 
of surgery limits the interpretation of these findings. Indeed, persistent macroscopic implants following  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  144 
surgery are more likely associated to a recurrence of pain if stimulated by a cyclical administr ation of 
combined estrogen -progest ogen regime.  
VI.3.d. MHT  and risk of malignancy  
The systematic review by Gemmell et al . performed an extensive search on the topic of malignancy. 
Regarding the risks of treatment with MHT  in women with a history of endome triosis they found a few 
case reports of malignancy, mostly in women who received estrogen -only MHT . In this systematic 
review they reported a total of 25 patients with malignant transformation of endometriotic lesions from 
case reports and case series. Ni neteen of these 25 women received unopposed estrogens. Although 
data are very scarce and regarded as low quality, it seems advisable to consider using continuous 
combined estrogen -progestogen or tibolone regimes in women  requiring MHT  over unopposed 
estrogen (Gemmell , et al. , 2017 ).  
VI.3.e. Regimen of MHT  in women with a history of endometriosis  
Evidence is limited with regards to the regimen of MHT  in women with endometriosis (Baber , et al. , 
2016 ). Considering responsiveness of ectopic endometrial tissue to sex steroids, it seems advisab le to 
use continuous estrogen -progestogen  in those patients requiring MHT , in order to limit any abnormal 
estrogen -induced endometriosis proliferation in persistent endometriosis tissue.  
Tibolone could be an alternative for combined MHT  as this molecule ha s a typically estrogenic effect 
on vasomotor symptoms and bone, yet a progestogenic -like effect on the endometrium. In a small RCT, 
10 women received continuous transdermal estrogen plus cyclical oral progestogen, and 11 women 
were randomised to tibolone. After 12 months, 4 patients in the first group and 1 in the second 
experienced moderate pelvic pain ( Fedele , et al. , 1999 ). The authors concluded that Tibolone might be 
a safe alternative for combined MHT . Additi onally, one case report described a woman with recurrent 
disease after using tibolone (Sundar , et al. , 2007 ). More recent evidence shows a hig her risk of 
endometrial carcinoma than combined MHT , therefor e this is not recommended as a first choice MHT  
treatment  (Løkkegaard and Mørch, 2018 ). 
Phytoestrogens are non -steroidal plant- derived compounds, structurally similar to endogenous 
estrogens, but capable of showing both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. Among these, soy 
isoflavone supplements are commonly seen as a safer alternative to MHT, particularly in women with 
estrogen -dependent conditions (Chen, et al. , 2019 ). Evidence from published human trials reveals that 
soy isoflavone treatment does not stimulate proliferation in the endometrium during short- term 
treatment for at least 2 years (North American Menopause Society, 2011 ). Endometrial safety in long -
term users is unknown. The effect of isoflavone supplement in postmenopausal women with 
endometriosis has not been properly investigated. Notably, one case report showed that five -year use 
of a highly concentrated isoflavone supple ment was associated with florid recurrence of endometriosis 
and ureteral malignant Müllerian carcinosarcoma (Noel , et al. , 2006 ). This report raises further 
concerns over the use of phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women with a history of endometriosis 
(Cotroneo and Lamartiniere, 2001 ), despite some clinical and animal literature suggesting a reduced 
risk of endometriosis with dietary isoflavones (Tsuchiya , et al. , 2007 , Yavuz , et al. , 2007 ). 
   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  145 
 
Recommendations (90-92) 
Clinicians may consider combined menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for the 
treatment of postmenopausal symptoms in women (both after natural and surgical 
menopause) with a history of endometriosis.   ⊕⊕ 
 
Clinicians should avoid prescribing estrogen -only regimens for the treatment of 
vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women with a history of endometriosis, as 
these regimens may be associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation  ⊕⊕ 
 
The GDG recommends that clinicians continue to treat women with a history of 
endometriosis after surgical menopause with combined estrogen -progest ogen at least 
up to the age of natural menopause.  GPP  
Justification  
Efficacy of MHT  for the relief of menopausal symptoms in women with endometriosis has not been 
studied but  can be deduced from studies in the general population concluding that MHT  is the effective 
treatment for relieving vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy, with p ossible beneficial effects 
on other menopause -related complaints and quality of life. The impact of MHT  on recurrence of 
endometriosis (2 small RCTs, 4 observational studies and 33 case reports) was recently summari sed in 
a systematic review, showing a pos sibly increased risk. For malignancy, very few cases have been 
reported for combined MHT  or tibolone. Considering the benefits and risks, combined MHT  can be 
considered  for the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms  in women with a history of endometriosis  
(weak recommendation) .  
As the reported cases of malignancy could mainly be linked to unopposed estrogens, the risks for 
estrogen -only regimens seem to outweigh the bene fits, and their use should be  avoided  (strong 
recommendation) .

VI.4. Menopause -related major health concerns in women with 
endometriosis  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : ARE WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS AT HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING 
MENOPAUSE -RELATED MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS ?  
 
Oophorectomy is an important, widely used treatment for endometriosis. Women with endometriosis 
are therefore more likely to undergo oophorectomy than wo men in the general population and also to 
undergo this surgery at a much younger age. The resulting surgically induced  early menopause 
increases the risk of diminished bone density or osteoporosis (Farmer , et al. , 2003 ) and dementia 
(Georgakis , et al. , 2019 ), but also could have an effect on other menopause -related major health 
concerns.  
A recent review based on an extensive search  of articles on the associations between endometriosis 
and other chronic diseases, concluded that endometriosis patients have a higher risk of developing asthma, some auto -immune diseases and cardiovascular disease (Shigesi , et al. , 2019 ). For this chapter 
we fo cused on the menopause -related major health concerns, thus on the higher risk of cardiovascular 
disease.  
Two large prospective cohort studies have been published on this subject. Mu et al.  described a 
subgroup of the Nurses’ health study II with laparosco pically confirmed endometriosis, which 
prospectively included around 5,000 women and compared them to 100,000 women without endometriosis (Mu, et al. , 2016 ). They found a sign ificantly higher risk of myocardial infarction (RR 
1.52), angina (RR 1.91), coronary surgery (RR 1.35) or any of these coronary heart disease endpoints 
combined (RR 1.62) in women with a history of endometriosis. These higher risks were independent of 
demo graphic, family history, reproductive and lifestyle confounders. 42% of the association between 
endometriosis and coronary heart disease could be explained by a history of hysterectomy/BSO and 
earlier age at surgery. In the same cohort of women, they also found a higher risk for developing 
hypercholesterolemia (RR 1.25) and for hypertension (RR 1.14) (Mu, et al. , 2017) . 
Conclusion  
Clinicians should be aware that women with endometriosis who have undergone an early bilateral 
salpingo -ooph orectomy as part of their treatment have an increased risk of diminished bone density, 
dementia,  and cardiovascular disease. It is also important to note that women with endometriosis have 
an increased risk of card iovascular disease, irrespective of whether they have had an early surgical 
menopause.

VII. Extrapelvic Endometriosis  
VII.1. Diagnosis  
PICO  QUESTION : HOW RELIABLE IS IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSING EXTRAPELVIC ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
VII.1.a. Abdominal wall, umbilical, perineal and inguinal endometriosis  
Abdominal wall endometriosis is frequently associated with a gynaecologic procedure such as 
Caesarean section , laparoscopy,  or abdomin al hysterectomy ( Andres , et al. , 2020 , Chamie , et al. , 2018 , 
Hirata , et al. , 2020 , Horton , et al. , 2008 ). In a review of 445 cases, the pooled mean time interval 
between index surgery and clinical presentation of abdo minal wall endometriosis was 3.6 years 
(Horton , et al. , 2008 ). 
Caesarean section scar endometriosis is the most common abdominal wall endometriotic lesion and is 
located near or at the site of the surgical incision. It is estimated to occur in 0.03% –1.5% of women 
after Caesarean delivery (Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Hirata , et al. , 2020) . Umbilical endometriosis is rare, 
estimated to occur in 0.5% –1.0% of all cases of endometriosis (Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Hirata , et al. , 2020 ). 
Episiotomy endometriosis is even less common and is estimated to occur in 0.01% –0.06% of women 
after episiotomy (Chamie , et al. , 2018, Hirata , et al. , 2020) .  
Scar endometriosis may be identified at transabdominal ultrasonography (TAS), computed tomography 
(CT), and magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) in patients who are symptomatic or asymptomatic 
(Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Hirata , et al. , 2020 , Yarmish , et al. , 2017 ).  
The appearance of scar endometriosis at ultrasound, CT, or MRI depends on the phase of the patient’s menstrual cycle, the chronicity of the pro cess, the number of stromal and glandular elements, and the 
amount of bleeding and associated inflammation (Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Gidwaney , et al. , 2012 , Yarmish , 
et al. , 2017) . 
TAS is usually the first imaging examination performed to evaluate focal abdominal or inguinal wall 
thickening identified at clinical examination. TAS depicts the extent and nature of such focal lesions and 
is useful for establishing or excluding abdominal  wall hernia (Gidwaney , et al. , 2012 ).   
In women with a palpable anterior abdominal or pelvic wall abnormality, CT findings may help diagnose, exclude, or suggest the presence of a mass and define its extent and nature. CT may be performed with or without intravenous contrast material, although the use of contrast material improves its sensitivity and specificity (Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Gidwaney , et al. , 2012 , Yarmish , et al. , 2017 ). The highest reported 
combined sensitivity of CT imaging for the diagnosis of abdominal wall endometriosis is (0.69 ; 95%CI  
0.48 to 0.86) and specificity (0.97 ; 95% C I 0.91  to 1.00) (Yarmish , et al. , 2017 ) 
In younger patients, MRI is preferred because of its improved tissue characteri sation and lack of ionizing 
radiation. CT and MRI may be used to diagnose or exclude alternative diagnoses in the anterior 
abdominal and pelvic wall, including hernia , abscess, hematoma from other causes, and other soft -
tissue tumours ( Chamie , et al. , 2018 , Gidwaney , et al. , 2012 , Yarmish , et al. , 2017 ). 
Recently, for the diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis sensitivity of 8 7.1% for physical examination, 
76.5% for transabdominal ultrasonography, 75.6% for CT, and 81.8% for MRI was reported (Hirata , et 
al., 2020 ). 
 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  149 
VII.1.b. Thoracic endometriosis  
Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) is usually based on clinical grounds. Symptoms 
have a catamenial (cyclical) pattern, occurring between 24h before and 72h after the onset of menses, and typically recurring (Andres , et al. , 2020 , Johnson, 2004 , Rousset , et al. , 2014 ).  
Thoracic endometriosis syndrome includes five well -recogni sed clinical entities grouped into two forms, 
namely the pleural form with catamenial pneumothorax, non- catamenial endometriosis -related 
pneumothorax, catamenial haemothorax, and the pulmonary form with catamenial haemoptysis and 
lung nodules (Joseph and Sahn, 1996 , Rousset , et al. , 2014 , Vigueras Smith , et al. , 2020 ).  
Catamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this 
time interval. In a review of Gil and co -workers, d ata on 490 cases of catamenial pneumothorax were 
summari sed. Pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung (456 of 490 cases, 93%) ( Gil and 
Tulandi, 2019 ). The right -side pr edominance of symptoms represents a diagnostic clue (Johnson, 2004 , 
Rousset , et al. , 2014) . Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules (as visuali sed by laparoscopy) were 
observed in 265 of 297 cases (89%) (Gil and Tulandi, 2019 ).   
TES is the term used to refer to the various clinical and radiological manifestations resulting from the 
presence and cyclical changes of functional endometrial tissue in a thoracic structure (visceral or 
parieta l pleura, lung parenchyma, airways, or diaphragm) (Johnson, 2004 , Rousset , et al. , 2014 ). 
Approximately 90% of patients with thoracic endometrio sis syndrome experience catamenial thoracic 
pain and different entities may be associated . The right hemithorax is involved in more than 90% of all 
forms (Johnson, 2004 , Rousset , et al. , 2014) . 
In a recent systematic review only one study with 33 p atients with diaphragmatic endometriosis 
evaluated the accuracy of MRI for the diagnosis of this condition. This study reported a sensitivity of 
83% for MRI when using fat -suppressed T1 -weighted sequences for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic 
endometriosis (Andres , et al. , 2020 ). 
Recommendations (93-94) 
Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis, such as cyclical 
shoulder pain, cyclical spontaneous pneumothorax, cyclical cough,  or nodules which 
enlarge during menses.  GPP 
 
It is advisable to discuss diagnosis and management of ext rapelvic  endometriosis in a 
multidisciplinary team in a centre with sufficient expertise.  GPP 
Justification  
There is limited evidence on extrapelvic endometriosis. Cyclic pain is the most common presenting 
symptom,  and the diagnosis is usually made by histological confirmation. Additional imaging and 
endoscopic investigations specific to the location may also be used.  
MRI provides better contrast reso lution than CT and TAS and is superior to CT for depicting the 
delineation between muscles and abdominal subcutaneous  tissues and infiltration of abdominal  wall 
structures.  
Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is challenging, as these women’s sy mptoms may not 
immediately be attributed to endometriosis, MRI technique provides a good diagnostic accuracy.  
As there were no comparative studies identified that compared different imaging modalities, we are 
unable to determine which imaging tool is optim al for abdominal or thoracic disease.

VII.2. Treatment  
PICO  QUESTION : DOES TREATMENT FOR EXTRAPELVIC ENDOMETRIOSIS RELIEVE SYMPTOMS ? 
VII.2.a. Extrapelvic endometriosis of the abdominal wall, the umbilicus,  and the 
inguinal region  
Treatment of extrapelvic endometriosis of the abdominal wall, the umbilicus or the inguinal region will 
depend on the location of the lesions. If complete exc ision is possible, this is the treatment of choice; 
when this is not possible, long -term medical treatment is necessary ( Andres , et al. , 2020 , Keckstein , et 
al., 2020 , Veeraswamy , et al. , 2010 ). The principles of medical treatment for pelvic endometriosis will 
similarly apply for extragenital endometriosis ( Hirata , et al. , 2020) .  
Abdominal wall and perineal endometriosis are  usually treated by complete excision of the nodule 
(Liang , et al. , 1996 , Marinis , et al. , 2006 , Nissotakis , et al. , 2010 , Song , et al. , 2011 ). Recurrence after 
resection was 4.3% in an earlier mentioned review of 445 cases of abdominal wall endometriosis 
(Horton , et al. , 2008 ). 
According to Zhu and co -workers there is no difference between the pain relief among patients with 
abdominal wall endometriosis treated with ultrasound -guided (high -intensity focussed ultrasound) 
HIFU and surgical excision. The hospital stay was shorter in the HIFU group than in the surgery group. 
Change in the size of nodules was more remarkable in the group treated with surgery (Zhu, et al. , 2017 ). 
For umbilical endometriosis, a similar approach can be applied taking into account cosmetic consequences (Hirata , et al. , 2020, Keckstein , et al. , 2020 ). The cumulative recurrence rate was 1.34% 
at 6 months, 6.35% at 12 months, and 6.35% at 60 months after surgery performed for umbilical 
endometriosis. Medical treatment can be advised  f or the conservative therapy of  umbilical 
endometriosis, the efficacy of oral progestins, gonadotropin -releasing hormone agonists, and oral 
contraceptives was 91.7%, 81.8%, and 57.1%, respectively ( Hirata , et al. , 2020 ). 
In endometriosis of the inguinal region, the proximity to neural structures and femoral vessels should 
be considered and a multidisciplinary approach is advised (Hirata , et al. , 2020 ). 
VII.2.b. Thoracic and diaphragmatic endometriosis  
Hormon e treatment (OCP or GnRH agonist) has been shown to be effective in a significant proportion 
of patients, although with high recurrence rates. In cases of recurrent pneumothorax or haemothorax, 
chemical pleurodesis, pleural abrasion or pleurectomy may be helpful ( Gil and Tulandi, 2019 , Joseph 
and Sahn, 1996 ). Persistent haemoptysis due to parenchymal lesions may be treated by lobectomy or 
segmentectomy (Gil and Tulandi, 2019 , Nezhat , et al. , 2014 ). 
If diaphragmatic endometriosis is found as the reason for catamenial pneumothorax, consideration should be given to inve stigation and treatment of pelvic endometriosis. (Ceccaroni , et al. , 2013 , Gil and 
Tulandi, 2019 , Vigueras Smith , et al. , 2020) .  
According to recent meta -analysis by Ciriaco et al . on the treatment of thoracic endometriosis 
syndrome, video -assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) was the preferred surgical technique (84%; 95%CI  66 to 
96) (Ciriaco , et al. , 2020 ). Intraoperative evaluation revealed the presence of diaphragmatic anomalies 
in 84% of cases ( 95%CI  73 to 93). The overall pooled prevalence of concomitant or staged laparoscopy 
was 52% ( 95%CI  18 to 85). Postoperative hormone therapy was heterogeneous with a pooled  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  152 
prevalence of 61% ( 95%CI  33 to 86). Recurrence of symptoms was document ed in 27% of patients 
(95%CI  20 to 34).  
When a patient does not want to undergo thoracic surgery or only incomplete resection is expected, in 
case of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy (BSO) may be considered in 
absence of future fertility plans ( Keckstein , et al. , 2020) . 
Recommendations (95-96) 
For abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, surgical removal is the preferred treatment 
when possible, to relieve symptoms. Hormon e treatment may also be an option when 
surgery is not possible or acceptable.  ⊕ 
 
For thoracic endometriosis, hormon e treatment can be offered. If surgery is indicated, 
it should be performed in a multidisciplinary manner involving a thoracic surgeon and/or 
other relevant specialists.   ⊕ 
Justification  
Due to the lack of unequivocal evidence regarding the treatment of extrapelvic endometriosis, clinicians 
may consider surgical removal of symptomatic extrapelvic endometriosis, when possible, to relieve 
symptoms.  Both for abdominal and thoracic endometriosis, a weak recommendation was formulated.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question VII.2)  
Research recommendation  (R26) 
Prospective st udies are needed in the field of extrapelvic endometriosis, especially thoracic 
endometriosis.

VIII. Asymptomatic endometriosis  
Asymptomatic endometriosis is defined as the incidental finding of peritoneal, ovarian,  or deep 
endometriosis without pelvic pain and/or infertility. Incidental findings of endometriosis have been 
reported during different gynaecologic  procedures (sterili sation, ovarian drilling for PCOS, 
appendectomy) and examinations ( e.g.,  fertility work -up or general gynaecologic  examinations).  The 
exact prevalence of asymptomatic peritoneal endometriosis is unknown, but the presence of 
endometriosis has been reported i n 3 to 45% of women undergoing laparoscopic  tubal ligation 
(Gylfason , et al. , 2010 , Rawson, 1991) . It is unclear, however, whether these women were entirely 
asymptomatic.  
 
VIII.1. Treatment  
PICO  QUESTION : IS TREATMENT BENEFICIAL FOR INCIDENTAL FINDING OF ASYMPTOMATIC 
ENDOMETRIOSIS ? 
 
By definition, patients with an incidental finding of endometriosis do not have symptoms of the disease 
that require treatment. Treatment could however be indicated to prevent progression of 
endometriosis.  
In this respect, it has been shown that the risk that asymptomatic minimal disease will become symptomatic is low (Moen and Stokstad, 2002 ). 
To date no clinical trials have been performed to assess whether surgery is beneficial compared to expectant management. Furthermore,  as with any surgical procedure, surgical excision or ablation has 
associated risks, such as damage to adjacent anatomical structures. Therefore, surgical treatment for 
an incidental finding of asymptomatic endometriosis cannot be recommended.  
In the absence of evidence of disease progression, medical treatment cannot be recommended either for asymptomatic disease.  
Recommendations (97-99) 
The GDG recommends that clinicians should inform and counsel women about any 
incidental finding of endometriosis.  GPP  
 
The GDG recommends that clinicians should not routinely perform surgical 
excision/ablation for an incidental finding of asymptomatic endometriosis at the time of 
surgery.  GPP  
 
Clinicians should not prescribe medical treatment in women with incidenta l finding of 
endometriosis.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Based on the lack of evidence and despite the small risk that asymptomatic minimal disease will become symptomatic or progress, the conclusion from the GDG is that medical or surgical treatment of 
incidental finding of asymptomatic endometriotic lesions is not routinely recommended  (strong  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  155 
recommendation) . The GDG recommends that clinicians follow national guidelines for the management 
of ovarian cysts detected incidentally on ultrasound scan.  
It is  considered good practice to inform and counsel patients about any incidental finding of 
endometriosis.

VIII.2. Monitoring  
PICO  QUESTION : IS LONG TERM MONITORING OF WOMEN WITH ASYMPTOMATIC ENDOMETRIOSIS 
BENEFICIAL IN PREVENTING ADVERSE OUTCOMES ? 
 
The only rationale for long term monitoring of patients with asymptomatic endometriosis would be to 
prevent the progression of disease and development of symptoms and to avoid a potential malignant 
transformation.  
The conservative management of ovarian mas ses which have appearances consistent with 
endometrioma on ultrasound in asymptomatic premenopausal women is a safe option of treatment 
after proper counselling  (Alcazar , et al. , 2005 ).  
However, in view of other possible negative consequences of endometriosis ( e.g.,  effects on fertility, 
increased risk of ovarian malignancy), there is a need for RCTs to determine whether surgery or long -
term  monitoring should be recommended in asymptomatic patients ( Maouris, 1991 , Pearce , et al. , 
2012 ).  
A recent prospective study reported that deep endometriosis  could significantly impair detrusor 
functions. Authors conducted preoperative urodynamic evaluation to assess bladder function in 
asymptomatic patients and found that detrusor overactivity was correlated with the presence of deep 
endometriosis (Serati , et al. , 2013) . 
Recommendation  (100)  
Routine ultrasound monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Even in the absence of solid data on the benefit of monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis, the GDG suggests  considering  US monitoring as it is cost effective and safe (weak recommendation) . There is no 
information as to how often and how long the monito ring should continue. . Alternatively, women  with 
asymptomatic endometriosis can be advised to seek medical help in case of occurrence of any 
endometriosis -related symptoms.

IX. Primary p revention of endometriosis  
Primary prevention is aimed at protecting healthy, asymptomatic women from developing 
endometriosis.  
Since the cause of endometriosis is unknown, the potential of primary prevention is limited. One of the 
risk factors for endometriosis seems to be having a first -degree family member wit h the disease, 
although the specific genetic origin of the association is still unknown. The increased disease prevalence 
which has been found in first -degree relatives of women with endometriosis results in questions from 
patients and family members on ho w they can prevent the development of endometriosis. Therefore, 
we performed a literature search for interventions that could influence the development of endometriosis, although not specifically for women with increased risk for endometriosis. However, 
interventions for prevention of disease development could be beneficial for these women as well.  
Prevention of recurrence, or secondary prevention of endometriosis is covered in chapter IV.  
 
PICO  QUESTION : IS THERE A ROLE FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF ENDOMETRIO SIS?  
IX.1 Risk factors and prevention  
Epidemiological data suggest that early menarche, shorter cycle length, long and heavy menstrual flow, 
lean body size and reduced gravidity/parity are associated with increased risk of developing endometriosis (Parazzini , et al. , 2017 , Shafrir , et al. , 2018 ). Available data regarding exposure to 
environmental pollutants, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls, do not draw a firm conclusion 
about the risk of developing endometriosis later in life ( Cano -Sancho , et al. , 2019 ). Nickel allergy seems 
to be a risk factor for endometriosis ( Yuk, et al. , 2015) . 
To date there is no robust evidence supporting a significant association between diet and 
endometriosis, although women with endometriosis seem to consume fewer vegetables, fruits 
(particularly citrus fruits), dairy products, as well as foods rich of vitamin D and omega -3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and more red meat, coffee and trans fats (Harris , et al. , 2018 , Nodler , et al. , 
2019 , Parazzini , et al. , 2013b ).  
In a review by Hansen et al . on endometriosis, dysmenorrhea,  and diet, one large included prospective 
cohort study reported that increased intake of long -chain omega -3 fatty acids lowered the risk of 
endometriosis, while increasing trans -unsaturated fatty acid intake increased the risk  of endometriosis, 
indicating that there may be modifiable risk factors ( Hansen and Knudsen, 2013 , Missmer, et al. , 2010) . 
Women with endometriosis were found to have lower vitamin D status when compared with women 
without endometriosis, and a negative relationship between vitamin D levels and severity of 
endometriosis was observed (Qiu, et al. , 2020) . Recent data provides evidence for an association 
between alcohol consumption and endometriosis risk ( Parazzini , et al. , 2013a ), but not for tobacco 
smoking (Bravi , et al. , 2014) .  Although physical activity does not seem to reduce the risk of 
endometriosis, it may play a positive role in reducing endometriosis -associated pa in (Ricci , et al. , 2016 ). 
When comparing women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis to women without a diagnosis of 
endometriosis, there is evidence that current use of oral contraceptives has a protective effect against 
the development of endometriosis, but this effect is not observed in past or  ever contraceptive users 
(Vercellini , et al. , 2011 ). However, the protective effect observed in current users can be related to the 
postponement of surgica l evaluation due to temporary suppression of pain (Vercellini , et al. , 2011 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  158 
Recommen dations (101-102) 
Although there is no direct evidence of benefit in preventing endometriosis in the future, 
women can be advised of aiming for a healthy lifestyle and diet, with reduced alcohol 
intake and regular physical activity.  ⊕⊕ 
 
The usefulness of hormonal contraceptives for the primary prevention of endometriosis 
is uncertain.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The evidence on a healthy lifestyle and diet, with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity 
for the prevention of endometriosis is summari sed in systematic reviews and meta -analyses of 
epidemiological/observational studies. The benefits of a he althy lifestyle are well known, regardless of 
endometriosis. To the best of our knowledge, the proposal of healthy lifestyle/diet could be considered 
a feasible and acceptable option  to improve general health, and it may also be beneficial towards the 
risk of endometriosis . However, the underlying cause of endometriosis remains unknown, thus, due to 
a lack of scientific data it remains unclear whether preventative measures exist and, if so, how effective 
they may be.  
The evidence on a reduced risk of endometriosis during oral contraceptive use is controversial, as 
summari sed in systematic reviews and meta -analyses of epidemiological/observational studies. To 
date, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the apparent protective effect of oral contr aceptive 
against endometriosis is the result of postponement of surgical evaluation due to temporary 
suppression of pain symptoms.  
Further information  
Details of the literature study and evidence tables are available in Annex 7 and Annex 8 (question IX .1) 
 
IX.2. Genetic predisposition  
Although meta -analyses of genome -wide association studies identified some single nucleotide 
polymorphisms associated with endometriosis (Sapkota , et al. , 2015 , Sapkota , et al. , 2017 ), to date 
there is no robust evidence to recommend any genetic test to assess the risk of developing the disease.  
Recommendation  (103)  
Genetic testing in wome n with suspected or confirmed endometriosis should only be 
performed within a research setting.  RESEARCH -
ONLY  
Justification  
With regards to genetic markers to identify high -risk population for developing endometriosis , the 
evidence is drawn from systematic reviews and meta -analyses of epidemiological/observational and 
genome -wide association (GWAS) studies. At this stage, no genetic test could be considered reliable for 
the diagnosis of endometriosis. As such, genetic testing for identifying a high -risk population for 
developing endometriosis, should be limited to a research setting.   
 
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  159 
Research recommendation  (R27)  
Research should further consider the genetic background of endometriosis, which may not be a 
monogenic disorder, and translate findings into validated tests that can be used in diagnosis and 
prevention.

X. Endometriosis and cancer  
Endometriosis , although non -malignant, shares similar features with cancer, such as resistance to 
apoptosis, development of local and distant foci, invasion of other tissues, and chronic inflammatory 
milieu. The possible link between endometriosis and cancer is a concern for many clinicians and  
patients . However, the evidence on this link, and its translation into clinical practice in terms of 
information to patients and early detection of cancer, are unclear. In addition, recent publications 
suggest the presence of somatic cancer -driver mutatio ns in endometriosis lesions that may be 
associated with ovarian cancer development and progression. There is concern and uncertainty also as 
to whether treatment for endometriosis ( hormone  treatment, surgery) may increase cancer risk.  These 
questions with regards to cancer and endometriosis are discussed below.  
X.1. Link between endometriosis and cancer  
PICO  QUESTION : ARE ENDOMETRIOSIS PATIENTS AT INCREASED RISK OF CANCER ? 
 
Based on a systematic review and meta -analysis of 49 cohort or case -control studies, endometriosis is 
associated with a very small and not statistically significant increased risk of cancer overall (summary 
relative risk (SRR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16) ( Kvaskoff , et al. , 2020 ). 
Specifically, endometri osis diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer (SRR 1.93), 
particularly the clear -cell (SRR 3.44) and endometrioid histotypes (SRR 2.33), breast cancer (SRR 1.04), 
and thyroid cancer (SRR 1.39)  (Kvaskoff , et al. , 2020) . The review reported no increased risk  of 
colorectal cancer (SRR 1.00), and a lower risk of cervical cancer (SRR 0.68) in women with 
endometriosis. This lower risk of cervical cancer ( -32%) could be attributed to higher cervical 
surveillance and earl ier detection in women with endometriosis. T he meta -analysis stresses several 
complex methodological issues that must be considered when interpreting findings and weighing 
results. Associations with endometrial cancer and cutaneous melanoma are indeed unclear as they 
varied in sensitivity analyses, with evidence of important impact of methodologic bias. Most of the 
evaluated studies (53%) were rated as having serious or critical risk of bias, with impactful 
heterogeneity across studies.  
Associations with other cancer types either show high potential for bias (endometrial cancer, cutaneous melanoma) or have been too sparsely documented to make valid conclusions  (Kvaskoff, et al. , 2020 ).  
Very few studies provided estimates by endometriosis subtype. The meta -analysis shows a higher risk 
of ovarian cancer associated with endometrioma (SRR  5.41), although this result should be interpreted 
with caution given the probable methodologic bias  (Kvaskoff , et al ., 2020 ). Only one study provided 
estimates by endometriosis subtype for the association with ovarian cancer; endometrioma and 
superficial peritoneal endometriosis were associated with a higher risk of clear -cell and endometroid  
tumours (and serous tumours for endometrioma), but deep endometriosis was not associated with ovarian cancer risk ( Saavalainen , et al. , 2018) . 
Very few studies reported results by age at diagnosis or menopausal status. The association between 
endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk was reported to increase linearly with age at endometrioma 
diagnosis in one Japanese prospective cohort study (Kobayashi , et al. , 2007 ), but the relationship was 
less clear in a large retrospective Danish study  showing  stronger associations for the 30 -39 and ≥50 
years age categories ( Mogensen , et al. , 2016 ). In the latter study, a similar association was reported 
between age at endometriosis diagnosis and endometrial cancer risk. The association between 
endometriosis and breast cancer was stronger in women aged at least 50 years at endometr iosis  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  161 
diagnosis in two studies  (Bertelsen , et al. , 2007 , Mogensen , et al. , 2016) . The association between 
endometriosis and breast cancer did not differ according to menopausal status at breast cancer 
diagnosis in a prospective cohort study ( Farland , et al. , 2016 ), but it was stronger in premenopausal 
women in two early population -based case -control studies (Moseson , et al. , 1993 , Weiss , et al. , 1999) . 
Overall, the currently available data is insufficient to m ake any conclusion on the association by age or 
menopausal status.  
Recommendation  (104)  
Clinicians should inform women with endometriosis requesting information on their risk 
of developing cancer that  endometriosis is not associated with a significantly higher risk 
of cancer overall.  Although endometriosis is associated with a higher risk of ovarian, 
breast, and thyroid cancer s in particular , the increase in absolute risk compared with 
women in the gen eral population is low.  ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
The data show a higher risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer in women with endometriosis, 
although the increase compared to the general population is low (+0.5% to +1.2%). . As the risk of 
developing cancer is a major concern in some women with endometriosis; a strong recommendation 
for information provision was formulated. Further guidance on how information can be provided is 
included in the next section.  
Research recomme ndation  (R28)  
Future studies should investigate the association between endometriosis and cancer using a 
prospective design, with a long duration of follow- up to take into account the temporality of the 
association, a population -based sample with standardi sed collection of data and recogni sed criteria for 
the definition of endometriosis, evaluate potential confounding and mediation, and, also importantly, explore heterogeneity by reporting associations according to a) endometriosis and cancer subty pes, 
and b) patient characteristics (age, menopausal status , etc ). When exploring endometriosis macro -
phenotypes, results from both exclusive and non- exclusive subtypes should be reported.

NARRATIVE QUESTION : WHAT INFORMATION COULD CLINICIANS PROVIDE TO WOMEN WITH 
ENDOMETRIOSIS REGARDING THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER ?  
 
Based on the currently available evidence, the increase in absolute risk for cancer in women with 
endometriosis is very small  (Kvaskoff , et al. , 2020 ): 
 Absolute risk of developing cancer in a 
woman’s lifetime  Increase in risk in 
women with 
endometriosis  All women  Women with 
endometriosis  
Ovarian cancer  1.3 %  2.5 %  +1.2 %  
Breast cancer  12.8 %  13.3 %  +0.5 %  
Thyroid cancer  1.3 %  1.8 %  +0.5 %  
  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  162 
Although endometriosis is associated with the risk of some cancers, given the low absolute risks of 
ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer in people with endometriosis relative to people without (increases 
of +1.2%, +0.5%, and +0.5%, respectively), and the un certainty with regards to the risk of other cancers, 
endometriosis patients may be reassured that their cancer risk is low and close to that of people 
without the disease.  
Recommendation  (105)  
The GDG recommends that clinicians reassure women with endometriosis with regards 
to their cancer risk and address their concern to reduce their risk by recommending 
general cancer prevention measures (avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, 
exercising regularly, having a balanced diet with high intake s of fruits and vegetables and 
low intakes of alcohol, and using sun protection).  GPP

X.1.a Somatic mutations  
NARRATIVE QUESTION : ARE SOMATIC MUTATIONS IN DEEP ENDOMETRIOSIS OF PATIENTS WITHOUT 
CANCER PREDICTIVE FOR OVARIAN CANCER DEVELOPMENT AND /OR PROGRESSION ? 
 
Endometrioma has been posited as a direct precursor for clear -cell and endometrioid ovarian cancer  
(Anglesio and Yong, 2017 ). However, epidemiologic, histologic, genetic, and biochemical data have 
been conflicting  (Bulun , et al. , 2019 , Guo, 2020 , Kvaskoff, et al. , 2020 , Vigano , et al. , 2006 ). Some 
authors described atypical endometriosis in a spatial and chronological association with ovarian cancer 
(Van Gorp , et al. , 2004 ). Although a direct progression has been only rarely demonstrated, emerging 
evidence suggests genetic associations between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. Several genetic studies have shown that endometriotic lesions have mutations or alterations in gene s directly related 
to neoplasms, particularly PTEN, TP53 , KRAS , and ARID1A  (Akahane , et al. , 2007 , Amemiya , et al. , 2004 , 
Borrelli , et al. , 2016 , Er, et al. , 2016 , Siufi Neto , et al. , 2014 ). 
Nevertheless, more recently, the presence of cancer -driver mutations was investigated in various 
tissues of patien ts without cancer ( Bulun , et al. , 2019, Yong, et al. , 2021 ). Aside from endometrioma  
(Anglesio , et al. , 2015, Suda , et al. , 2018 ), somatic mutations in cancer -associated genes were observed 
in a quarter to a third of patients with deep endometriosis – a subtype that rarely undergoes malignant 
transformation (Anglesio , et al. , 2017 , Lac, et al. , 2019b ); in about 28% of patients with incisional 
endometriosis (a n iatrogenic form of endometriosis occurring in the resulting surgical scars of obstetric/ 
gynaecological procedures) ( Lac, et al. , 2019b ); and in over 50% of normal endometrium samples  (Lac, 
et al. , 2019a ).  
Conclusion  
Based on the limited literature and controversial findings, there is little evidence that somatic mutations 
in patients with deep endometriosis may be predictive of development and/or progression of ovarian 
cancer   
Research recommendation  (R29) 
More research needs to be performed on the mutational and epigenetic profile of endometriosis tissue, 
endometrium from endometriosis patients and normal endometrium from women of different ages 
and reproductive histories. Among women with endometriosis, exclusive macro -phenotypes of 
endometriosis should be investigated.

X.1.b Impact of hormon e treatments  
PICO  QUESTION : DOES THE USE OF HORMON E TREATMENTS INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER ? 
Hormon e treatments ( OCP, progestogens) are recommended for the treatment of endometriosis -
associated pain and are widely used (See chapter II medical treatment for pain). As symptoms  often 
reappear after discontinuation, the treatments are often used long -term, which may pose patients at 
risk of safety issues ( Ferrero , et al. , 2015, Ferrero , et al. , 2018 ).  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  164 
The neoplastic effects of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) have been extensively studied. A review on 
the safety of medical treatments for endometriosis suggested an inverse association between duration 
of OCP use  and ovarian cancer risk (for women using  oral contraception for 4 and 8 years, the RR was 
0.60 and 0.49, respectively) and endometrial cancer risk (for women using oral contraception for 4 and 8 years, the RR was 0.46 and 0.34, respectively); whereas the use of OCP was associated with an increas ed risk of breast cancer (RR between 1.09 and 1.38) and cervical cancer (RR between 1.1 and 
2.2) (Berlanda , et al. , 2016 ). 
In the general population, OCP users have a 20% to 30% lower risk of ovarian cancer than never -users 
(Havrilesky , et al. , 2013 , Wentzensen, et al. , 2016 ) . Furthermore, this risk reduction has been shown 
to be strengthened with the length of oral contraceptive u se; long -term OCP use (10 years or more) 
was associated with a 40% lower ovarian cancer risk (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.76) compared with OCP use for less than 1 year in the NIH -AARP Diet and Health Study, a large prospective population -based 
cohort (Michels , et al. , 2018 ). This lower risk with longer durations of OCP use was observed for all 
histotypes of ovarian cancer except for mucinous tumours (Wentzensen, et al. , 2016)  and across several 
lifestyle characteristics (smoking, BMI, physical activity) ( Michels , et al. , 2018) . 
In the NIH -AARP Diet and Health Study, women who have ever used OCPs had a 34% lower risk of 
endometrial cancer than women who have never used oral contraceptives and this risk decrease was more pronounced with long durations of use (HR 0.66; 95%CI 0. 56 to 0.78 for ≥10 years vs. 1 year or 
less) (Michels , et al. , 2018) . The strongest risk reductions were observed in those long -term users of 
oral contraceptives who were current smokers, obese, or exercised moderately or infrequently. In an 
Italian case -control study, OCP use was associated with 36% lower odds of endometrial cancer (95% CI 
0.43- 0.96) (Zucchetto , et al. , 2009) . 
In 2017, a large nationwide, registry -based prospective Danish study reported breast cancer risks 
associated with OCP  use, based on 1.8 million women and over 11,000 breast cancer cases (Morch , et 
al., 2018 ). Comp ared with women who had never used hormonal contraception, the relative risk of 
breast cancer among all current and recent users of OCP  was 1.20 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.26). This risk 
increased from 1.09 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.23) with less than 1 year of use to 1.38  (95% CI 1.26 to 1.51) with 
more than 10 years of use. In the NIH -AARP Diet and Health Study, there was no association between 
duration of OCP use and breast cancer risk (P for trend=0.23)  (Michels , et al. , 2018 ): . 
A systematic review of 28 studies showed that compared with never u sers of OCPs, the relative risk of 
cervical cancer increased with increasing duration of use: for durations of approximately less than 5 
years, 5 -9 years, and 10 or more years, respectively, the summary relative risks were 1.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 
1.2), 1.6 (95%  CI 1.4 to 1.7), and 2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.4) for all women ( Smith , et al. , 2003 ). 
A meta -analysis showed that women who have ever used OCPs had a 14% lower risk of colorectal 
cancer than women who have never used OCPs (Gierisch , et al. , 2013 ), although there was no 
association between duration of OCP use and colorectal cancer risk in the NIH -AARP Diet and Health 
Study (Michels , et al. , 2018 ). No association was observed between OCP use and pancreatic cancer 
(Butt, et al. ) or thyroid cancer (Braganza , et al. , 2014)  in two large prospective studies.  
Scanty evidence is available on the neoplastic effect of progestins and their long -term use. However, 
an association between use of progestins for contraception and an increased risk of breast cancer has 
not been reported (Berlanda , et al. , 2016 ). Finally, a Swedish nationwide, registry -based nested case -
control study including 220 ovarian cancer cases and 416 controls, all among women with 
endometriosis, reported no appreciable impact of hormon e treatments (OCP, progestogen , danazol , 
GnRH agonists, or menopausal hormone therapy) on ovarian cancer risk among women with 
endometriosis (Melin , et al. , 2013) .   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  165 
Recommendation  (106)  
Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy 
associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives.  ⊕ 
Justification  
Robust evidence  from studies in the general population shows that the risks of ovarian, endometrial, 
and colorectal cancers are decreased in women who use OCP s, whereas the risks of breast and cervical 
cancers are increased.  . However, the higher risk of cervical cancer related to OCP use may be 
counterbalanc ed by the lower cervical cancer risk related to endometriosis, and the risk reduction for 
ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancers may outweigh the increased risk for breast cancer.  The 
risk reductions and risk increases are more pronounced for longer durations of use of the OCP.

X.2. Monitoring for detection of malignancy  
PICO  QUESTION : SHOULD WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS BE MONITORED FOR DETECTION OF 
MALIGNANCY ? 
 
Based on the  increase in lifetime risks of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer in endometriosis patients , 
monitoring could be advocated. However, the data discussed above show that the increased risk is very 
small compared with women in the general population (0.5 -1.2%) (Kvaskoff , et al. , 2020 ).  
Monitoring for ovarian malignancy could be performed by CA -125 measure ment, or imaging, although 
the value is unclear, even in women without endometriosis. Randomised -controlled trials have shown 
no benefit of serum CA -125 measurements or transvaginal ultrasound on early detection of ovarian 
cancer or mortality reduction (Buys , et al. , 2011, Jacobs , et al. , 2016 ). In fact, significant harm ha s been 
reported for those receiving false- positive test results for ovarian cancer (unnecessary surgery, surgical 
complications, infections, or cardiovascular/pulmonary complications) (Buys , et al. , 2011) . 
Still, monitoring, by regular CA -125 measurements or ultrasound scans, is performed in women with 
high risk of developing ovarian cancer, such as those with family history of ovarian/breast cancer or a 
known germline mutation These women  may have a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of up to 50% 
compared to the 1.3% risk in the general population (and 2.5% in women with endometriosis). In some 
of these high- risk women, prophylactic bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy (BSO) is recommended for 
further reduction of ovarian cancer risk (Berek , et al. , 2010 ); however, BSO is associated with important 
health risks of starkly higher incidence than the risk of ovarian cancer. In premenopausal women, BSO 
can result in cardiovascular disease, depression, arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and osteoporosis . In post -menopausal women, BSO has been  linked to cardiovascular diseases, 
anxiety, sexual function disorders, fracture, neurologic disorders, and  cognitive impairment ( Kvaskoff , 
et al. , 2020 , Parker , et al. , 2009 ). Considering the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and the significant harm, 
BSO is not recommended in women with endometriosis without further risk factors for ovarian cancer.  
Monitoring for other types of malignancy is not justified given the low absolute breast and thyroid 
cancer risk in women with endometriosis.  
An area of uncertainty is monitoring for malignancy among asymptomatic patients and postmenopausal 
women with endometrioma.  
Recommendations (107 -108)  
In women with endometriosis, c linicians should not systematically perform cancer 
screening beyond the existing population -based cancer screening guidelines .  ⊕⊕ 
 
Clinicians can consider cancer screening according to local guidelines in individual 
patients that have additional risk factors, e.g.,  strong family history, specific germline 
mutations.  GPP 
Justification  
Given the small increases in the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in endometriosis patients, regular 
screening through serum CA- 125 measurements or trans -vaginal ultrasound has no benefit on early 
detection or mortality reduction for ovarian cancer. Conversely, significant harm ha s been reported fo r 
women receiving false -positive test results. In the absence of significant risk factors, bilateral salpingo -
oophorectomy outweighs the risk of ovarian cancer.   
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  168 
Research recommendation  (R30)  
More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometr ioma and endometriosis in general 
to guide the need for monitoring.

X.3. Surgery and malignancy  
PICO  QUESTION : DOES SURGERY FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS CHANGE THE FUTURE RISK OF CANCER ? 
 
Some authors have advocated “earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete disease 
removal” to reduce future ovarian cancer risk ( Nezhat , et al. , 2008) . Others have challenged this 
position on the basis that preventative surgery may be extended to asymptomatic women and argued 
that given the relapsing nature of endometriosis, it is unlikely tha t preventative surgery would reduce 
the future risk substantially (Vercellini , et al. , 2009 ). 
A nationwide, registry -based study of all women with a first- time discharge diagnosis of endometriosis 
(70% -80% with endometrioma regardless of other types) in 1969 -2007 in Sweden identified 183 cases 
of epithelial ovarian cancer in women with endometriosis and compared them with 318 matched controls with endometriosis and no ovarian cancer using a nested case -control design ( Melin , et al. , 
2013 ). Those who had undergone unilateral oophorectomy or extirpation of all visible endometriosis at 
surgery for endometriosis had a dramatically reduced risk of ovarian cancer in later life. This risk 
reduction was more pronounced in those who had unilateral oophorectomy (OR 0.10; 95%CI 0.03 to 
0.36) compared with those who had excision without removing the  affected ovary (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.10 
to 0.84). Other types of surgical treatment (tubal ligation, unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy, 
hysterectomy) were not significantly associated with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.  
A population -based case -control study of 812 women with ovarian cancer and 1313 controls explored 
the relationship between pre -existing benign ovarian conditions and risk of ovarian cancer, as well as 
the reduction in such risk associated with ovarian surgery following the diagnosis  of the benign 
condition (Rossing , et al. , 2008 ). Howe ver, the study lacked statistical power (only 175 participants 
reported endometriosis) and produced imprecise estimates, with wide CIs that often overlapped across 
subgroups. The association between self -reported endometriosis and ovarian cancer did not 
significantly differ between women who reported ovarian surgery after their endometriosis (unilateral 
oophorectomy, excision of a cyst or of a partial ovary; OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0 to 2.0) and those who did not 
(OR 1.0; 95%CI 0.5 to 2.2). The OR for the associati on between self -reported endometriosis and ovarian 
cancer was 0.8 (95%CI 0.3 to 2.1) in women who reported unilateral oophorectomy, whereas it was 3.3 
(95%CI 0.7 to 15.3) in those who reported a lesser extent of ovarian surgery (cystectomy or partial oopho rectomy). Self- reported endometriosis was associated with a three -fold increase in the risk of 
endometrioid and clear -cell invasive tumours (OR 3.2; 95%CI 1.9 to 5.6), with a smaller OR in those who 
underwent ovarian surgery (OR 1.6; 95%CI 0.4 to 5.7).  
In a retrospective cross -sectional study of 485 women who had excision of endometrioma, 4 (0.8%) 
developed ovarian cancer ( Haraguchi , et al. , 2016 ). These all occurred in women with recurrence of 
their endometrioma. Age at endometrioma excision ranged from 32 to 41.  
Recommendation  (109)  
Clinicians should be aware that there is  epidemiological data, mostly on ovarian 
endometriosis, showing that complete excision of visible endometriosis may reduce the 
risk of ovarian cancer . The potential benefits should be weighed against the risks of 
surgery (morbidity, pain, and ovarian reserve) . ⊕⊕ 
Justification  
Surgical excision of endometriosis, from the ovaries and from other locations, may reduce the risk of subsequent ovarian cancer. However, removal of the affected ovary, where appropriate, may have a  
Guideline Endometriosis - 2022  170 
bigger cancer risk reduction effect than excision of dise ase and preservation of the ovary. If 
endometriosis involves both ovaries, BSO should be considered with caution with regards to other long -
term health risks, as detailed in section X.2

Annex 4: Methodology 
Guideline development  
European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines are developed based 
on the Manual for ESHRE guideline development (N. Vermeulen, et al., Manual for ESHRE guideline 
development, version 2020), which can be consulted at the ESHRE website (www.eshre.eu/guidelines). 
The principal aim of this manual is to provide stepwise advice on ESHRE guideline development for 
members of ESHRE guideline development groups. The manual describes a 12-s tep procedure for 
writin g clinical management guidelines by the guideline development group, supported by the 
ESHRE methodological expert.  
Th
e current guideline was developed with support of ESHRE, which covered expenses associated with 
the guideline meetings (travel, hotel,  and catering expenses) associated with the literature searches 
(library costs, costs associated with the retrieval of papers) and with the implementation of the 
guideline (printing, publication costs). Except for reimbursement of their travel expenses, GDG members did not receive any payment for their participation in the guideline development process.  
After approval of the guideline application by the ESHRE Executive Committee, the scope of the guideline and the members of the guideline group were discusse d. In composing a guideline group, we 
strived towards a balance in expertise, gender,  and location within Europe. … 
A meeting of the guideline development group was organi sed to discuss the key questions and redefine 
them through the PICO process (patients – interventions – comparison – outcome). This resulted in a 
final list of  42 key questions, of which 7 were answered as narrative questions, and 35 as PICO 
questions. Based on the defined key words, literature searches were performed by the methodological expert (N. Vermeulen). Key words were sorted to importance and used for searches in 
PUBMED/MEDLINE and the Cochrane library. We searched the databases  from inception up to 1 
december 2020 . 
Literature searches were performed as an iterative process. In a first step, systematic reviews and meta -
analyses were collected. If no results were found, the search was extended to randomised controlled 
trials, and further to cohort studies and case repo rts, following the hierarchy of the levels of evidence. 
References were selected or excluded by the methodological expert and expert GDG member based 
on title and abstract and knowledge of the existing literature. If necessary, additional searches were 
performed to get the final list of papers. The quality of the selected papers was assessed by means of 
the quality assessment checklist, defined in the ESHRE guideline manual. Next, the evidence was collected and summari sed in an evidence table. The quality a ssessment and completion of evidence 
tables were performed by the expert GDG members.  
Guid
eline Endometriosis - 2022  184 
Summary of findings tables are usually prepared 
according to the GRADE approach for all interventions with at least two studies (RCTs) per 
outcome. For the interventions in the current 
guideline, such evidence is not available, and hence no summary of findings tables were produced.  
GDG meetings were organi sed to discuss the draft 
recommendations and the supporting evidence and 
to reach consensus on the final formulation  of the 
recommendations.  
For each recommendation, it is mentioned whether 
it is strong or weak and what the quality of the supporting evidence was.  
In the justification section, more data are provided on the interpretation of the supporting evidence and how other factors (i.e., balance between desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of the 
evidence of effects, certainty in how people value the outcome, and acceptability) were considered. 
Costs and resource impact were only discussed where relevant.  
In a final step, all evidence and recommendations were combined in the ESHRE guideline: 
“Endometriosis ”  
Implications  of recommendations  
We labelled the recommendations as either ‘‘strong’’ or ‘‘weak” according to the GRADE approach, 
with appropriate wording for each option. Suggested interpretation of strong and weak  
recommendations by patients, clinicians and health care policy makers is as follows:  Clinical 
recommendation
Evidence
Acceptability
Cost

use)

Harms

Good practice points or GPPs are mainly based on the expertise and opinion of guideline group 
members. GPPs can be used to emphasize the importance of patient participation in decision making 
about specific procedure, provide advice on the management of specific surgical procedures for 
which there is an evidence-based recommendation, or advise caution where there is perceived risk of 
harm but no available direct evidence of such harms.Gu

Strategy for review of the Guideline draft  
After finalis ation of the guideline draft, the review process was initiated. The draft guideline was 
published on the ESHRE website, accompanied by the reviewers’ comments form and a short 
explanation of the review process. The guideline was open for review between 24 June and 15 August 2021 . 
To notify interested clinicians, we sent out an invitation to review the guideline by email to all members of the ESHRE SIG Endometriosis and Endometrial Disorders . Selected reviewers were personally invited 
by email. These reviewers included:  
•Coordinators  and deputies of the ESHRE SIGs Endometriosis and Endometrial Disorders
•The members of the endometriosis guideline group 2013
•Experts that participated in the stakeholder review in 2013
•Contact persons of international and national societies .
All reviewer s that submitted comments are listed in  Annex 6 . The Review  report, including further 
information on the review and a list of all comments per reviewer with the response formulated by the GDG is published on the ESHRE website.  
Guideline Implementation str ategy  
The standard dissemination procedure for all ESHRE guidelines comprises publishing and announcement.  
Each guideline is published on the ESHRE Website and in Human Reproduction. The announcement procedure includes a newsflash on the ESHRE website hom epage. All participants in the annual ESHRE 
meeting and all related national societies and patient organi sations are informed about the guideline 
release. The latter are asked to encourage local implementation by, for instance, translations or condensed versions, but they are also offered a website link to the original document.  
Patient versions of the guidel ine will be developed by a subgroup of the GDG together with patient the 
representatives. The patient version is a translation of the recommendations in everyday language, with 
emphasis on questions important to patients. It aims to help patients understand the guideline’s 
recommendations and facilitates clinical decision -making.  
To further enhance implementation of the guideline, the members of the GDG, as experts in the field, will be asked to make suggestions for tailor -made implementation interventions (e.g.,  option grids, 
flow- charts, additional recommendations, addition of graphic/visual material to the guideline).  
Schedule for updating the guideline.  
The current guideline will be considered for revision in 2025 (four years after publication). An 
intermediate search for new evidence will be performed two years after publication, which will inform 
the GDG of the necessity of an update.  
Every care is taken to ensure that this publication is correct in every detail at the time of publication. 
However, in  the event of errors or omissions, corrections will be published in the web version of this 
document, which is the definitive version at all times. This version can be found at 
www.eshre.eu/guidelines .
