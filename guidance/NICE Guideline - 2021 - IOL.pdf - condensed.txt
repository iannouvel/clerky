Inducing labour guidelines focus on providing information and supporting decision-making for pregnant women considering induction of labour. Discussions should include preferences for mode of birth, potential risks and benefits of induction, and alternative options. Women should be given time to make informed decisions and their choices should be respected. Additional monitoring may be recommended for women from minority ethnic backgrounds or living in deprived areas. It is important to consider individual circumstances and preferences when discussing induction of labour.

Advise women to contact their midwife or maternity unit if they change their mind before their next appointment or have concerns about their baby. For preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, do not induce labor before 34 weeks unless there are additional obstetric indications. Offer expectant management until 37 weeks. If a woman has preterm prelabour rupture of membranes after 34 weeks but before 37 weeks, discuss the options of expectant management or induction of labor. If a woman has preterm prelabour rupture of membranes after 34 weeks but before 37 weeks and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or caesarean birth. For prelabour rupture of membranes at term, offer expectant management for up to 24 hours or induction of labor as soon as possible. Respect the woman's decision if she chooses to wait for spontaneous onset of labor for over 24 hours after prelabour rupture of membranes at term. If a woman has prelabour rupture of membranes at term and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or caesarean birth. Discuss methods of induction with a woman who has had a previous caesarean birth. Consider requests for induction of labor after discussing the benefits and risks with the woman. Induction of labor is not generally recommended if a woman's baby is in the breech position. Consider induction of labor for babies in the breech position if birth needs to be expedited and external cephalic version is unsuccessful. Do not induce labor if there is fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise. Do not routinely offer induction of labor to women with a history of precipitate labor. In the event of an intrauterine fetal death, offer support and options for birth. Explain membrane sweeping to women and discuss if they would like the procedure. Discuss the risks and benefits of different methods to induce labor with women. Include information about hyperstimulation with pharmacological methods.

- Uterine activity and fetal condition must be monitored regularly
- Hyperstimulation during induction of labor should be treated promptly
- Follow manufacturers' guidance on the use of dinoprostone and misoprostol preparations
- Offer induction of labor with various methods based on Bishop score
- Assess the position of the baby and the woman's condition before induction
- Monitor fetal wellbeing and uterine contractions after administering medications
- Provide pain relief options during induction of labor
- Consider outpatient induction of labor for low-risk women
- Prevent and manage complications such as uterine hyperstimulation and unsuccessful induction
- Take precautions to avoid cord prolapse during induction
- Check for placenta previa or uterine rupture before induction
- Define terms used in the guideline such as Bishop score and expectant management.

Labour induction can lead to hyperstimulation of the uterus, membrane sweeping can help start labour, and there are guidelines for reducing risks in mothers and babies. Other topics include unsuccessful induction, suspected fetal macrosomia, and setting for induction of labour. Research recommendations include prevention of prolonged pregnancy and optimal timing for induction of labour.

The committee recommended discussing different birth options with women after intrauterine fetal death, especially those with a previous cesarean birth, and respecting their choice. Women with IUFD should be cared for on a one-to-one basis and monitored due to the increased risk of uterine rupture with a scarred uterus. The committee discussed the use of mifepristone for labor induction after IUFD but did not recommend it for women with a previous cesarean birth. Mechanical methods of induction may be safe for women with a previous cesarean birth. Recommendations for induction after a previous cesarean birth align with those for women with live babies or after IUFD.

The committee recommended offering a choice of vaginal dinoprostone preparations based on Bishop score for induction of labor. Misoprostol could be an alternative to dinoprostone, particularly for women who prefer an oral preparation. Mechanical methods of induction, such as balloon catheters, were also considered safe. Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin were deemed the most effective method for promoting vaginal birth within 24 hours for women with a Bishop score of more than 6.

Induction of labor has implications for the birth experience, including increased pain and likelihood of additional interventions. The guideline aims to provide advice on the information and support needed for decision-making about induction of labor, defining appropriate circumstances and effective methods. Recommendations may lead to more individualized care for women with a Bishop score of more than 6.

The guideline provides recommendations on the induction of labor in various clinical scenarios, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making and individualized care.
