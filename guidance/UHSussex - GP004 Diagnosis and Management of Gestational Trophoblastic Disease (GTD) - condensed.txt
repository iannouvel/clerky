Diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)  
Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals 

Key Principles: These guidelines are not prescriptive and should be used in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues. 

Introduction: GTD is a group of pregnancy-related tumors characterized by trophoblastic tissue proliferation. It includes complete and partial molar pregnancies, as well as invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). 

Clinical Features: Symptoms of molar pregnancy include irregular bleeding, hyperemesis, early pregnancy failure, and uterine enlargement. Rare presentations may include hyperthyroidism and early-onset pre-eclampsia. 

Ultrasound Examination: Helpful for pre-evacuation diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis is made through histological examination. 

Complete Moles: Diploid and androgenic in origin, with no fetal tissue. 

Partial Moles: Usually triploid in origin, with two sets of paternal genes and one set of maternal genes. 

Histology: Histological assessment recommended for failed pregnancies to exclude trophoblastic disease. 

Evacuation of Molar Pregnancy: Suction curettage is the method of choice for complete and partial molar pregnancies. 

Follow Up: Patients diagnosed with GTD are referred for follow-up testing. 

Future Pregnancy and Contraceptive Advice: Women advised not to conceive until follow-up is complete. Barrier methods of contraception recommended until hCG levels normalize. 

Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN): Defined by persistent elevation of beta hCG. 

Twin Pregnancy: Seek advice from Fetal Medicine Center if there is doubt about a combined molar and viable twin pregnancy.
