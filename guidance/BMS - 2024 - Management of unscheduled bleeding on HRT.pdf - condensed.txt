BMS Guideline on Management of Unscheduled Bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
The British Menopause Society provides guidelines for assessing and managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Key messages include assessing cancer risk factors, adjusting HRT regimens, and offering examinations and investigations as needed. Recommendations are evidence-based and regularly updated to reflect new studies and information.

Suggested topics for audit are included. Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. 

Section 1: Assessment of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT
When women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination (abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).

History
• Last menstrual period or withdrawal bleed (before and during HRT)
• Bleeding pattern before starting HRT
• Pelvic pain and / or deep dyspareunia
• Discharge
• Vulvovaginal and / or urinary symptoms
• Bleeding pattern: Number of episodes per month, type, duration, regularity, precipitating factors
• HRT use: Duration since initiation or change, current preparation, type of progestogen, adherence
• Application: Where is it applied, any issues with application
• Pregnancy risk, cervical screening history, sexual history, drug interactions, endometrial cancer risk factors

Examination and initial investigations
Offer assessments including abdominal, vulvo-vaginal, cervical appearance, genital tract swabs, cervical screening, pregnancy test, and BMI measurement.

Section 2: Endometrial cancer risk factors in women taking HRT
Major and minor risk factors affecting endometrial cancer risk in women taking HRT are outlined. Factors such as BMI, genetic predisposition, type of HRT preparation, and duration of use are discussed. Recommendations for managing endometrial cancer risk in HRT users are provided.

Endometrial cancer risk factors independent of HRT use
Risk factors such as BMI, genetic conditions, diabetes, and PCOS can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Modifiable factors can help reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

Continuous combined HRT (ccHRT)
Continuous combined HRT with standard dose estrogen and proportionate progestogen dose can reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Recommendations for progestogen use in ccHRT are provided.

Sequential/cyclical HRT (sHRT)
Progestogen use in sHRT can impact the risk of endometrial cancer. Recommendations for progestogen use in sHRT are outlined.

Tricycling (Long-cycle) Progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens
Different HRT regimens can affect the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Recommendations for progestogen use in tricycling HRT are discussed.

Unopposed estrogen
Unopposed estrogen use can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Recommendations for managing unopposed estrogen use are provided.

Progestogen type and endometrial protection
Different types of progestogens can provide endometrial protection in HRT users. Recommendations for progestogen use in HRT are outlined.

Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD)
The use of LNG-IUD can provide endometrial protection in HRT users. Recommendations for the use of LNG-IUD are discussed.

It is common and safe practice to use the 52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens. Women should be counseled about limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium. If unscheduled bleeding occurs, a change of 52 mg LNG IUD should be offered. Synthetic progestogens provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to estrogen dose. Micronised progesterone can be used as an oral or vaginal preparation. Adjustments to the progestogen or HRT preparation should be offered if unscheduled bleeding persists. It is important to understand normal bleeding patterns for different types of HRT preparations. Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer is crucial. Clinical pathways and time-frames for investigating unscheduled bleeding on HRT should be followed.

The following conservative management strategies can be offered through primary care (or an unscheduled bleeding service) for women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer, who have had a thorough assessment and do not report heavy, prolonged, or daily bleeding. Offer adjustments in progestogen or preparation for unscheduled bleeding within 6 months of initiating HRT. If unscheduled bleeding continues 3 months after a change in HRT dose or preparation, offer adjustments for six months. Refer for an urgent ultrasound if certain criteria are met. Women with unscheduled bleeding and risk factors for cancer should be referred for further assessment. Discuss ongoing adjustments to progestogen if ultrasound is preferred. Consider weaning off HRT if ultrasound is declined and offer non-hormonal alternatives. If bleeding continues despite stopping HRT, recommend an urgent referral. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of continuing HRT if a referral is recommended. Offer follow-up and adjustments if bleeding ceases and there is a preference to restart HRT. Consider endometrial assessment if unscheduled bleeding persists after adjustments. Offer endometrial assessment for women with a thickened endometrium. Discuss hysteroscopy for further evaluation if necessary.

Menopausal women with unscheduled bleeding should undergo endometrial assessment, including biopsy and hysteroscopy if necessary. Adjustments in progestogen should be made based on biopsy results. If bleeding persists, further assessment and cessation of HRT may be necessary. Considerations for different types of progestogens and routes of HRT administration should be made to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes. Basic principles include ensuring compliance, appropriate progestogen dose, and lifestyle factors such as weight management. Vaginal estrogens and the 52 mg LNG-IUD may be beneficial in certain cases.

Counsel women with existing endometrial cancer risk factors before using HRT. Consider contraceptive needs to prevent unplanned pregnancies. Manage irregular bleeding with sequential preparations by timing the start with the natural cycle and offering desogestrel. Adjust progestogen dose or type if needed. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases. Hysterectomy should be a last resort after exploring other options. Consider reducing estrogen dose and offering non-hormonal alternatives if unscheduled bleeding persists.
