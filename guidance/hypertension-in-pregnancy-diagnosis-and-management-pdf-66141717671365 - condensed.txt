Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management guidelines published by NICE in 2019 aim to improve care for pregnant women with high blood pressure, including pre-eclampsia. Recommendations include advising pregnant women to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia, such as severe headache, vision problems, and swelling. Other recommendations cover the use of aspirin for high-risk women, assessment of proteinuria, and management of chronic hypertension during pregnancy. It is important to note the risks associated with certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, during pregnancy.

1.3.3 Stop antihypertensive treatment in women taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs if they become pregnant and offer alternatives. 
1.3.4 Advise women taking thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics about the risks during pregnancy and discuss alternative treatment options. 
1.3.5 Advise women taking antihypertensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides, or thiazide-like diuretics that limited evidence has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformations. 
1.3.6 Offer pregnant women with chronic hypertension advice on weight management, exercise, healthy eating, and lowering salt intake. 
1.3.7 Continue existing antihypertensive treatment if safe in pregnancy or switch to an alternative treatment based on blood pressure levels. 
1.3.8 Offer antihypertensive treatment to pregnant women with chronic hypertension if their blood pressure is elevated. 
1.3.9 Aim for a target blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg when using medicines to treat hypertension in pregnancy. 
1.3.10 Consider labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa to treat chronic hypertension in pregnant women based on individual factors. 
1.3.11 Offer pregnant women with chronic hypertension aspirin from 12 weeks onwards. 
1.3.12 Offer PLGF-based testing to help rule out preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. 
1.3.13 Schedule additional antenatal appointments for women with chronic hypertension based on individual needs. 
1.3.14 Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women with chronic hypertension unless medically indicated. 
1.3.15 For women with chronic hypertension after 37 weeks, timing of birth should be agreed upon with the senior obstetrician. 
1.3.16 Offer antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate if planned early birth is necessary. 
1.3.17 Measure blood pressure in women with chronic hypertension daily for the first 2 days after birth. 
1.3.18 Aim to keep postnatal blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg in women with chronic hypertension. 
1.3.19 Switch from methyldopa to alternative antihypertensive treatment after birth if needed. 
1.3.20 Offer a medical review 6 to 8 weeks after birth for women with chronic hypertension.

Impact section on monitoring and treatment of gestational hypertension:

Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women with gestational hypertension unless there are other medical indications. For women with gestational hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg after 37 weeks, timing of birth should be agreed upon between the woman and the senior obstetrician. If planned early birth is necessary, offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate if indicated. 

Postnatal investigation, monitoring, and treatment:

Measure blood pressure daily for the first 2 days after birth, at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth, and as clinically indicated if antihypertensive treatment is changed after birth. Continue antihypertensive treatment if required, advise women on the duration of postnatal antihypertensive treatment, reduce treatment if blood pressure falls below 130/80 mmHg, and adjust treatment if necessary. Write a care plan for women with gestational hypertension who have given birth and are being transferred to community care, including follow-up care, frequency of blood pressure monitoring, thresholds for reducing or stopping treatment, and indications for referral to primary care for blood pressure review. Offer medical reviews to women on antihypertensive treatment 2 weeks after transfer to community care and 6 to 8 weeks after birth. 

Management of pre-eclampsia:

Assessment of women with pre-eclampsia should be performed by a healthcare professional trained in the management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Carry out a full clinical assessment at each antenatal appointment for women with pre-eclampsia and offer admission to hospital for surveillance and interventions if there are concerns for the wellbeing of the woman or baby. Consider using validated risk prediction models to guide decisions on the most appropriate place of care and thresholds for intervention. Offer tests and treatments as listed in the guidelines for managing pregnancy with pre-eclampsia. Offer specific antihypertensive pharmacological treatments based on individual factors and preferences. Record maternal and fetal thresholds for planned early birth before 37 weeks in women with pre-eclampsia. Involve a senior obstetrician in decisions on timing of birth, discuss with the anesthetic team and neonatal team if birth is planned, and offer magnesium sulfate and antenatal corticosteroids if indicated for early birth in line with guidelines. Decide on timing of birth based on the recommendations provided.

Consider antenatal corticosteroids in line with NICE guidelines for preterm labor and birth. Initiate birth within 24 to 48 hours after 37 weeks onwards. Monitor blood pressure in women with preeclampsia post-birth. Start antihypertensive treatment if blood pressure is 150/100 mmHg or higher. Offer transfer to community care if criteria are met. Provide follow-up care and monitoring for women with preeclampsia post-birth. Repeat fetal monitoring tests as needed. Offer advice and treatment for hypertensive disorders during labor. Measure blood pressure hourly in women with hypertension during labor. Consider anticonvulsants for women with severe hypertension or preeclampsia in critical care settings.

Use the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial regimen for magnesium sulfate administration in pregnancy, with caution for skeletal adverse effects in neonates. Avoid using diazepam or phenytoin for eclampsia. Treat severe hypertension with labetalol, nifedipine, or hydralazine. Consider corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation in pre-eclampsia. Choose mode of birth based on clinical circumstances and patient preference. Refer women with severe hypertension or pre-eclampsia to appropriate critical care settings. Adjust antihypertensive treatment for breastfeeding women. Advise on the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in future pregnancies. Inform women with a history of hypertensive disorder in pregnancy about the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease later in life.

Cardiovascular disease: Any hypertension in current or previous pregnancy, pre-eclampsia in current or previous pregnancy, gestational hypertension in current or previous pregnancy, chronic hypertension in current or previous pregnancy. Major adverse cardiovascular event risk increased, cardiovascular mortality risk increased, stroke risk increased, hypertension risk increased. Advise women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to discuss how to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease with their GP or specialist. Consider pre-pregnancy counseling for women who have had pre-eclampsia or hypertension with early birth before 34 weeks. Encourage women who have had pre-eclampsia to achieve and maintain a healthy BMI before their next pregnancy. Recurrence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increases with an inter-pregnancy interval greater than 10 years. Long-term risk of end-stage kidney disease is low in women with a history of pre-eclampsia who have no proteinuria and hypertension at the postnatal review. Do not routinely screen for thrombophilia in women who have had pre-eclampsia.

The committee recommends using PCR and ACR instead of 24-hour urine collection for diagnosing proteinuria in pregnant women. A PCR of 30 mg/mmol is considered significant, but retesting is recommended for results above this threshold. An ACR result of 8 mg/mmol is also diagnostic for proteinuria. Repeat testing may be needed for diagnostic uncertainty. Moving to spot urine tests can save time and improve accuracy in diagnosis. For chronic hypertension in pregnancy, lifestyle advice and medications like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa are recommended. Aspirin may also be offered to reduce adverse outcomes. The recommendations aim to standardize practices and improve outcomes for pregnant women with hypertension. Monitoring and treatment for gestational hypertension should follow similar guidelines to chronic hypertension. Full clinical assessments and validated models can help predict adverse outcomes in women with pre-eclampsia. Admission to hospital should be considered based on risk factors. The recommendations aim to improve consistency in practice and standardize care for pregnant women with hypertension.

The committee recommends using labetalol as the first-line treatment for hypertension in pregnancy, with nifedipine as the next alternative and methyldopa as the third option. Decisions about timing of birth should be based on the risk of adverse outcomes for the woman and baby. For postnatal hypertension, the committee recommends using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as first-line treatment, with beta-blockers as the second-line option. Recommendations on the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and long-term cardiovascular disease are also provided.
