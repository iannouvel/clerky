supplements NICE guideline NG25 Preterm labour and birth .
1. Key recommendations
/C15 Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births should be offered a
history-indicated cervical cerclage. [Grade B]
/C15 Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birthwho have not undergone a history-indicated cerclage may be offered serial sonographic surveillance, asthose who experience cervical shortening may beneﬁt from ultrasound-indicated cerclage while thosewhose cervix remains long (greater than 25mm) have a low risk of second-trimester loss/preterm birth.[Grade B]
/C15 For women with a singleton pregnancy and no other risk factors for preterm birth, insertion of cervicalcerclage is not recommended in women who have an incidentally identiﬁed short cervix. [Grade B]
/C15 In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may bediscussed and considered. [Grade A] [Correction added on 10 March 2023, after original publication: Inbullet 4 of the Key Recommendations, the evidence level has been changed from Grade D to Grade A.]
/C15 In women with a singleton pregnancy insertion of a emergency cerclage may delay birth by an average of34 days, compared with expectant management/bed rest alone in suitable cases. It may also be associatedwith a two-fold reduction in the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation. However, there are onlylimited data to support an associated improvement in neonatal mortality or morbidity. [Grade B]
/C15 The choice of transvaginal cerclage technique (high cervical insertion with bladder mobilization or lowcervical insertion) should be at the discretion of the surgeon [Grade C], but the cerclage should beplaced as high as is practically possible. [Grade C]
2. Background and scope
Cerclage remains one of the standard options for prophylactic intervention in the care of women at risk of pretermbirth and second trimester fetal loss and is used by most obstetricians, despite difﬁculties in identifying thepopulation of women who would most beneﬁt. The procedure, a stitch inserted into the cervix, was ﬁrst performedin 1902 in women with a history of second trimester loss or spontaneous preterm birth suggestive of cervicalinsufﬁciency, with the aim of preventing recurrent loss.

Cervical insufﬁciency is an imprecise clinical diagnosis frequently applied to women with such a history, where it is
assumed that the cervix is ‘weak’ and unable to remain closed during the pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that,
rather than being a dichotomous variable, cervical integrity is likely to be a continuum inﬂuenced by factors relatednot solely to the intrinsic structure of the cervix but also to processes driving premature effacement and dilatation.While cerclage may provide a degree of structural support to a ‘weak’ cervix, its role in maintaining the cervicallength and the endocervical mucus plug as a mechanical barrier to ascending infection may be more important.
There is lack of consensus on the optimal cerclage technique, timing of suture placement, the role of amniocentesis
before emergency cerclage insertion and optimal care following insertion. Complications are not well documented
and often difﬁcult to separate from risks inherent to the underlying condition. The purpose of this guideline is toreview the literature and provide evidence-based guidance on the use of cerclage in women at risk of preterm birthand second trimester loss. This guideline supplements NICE guideline [NG25] Preterm labour and birth.

Within this document we use the terms woman and women’s health. However, it is important to acknowledge thatit is not only people who identify as women for whom it is necessary to access women’s health and reproductive
services in order to maintain their gynaecological health and reproductive wellbeing. Gynaecological and obstetric
services and delivery of care must therefore be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individualswhose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline was developed in accordance with the
standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.2
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE, EMBASE, TRIP, Medline andPubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomized control trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published between 2011 and April 2020. The databases were searchedusing the relevant MeSH terms, including all subheadings and this was combined with a keyword search. Searchwords included ‘cervical cerclage’, ‘cervical suture’, ‘cervical stitch’, ‘midtrimester miscarriage’, ‘McDonald cerclage’,‘Shirodkar cerclage’, ‘infection and cerclage’, ‘tocolytics and cerclage’ and ‘inﬂammatory mediators and cerclage’; thesearch was limited to humans and the English language. The National Library for Health and National GuidelinesClearing House were also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews. The full search strategy is available to viewonline as supporting information (Appendices S1 and S2).
4. De ﬁnitions
Previous terminology (prophylactic, as a planned procedure, emergency, urgent, rescue) of cervical sutures/cerclage
can be ambiguous. More appropriate nomenclature based on indication for cervical suture is recommended. Theterms below are increasingly used in the scientiﬁc literature.
History-indicated cerclage
Insertion of a cerclage as a result of factors in a woman’s obstetric or gynaecological history, which increase the riskof spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth.
3A history-indicated suture is performed as a prophylactic
measure in asymptomatic women and usually inserted as a planned procedure at 11 –14 weeks of gestation.

Preterm Birth
Birth before to 37+0weeks’ gestation.
Ultrasound-indicated cerclage
Insertion of a cerclage as a therapeutic measure in cases of cervical length shortening seen on transvaginal
ultrasound.3Ultrasound-indicated cerclage is performed on asymptomatic women who do not have exposed fetal
membranes in the vagina. Sonographic assessment of the cervix is usually performed between 14 and 24 weeks ofgestation by transvaginal scan and with an empty maternal bladder.
Emergency cerclage (also known as physical exam-indicated or emergency cerclage)
Insertion of cerclage as a salvage measure in the case of premature cervical dilatation with exposed fetal membranesin the vagina.
3This may be discovered by ultrasound examination of the cervix or as a result of a speculum/physical
examination performed for symptoms such as vaginal discharge, bleeding or ‘sensation of pressure’. It can beconsidered up to 27
+6weeks gestation.1
Transvaginal cerclage (McDonald)
A transvaginal purse-string suture placed at the cervical isthmus junction, without bladder mobilization.4
High transvaginal cerclage requiring bladder mobilization (including Shirodkar)
A transvaginal purse-string suture placed following bladder mobilization, to allow insertion above the level of the
cardinal ligaments.5
Transabdominal cerclage
A suture performed via a laparotomy or laparoscopy, placing the suture at the cervicoisthmic junction.6
Occlusion cerclage
Occlusion of the external os by placement of a continuous non-absorbable suture. The theory behind the potentialbeneﬁt of occlusion cerclage is retention of the mucus plug.

5. History-indicated cerclage
5.1. When should a history-indicated cerclage be offered?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women with singleton pregnancies and
three or more previous preterm birthsshould be offered a history-indicatedcervical cerclage1+ B A subgroup analysis of the Medical
Research Council (MRC)/RCOG multicentretrial found bene ﬁt was only conferred for
women with a history of three or moreprevious preterm births and/or secondtrimester losses
History-indicated cerclage should not
routinely be offered to women with lessthan three previous preterm births and/orsecond trimester losses without additionalrisk factors1+ B Subgroup analysis of the MRC/RCOG
multicentre trial showed no bene ﬁt
conferred
It is unknown if the speci ﬁc characteristics
of the previous adverse event are helpfulin the decision to place a history-indicated cerclage. (e.g. painless
dilatation, rupture of membranes, prior
cervical surgery)4 GPP Good quality data are currently lacking to
inform this practice
Cochrane review concluded that, in women with a singleton pregnancy, there was a signiﬁcant reduction
in preterm births compared to controls before 37, 34 and 28 weeks of gestation in women who hadcerclage compared to no cerclage (average risk ratio [RR] 0.77, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.66 –0.89,
incorporating nine studies with 2415 women). Subgroup analysis (assessing history-indicated; short cervixbased on one off ultrasound in women at high risk; short cervix found by serial scan measurements inwomen at high risk; examination indicated; and short cervix found on scan in populations with low ormixed risk) had too few numbers to draw signiﬁcant conclusions.
3Evidence
level 1 +
There is no evidence to suggest an effect on perinatal death. Although the authors concluded that
cerclage probably leads to a reduced risk of perinatal death when compared to no cerclage, the CIcrossed the line of no effect (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 –1.04, based on 10 studies including 2927 women).
When stillbirths and neonatal deaths were considered separately the number of events and sample sizewere reduced considerably. Neonatal morbidity was similar with and without cerclage.
3Evidence
Level 1 +
A pre-speciﬁed subgroup analysis of an international multicentre trial, which recruited 1292 women to
cerclage or no cerclage, coordinated by the MRC and RCOG, found that only women with a history ofthree or more pregnancies ending before 37 weeks of gestation ( n=104) beneﬁtted from cerclage, which
halved the incidence of preterm birth before 33 weeks of gestation (15% versus 32% P>0.05). No effect
was observed in those with only one (birth before 33 weeks of gestation in the cerclage group 14%versus 17% in the expectant group) or two previous early births (birth before 33 weeks of gestation inthe cerclage group 12% versus 14% in the expectant group).

Subgroup analysis of this study also found no beneﬁt for a history-indicated cerclage in women with
previous cervical surgery or uterine abnormalities; the authors concluded that the relatively small numbersin each group limited the reliability of these results.
8Evidence
level 1 +
The studies that have examined the use of pre-pregnancy techniques (e.g. hysterography, cervical
resistance indices, insertion of cervical dilators) to assess cervical weakness were observational and not
designed to test the hypothesis that their use optimized the selection of women for history-indicatedcerclage.

6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage
6.1. When should an ultrasound-indicated cerclage be offered?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
For women with a singleton pregnancy
and no other risk factors for preterm birth,
insertion of cervical cerclage is notrecommended in women who have a shortcervix incidentally identi ﬁed on a late
second trimester ultrasound scan1++ B A number of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) and a meta-analysis have found no
bene ﬁt of cerclage in women with a
cervical length less than 25 mm with noother risk factors for preterm birth
To et al.
11screened 47 123 women at 22 –24 weeks of gestation using transvaginal ultrasound to measure
cervical length; in 470 women (1%), the cervix was 15 mm or less. Of these women, 253 (54%) agreedto participate in a randomized study comparing Shirodkar cerclage ( n=127) with expectant management
(n=126). The incidence of preterm birth before 33 weeks of gestation was similar in both groups,
at 22% (28 of 127) in the cerclage group versus 26% (33 of 126) in the control group (RR 0.84;95% CI 0.54 –1.3; P=0.44), with no signiﬁcant differences in perinatal or maternal morbidity or mortality.Evidence
level 1 ++
This was further conﬁrmed in an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of four RCTs of cerclage
versus expectant management in women with a short cervix (in which women from the previouslydiscussed RCT were included). This meta-analysis reported no overall evidence of beneﬁt of cerclage inwomen with cervical length less than 25mm who had no other risk factors for spontaneous pretermbirth.

level 1 ++
Routine surveillance of women at low risk is not currently recommended by the National Screening Committee.

6.1.1. Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women with a history of one or more
spontaneous second trimester loss orpreterm births who are undergoingultrasound surveillance of cervical lengthshould be offered cerclage if the cervix is25mm or less at gestations less than
24 weeks1++ A A meta-analysis including data from four
RCTs shows that an ultrasound indicatedcerclage for cervical shortening (less than25 mm) in the presence of a history of oneor more spontaneous second trimesterlosses or preterm births, reduces preterm
birth prior to 35 weeks gestation
An ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not
recommended for funnelling of the cervix(dilatation of the internal os on
ultrasound) in the absence of cervical
shortening to 25 mm or less (the closedlength of the cervix)2++ C Observational studies have indicated no
association between preterm birth andfunnelling alone in the absence of a short
cervix
An RCT of ultrasound-indicated cerclage with singleton pregnancies with a history of spontaneous
preterm birth between 17
+0and 33+6weeks of gestation, who were found to have a cervical length of
less than 25mm detected during serial sonographic examinations between 16+0and 21+6weeks of
gestation, reported that when compared with expectant management, cerclage reduced pre-viable birth(at less than 24
+0weeks of gestation: 6.1% versus 14%; P=0.03) and perinatal death (8.8% versus 16%;
P=0.046) but did not prevent birth at less than 35+0weeks of gestation (32% versus 42%; odds ratio
[OR] 0.67; 95% CI 0.42 –1.07) unless cervical length was less than 15 mm (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08 –0.66).13Evidence
level 1 ++
Similar results were reported from a meta-analysis that included 607 pregnancies from four RCTs of
ultrasound-indicated cerclage.14This study reported that in the subgroup of women with singleton
pregnancies with a history of preterm second trimester loss (16+0–23+0weeks of gestation) or birth
before 36 weeks of gestation, cerclage resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in birth before 35 weeks ofgestation (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33 –0.99 and RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 –0.92, respectively) when compared with
expectant management; this reduction was of a similar magnitude to that observed in the previousstudy.
13Evidence
level 1 ++
There are no studies evaluating ultrasound-indicated cerclage performed solely on the presence of
funnelling. However, studies have demonstrated that funnelling is a function of cervical shortening anddoes not appear to independently add to the risk of preterm birth associated with cervical length.

6.2. Who should be offered serial sonographic surveillance with a view to ultrasound-indicated
cerclage?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women with a history of spontaneous
second trimester loss or preterm birthwho have not undergone a history-indicated cerclage may be offered serialsonographic surveillance, as those whoexperience cervical shortening (less than25mm) may bene ﬁt from ultrasound-
indicated cerclage (see 6.1)2++ B A meta-analysis showed similar incidences
of preterm birth with history andultrasound indicated cerclage in women athigh risk
In studies where serial sonographic surveillance of cervical length has been carried out in women with a
history of second trimester loss and/or spontaneous preterm birth, 40% –70% of women maintain a
cervical length of more than 25mm before 24
+0weeks of gestation.8,13,16 –19In three of these studies, 90%
of women who maintained a cervical length of more than 25mm (and therefore did not receive cerclage)gave birth after 34 weeks of gestation. This suggests that serial sonographic surveillance may differentiatebetween women with a prior second trimester loss/preterm birth who might beneﬁt from cerclage andwomen who do not need interventionEvidence
level 2 ++
A meta-analysis by Berghella et al.20compared pregnancy outcomes in singleton gestations with prior
preterm birth that were managed either by cervical length screening with cerclage for short cervicallength or history-indicated cerclage. Cervical length screening with cerclage for short cervical length wasassociated with similar incidences of preterm birth before 37 weeks (31% compared with 32%, RR 0.97;95% CI 0.73 –1.29), preterm birth before 34 weeks (17% compared with 23%, RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.48 –1.2)
and perinatal mortality (5% compared with 3%, RR 1.77; 95% CI 0.58 –5.35) compared with history-
indicated cerclage. In the transvaginal ultrasound group, only 42% developed a short cervix and requiredcerclage. These data support the recommendation that women with a previous second trimester loss/preterm birth can be safely cared for by serial ultrasound surveillance and that this may reduce thenumber of cerclages performedEvidence
level 2 ++
Ultrasound surveillance of cervical length is advocated in women at high and intermediate risk in Element 5 of the
Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle,21the timing of which is dependent on the women’s history.
Women at high risk include:
/C15those with a previous preterm birth or second trimester loss (16 –34 weeks’ gestation)
/C15previous preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) less than 34 weeks
/C15previous use of cerclage
/C15known uterine variant

These women are recommended to be reviewed by a preterm prevention specialist by 12 weeks where possible, or
with the dating scan whichever is sooner, and offered transvaginal cervix scanning as a secondary screening testevery 2 –4 weeks between 16 and 24 weeks.
Women at intermediate risk include:
/C15women including those who have a history of a previous full dilatation C-section
/C15signiﬁcant cervical excisional surgery i.e. large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ)
with an excision depth greater than 1 cm, more than one procedure or a cone biopsy.
These women should undergo a single transvaginal cervix scan no later than 18 –22 weeks as a minimum.
These timings are based on a consensus of experts from the UK Preterm Clinical Network.22Evidence
level 4
There is, however, uncertainty as to how to care for these w omen if a short cervix is identiﬁed in women who have had
serial screening but do not have a history of a previous preter m birth; an ultrasound indicated cerclage may be considered.
7. Can cervical cerclage be recommended in any other groups of women considered at increased
risk of preterm birth?
7.1. Multiple pregnancy
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
The insertion of a history- or ultrasound-
indicated cerclage in women withmultiple pregnancies is notrecommended1++ B Data from meta analyses indicates no
bene ﬁt of cerclage in multiple pregnancies
without additional risk factors
A meta-analysis of ﬁve trials assessed the use of cerclage in multiple pregnancies; 122 women had twin
pregnancies and six had triplet pregnancies. Included studies assessed history-indicated cerclage,ultrasound indicated cerclage and physical exam-indicated cerclage. No statistical difference in perinataldeath was found between cerclage and no cerclage (19.2% versus 9.5%; RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.92 –3.28, ﬁve
trials n=262), signiﬁcant neonatal morbidity (15.8% versus 13.6%; average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 –7.10,
three trials n=116) or composite perinatal death and neonatal morbidity (40.4% versus 20.3%; average
RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.58 –4.11, three trials n=116). No signiﬁcant differences were found in secondary
outcomes such as preterm birth less than 34 weeks, birth weight below 2500 g, respiratory distresssyndrome, caesarean section rates and maternal side-effects. Subgroups were also assessed: ultrasoundindicated cerclage was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight (below 2500 g) compared tono cerclage (average RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 –1.83), very low birth weight (below 1500g) (average RR 3.31,
95% CI 1.58 –6.91) and respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 5.07, 95% CI 1.75 –14.7). However, the
numbers in these subgroups were small so results should be interpreted with caution.

Jarde et al.24also assessed the efﬁcacy of twin pregnancies treated with progesterone, pessary or cerclage
in a meta-analysis. No intervention signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of preterm birth less than 34 or
37 weeks’ gestation, or neonatal death compared to a control group.Evidence

Data from a multicentre retrospective cohort study in twins, where women with a cervix less than 25mm
between 16 and 24 weeks’ gestation either had ultrasound indicated cerclage ( n=57), or no cerclage
(n=83) found that there were no differences in gestational age at birth or spontaneous preterm birth
less than 28 weeks (12 versus 20 adjusted OR 0.3 95% CI 0.68 –1.37). In the subgroup of women with
cervical length less than 15 mm (cerclage n=32 and controls n=39) the interval between diagnosis to
birth was signiﬁcantly prolonged (12.5 /C64.5 versus 8.8 /C64.6 weeks, P<0.001); spontaneous preterm
birth less than 34 weeks was signiﬁcantly decreased (16 versus 31 adjusted OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.31 –0.83) as
was admission to neonatal intensive care unit when the ultrasound indicated group was compared withthe control group. However, there was no difference in rates of preterm birth at gestations less than 32weeks, less than 28 weeks and less than 24 weeks and no effect on perinatal mortality (11.3% versus16.6% P=0.46). Numbers in this study are small and further RCTs are therefore required to assess the
effect of ultrasound indicated cerclage based on different cervical lengths.

7.2. Cervical surgery, trauma and uterine abnormalities
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
The role of history- or ultrasound-indicated
cerclage is uncertain in other high-risk groups,who display no additional risk factors, such as
women with Mullerian anomalies, previous
cervical surgery (cone biopsy, LLETZ or destructiveprocedures such as laser ablation or diathermy) ormultiple dilatation and evacuation1+ B An IPD meta-analysis showed no
difference in preterm birth before35 weeks
Local excisional treatment of the cervix has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth. A meta-analysis of 27 retrospective cohort studies showed an increased risk of pretermbirth less than 37 weeks’ gestation when cold knife conisation was compared to no treatment(14% versus 5%; RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.8 –3.72) and LLETZ versus no treatment (11% versus 7%; RR 1.7,
95% CI 1.24 –2.35). No increased risk was associated with laser ablation.
27Women with cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia have been shown to have an increased background risk of preterm birth
compared to the general population (5.9% versus 5.6%; RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14 –1.35) but the risk of
preterm birth is higher in women who have undergone more than one treatment (13.2% versus 4.1%;RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.65 –5.39) and with increasing depth of excision ( ≤10–12mm: 7.1% versus 3.4%; RR
1.54, 95% CI 1.09 –2.18; ≥10–12mm: 9.8% versus 3.4%; RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.62 –2.31; ≥15–17mm: 10.1%
versus 3.4%; RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.95 –3.93; ≥20mm: 10.2% versus 3.4%; RR 4.91, 95% CI 2.06 –11.68).

Kindinger et al.29aimed to develop a screening model to differentiate women into high and low risk for
preterm birth after excisional treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Longitudinal cervical length
data from 725 pregnant women post treatment attending preterm surveillance clinics over a ten-year
period was analysed. Of these, 13.5% of women received an ultrasound indicated cerclage and 9.7% gavebirth prior to 37 weeks’ gestation; 24.5% of these despite receiving cervical cerclage. Accuracy parametersof interval reduction in cervical length between longitudinal second trimester measurements wereundertaken and a reduction in cervical length of less than 10% between measurements identiﬁed womenat low risk of preterm birth who did not require further surveillance. However, the study wasretrospective and a direct comparison population was lacking. Prospective studies are required toinvestigate this further.Evidence

A consensus of experts from the UK Preterm Clinical Network has recommended women with a history
of signiﬁcant cervical excisional surgery i.e. LLETZ where greater than 10mm excised, or more than oneLLETZ procedure, or a cone biopsy should be referred to a preterm birth prevention specialist and asingle transvaginal cervical scan should be performed between 18 –22 weeks as a minimum. Women with a
known uterine variant should be referred to a preterm prevention specialist by 12 weeks’ gestation wherepossible and offered transvaginal screening every 2 –4 weeks between 16 and 24 weeks’ gestation.

to make evidence-based recommendations regarding efﬁcacy of cerclage in these groups of women. TheIPD meta-analysis of ultrasound-indicated cerclage

8.1. When should a transabdominal cerclage be considered?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
In women with a previous unsuccessful
transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a
transabdominal cerclage may be discussedand considered1+ A Evidence is derived from a multi-centre
RCT randomising women to trans
abdominal cerclage high vaginal or lowvaginally placed cerclage
Transabdominal cerclage can be
performed pre-conceptually or in earlypregnancy. Pre-conceptual proceduresmay be more effective and are notassociated with sub-fertility4 GPP Pre-conceptional insertion should be
considered as it does not affect fertilityrates and technically may be easier withlower anaesthetic and fetal risks
A transabdominal cerclage is usually inserted following an unsuccessful vaginal cerclage or extensive
cervical surgery. The MAVRIC study, a multicentre randomized controlled trial of transabdominal versustransvaginal cerclage randomized women to receive transabdominal cerclage, high vaginal cerclage or lowvaginal cerclage either before conception or at less than 14 weeks of gestation. The data for 111 of 139women who were recruited and who conceived were analysed: 39 had transabdominal cerclage, 39 hadhigh vaginal cerclage and 33 had low vaginal cerclage. Rates of preterm birth less than 32 weeks’ gestationwere signiﬁcantly lower in women who received transabdominal cerclage compared with low vaginalcerclage (8% versus 33%, RR 0.23: 95% CI, 0.07 –0.76; P=0.0157). The number needed to treat to
prevent one preterm birth was 3.9 (95% CI, 2.32 –12.1). There was no difference in preterm birth rates
between high and low vaginal cerclage.
31However, a previous retrospective study has indicated that the
higher a cerclage is placed in cases of short cervix the lower the subsequent odds of preterm birth.32Evidence
level 2 –
There are no RCT studies directly comparing the insertion of a pre-conceptual transabdominal cerclage
with insertion in early pregnancy. Tulandi et al.33evaluated 16 studies of abdominal cerclage involving 678
cases, ﬁnding no difference in the live birth rate when the cerclage was performed before or duringpregnancy. However, pre-conceptual insertion should be considered when possible because of reducedanaesthetics risk and the technical advantage of operating on the uterus of a woman who is not pregnant.Furthermore, there is no evidence that pre-conceptual transabdominal cerclage has any detrimental impacton fertility or care and treatment of early miscarriage.

8.3. How should women who experience delayed miscarriage or fetal death be cared for?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Decisions on care and treatment in cases
of delayed miscarriage or fetal death inwomen with an abdominal cerclage canbe dif ﬁcult and women ’s decision making
should be aided by a senior obstetrician4 GPP No studies have been performed but
senior clinicians should be involved inthese decisions
Complete evacuation through the stitch by
suction curettage or by dilatation andevacuation (up to 18 weeks of gestation)may be performed; alternatively, thesuture may be cut, usually via a posteriorcolpotomy. Failing this, a hysterotomy may
be required or caesarean section may be
necessary; the woman ’s decision should
be aided by a senior obstetrician4D Case reports have been published
regarding evacuation through atransabdominal cerclage or cutting of thesuture
Carers should be aware of the potential psychological sequelae associated with fetal death and miscarriage, and
women and their families supported by debrieﬁng services and the offer of counselling. Families should also besignposted to the relevant patient support groups.
There are no studies evaluating the different methods of uterine evacuation in the event of fetal demise
or the need to terminate a pregnancy. The use of techniques described above has been reported by
experienced clinicians and in case reports.

the chance of birth before 34 weeks ofgestation. However, there are only limited datato support an associated improvement inneonatal mortality or morbidity
Advanced dilatation of the cervix (more than
4cm) or membrane prolapse beyond theexternal os appears to be associated with ahigh chance of cerclage failure3D Data are derived from uncontrolled
studies
Eshanipor et al.
41undertook a systematic review to estimate the effectiveness of physical examination-
indicated cerclage in the presence of cervical dilatation and exposed membranes in the second trimester.Both cohort studies and RCTs were included comparing women who underwent expectant managementwith cervical dilatation between 14 and 27 weeks’ gestation. Ten studies were included although only onewas an RCT, two were prospective cohort studies and seven were retrospective cohort studies; 64%(485) underwent cerclage and 36% (272) had expectant management. Cerclage was associated withincreased neonatal survival (71% compared with 43%; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.19 –2.28) and prolongation of
pregnancy (mean difference 33.98 days, 95% CI 17.88 –50.08). Birth at all preterm gestations except those
prior to 24 weeks was reduced. However, details regarding the exact degree of dilatation at time ofcerclage were not given. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to identify the women most likely tobeneﬁt from emergency cerclage
Evidence
level 2 +
There is no clear evidence that the gestation at which the cerclage is inserted affects the magnitude of prolongation
of the pregnancy; however, consideration should be given to the fact that, in cases presenting before 20 weeks ofgestation, insertion of a emergency cerclage is highly likely to result in a preterm birth before 28 weeks of gestation.Furthermore, emergency cerclage can rarely be justiﬁed beyond 24 weeks’ gestation due to the potential risk ofiatrogenic membrane rupture and subsequent preterm birth.
The aforementioned studies have not provided an analysis of prolongation of pregnancy in relation to
cervical dilatation. However, several other uncontrolled studies have suggested the presence of membraneprolapse beyond the external os and/or cervical dilatation greater than 4cm are signiﬁcant predictors ofcerclage failure. In view of the absence of a control group in these studies, it is not clear whether thisobservation relates to treatment failure or a more advanced underlying process that makes this group ofwomen inherently more likely to give birth.

Although women are often routinely informed of a number of potential complications associated with
cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labour, infection, bleeding and
bladder or cervical damage, there is little published evidence to support this. None of the randomized

qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Maternal white cell count and C-reactive
protein to detect chorioamnionitis beforeinsertion of a emergency cerclage can beused to aid management. The decision toperform these tests should be based onthe overall clinical picture, but in theabsence of clinical signs of
chorioamnionitis, the decision for
emergency cerclage need not be delayed2– D There is limited evidence to inform this
however it is good practice to ensurethere are no signs of developing infectionin the mother
Several studies have linked a raised maternal C-reactive protein level with histological evidence of
chorioamnionitis in cases of preterm labour or PPROM, however the sensitivity and speciﬁcity areconsidered poor and they should be used in conjunction with clinical features.
51,52In an uncontrolled
retrospective review of 17 cases of emergency cerclage, the authors reported that a preoperative C-reactive protein value below 4.0 mg/dl and a maternal white cell count less than 14 000/microlitre wereassociated with prolongation of pregnancy compared with women with values above these cut-offs.Interpretation of these results was confounded by the degree of cervical dilatation, such that thosewomen with higher values also had more advanced cervical dilatationEvidence

11.5. Which technique and material should be used?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
The choice of suture material should be at
the discretion of the surgeon; a non-absorbable suture should be used4 GPP Trials are currently in progress to inform
the use of suture material at present thisshould be at the discretion of the surgeon
The choice of transvaginal cerclage

practice. One RCT has been performed butwas stopped due to slow recruitment andlack of ef ﬁcacy
There is insufﬁcient evidence to support any speciﬁc technique for cerclage insertion. One small RCT
compared Shirodkar ( n=34) and McDonald Cerclage ( n=34) versus bed rest ( n=30) in women with
no evidence of infection. No difference in the preterm birth or perinatal outcomes was found betweenthe three groups.

In a secondary analysis of singleton pregnancy data from four randomized trials of cervical cerclage in
women with a short cervix, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the rate of birth before 33 weeks ofgestation in those with a McDonald cerclage compared with those with a Shirodkar suture, once adjustedfor confounding factors (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.2 –1.3).

Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efﬁcacy of single versus double cerclage. Both concluded
there was no signiﬁcance in preterm birth rates. One, comprising of 33 women, found that the preterm
birth rate less than 34 weeks was comparable between the two groups (10.5% versus 35.7%; P=0.106).70
The second found there was no signiﬁcant difference in prolongation of the pregnancy between single and
double cerclage, however, preterm birth less than 33 weeks was not experienced by any of the women inthe double cerclage group and ﬁve in the single cerclage group.

Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Bed rest in women who have undergone
cerclage should not be routinelyrecommended but should beindividualised, taking into account theclinical circumstances and potentialadverse effects that bed rest could have
on women and their families, in addition
to increased costs for the healthcaresystem4 GPP Limited data exists to support the use of
bed rest but individualisation of care shouldbe considered as well as the risksassociated with prolonged immobilization
There are no studies comparing bed rest in women undergoing cervical cerclage. A Cochrane review of bed
rest in women at high risk of preterm birth identiﬁed only one randomized cluster study of uncertainmethodological quality. A comparison was made between 432 women prescribed bed rest and 834 womenprescribed no intervention/placebo. Preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation was similar in both groups(7.9% in the intervention group versus 8.5% in the control group: RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.62 –1.37).

12.3. Is there a role for post-cerclage serial sonographic surveillance of cervical length?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
While routine serial sonographic measurement of the
cervix is not recommended it may be useful in
individual cases following ultrasound-indicated cerclageto offer timely administration of steroids or in uterotransfer3D This is considered good
practice
In the presence of history-indicated cerclage additional
ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not routinelyrecommended as, compared with expectantmanagement, it may be associated with an increase inboth pregnancy loss and birth before 35 weeks ofgestation3D Data are limited to
retrospective studies withsmall numbers
The decision to place a emergency cerclage following
an elective or ultrasound-indicated cerclage should bemade on an individual basis taking into account theclinical circumstances4 GPP Care should be individualised
Several studies have shown a signiﬁcant increase in cervical length following the insertion of elective,
ultrasound-indicated and emergency cerclage.
32,74-77A number of retrospective studies have indicated that
the higher the cerclage is placed the lower the risk of subsequent preterm delivery.32,78Evidence
level 2 –
In a retrospective cohort study involving 24 women with a history-indicated cerclage and subsequent
cervical length shortening to less than 25mm on ultrasound, 19 women had expectant management andﬁve women underwent insertion of a reinforcing cerclage.
79Repeat suture insertion was associated with a
signiﬁcantly earlier gestational age at birth (21 versus 33 weeks of gestation; P=0.002) and an increased
second trimester loss rate (80% versus 15%; P=0.01). However, the numbers are small and selection
criteria for choosing expectant management over repeat suture insertion were not deﬁned and hencethese results may be subject to bias. This ﬁnding was supported by a further retrospective cohort studyby Simcox et al.
80which assessed 25 women with a previous cerclage and evidence of membranes
prolapsing through the ﬁrst suture. Of these women, 13 had a second reinforcing suture and 12 hadexpectant management. Women with a reinforcing cerclage were more likely to give birth at an earliergestation compared with those who had expectant management (26

12.4. Is fetal ﬁbronectin testing useful following insertion of a cervical cerclage?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Routine fetal ﬁbronectin testing is not
recommended post-cerclage. However, thehigh negative predictive value of fetalﬁbronectin testing for subsequent birth at
less than 30 weeks of gestation inasymptomatic high-risk women with acerclage in place may provide reassuranceto women and clinicians in individual cases2+ C Limited data exist indicates however, there
is a high negative predictive value of fetalﬁbronectin following cerclage
In a retrospective observational study involving 910 asymptomatic women at high risk of preterm birth,
including 159 with a cervical cerclage in place, fetal ﬁbronectin testing for the prediction of birth before30 weeks of gestation was shown to have a similar negative predictive value in both groups (over 98%)but a signiﬁcantly lower speciﬁcity (77% versus 90%; P<0.001) in those with a suture.
81Evidence

A further small study by Benson et al.82undertook 71 ﬁbronectin tests in women presenting with
symptoms of labour post cervical cerclage between 23 and 34 weeks’ gestation ﬁnding the sensitivity,speciﬁcity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for birth within 2 weeks of fFN testingwere 100, 78, 28 and 100% respectively. Evidence

12.6. Should women be offered an Arabin pessary or progesterone instead of a cerclage?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
There is no evidence that either progesterone or Arabin
pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical
cerclage1– C Data are currently lacking
but trials are ongoing
Multiple studies have compared different agents (cerclage, progesterone and pessaries) for the prevention of preterm
birth, however these often do not control for clinician preference and many of the studies are retrospective innature.
The 2017 Cochrane review assessed the efﬁcacy of cerclage versus progesterone in high risk women for
preventing preterm birth. Two trials were included comprising of 129 women with a short cervix onultrasound. However, numbers were too small to detect signiﬁcant differences.
3Evidence
level 1 –
A meta-analysis was undertaken by Jarde assessing the effectiveness of progesterone, cerclage and Arabin
pessary insertion for preventing preterm birth in singleton pregnancies, which included 36 trials(9425 women). Progesterone was most effective, reducing preterm birth less than 34 weeks (OR 0.44;95% CI 0.22 –0.79; NNT 9), less than 37 weeks (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41 –0.79; NNT 9) and neonatal death
(OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.28 –0.58) compared with control but the data was heterogeneous and the indication for
treatment included women with just a history of previous preterm birth and others who had asonographically short cervix. Results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

A number of randomized controlled trials are planned comparing the efﬁcacy of cerclage versus pessary versus
progesterone.

13. When should the cerclage be removed?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the
recommendation
A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before
labour, usually between 36+1and 37+0weeks of gestation,
unless birth is by pre-labour caesarean section, in which casesuture removal could be delayed until this time4 GPP This is considered
good practice
In women presenting in established preterm labour, the
cerclage should be removed to minimize potential trauma to
the cervix4 GPP This is considered
good practice
A high (inserted with bladder mobilization) cervical cerclage
will usually require anaesthesia for removal4 GPP This is considered
good practice
All women with a transabdominal cerclage require birth by
caesarean birth, and the abdominal suture may be left in placefollowing birth4 GPP This is considered
good practice
There are no studies comparing elective removal of transvaginal cerclage with removal in labour. However, in the
absence of preterm labour, elective removal at 36 –37 weeks of gestation is advisable owing to the potential risk of
cervical injury in labour and the minimal risk to a neonate born at this gestation.
There are no studies regarding the use of anaesthesia in the removal of a cerclage inserted with bladder mobilization
but, given that the technique involves burial of the suture, an anaesthetic is likely to be necessary for removal.Decisions regarding use of anaesthetic should be taken jointly with the woman.
There are no published studies on long-term outcome comparing a policy of removing a transabdominal cerclage to
it remaining in place. However, if further pregnancies are contemplated, it is reasonable to recommend leaving thecerclage in place. There have been anecdotal reports of suture ‘pulling through’ prior to labour, and a vaginal birthcan occur safely if this is identiﬁed.

13.1. Should the cerclage be removed following PPROM?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
In women with PPROM between 24 and
34 weeks of gestation and without
evidence of infection or preterm labour,delayed removal of the cerclage for48 hours can be considered to facilitate inutero transfer4 GPP Care should be individualised
Delayed suture removal until labour
ensues, or birth is indicated, is associatedwith an increased risk of maternal/fetalsepsis and is not recommended1– C Data are derived from one RCT which was
terminated early but interim analysisindicated there is no increasedprolongation of pregnancy
Given the risk of neonatal and/or maternal
sepsis and the minimal bene ﬁto f4 8h o u r s
of latency in pregnancy with PPROMbefore 23 and after 34 weeks of gestation,delayed suture removal is unlikely to beadvantageous in this situation1– C Data are derived from the same RCT and
there was a suggestion leaving thecerclage in place was associated withhigher rates of chorioamnionitis
A multicentre RCT conducted by Galyean et al.
89assessed women where a cerclage was placed less than
24 weeks’ gestation in singleton or twin pregnancies with a subsequent rupture of membranes between22 and 33 weeks’ gestation. Women were then randomized to retention or removal of the cerclage.Expectant management was then performed and birth expedited in the presence of chorioamnionitis, fetaldistress or other medical or obstetric indications. The study was terminated after 56 women wererecruited in 10 years as, even if the intended sample size of 142 was reached, interim statistical analysisdemonstrated that it was unlikely that leaving a cerclage in situ after PPROM would prolong gestation.There was also the suggestion that leaving the suture in place was associated with higher rates ofchorioamnionitis and no beneﬁt in terms of steroid administration.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
