Third trimester acquisition:
- Increased risk of perinatal morbidity.
- Treatment with aciclovir should not be delayed.
- Caesarean section recommended for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester.
- Type-specific HSV antibody testing advisable for women presenting with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester.

It is recommended that an initial plan of delivery should be based on the assumption that all first episode lesions are primary genital herpes. Daily suppressive aciclovir 400 mg three times daily should be considered from 36 weeks of gestation. Caesarean section should be recommended to all women presenting with primary episode genital herpes lesions at the time of delivery. In cases of recurrent genital herpes infections in the mother, conservative management of the neonate is advised. Efforts to prevent postnatal transmission of HSV are important. All possible care has been undertaken to ensure the publication of the correct dosage of medication and route of administration.
