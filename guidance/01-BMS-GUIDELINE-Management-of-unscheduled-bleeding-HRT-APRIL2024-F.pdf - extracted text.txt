Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
The British Menopause Society (BMS) is the specialist authority for
menopause and post reproductive health in the UK. The BMS educates,
informs and guides healthcare professionals, working in both
primary and secondary care, on menopause and all aspects of post
reproductive health.
BMS guidelines, prepared by the BMS medical advisory council in partnership
with other specialist organisations and Royal Colleges, address key disorders
and controversial topics relating to menopause and post reproductive health.
They reflect new studies together with recent medical and scientific information
from articles in professional journals, plus informal consensus.
The guidelines are evidence-based, comprehensively referenced and peer
reviewed and they are regularly updated.
This joint guideline has been prepared on behalf of the British Menopause Society,
in partnership with the British Society of Gynaecological Endoscopy, British
Gynaecological Cancer Society, Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare,
Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT), Royal College of General Practitioners and the
Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists.

Key Messages
Assessment of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT
.
When women present with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, clinical assessment
should start with a comprehensive review detailing bleeding patterns, HRT
preparations and individual risk factors for cancer. Offer an examination
(abdominal, pelvic) and, where relevant, initial investigations such as cervical
screening, lower genital tract swabs and body-mass index (BMI).
Endometrial cancer risk factors in women taking HRT
.
•
.
•
Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, independent of
HRT, should be identified. Major risk factors are BMI ≥ 40 and hereditary
conditions such as Lynch or Cowden syndrome. Minor risk factors include
BMI 30-39, diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Optimisation
of modifiable factors can, in themselves, reduce episodes of unscheduled
bleeding on HRT and endometrial cancer risk.
A monthly progestogen dose, in proportion to the estrogen dose, is
recommended in women with a uterus.
In women using sequential HRT (sHRT), offer a minimum of 10 days
norethisterone (NET) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), or 12 days of
micronised progesterone, per month.
Women taking a sequential preparation (sHRT) over the age of 45 should be
offered, after five years of use or by age 54 (whichever comes first), a change
to continuous combined (ccHRT).
When to investigate unscheduled bleeding on HRT
•
.
•
In the absence of risk factors for endometrial cancer, offer adjustments in the
progestogen or HRT preparation, for 6 months in total, if unscheduled bleeding
a) occurs within six months of starting HRT or b) is persisting three months after a
change in HRT dose or preparation.
If unscheduled bleeding continues in low-risk women, after six months of
adjustments, discuss the options of an urgent ultrasound (within six weeks)
versus weaning off HRT and consideration of non-hormonal alternatives (to avoid
invasive investigations).
For those women who elect to stop HRT, if the bleeding has settled at a 4-week
follow-up, and continued cessation of HRT is acceptable, no further investigations
are required. If the bleeding has settled at a 4-week follow-up and there is a
preference to restart HRT, offer adjustments in HRT for six months and then an
urgent ultrasound if bleeding is heavy/persistent during the 6 months or, is
continuing after this interval.
Offer an urgent TVS (within 6 weeks) if the first presentation with bleeding occurs
more than six months after initiating, or three months after changing, the HRT
preparation.
Offer an urgent TVS (within 6 weeks), irrespective of interval since starting, or
changing, HRT preparations if a) bleeding is prolonged / heavy or, b) there are 2
minor risk factors for endometrial cancer.
Offer an urgent suspicion of cancer pathway (USCP) referral to women with one
major or three minor risk factors for endometrial cancer - irrespective of bleeding
type or interval since starting or changing HRT preparations. Adjustments to the
progestogen, or stopping HRT, should be offered whilst awaiting assessment.

How should unscheduled bleeding on HRT be investigated
•
•
.
Women with unscheduled bleeding, in the presence of a uniform
endometrium which is fully visualised, and measures ≤ 4 mm with ccHRT or <
7 mm with sHRT, can be reassured that the risk of endometrial cancer is low.
Offer HRT adjustments for 6 months and then offer endometrial assessment,
on an urgent pathway, if bleeding increases during the 6 months or, is
continuing after this interval.
Women with a thickened endometrium on TVS (>4 mm for ccHRT or > 7
mm for sHRT) should be offered referral to the urgent suspicion of cancer
pathway (USCP) for endometrial assessment (biopsy and / or hysteroscopy).
In the presence of a normal endometrial biopsy, discuss adjustments in the
progestogen and provide reassurance for three months. If hysteroscopy and
biopsy are normal, reassurance can be provided for six months.
Adjusting HRT to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes
•
Assess adherence and understanding of how to use the prescribed
preparation including dose and duration of progestogen – for example,
-
would a combined patch or pill reduce administration errors when compared
to a separate estrogen and progestogen component.
Offer all women a 52 mg LNG-IUD; this preparation reduces episodes of
unscheduled bleeding when compared to all other preparations.
Oral preparations provide higher rates of amenorrhoea when compared to
transdermal preparations and could be offered, if there are no risk factors
for thrombosis, as a) a first-line therapy or b) to women who have recurrent
unscheduled bleeding with transdermal preparations.
Offer vaginal estrogens if there are atrophic findings on examination.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Introduction
Unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is defined as irregular
bleeding which occurs after initiating, or changing, a HRT preparation which should
be'bleed free' - continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (ccHRT) or,
which occurs, in addition to the scheduled monthly withdrawal bleed in persons
taking sequential preparations (sHRT).(¹) Unscheduled bleeding within the first six
months of initiating HRT or, within three months of a change in dose or preparation
in those already established on HRT, is common. It can affect up to 38% of people
using sHRT and 41% using ccHRT. It is a major factor leading to repeat consultations
and cessation of HRT.(3)
HRT was prescribed to 1.9 million women in the UK in 2021/2022 - a 35% increase
from the preceding year. Over the past decade, prescriptions have increased annually,
by 13.6%, in women aged 50 years or older. (4) In England, estradiol gel and micronised
progesterone were the top two prescribed HRT items in 2022 with total number
of identified persons prescribed micronised progesterone increasing by 125%.(5) In
parallel with this increase in prescribing there has been a rapid rise in unscheduled
bleeding on HRT and a 43% increase, over the past 3 years, in referrals to the Urgent
Suspicion of Cancer Pathway (USCP). Overall this change in referral pattern does not
appear to have resulted in more cancers being diagnosed, which rose by 2% over the
same interval. (1,6,7) An increase in referrals, for those who appear to be at lower risk of
endometrial cancer, may impact on the ability of organisational structures to attain
the national '28-day faster cancer diagnosis recommendations' and increase anxiety
in women awaiting assessment.
The reasons behind this increase are multiple. As well as the steady increase in the use
of HRT since the NICE guidance in 2015 (8), there has been an increase in use of HRT
amongst peri-menopausal women who, by definition, often have irregular bleeding.
The wider availability of transdermal preparations has enabled women with complex
comorbidities, which may be independent risk factors for endometrial cancer, to
access HRT. In addition, there is an increasing tendency for off-license prescribing of
higher dose estrogen with sub-optimal dosages of progestogen. Whilst all irregular
bleeding is distressing, there is a need to prioritise investigations for those with a
potential increased risk of endometrial cancer, over those in whom endometrial
cancer is unlikely.
The purpose of this guideline is to provide recommendations which stratify
management for unscheduled bleeding according to risk of endometrial cancer,
ensuring best outcomes for all women whilst using NHS resources appropriately.

Methodology
On behalf of the British Menopause Society (BMS) an expert review panel was
established, including primary and secondary care clinicians with expertise in the
management of menopause, with representatives from key related organisations,
including the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG), the British
Gynaecological Cancer Society (BGCS) and the British Society for Gynaecological
Endoscopy (BSGE), and service development partners from NHS England and GIRFT
(Getting it Right First Time). For each topic, a focused literature review was completed
to develop evidence led recommendations which were ratified by consensus
review within the panel and by guideline groups. In many areas there is a paucity
of evidence and the recommendations are based on expert opinion. This is a live
document and as new evidence becomes available, the guidance in these areas will
be updated.
No modelling or cost analyses have been performed in drawing up this guideline.
This is a clinical guideline designed to facilitate and standardise the management
of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Our focus is on utilising
resources efficiently to ensure women are not over investigated whilst at the same
time not missing those in whom endometrial cancer is a possibility. It is recognised
that many organisations have already drawn up their own guidelines based on their
own resources and it is hoped this document will serve as a guide to support and
inform the further development of these guidelines. Suggested topics for audit are
included.
Within this document we use the terms woman and women's health. However, it
is important to acknowledge that it is not only women for whom it is necessary
to access women's health and reproductive services in order to maintain their
gynaecological health. Gynaecological services and delivery of care must be
appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals whose gender
identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.

Section 2: Endometrial cancer risk factors in women taking HRT
The incidence of endometrial cancer in relation to a woman's individual risk factors
and specific HRT preparation are outlined in this section. Table 1 summarises this
evidence and categorises these risk factors into major or minor, to enable triage
of women who present with unscheduled bleeding onto the correct assessment
pathway (non-urgent, urgent and urgent suspicion of cancer pathway (USCP)) as
outlined in Sections 3 and 4.
Tables 2 and 3 (combined in Appendix 1) outline prescribed estrogen dosages,
in relation to specific transdermal and oral preparations, and the recommended
progestogen dose, for ultra-low to high dose estrogen.

Endometrial cancer risk factors independent of HRT use
•
Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia, independent of HRT, should be
identified. Major risk factors include BMI ≥ 40 and hereditary conditions
such as Lynch or Cowden syndrome. Minor risk factors include BMI 30-39,
diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Optimisation of modifiable
factors can, in themselves, reduce episodes of unscheduled bleeding on HRT
and endometrial cancer risk.
Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK; the reported
incidence in women who present with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), i.e. those
who are not taking HRT, is 3-10%. (10, 11) The incidence increases with age; rates (per
100,000 women) rise sharply from the age of 55 and reach a peak at age 70 to 74.
The age-related incidence in the UK is 0.7% for women aged 50-54, 1.2% aged 55-59,
1.3% aged 60-64, and 1.5% aged 65-74.(12)
Genetic factors can increase risk by 30-50%, with conditions such as Lynch and
Cowden syndrome considered major factors. (13) Obesity is the strongest risk
factor for endometrial cancer with 40% of cases associated with this; BMI ≥ 40
confers a tenfold higher risk when compared to a BMI within the normal range.
(14) Consideration of weight loss strategies, and support for this, is associated with a
reduction in endometrial hyperplasia and cancer risk. (15, 16) Other factors that affect the
bioavailability of estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), such as diabetes,
PCOS and unstable liver disease, can increase endometrial cancer risk.(11)
Risk of endometrial cancer in HRT users who DO NOT report unscheduled
bleeding
Effect of HRT preparation on endometrial cancer risk
•
.
Inform amenorrhoeic postmenopausal women taking a continuous
combined preparation (ccHRT), which contains standard dose estrogen and a
proportionate progestogen dose, that endometrial cancer risk appears to be
lower than in non-HRT users.
Women taking a sequential preparation (sHRT) over the age of 45 should be
offered, after five years of use or by age 54 (whichever comes first), a change
to ccHRT.
In women using sHRT, offer a minimum of 10 days norethisterone (NET) or
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), or 12 days of micronised progesterone,
per month; recommending two weeks per 28 day cycle with progestogen
and two weeks without may help to reduce administration and prescribing
errors.
A monthly progestogen dose, in proportion to the estrogen dose, is
recommended in women with a uterus. It should be noted that more than
six months of unopposed estrogen or 12 months of tricycling (estrogen
daily with a progestogen course every 3 months), are major risk factors for
endometrial cancer.
Counsel women there are limited data relating to the optimal progestogen
dose needed to provide endometrial protection in women taking high dose
estrogen (particularly in perimenopausal women taking sHRT).

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Continuous combined HRT (CCHRT):
Administration of daily (continuous) progestogen suppresses endometrial
growth leading to amenorrhoea and atrophy.(17) This appears to reduce the risk
of endometrial cancer, compared with non-users, with the greatest effect seen in
women with a BMI ≥ 30. (18-20) In women who do not report unscheduled bleeding,
the risk of endometrial cancer with ultra-low to standard dose estrogen, and a
progestogen dose which is in proportion, is < 1%.(21) There are limited data assessing
risk with moderate or high dose estradiol use. Table 2 outlines prescribed estrogen,
in relation to specific transdermal and oral preparations for ultra-low, low, standard,
moderate and high dosages.

Sequential/cyclical HRT (SHRT):
In women over 50, who have no unscheduled bleeding and use
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or norethisterone (NET) for 10-12 days of
the month, the relative risk of endometrial cancer is similar to non-users. If these
progestogens are used for less than 10 days, this risk is three-fold higher after
six months use (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7). (21-23) Micronised progesterone (MP), in
conjunction with standard dose estrogen, provides endometrial protection if given at
a dose of 200mg for 12-14 days of the month for up to five years use.(24)
When compared to non-users, if sHRT (progestogen for 10-12 days) is used for
more than five years, the risk of endometrial cancer is almost three times higher (RR
2.9 (95% CI 1.8-4.6)). (21-23) In women who are perimenopausal at the natural age (>
age 45), switching to ccHRT should be offered after five years of sHRT or by age 54
(whichever comes first). It can also be considered after 12-18 months of sequential
use, if women want to try ccHRT to see if they can achieve a bleed-free regimen at an
earlier point.(25)
Tricycling (Long-cycle) Progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens
This is where estrogen is given daily but a reduced progestogen course (7-10 days)
is given every three months. When compared to use of a monthly progestogen
course - NET or MPA for 10-12 days - the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and
cancer is higher; 7.5% vs 0% at 12 months (p=0.005) and 11% vs 1.4% by 36 months
(p=0.01).(26, 27) The risk of endometrial cancer when tricycling incorporates moderate
or high dose estrogen, or micronised progesterone, is unknown.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
If a shortened duration of progestogen is considered in women with an intolerance
to all progestogen types (including 52 mg LNG-IUD and off-license use of standard
dose estrogen with 150 micrograms of daily desogestrel or x3 noriday tablets i.e.
1.05 mg NET), and in whom hysterectomy is not suitable or acceptable, informed
counselling about endometrial risk, and the lack of evidence to support surveillance
accuracy (six monthly ultrasound), should be discussed and documented.
Unopposed estrogen
There is strong evidence to support an increased risk of endometrial cancer with
unopposed estrogen (i.e no progestogen use) in people with a uterus. A Cochrane
review (27) reported high rates of endometrial hyperplasia, compared with placebo,
after 12 and 24 months of standard dose unopposed estrogen use; OR 8.4 (95% CI
5.5-12.9) and OR 11.9 (95% CI 7.8-18.1) respectively. At one, two and three years, the
proportion of women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia was 14.7%, 35.5% and
62% (respectively) – compared with 0.3% in the placebo group. There are limited data
on risk with moderate or high dose unopposed estrogen use.
•
Progestogen type and endometrial protection
Counsel peri- and postmenopausal women considering use of a 52 mg LNG-
IUD that it can be used for endometrial protection with ultra-low to high
estrogen dosages for up to five years.
Counsel women that a) tibolone and, b) progestogens (norethisterone,
medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, dydrogesterone, micronised
progesterone) when combined with standard dose estrogen, provide
equivalent protection against endometrial cancer.
Women taking moderate or high dose estrogen should be informed that the
adequacy of endometrial protection provided by micronised progesterone
is uncertain. The use of 200 mg as a continuous preparation, and 300 mg as
a sequential preparation, should be offered if using high dose estrogen or if
unscheduled bleeding occurs with ultra-low to moderate dose estrogen.
Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD)
Mirena® (52 mg LNG IUD) has a four-year license in the UK for progestogenic
opposition of estrogen within HRT. The Food and Drug administration recommends
use with a uterine depth less than or equal to 10 cm and NICE (28) advises against use if
submucosal fibroids are more than 3 cm.
Studies have shown all 52 mg LNG IUD offer sufficient endometrial protection
against ultra-low to high dose estrogen for up to five years of use in both peri- and
postmenopausal women. (29-33) As a result, it is common and safe practice to use the
52 mg LNG IUD for five years within HRT regimens (outside manufacturer's license).
There are a paucity of data relating to endometrial protection when estrogen above
high dose is used and whether additional progestogen is required. Women should be
counselled about this and the limitations of ultrasound in assessing the endometrium
if unscheduled bleeding occurs (with the higher likelihood that hysteroscopy may
be required). If at 4 years of use, new unscheduled bleeding develops, a change of 52
mg LNG IUD should be offered (if cancer exclusion tests are normal), particularly in
women using over licensed estrogen dosages and in those with a BMI ≥ 40.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
There are insufficient data to guide whether a malpositioned 52 mg LNG IUD
provides adequate endometrial protection when used as part of HRT. Discuss with
the woman a 52 mg LNG IUD may need to be correctly positioned at the fundus
for maximum effectiveness. In relation to contraceptive use, the FSRH suggest’as a
general guide any of the following findings would usually be an indication to suggest
that the IUC is removed and replaced: IUC> 2 cm from the fundus; IUC within the cervical
canal (fully or partially); or IUC user experiencing symptoms that may be related to
malpositioned IUC (e.g. pain or bleeding).(29) One study (34) reported an association with
irregular endometrial suppression and breakthrough bleeding when a specially
designed intracervical LNG-IUD was compared to fundal placement; until high-
quality studies assess efficacy for endometrial protection in HRT users, women who
present with unscheduled bleeding and a malpositioned 52 mg LNG IUD should be
offered alternate progestogens until IUD replacement.
Synthetic Progestogens
Synthetic progestogens such as NET, MPA, levonorgestrel and dydrogesterone,
provide equivalent endometrial protection when the dose is in proportion to ultra-
low, low, standard or moderate dose estrogen (see Table 3). (27, 35, 36) There are limited
data assessing optimal dose for endometrial protection when high dose estrogen is
prescribed.
Micronised progesterone (MP); dose and duration of use
MP can be used as an oral or vaginal (off-license) preparation. The Kronos Early
Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) and Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin
Interventions trials (PEPI) (37, 38) compared sHRT (200 mg MP with standard dose
estrogen) to placebo, over four years, and both reported equivalent endometrial
cancer rates. The E3N cohort study (39) assessed endometrial cancer rates in 65,630 HRT
users over ten years of whom 40% were taking oral MP; use for less than five years did
not appear to increase risk (hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% CI 0.99-1.97).
There is limited evidence assessing the long-term endometrial protective effect (>
5 years) when micronised progesterone is used as a continuous preparation and
this should be considered a research priority. Although the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study reported a two-fold association
between micronised progesterone use and endometrial cancer, when compared with
non-users (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.53-3.83), the majority of participants used sequential,
rather than continuous preparations, and duration of HRT was not adjusted for.(35)
There are insufficient data to advise on endometrial cancer risk when micronised
progesterone, at a dose used for low or standard dose estrogen, is used in
combination with moderate or high dose estrogen. Until evidence relating to safety
with moderate and high dose estrogen is available, a pragmatic approach needs
to be considered, as the risk to breast tissue from increasing the progesterone dose
is also unknown; the use of 200 mg as a continuous preparation and 300 mg as a
sequential preparation should be offered if using high dose estrogen (24, 39-42) or, if
unscheduled bleeding occurs with low to moderate dose estrogen (Table 3). This
should be considered a research priority as high-quality outcomes may enable
lower dosage use in women taking high-dose estrogen or, conversely, may stratify
if women with risk factors for endometrial cancer (diabetes, raised BMI) should be
offered increased dose micronised progesterone with lower estrogen dosages.

Unbalanced estrogen to progestogen dose
British Menopause Society (BMS) guidance (25) recommends a progestogen dose in
proportion to the estrogen dose in people who have a uterus, to reduce unscheduled
bleeding and endometrial cancer risk. (20, 24, 25, 41) Table 3 summarises this section
and outlines the progestogen dose that appears to provide adequate endometrial
protection for different strengths of licensed estrogen dosages (ultra-low, low,
standard, moderate and high).

^ There is limited evidence in relation to optimal MPA dose with high dose estrogen; the advised dose is based on studies reporting 10 mg
providing protection with up to moderate dose estrogen.
Oral versus vaginal (off-license) micronised progesterone (MP)
A systematic review of 14 studies (24) assessed the impact, on endometrial histology, of
using vaginal micronised progesterone. Of the five randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
included, the comparator groups were 52 mg LNG-IUD, transdermal NET and oral MPA.
Using vaginal micronised progesterone as either a sequential (200 mg for 12 days)
or continuous preparation (100 mg/day), for three years, were sufficient to provide
endometrial protection with standard or low-dose estrogen. There are insufficient data
to advise on endometrial protection when vaginal MP is used 100 mg alternate days,
100 mg as a sequential preparation, (24, 25, 41) or for more than three years.
A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up of 4.8 years (43), reported that
45 mg of vaginal MP used for 10 days of the month, in combination with low dose
estradiol, resulted in higher rates of endometrial hyperplasia (12.7% vs 3.1%, p<0.001).

In the absence of individual risk factors for endometrial cancer,
perimenopausal women taking sHRT, containing ultra-low to standard dose
estrogen, who have unscheduled bleeding and a thickened endometrium

lower than in women with postmenopausal bleeding. The continuing need
for sHRT should be regularly assessed as risk increases with duration of use
(more than 5 years).

In the absence of individual risk factors for endometrial cancer,
postmenopausal women taking ccHRT, containing low or standard dose
estrogen, who have unscheduled bleeding and a thickened endometrium
should be counselled that endometrial hyperplasia and cancer risk appears
lower than women with postmenopausal bleeding. However, the continuing
need for long-term ccHRT should be regularly assessed as risk appears to
increase with duration of use (more than 5 years).
Women should be counselled that risk of endometrial cancer with moderate
or high dose estrogen plus micronised progesterone is unknown in the
presence of unscheduled bleeding.
There are limited data on the rates of endometrial cancer in women who present
with unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Endometrial outcomes in women with a
thickened endometrium and unscheduled bleeding are summarised in Table 4 (1,44-
49) – the studies relating to HRT users, although adjusting for confounders such as
BMI/ diabetes, included women using standard dose estrogen, for less than 5 years,
often in combination with a daily synthetic progestogen and were not adequately
powered precluding a more robust evaluation of the relative risks of endometrial
cancer. Where reported, an endometrial thickness of 5 mm or more was used for both
CCHRT and SHRT. There are limited data assessing outcomes with moderate or high
dose estrogen (particularly in perimenopausal women who may have intermittent
endogenous ovarian activity), micronised progesterone or use of ccHRT for more
than five years - these areas should be considered research priorities.

have a polyp.(5
(50)
Endometrial hyperplasia and cancer risk in users of ccHRT containing standard
dose estrogen appears lower than non-users with PMB. However, risk of diagnosing
endometrial cancer in women with unscheduled bleeding on ccHRT may increase
with duration of use; 4:1000 with up to three years use, 9:1000 with 4-6 years use and
19:1000 with more than six years use. (1) Endometrial cancer risk in women using sHRT
appears lower than non-users with PMB, but higher than users of ccHRT; risk may
relate to total duration of sHRT use, progestogen dose and / or total number of days
in the month of progestogen use - it is important to ascertain these factors when
discussing and stratifying risk.

Section 3: When to investigate unscheduled bleeding on HRT
•
•
In the absence of risk factors for endometrial cancer, offer adjustments in
the progestogen or HRT preparation for 6 months in total, if unscheduled
bleeding a) occurs within six months of starting HRT or b) is persisting three
months after a change in HRT dose or preparation.
If unscheduled bleeding continues in low-risk women, after six months of
adjustments, discuss an urgent ultrasound (within six weeks) versus weaning
off HRT and consideration of non-hormonal alternatives (to avoid invasive
investigations) – according to the woman's preference.
Offer an urgent TVS (within 6 weeks) if the first presentation with bleeding
occurs more than six months after initiating, or three months after changing,
the HRT preparation.
Offer an urgent TVS (within 6 weeks), irrespective of interval since starting,
or changing, HRT preparations if a) bleeding is prolonged / heavy or, b) there
are 2 minor risk factors for endometrial cancer.
Offer an urgent suspicion of cancer pathway (USCP) referral to women with
one major or three minor risk factors for endometrial cancer – irrespective
of bleeding type or interval since starting or changing HRT preparations.
Adjustments to the progestogen, or stopping HRT, should be offered whilst
awaiting assessment.
Which bleeding patterns are considered normal for HRT
It is important when assessing and counselling women who present with
bleeding on HRT, to understand what is normal for the preparation they are taking.
Unscheduled bleeding within the first six months of starting any type of HRT occurs
in up to 40% of women. (51)
Sequential or cyclical HRT (sHRT)
This preparation is prescribed for women who are still having periods in the 12
months preceding the start of HRT (peri-menopausal). Estrogen is used every day
and a progestogen is given for 10-14 days of the month (dependent upon the type
prescribed). 90% of women on this preparation will have a cyclical bleed (usually
at the end of the progestogen phase), lasting 3-7 days which is generally lighter
than premenopausal menstruation. Prolonged or heavy withdrawal bleeding is not
normal, nor is persistent (almost daily) bleeding.
Continuous combined HRT (CCHRT)
This preparation is recommended for women who have had amenorrhoea for 12
months before starting HRT (including women on contraception or post-ablation).
Women are expected to be amenorrhoeic on this preparation six months after
initiation. (25,51) ccHRT is associated with less unscheduled bleeding than sHRT in
postmenopausal women.(21, 52-54) If given to perimenopausal women who still have
menstrual cycles, endogenous follicular activity can lead to irregular bleeding.
Triaging unscheduled bleeding episodes
Once the initial assessment, as outlined in Section 1, has been completed, the
bleeding pattern and underlying individual risk factors for endometrial cancer
need to be considered to enable a rational basis for triaging women to either a)
conservative management (continue with HRT +/- adjust the current preparation) or
b) refer for investigations (primary care direct access or gynaecological services).

Table 5 defines the clinical pathways for assessment of women with unscheduled
bleeding, detailing the intervals in which investigations should be offered and by
which health care provider. These definitions and time-frames are adapted from
the criteria recommended in the NICE guideline 'Suspected cancer: recognition and
referral (NG12).(55) While the time-frames for referral should remain standardised,
the model of care in terms of referral pathway, to reduce the burden on the USCP,
will vary according to local infrastructure. For example, if resources within primary
care services cannot provide direct access urgent ultrasound then development of
an urgent unscheduled bleeding clinic within the gynaecological services could be
considered. Or, if there is a paucity of experience at adjusting HRT regimens, consider
gynaecological advice and guidance platforms.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
When to manage conservatively and offer adjustments to the HRT
The following conservative management strategies can be offered through primary
care (or an unscheduled bleeding service) for women with no risk factors for
endometrial cancer, who have had a thorough assessment as outlined in Section 1
and who do not report heavy, prolonged or daily bleeding.
•
•
Unscheduled bleeding which occurs within 6 months of initiating either
CcHRT or SHRT:
Offer an adjustment in the progestogen or preparation (such as vaginal
estrogen if vulvovaginal atrophy is present (see Section 5)), totalling six months
of adjustments after the initial presentation. Ensure that the progestogen is in
balance with the estrogen dose (see Appendix 1).
Unscheduled bleeding continuing 3 months after a change in HRT dose or
preparation:
If the HRT preparation is changed (such as from a pill to a patch), or the dose is
increased, ensure the progestogen is in proportion. If unscheduled bleeding is
occurring three months after this change, offer adjustments to the preparation
(see Section 5) for six months in total.
If unscheduled bleeding continues after six months of adjustments, offer an urgent
(within 6 weeks) direct access transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) with continued changes
to the progestogen component or, weaning off HRT and consideration of non-
hormonal alternatives (if there is a preference to avoid invasive investigations).
When to refer for an ultrasound
Urgent pathway (within 6 weeks):
For women who meet the following criteria, offer a direct access urgent TVS (or
urgent gynaecological service review - dependent upon local resources) versus
weaning off HRT and consideration of non-hormonal alternatives (to avoid invasive
investigations). If continuing HRT and attending for ultrasound is the woman's
preference, continue to make changes to the progestogen component whilst
awaiting investigation.
Within any time-frame of starting ccHRT/SHRT presenting with:
― Prolonged withdrawal bleeds (more than 7 days), and/or
― Heavy bleeding (flooding and/or clots), and/or
- Persistent bleeding, even light, which occurs most days for 4 weeks or more,
and/or
- Two minor risk factors for endometrial cancer
More than six months after starting HRT and:
Reports bleeding with ccHRT after an interval of amenorrhoea
― Develops unscheduled bleeding on sHRT having had prior, light regular
withdrawal bleeds
If the endometrial thickness is above the recommended range (> 4 mm if ccHRT
and > 7 mm if sHRT - see Section 4), refer to the USCP. If the endometrium is within
recommended ultrasound limits, offer HRT adjustments (see section 5) and if
unscheduled bleeding persists six months after these changes, or the bleeding
increases in intensity or frequency during the six months of adjustments, recommend
referral to the USCP.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Urgent Suspicion of Cancer Pathway:
Refer women with unscheduled bleeding and one major, or three minor, risk factors
(Table 1) to the USCP irrespective of bleeding pattern or interval since starting, or
changing, the HRT preparation.
Can HRT be continued if referring for urgent or USCP assessment
•
•
If women are referred for histological assessment of the endometrium following
ultrasound, and HRT is continued, it will not affect the accuracy of the pathological
assessment, but interpretation would be aided by providing information to the
histopathologist on the type of HRT regimen (such as sHRT, ccHRT, 52 mg LNG-IUD)
and additional contraceptives such as the copper IUD or progestogen-only pill.
In women with no risk factors for cancer who are offered TVS on an urgent
pathway, discuss ongoing adjustments to the progestogen whilst awaiting
investigation.
If there is a strong preference to avoid ultrasound, and there are no risk factors for
endometrial cancer, discuss weaning off HRT (i.e. reduction in dose over weeks
until cessation, rather than an abrupt stop) and offer non-hormonal options to
manage symptoms.
-If bleeding ceases at a 4 week follow-up, and continuing without HRT is
acceptable, then no further investigations are required.
- If the bleeding ceases at a 4-week follow-up and there is a preference to restart
HRT, offer adjustments in HRT for six months. If the bleeding becomes heavy
/prolonged / persistent, or continues after the six months of adjustments,
recommend urgent ultrasound.
· If bleeding continues despite stopping HRT, recommend an USCP referral.
If an USCP referral is recommended and acceptable, discuss the advantage of
continuing HRT (ongoing menopausal symptom control) versus the potential
disadvantage of exacerbating an estrogen driven endometrial cancer.
If an USCP referral is recommended, and investigations are declined, recommend
weaning off HRT and offer non-hormonal alternatives. Offer follow-up at 4 weeks;
recommend USCP referral if bleeding continues on stopping HRT. If bleeding
ceases and there is a preference to restart HRT, offer adjustments for three months
before recommending a TVS on an urgent pathway if bleeding is continuing after
this interval.

Section 4: How should unscheduled bleeding be investigated
This chapter outlines evidence relating to initial investigations for unscheduled
bleeding in women who meet the referral criteria in Section 3. Recommendations for
method of endometrial assessment in women who have a thickened endometrium
on TVS, and management options relating to subsequent histological outcomes,
are discussed. Appendix 2 contains suggested ultrasound reporting criteria and
Appendix 3 summarises the ultrasound and histological outcome recommendations
made in this section.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound provides high diagnostic accuracy as a first line investigation for women
who present with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB)(56-60) and is more acceptable to
women than hysteroscopy or biopsy. (61, 62) Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is more
accurate than transabdominal (TAS) with double-layer endometrial thickness (ET)
measured at the point of maximal width.(57) Evidence in relation to the sensitivity of
TVS in predicting cancer risk in women with unscheduled bleeding on HRT is scarce,
as large studies assessing this in women with PMB often exclude HRT users or do not
provide subgroup analyses of HRT preparation or dose.
•
Endometrial measurements which should determine further investigations
Women with unscheduled bleeding, in the presence of a uniform
endometrium which is fully visualised, and measures ≤ 4 mm with ccHRT or ≤
7 mm with sHRT, can be reassured that the risk of endometrial cancer is low.
Offer HRT adjustments for 6 months and then offer endometrial assessment,
on an urgent pathway, if bleeding becomes persistent or heavy during the 6
months or, is continuing after this interval of adjustments.
Women with a thickened endometrium on TVS (> 4 mm for ccHRT or > 7
mm for sHRT) should be offered referral to the urgent suspicion of cancer
pathway (USCP) for endometrial assessment (biopsy and/or hysteroscopy).
When the entire endometrium cannot be visualised on TVS, but the area
measured is within normal ultrasound limits, offer urgent endometrial
assessment (within 6 weeks).
•
•
•
In the absence of unscheduled bleeding, women with an endometrium ≥ 10
mm should be offered endometrial assessment - consider endometrial blind
biopsy if direct access hysteroscopy is not acceptable or feasible (within unit
resources). If major risk factors for endometrial cancer are present, refer on
an USCP and, in their absence, refer on an urgent pathway (within six weeks).
In the absence of unscheduled bleeding, women who have one major or two
minor risk factors for endometrial cancer, and an incidental ET > 4 mm on
ccHRT or > 7 mm on sHRT, should be offered endometrial assessment on a
USCP.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Continuous combined preparations
In studies of women with PMB, TVS ET cut offs of 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm are reported
to have a sensitivity of 98%, 95% and 90% respectively for predicting endometrial
cancer. (56-60) Based on a 26% (95% CI 25-27%) prevalence (pre-test) probability of
endometrial disease (carcinoma and hyperplasia) in women with PMB, the post-test
probability after a negative scan is reduced to 2.4% (95% CI 1.3-3.9%) when an ET
of ≤4 mm is used and 5.0% (95% CI 2.9-9.1%) when ≤ 5 mm is used. (58) TVS ET is less
accurate at predicting endometrial cancer in Black women because of the higher
prevalence of fibroids and non-endometrioid histologic subtypes, when compared
with Caucasian women; sensitivity 47.5% vs 97.9% for an ET > 4 mm and of 43.7% vs
86% for an ET > 5 mm. (63) A cut-off of > 5 mm would reduce the number of women
who are referred for further invasive investigations but, when compared to > 4 mm,
it would reduce the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of TVS ET for
endometrial cancer detection in all women. (63-65)
Women taking ccHRT who have unscheduled bleeding and a ET > 4 mm, should
currently be managed in a similar way to non-users who present with PMB(66);
referral to the USCP for endometrial assessment. Blind endometrial biopsy is not
recommended if the ET is within normal limits as more than two-thirds will have an
insufficient sample. (67) High quality data, in cHRT users, which assesses endometrial
pathology in relation to ET should be a research priority as higher ET cut-offs, and
stratification to an urgent pathway, or prolonged conservative management, may be
enabled dependent upon estrogen dose, duration of HRT use and progestogen type.
Sequential (cyclical) preparations
Studies using standard dose estrogen with 12 days of 200 mg micronised
progesterone or 10 days of 10 mg MPA report a high NPV (99%) for endometrial
cancer when an ET of 7 mm or less is visualised.(68, 69) Until high quality evidence
assesses ultrasonographic variation at different intervals in the cycle (such as
mid-cycle and immediately after the withdrawal bleed), and correlates this with
histological outcomes, women taking sHRT who have unscheduled bleeding and an
ET of > 7mm should be offered referral to the USCP for endometrial assessment.
Incomplete visualisation of the entire endometrium
Unsatisfactory ultrasound examinations, where the view of the endometrium is
limited (IUD, fibroids, prior ablation, TAS as TVS declined or not appropriate e.g.
transgender women who are not sexually active or those with a prior history of
assault), have been associated with higher rates of endometrial hyperplasia (27%
vs 7%). (63,69) Offer an urgent (within 6 weeks) endometrial assessment - discuss
hysteroscopy (unit resources dependent) over blind biopsy if the endometrium is
distorted by fibroids - versus weaning off HRT and consideration of non-hormonal
alternatives (to avoid invasive investigations).
Recurrent unscheduled bleeding with a normal endometrial profile
Women who have a normal ET on TVS (≤ 4 mm with ccHRT or ≤7 mm with sHRT) but
recurrent bleeding that is ongoing six months after adjustments in the progestogen
should be offered endometrial assessment on an urgent pathway. If the bleeding
increases in intensity or frequency – persistent, almost daily bleeding, prolonged
withdrawal bleeds or flooding - referral should be recommended prior to the six

months. Discuss hysteroscopy, over blind biopsy (dependent upon unit resources),
as it facilitates a 'see and treat' approach, as more than one third of women with
recurrent unscheduled bleeding will have polyps on assessment.(1, 44–46, 50)
Fluid in the endometrial cavity but a normal endometrial thickness
The risk of cancer in postmenopausal women with intracavity fluid appears to be
increased in the presence of genital symptoms (vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal
bleeding), a history of colorectal cancer or an abnormal TVS finding (focal cavity
lesions e.g. polyps). (70) The decision for endometrial evaluation, in the presence of
endometrial fluid and a normal ET, should be based upon symptoms and cancer risk
factors (Table 1) – as is the case in women without intracavity fluid.
Asymptomatic (no unscheduled bleeding) with an incidental thickened
endometrium
The diagnostic value of TVS ET in asymptomatic postmenopausal women for
endometrial cancer is contentious; the diagnostic yield (and prevalence) of
premalignant and malignant endometrial cells is lower than in women who report
bleeding (< 1% vs 5%).(71-73) A systematic review concluded that the use of TVS ET as
a screening test for endometrial cancer could not be justified because of its relatively
poor predictive ability and the low prevalence; the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian
Cancer Screening (UKCTOCs) (72) advise a TVS ET threshold value > 10 mm to minimise
unnecessary biopsies (high specificity) whilst facilitating the diagnosis of endometrial
cancer (moderate sensitivity). In the absence of robust accuracy data, the UKCTOCs
and British Gynaecological Cancer Society (BGCS) 10 mm threshold is recommended
in women taking HRT.(72, 74) Discuss hysteroscopy as a first line investigation, on
an urgent pathway, due to the high prevalence of endometrial polyps with a
substantially thickened endometrium (50, 75) or offer endometrial biopsy if hysteroscopy
is not acceptable or feasible (within unit resources).
(66)
Asymptomatic women with an ET of < 10 mm, who have no major risk factors for
endometrial cancer, can be offered adjustments in their progestogen. Only offer
endometrial sampling, on an urgent pathway, if unscheduled bleeding occurs.6
Asymptomatic women who have one major or two minor risk factors for endometrial
cancer, and an ET > 4 mm on ccHRT or > 7 mm on sHRT, should be offered
endometrial assessment on an USCP (14, 15) – adjustments to the progestogen should
be offered at the time of referral.

Endometrial assessment options if a thickened endometrium on TVS
•
Offer endometrial assessment if unscheduled bleeding and a thickened
endometrium on ultrasound. A blind outpatient endometrial biopsy can be
performed or, hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling, if acceptable to the
woman and within unit resources
Blind outpatient endometrial biopsy, in comparison to hysteroscopy, is cost-effective
and quicker to achieve. (64) A systematic review reported that in postmenopausal
women who had an adequate pipelle biopsy, the post-test probability of cancer
being present with a positive result was 81.7% (95% CI 59.7 – 92.9%) and 0.9% (95%
CI 0.4-2.4%) with a negative result. (10) The failure rate of blind 'pipelle' endometrial
biopsy, in postmenopausal women, is 12% and inadequate rates are 22%. In women
taking HRT these proportions may be lower owing to reduced rates of atrophic

changes. They concluded that'a positive test result is more accurate for ruling in
disease than a negative test result is for ruling it out, indicating that if hysteroscopy is
not possible as a first line investigation, it should be offered, if within unit resources
and dependent upon acceptability to the woman, when outpatient biopsy is
inadequate or if recurrent episodes occur after a normal blind biopsy and appropriate
adjustments in the progestogen. (50, 76)
Hysteroscopy has a lower failure rate (3.4%) compared to blind endometrial sampling
in postmenopausal women. The post-test cancer probability is 71.8% after a positive
result and 0.6% with a negative result; sensitivity 86.4% and specificity 99.2%.(10)
Removing focal lesions like polyps, as part of a 'see-and-treat' procedure, may improve
patient experience by reducing the total number of appointments and procedures
but has to be tempered with available resources and patient choice. A randomised
control trial reported that half of the women who present with PMB, a TVS ET ≥ 4
mm and a subsequent negative blind endometrial biopsy will have an endometrial
polyp and of these polyps, 6% contain endometrial cancer or atypical endometrial
hyperplasia. (50) However, removal of polyps in the PMB population does not appear
to reduce bleeding episodes (50) and there is a lack of evidence relating to efficacy with
recurrent unscheduled bleeding episodes.

Recommendations for management according to endometrial histology
•
.
If blind endometrial biopsy is reported as normal, offer reassurance and
adjustments in the progestogen for 3 months. If unscheduled bleeding
persists after this interval, or becomes heavy / prolonged, offer hysteroscopic
assessment on an urgent pathway (within six weeks).
In the presence of a normal biopsy and hysteroscopy, discuss adjustments
in the progestogen and provide reassurance for six months. If unscheduled
bleeding persists after this interval, or becomes heavy / prolonged, offer a
repeat TVS on an urgent pathway.
A hysteroscopy should be offered, on an urgent pathway (within six weeks),
in the presence of a thickened ET on TVS and a blind biopsy which is reported
as an 'insufficient sample.
If proliferative endometrium is reported on blind biopsy and there are risk
factors for endometrial cancer (1 major or 2 minor) and the preparation used
is ccHRT, offer hysteroscopy.
If hyperplasia with atypia or endometrial cancer is reported, advise weaning
off HRT, discuss non-hormonal alternatives and refer to gynaecology
oncology on an USCP.
In the presence of an insufficient sample on blind biopsy, hysteroscopy (outpatient
or daycase) should be discussed. Biopsies with insufficient tissue for diagnosis can be
categorised as 'atrophic' (inactive), and the woman reassured, if the result is consistent
with the hysteroscopic appearance of the endometrium. (77) If an insufficient sample
is obtained, and is inconsistent with the hysteroscopic endometrial appearance, a
repeat hysteroscopy should be offered, considering different pain control options
(regional or general anaesthetic) to potentially facilitate an increased endometrial
tissue yield.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
If recommendations for endometrial assessment are offered, based on criteria in
sections 3 and 4, and there is a preference to avoid biopsy and / or hysteroscopy,
recommend weaning off HRT and offer non-hormonal alternatives; offer follow-up at
4 weeks and if bleeding continues after stopping HRT rediscuss the available options.
If bleeding ceases, and continuing without HRT is acceptable, then no further
investigations are required. If the bleeding ceases at a 4-week follow-up and there is a
preference to restart HRT, offer adjustments in HRT for three months. If the bleeding
becomes heavy/prolonged / persistent, or continues after the three months of
adjustments, recommend urgent endometrial assessment and cessation of HRT if
cancer exclusion tests cannot be completed.
In the absence of evidence relating to women with unscheduled bleeding but, in line
with the recommendations in the (archived) SIGN PMB Guideline (78), women who have a
normal hysteroscopy and biopsy can be reassured for six months after this outcome even
if unscheduled bleeding continues. Adjustments to the progestogen, and management
strategies to reduce cancer risk factors such as diabetes and BMI (if > 30) should be offered
to reduce the likelihood of recurrent episodes. Reassessment (TVS within 6 weeks) should
be offered before six months if the nature of the bleeding changes e.g. heavier or more
persistent. In the absence of evidence relating to women with unscheduled bleeding
but, in line with expert opinion, if a blind endometrial biopsy without concomitant
hysteroscopic assessment is reported as normal, reassurance can be provided for three
months; studies assessing whether this interval can be increased should be a research
priority. If bleeding is ongoing, despite adjustments in the progestogen, hysteroscopic
assessment should be offered on an urgent pathway. Reassessment before three months
should be offered if the nature of the bleeding changes e.g. heavier or more persistent.
If there is proliferative endometrium reported on blind biopsy, there are risk factors
for endometrial cancer (one major or two minor) and the preparation used is ccHRT,
offer hysteroscopy to enable targeted assessment of the whole endometrium. If the
hysteroscopy is normal but unscheduled bleeding continues despite six months of
adjustment in progestogen dose or type, offer repeat endometrial assessment. If
proliferation is reported on blind endometrial biopsy in women using sHRT or, there are no
risk factors for endometrial cancer and using ccHRT, offer adjustments in the progestogen
for six months; if bleeding persists after this interval, or the nature of the bleeding changes
e.g. heavier or more persistent prior to the six months, offer hysteroscopic assessment.
If the endometrial biopsy reports hyperplasia without atypia, manage in line with the
RCOG/BSGE Green-top Guideline No. 67 Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia:(79)
― Women taking a sequential preparation who wish to continue HRT (having been
offered, and declined, non-hormonal alternatives), should be advised to change to
CCHRT-a daily progestogen - offering the 52 mg LNG-IUD first-line or oral high-dose
NET/MPA (if the LNG-IUD is not acceptable). Discuss a reduction to standard dose
estrogen, if using moderate or high-dose, whilst awaiting follow-up biopsy results.
– Women taking ccHRT should have their need to continue HRT reviewed. Discuss
weaning off HRT and starting non-hormonal alternatives versus use of a 52 mg LNG-
IUD as a source of progestogen replacement. If a 52 mg LNG-IUD is already in-situ,
and within the recommended interval of use, explain the limitations of the available
evidence in optimising progestogens to lead to reversal of hyperplasia if HRT is
continued; if weaning off HRT and starting non-hormonal options is not acceptable,
consider the pros and cons of a hysterectomy.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Section 5: Adjusting HRT to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes
Does progestogen type affect rates of unscheduled bleeding?
Levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device (LNG-IUD)
The 52 mg LNG-IUD reduces systemic progestogenic adverse effects, is a licensed
contraceptive, can reduce polyp formation and induce atrophic changes. Non-
proliferative endometrium is reported on histology in 89.5% at 12 months, increasing
to 94.8% at two years and 97.5% at five years."
(80-83)
Cumulative amenorrhoea with moderate and high dose estrogen has not been
assessed in any of the pivotal studies. In postmenopausal women taking standard
dose estrogen, amenorrhoea rates at 12 months with either a 52 mg LNG-IUD, 100
mg daily oral micronised progesterone (MP) or 100 mg vaginal MP are reported as
80%, 67% and 53% respectively. (84,85)
In perimenopausal women taking standard dose estrogen with either the 52 mg LNG-
IUD or NET, irregular spotting is higher in the 52 mg LNG-IUD group at 3 months (33 vs
10%) but at 12 months there is no reported difference (80% amenorrhoea). (83) When
sequential oral MPA (5 mg) was compared to the 52 mg LNG-IUD, proliferation and
irregular spotting, after 12 months use was higher in the MPA users (38% vs 0%).(86)
Tibolone
This oral preparation has estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic effects; it should
be considered ccHRT. A RCT of 3240 women reported, at 12 months, higher rates of
amenorrhoea (78.7%) in those using tibolone when compared to use of standard
dose estrogen with 2.5 mg/day MPA (44.9%). (87) This finding, and its equivocal
endometrial safety profile, has been corroborated in other large RCTs. (36) Use of
tibolone, however, should be cautioned in women over 60 due to the increased risk
of cerebrovascular events.
Synthetic progestogens
Higher rates of cumulative amenorrhoea, when compared to micronised
progesterone (MP), have been reported in preparations which contain synthetic
progestogens (NET, MPA, levonorgestrel) as they are less rapidly metabolised and
provide high oral bioavailability.(53,88) Although breast cancer risk may be marginally
higher with these preparations, in comparison to MP, the pros and cons of use should
be discussed in women with recurrent unscheduled bleeding.
Micronised progesterone (MP)
Cohort studies have assessed rates of atrophy and proliferation in women taking oral
MP. In women using ccHRT (standard dose estrogen), atrophic/inactive endometrial
changes were reported in 100% of women using 200 mg/day (89) and 56.4% if using
100 mg for 25 of 28 days. (90) In women using sHRT, 12 days of 200 mg MP with low to
standard dose estrogen, atrophy rates were 20.8% -56% (91, 92) and proliferation 31%.
(92) Cumulative amenorrhoea rates with moderate or high dose estrogen have not
been reported.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Oral bioavailability can be improved if given with food, but this also affects the
adverse effect profile (such as sedation and progestogenic tolerance). Whether
this improves episodes of unscheduled bleeding is unclear. In comparison to
dydrogesterone, there are some data to suggest MP may have a more favourable
bleeding profile.(88)
Does route of HRT (oral, transdermal, vaginal) affect bleeding profile?
Transdermal versus oral preparations
A systematic review of 45 studies compared bleeding profiles over one year in
women taking ccHRT as an oral versus transdermal preparation. By three months,
amenorrhoea was noted in 65-91% of those taking oral preparations and in 40-
65% of those taking transdermal preparations. Cumulative amenorrhoea over 12
months was lower in the transdermal preparations (9-27%), when compared to oral
preparations (18-61%), irrespective of the constituents.(93)
As perimenopausal women have higher rates of unscheduled bleeding and
proliferation on biopsy, than postmenopausal women,(94, 95) an oral preparation (if
no risk factors for thrombosis), could be offered as either, a first-line therapy or, to
women whose initial preference was for transdermal but have unscheduled bleeding
episodes despite adjustments.
Vaginal versus oral micronised progesterone (MP)
There is no evidence to provide recommendations on whether vaginal MP reduces
unscheduled bleeding episodes compared to oral use or when compared to other
progestogens. It would, however, be reasonable to trial this (off-license) over three
months to assess the impact in women who cannot tolerate other progestogens.
Reducing recurrent episodes of unscheduled bleeding
Although unscheduled bleeding on HRT is common, there are few studies reporting
on interventions that reduce recurrent episodes. The suggestions outlined in this
section are based on the available evidence and clinical experience; see summary in
Table 6.
These changes can be instituted in primary care settings (GP practices or community
women's health 'hubs'), following queries to gynaecology advice and guidance
platforms or through secondary care unscheduled bleeding, hysteroscopy or USCP
clinics.

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
•
Basic principles
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Ensure compliance; would a combined patch, changed twice weekly, or a daily
pill be easier than a separate estrogen and progestogen component. Consider
calendar or phone reminders to enable progestogen component adherence in a
sequential preparation.
Assess understanding of how to use products, i.e. taking correct order of pills or patches
if a sequential preparation and how/where they are applying topical products.
Ensure the progestogen dose is proportionate to the estrogen dose (See Appendix 1).
Ensure the correct preparation: sHRT if perimenopausal and ccHRT if menopausal/
prior ablation/amenorrhoea with contraceptive.
Lower dose HRT achieves greater rates of amenorrhoea and if women have mild
symptoms, this should be considered when initiating sHRT or ccHRT.
Assess lifestyle factors - offer weight loss strategies and support if a raised BMI (≥
30) and optimise medical comorbidities.
Offer vaginal estrogens and/or moisturisers if evidence of localised atrophic
changes on the vulva and/or vagina.
Offer all women with a uterus the 52 mg LNG-IUD at the initial HRT consultation
if appropriate (may not be suitable if uterine malformation, submucosal fibroids
> 3 cm, history of trauma, endometrial ablation). In particular, counsel women
who have existing endometrial cancer risk factors (Table 1) about use as the
progestogenic component.
Assess contraceptive requirements to reduce unplanned pregnancies.
Managing unscheduled bleeding with sequential preparations (sHRT)
Irregular bleeding is more common in perimenopausal than pre-menopausal
women. Unlike contraceptives, HRT will not suppress endogenous ovarian
activity. Ways to manage this include:
.
•
― Timing the start of a sequential preparation to their natural cycle, i.e. starting
the estrogen component on day 1 of their period and the progestogen on day
15 for a 28-day cycle or day 21 for a 35-day cycle. This facilitates the withdrawal
bleed and their natural cycle bleed occuring at the same time.
― Offer desogestrel in addition to HRT. There are a lack of safety data relating
to endometrial safety with 75 microgram desogestrel in conjunction with
estrogen replacement; although some studies have reported safety with
desogestrel 150 micrograms, it is not currently licensed for this use.
- Consider a combined oral contraceptive (COC) in women < 50 who are at low
risk of thrombosis(9) and require contraceptive. Options which contain estradiol
can provide good symptom control in perimenopausal women.
In women using a progestogen separate to the estrogen i.e. non-combined
preparations, discuss using the progestogen 'two weeks on and two weeks off' (rather
than 10-12 days of the month) to reduce prescribing and administration errors.
Oral preparations may achieve greater cumulative rates of amenorrhoea than
transdermal; women using sHRT should be < 55 and if low risk for thrombosis this
change, in itself, may reduce irregular bleeding.
Increasing the progestogen dose or changing the progestogen type can be beneficial:
-Increase oral micronised progesterone (MP) to 300 mg for 14 days of the month (24, 25)
- Consider using 200 mg MP vaginally for 14 days of the month (off-license use)
― Change to transdermal estrogen and either oral MPA or NET (if they do not
absorb estrogen through an oral route, have ongoing bleeding despite
adjustments in MP dose / route, would not accept a 52 mg LNG-IUD and are
low risk for thrombosis).

BMS | GUIDELINE
Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
•
•
-If taking a combined preparation, give an additional progestogen (100 mg
MP, 10 mg MPA or 5 mg NET) for three months. If unscheduled bleeding
settles with use, but recurs with cessation, discuss long-term use (with the
potential increased effect on breast tissue and clot risk) if other options are not
acceptable or efficacious.
— If separate oral norethisterone leads to cessation of bleeding but the 5 mg
dose causes adverse progestogenic side effects, consider off-license use of x3
noriday tablets (1.05 mg norethisterone in total) for 10-14 days in combination
with low or standard dose estrogen.
Re-offer the 52 mg LNG-IUD.
• If a woman reports spotting before the withdrawal bleed, this may represent
inadequate stromal formation and increasing the estrogen can, in women
taking low dose preparations, be of benefit. (96) Ensure the progestogen dose is in
proportion to the estrogen dose.
• Reduce the estrogen dose and offer non-hormonal alternatives (lifestyle,
complementary, pharmacological).
Managing unscheduled bleeding with continuous combined preparations
(CcHRT)
Starting ccHRT in women who are perimenopausal can lead to irregular bleeding
patterns. Switching to sHRT would be appropriate in women who had menstrual
cycles in the 12 months preceding HRT initiation.
If switching to ccHRT from sHRT, amenorrhoea may be achieved more quickly if a
washout period (1 month) is offered to women who have recurrent unscheduled
bleeding on SHRT (97, 98) – but this advice needs to be balanced with a transient
deterioration in menopausal symptoms.
Lower dose HRT achieves greater rates of amenorrhoea and if women have mild
symptoms, this could be considered (particularly in women > 60 years).
If using micronised progesterone (MP), prescribe daily use, rather than days
1-25 to reduce administration errors.
Increasing the progestogen dose or changing the progestogen type can be beneficial:
-Increase MP to 200 mg per day. (24, 25)
-Increase MP to 200 mg on days 1-25 of a 28-day cycle (ensure understanding to
reduce adherence errors)
- Consider using 200 mg MP vaginally (off-license use)
― Change to transdermal estrogen and either oral MPA or NET (if they do not
absorb estrogen through an oral route, find a 52 mg LNG-IUD unacceptable,
have recurrent bleeding despite adjustments in MP and are low-risk for
thrombosis).
-If taking a combined preparation, an additional progestogen dose can be
given (100 mg MP, 5 mg MPA or 5 mg NET). Trial for three months to reduce
endometrial proliferation and if this leads to amenorrhoea during use, but
bleeding recurrence on cessation, then discuss long-term use (with the
potential increased effect on breast tissue and clot risk) if other options are not
acceptable or efficacious.
If separate oral norethisterone leads to cessation of bleeding but the 5 mg dose
causes adverse progestogenic side effects, consider daily off-license use of x3
noriday tablets (1.05 mg norethisterone in total) in combination with low or
standard dose estrogen.
- Re-offer the 52 mg LNG-IUD.

BMS | GUIDELINE
Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
- If at 4 years of use, new unscheduled bleeding develops, offer a change of 52 mg
LNG IUD, if cancer exclusion investigations are normal – particularly in women
using more than high dose estrogen and in those with a BMI ≥ 40.
Oral preparations may achieve greater cumulative rates of amenorrhoea than
transdermal. If older than age 60, oral preparations are a risk factor for thrombosis,
but if stopping HRT and switching to non-hormonal alternatives is not acceptable,
because of quality-of-life effects, then the pros and cons of combined ultra-low
and low-dose oral preparations, which contain micronised progesterone or
dydrogesterone (lower breast and thrombotic effects), may be of benefit.
If unscheduled bleeding persists, despite trying multiple adjustments, discuss
changing to a sequential regimen for 6-12 months.
Discuss reducing the estrogen dose and offer non-hormonal alternatives (lifestyle,
complementary, pharmacological).
Surgical options
Hysteroscopic myomectomy
This can be considered an option in women with heavy bleeding and a normal
endometrial assessment who have submucosal fibroids which prevent insertion of
a 52 mg LNG-IUD. Consider if changes to the HRT preparation are not acceptable or
efficacious. After informed counselling, small, non-vascular and mostly intracavity
submucosal fibroids (FIGO type 0 and 1) may be suitable for resection in an
outpatient setting with appropriate pain-relief. However, most submucosal fibroids
require removal as a day case procedure under regional or general anaesthesia.
Preparation for hysteroscopic myomectomy may require assessment of fitness
for a general anaesthetic, a degree of intravascular fluid absorption as well as a
laparoscopy if uterine perforation occurs. It may also require down-regulation (GnRH
analogues) with a potential reduction in estrogen dose if moderate or high-dose
preparations are currently used (which can affect menopause symptom control).
Endometrial Ablation
This day case / outpatient procedure is not recommended as a management option
in women who have recurrent unscheduled bleeding. Uterine cavity adhesions after
endometrial ablation often prevent further endometrial evaluation with ultrasound,
hysteroscopy and/or endometrial biopsy if further episodes of unscheduled bleeding
occur (which may then necessitate a hysterectomy).
Hysterectomy
This is a major operation and risks of the procedure (bleeding, infection, hernia
formation, risk of prolapse and bladder dysfunction, plus injury to surrounding
structures including bladder, bowel and ureters) need to outweigh the benefits
(management of unscheduled bleeding). All avenues of managing the bleeding
pattern, including reducing the estrogen dose, stopping HRT with consideration
of non-hormonal options / lifestyle measures and reasons for 52 mg LNG-IUD non-
acceptability, if relevant, should be explored and documented before considering
hysterectomy. Medical and individual comorbidities (such as an elevated BMI) can
increase intraoperative and postoperative surgical and anaesthetic risks; these factors
would need to be optimised before considering major elective surgery (which may in
itself improve unscheduled bleeding episodes).

increased to ensure adequate endometrial protection!

*1 mg provides endometrial protection for ultra-low to standard dose estrogen but the lowest stand-alone dose currently available in the UK is
5 mg (off-license use of three noriday POP i.e 1.05 mg, could be considered if 5 mg is not tolerated).
^There is limited evidence in relation to optimal MPA dose with high dose estrogen; the advised dose is based on studies reporting 10 mg
providing protection with up to moderate dose estrogen.
+There are limited evidence in relation to optimal micronised progesterone dose for moderate or high dose estrogen; until evidence is available
to guide practice, the advised dose is based on studies reporting 100 mg/day providing protection with up to standard dose estrogen.
If unscheduled bleeding occurs with ultra-low to moderate dose estrogen, and other progestogens are not acceptable, offer micronised
progesterone at the dosage recommended for high dose estrogen.

USCP-urgent suspicion of cancer pathway
SHRT - sequential HRT
CcHRT - continuous combined HRT
Continuous combined HRT (ccHRT): daily progestogen & estrogen
Preparation given to postmenopausal women i.e. 'bleed free' preparation
All patients should be offered a transvaginal ultrasound scan if possible, if
transabdominal please indicate on the report.
The upper limit for AP measurement for patients with unscheduled bleeding on
ccHRT is 4 mm. If > 4 mm advise an urgent suspicion of cancer pathway referral, if
not already under their care.
"The endometrium is thickened and measures XX mm: malignancy should be
excluded and referral to the gynaecology urgent suspicion of cancer pathway is
advised"
If the measurements are ≤ 4 mm report the endometrial thickness using the
following phrasing:
"The endometrium measures XX mm: This result is considered reassuring for
patients taking ccHRT but should be interpreted by the referring clinician in
the context of the patient's individual risk factors for endometrial cancer and
bleeding pattern."

Management of unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Sequential/cyclical HRT (sHRT): daily estrogen and progestogen for 10-14
days of the month
These women are perimenopausal and are still having monthly withdrawal bleeds.
All patients should be offered a transvaginal ultrasound scan if possible,
if transabdominal please indicate on the report
•
The upper limit for AP measurement for patients with unscheduled bleeding
on sequential HRT (progestogen for 10-14 days days of the month) should be ≤
7 mm because of the additional progestogen from mid-cycle. If > 7 mm, advise an
urgent suspicion of cancer pathway referral, if not already under their care.
"The endometrium is thickened and measures XX mm: malignancy should be
excluded and referral to the gynaecology urgent suspicion of cancer pathway is
advised"
If the AP measurements are ≤7 mm report the endometrial thickness using the
following:
"The endometrium measures XX mm. This result is considered reassuring for
patients taking sHRT but should be interpreted by the referring clinician in
the context of the patient's individual risk factors for endometrial cancer and
bleeding pattern."
Endometrium appears within normal limits but not entirely visualised
If it is not possible to accurately assess the endometrium, or obtain an AP
measurement of the endometrial thickness owing to factors such as fibroids, IUCD,
prior ablation etc, then use:
"The endometrium cannot be assessed in its entirety because of the presence of
XXXXXX, therefore endometrial pathology cannot be excluded; the visualised
portion measures XX mm. Referral to the gynaecology urgent suspicion of cancer
pathway, for endometrial assessment, is advised if the visualised portion is
thickened (>4 mm for ccHRT and >7 mm if sHRT) or on an urgent pathway
(within 6 weeks) if the visualised portion is within normal limits"

women taking HRT
Investigation Result
TVS: Endometrial thickness (ET) ≤ 4 mm if
CCHRT and ≤7 mm if sHRT
TVS: ET > 4 mm if ccHRT and > 7 mm if sHRT
(thickened endometrium)
TVS: Incomplete assessment of the
endometrium (e.g. fibroids/IUD
obscuring) but visualised portion
within normal ultrasound limits
TVS: Asymptomatic (no unscheduled
bleeding) with incidental ET ≥ 10 mm
and no risk factors for endometrial
cancer.
TVS: Asymptomatic (no unscheduled
bleeding) but incidental ET ≥ 10

sequential HRT or by age 54 (whichever occurs first) (100%)
4. Percentage of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding meeting criteria for
USCP referred by a USCP (100%)
5. Percentage of women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT meeting the

Management of unscheduled bleeding

Appendix 5: Research Priorities
1. Assessment of endometrial cancer risk in women who have unscheduled bleeding
on ccHRT including variables relating to moderate/high dose estrogen and/or
micronised progesterone.
2. Assessment of endometrial cancer risk in perimenopausal women who have
unscheduled bleeding on sHRT including variables relating to moderate / high
dose estrogen and/or micronised progesterone.
3. Acquire evidence assessing endometrial cancer risk dependent upon total
duration of HRT use. This should be stratified by progestogen type and dose (with
priority given to micronised progesterone).
4. Assessment of endometrial protection with LNG IUD as progestogenic
component of HRT:
a. When lower dose (13.3 and 19.5 mg) LNG IUD is used
b. When 52 mg LNG IUD is sited in the lower endometrial cavity (more than 2 cm
from the fundus)
c. When 52 mg LNG IUD is used in conjunction with estrogen use above high dose.
5. Acquire evidence correlating endometrial thickness (ET) with endometrial disease
(hyperplasia with/without cytological atypia and endometrial cancer) in women
who have unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Priority should be given to women
taking sequential HRT; assessment of ultrasonographic variation at different
intervals in the cycle, with histological correlation, may enable higher cut-offs at
the end of the progestogen phase which would reduce the number of women
offered invasive testing.
6. Assessment of optimal interval for endometrial reassessment (ultrasound
or biopsy) in women who have recurrent unscheduled bleeding, despite
progestogen adjustments, and a normal biopsy and/or hysteroscopy.
7. Assessment of the prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia / cancer in
hysteroscopically diagnosed focal endometrial pathology in women with
unscheduled bleeding on HRT.
