**Summary of MVA for Pregnancy Loss <12 Weeks**  

Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) is a safe, effective procedure for managing incomplete miscarriage or early embryonic demise (<10 weeks). It is performed by trained clinicians under local anesthesia, with optional nitrous oxide for pain relief. Key eligibility criteria include a mean sac diameter <4cm, while exclusions involve allergies or certain medical conditions.  

Pre-procedure counseling and informed consent are mandatory. The procedure itself takes 10â€“15 minutes, followed by a 60-minute recovery. Patients may experience cramping, and post-procedure pain relief is provided. Risks include incomplete evacuation, bleeding, infection, uterine perforation, or fainting.  

Post-procedure care involves monitoring for complications, a urine pregnancy test at 3 weeks, and follow-up if bleeding/persistent pain occurs. Alternatives (expectant or medical management) should be discussed, allowing patients time to decide. Contact details for post-procedure concerns must be provided.
