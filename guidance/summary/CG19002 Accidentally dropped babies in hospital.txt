This guideline focuses on the assessment and management of babies accidentally dropped in hospital settings. Prevention is key, and factors predicting baby falls should be considered. Post-fall actions include assessing stability, performing observations, informing the neonatal team, and documenting the incident. Ongoing responsibilities involve informing the safeguarding midwife, conducting 24-hour observations, and evaluating for head injury. Prompt response to neurological concerns, necessary examinations, and potential admission to the Special Care Baby Unit or pediatric ward are crucial if skull injury is suspected. Detailed documentation and communication are essential, including completing specific forms and notifying relevant healthcare providers. An audit process is recommended to review incidents. The guideline also provides a flowchart for management and a Head Injury Card for parental information post-injury.
