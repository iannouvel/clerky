This clinical guideline focuses on managing diabetes and its complications in women planning pregnancy or already pregnant. It aims to improve the diagnosis of gestational diabetes and empower women to self-manage blood glucose levels before and during pregnancy. Recommendations include providing information and support, individualized dietary advice, monitoring blood glucose levels, setting target levels, and advising on medication safety. It also covers intrapartum care, annual Hb A1c testing postnatally, and subsequent OGTT testing for women with gestational diabetes. The guideline emphasizes the risks associated with diabetes in pregnancy and provides tailored interventions to improve outcomes for both women and their babies.
