**Summary of Skin-to-Skin Contact Guidelines**  

Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) involves placing a dried newborn directly on the mother’s bare chest, covered with a warm blanket. It stabilizes the baby’s heart rate, breathing, temperature, and digestion while promoting bonding and breastfeeding initiation. In neonatal care, SSC (kangaroo care) enhances oxygenation, reduces stress, and supports growth.  

All mothers should receive uninterrupted SSC immediately after birth, including post-cesarean, to facilitate instinctive feeding behaviors. Antenatal discussions should prepare mothers for this practice. Newborns naturally seek the breast, rest, and self-attach during SSC, aiding breastfeeding success.  

Hospitals must prioritize SSC, ensuring safety by monitoring airway patency and maternal-infant well-being. Documentation of observations is essential. Partners should also be encouraged to participate in SSC to support infant care. This practice benefits both mother and baby, improving physiological stability and emotional bonding.
