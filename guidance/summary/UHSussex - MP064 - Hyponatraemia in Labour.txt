The clinical guideline for hyponatremia in labor provides standards for managing low sodium levels in pregnant individuals during labor. Key recommendations include encouraging oral intake, monitoring fluid balance, and specific protocols for low and high-risk care. Oxytocin dosing regimes are outlined, along with a management flowchart based on sodium levels and symptoms. Severe hyponatremia (sodium <125 mmol/L with symptoms) is deemed a medical emergency, requiring urgent senior obstetric and anesthetic review. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms rather than correcting sodium levels completely. This involves strict fluid restriction, hourly sodium monitoring, and 1.8% Sodium Chloride boluses under ITU supervision. The goal is to increase sodium levels by no more than 10 mmol/L in 24 hours. Regular communication with obstetric and anesthetic teams is emphasized throughout the management process.
