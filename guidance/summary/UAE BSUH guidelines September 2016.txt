**Summary of Uterine Artery Embolisation (UAE) Guidelines**  

UAE is an effective treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids causing heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea, anaemia, or mass effects on adjacent organs. It is contraindicated in pregnancy, malignancy, or active infection. Pre-procedure evaluation requires gynaecological assessment to confirm diagnosis and explore alternatives. The procedure involves uterine artery embolisation, typically using arterial closure devices. Post-procedure care focuses on pain management and monitoring for complications. Follow-up with MRI is advised, and any concerns should be promptly addressed. UAE has high technical success rates and satisfactory clinical outcomes for eligible patients.
