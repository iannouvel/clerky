**Summary of Conflict of Clinical Opinion Guideline**  

This guideline outlines the management of conflicts in clinical opinion within maternity care, prioritizing patient safety. Conflicts may arise from guideline deviations, unaddressed concerns, differing views on interventions, or diagnostic disagreements. Key principles include timely response, multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement, objectivity, patient engagement, clear communication, thorough documentation, and incident reporting. Tools such as MEOWS, NEWTT, and CTG stickers aid in assessment, while SBAR and PAUSES enhance communication.  

The escalation process involves senior staff and MDT discussions, ensuring resolution aligns with optimal patient outcomes. Essential skills include facilitating respectful dialogue, refocusing on patient welfare, and mutual respect. Safety is maintained by fostering open discussions, acknowledging concerns, and seeking support when needed. The on-call consultant holds ultimate clinical and legal responsibility. Incident monitoring ensures ongoing improvement in conflict resolution.
