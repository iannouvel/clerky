Antenatal screening for Sickle Cell and Thalassemia is essential in maternity care to identify women and couples at risk of having affected pregnancies. Screening should be offered to all pregnant women, ideally before 10 weeks of pregnancy. Couples aware of their carrier status should be referred for further assessment. Screening based on the Family Origin Questionnaire may not identify all carriers. Women have the right to decline screening, which can be done later through their midwife. Results are typically available within 3 working days, falling into categories like non-carrier, inconclusive, or carrier. Follow-up of paternal blood results is crucial for risk assessment. Couples at high risk should be referred for discussions about prenatal diagnosis. Postnatal testing is available for babies born to at-risk couples who declined prenatal diagnosis. Failsafe arrangements ensure timely follow-up of results. The NHS Sickle Cell & Thalassaemia Screening Programme in England addresses these conditions affecting hemoglobin in red blood cells. Written and verbal information, screening at booking, and timely result checks are essential components of this screening program.
