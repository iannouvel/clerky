The clinical guideline for the Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy provides recommendations for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. Treatment with oral or intravenous aciclovir is recommended for first episode genital herpes, along with daily suppressive aciclovir from 36 weeks of gestation. Caesarean section is recommended for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester to reduce neonatal transmission risk. The guideline also includes recommendations for managing recurrent genital herpes and HIV-positive women with genital HSV infection. Preventing postnatal transmission of HSV is emphasized.
