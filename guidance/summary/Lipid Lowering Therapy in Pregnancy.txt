### **Summary of Clinical Guideline: Lipid Lowering Therapy in Pregnancy**  

This guideline provides recommendations for managing lipid disorders in pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, emphasizing specialist collaboration for optimal care.  

#### **Key Recommendations:**  
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH):** Requires specialist management during pregnancy.  
- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia:** Treatment options are limited; fibrates (e.g., fenofibrate) may be used, especially in cases of pancreatitis or genetic predisposition.  
- **Medication Safety:**  
  - **Statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors:** Generally avoided in pregnancy.  
  - **Bile acid sequestrants:** Safe during breastfeeding.  
  - **Icosapent ethyl:** Can be continued if already prescribed.  
  - **Omega-3 fish oils (e.g., OMACOR):** May be used for hypertriglyceridemia, but high doses require caution.  

#### **Clinical Considerations:**  
- **Specialist input** (maternal medicine and lipidology) is essential for treatment decisions.  
- **Breastfeeding:** Bile acid sequestrants are the preferred option.  

The guideline highlights the need for careful risk-benefit assessment when using lipid-lowering therapies in pregnancy and lactation.
