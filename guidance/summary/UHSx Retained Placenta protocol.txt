### **Summary: Retained Placenta Management Protocol**  

**Definition & Incidence:**  
A retained placenta is diagnosed if delivery is incomplete within 30 minutes (active management) or 60 minutes (physiological management) after birth. Incidence: 1:100–200 births, with an 8–10% recurrence rate. Causes include uterine atony, trapped placenta, bladder distension, constriction rings, or morbidly adherent placenta (e.g., placenta accreta, 1:1500 births).  

**Immediate Management (No Bleeding):**  
- Inform the labor ward coordinator.  
- Transition to active management if physiological management fails after 60 minutes.  
- Obtain consent, catheterize the bladder, encourage breastfeeding (to stimulate contractions), and position upright.  
- Unclamp the cord to drain blood.  
- Site IV access (16G), take bloods (group & save, FBC, U&Es), and monitor vitals every 15 minutes.  
- Keep NBM; avoid IV oxytocin unless bleeding occurs.  
- If unresolved after 30 minutes (active) or 60 minutes (physiological), prepare for manual removal under regional/general anesthesia. **Never forcibly pull the cord.**  

**Active Bleeding:**  
- Start oxytocin infusion (40 units in 50ml NaCl 0.9% at 12.5ml/hr).  
- Expedite manual removal in theater with obstetric registrar consent, crossmatch 2 units blood, and alert anesthesia.  
- Follow PPH protocol, document fluid balance/blood loss, and administer IV cefuroxime prophylaxis.  

**Key Points:**  
- Early escalation, vigilant monitoring, and timely intervention are critical.  
- Manual removal requires anesthesia and should be performed in a controlled setting.  
- Homebirths with retained placenta warrant hospital transfer.
