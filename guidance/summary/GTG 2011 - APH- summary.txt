Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) is bleeding from the genital tract during pregnancy, most commonly caused by placenta previa and placental abruption. It complicates 3-5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Women with APH should be managed in a hospital maternity unit with resuscitation and emergency delivery capabilities. Clinical assessment, history-taking, maternal and fetal monitoring, and investigations are essential for managing APH. Management includes maternal resuscitation, delivery of the fetus, continuous fetal monitoring, and postpartum hemorrhage prevention. Anti-D Ig should be given to RhD-negative women, and neonates should be assessed by a pediatrician. Training of the multidisciplinary team and audit topics are recommended for quality improvement.
