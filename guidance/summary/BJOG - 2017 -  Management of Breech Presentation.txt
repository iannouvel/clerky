The clinical guideline on the Management of Breech Presentation provides recommendations for the management of breech presentation at term. It suggests offering external cephalic version (ECV) to women with breech presentation unless contraindicated, and counseling on the risks and benefits of ECV and implications for mode of delivery. The guideline discusses the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section, highlighting the reduction in perinatal mortality with caesarean section but also the risks associated with future pregnancies. Skilled intrapartum care and adherence to a management protocol are emphasized for safe vaginal breech delivery. Research recommendations and audit topics are also included.
