Breech presentation at term: Mgmt: Offer ECV if no contraindication, counsel on risks/benefits of ECV, vaginal breech delivery vs. C-section. Delivery risks: C-section reduces perinatal mortality, planned vaginal breech birth has higher mortality risk. Maternal complications: C-section increases future pregnancy risks. Vaginal breech delivery safety depends on case selection, operator skill, intrapartum management. Position for delivery can be semirecumbent or all-fours. Assist delivery without traction if delay or poor fetal condition. Preterm breech birth: Individualized management, C-section if maternal/fetal compromise. Twin pregnancy: C-section for first twin, not routine for second twin. Support for vaginal breech delivery service. Recommendations for future research and audit.
