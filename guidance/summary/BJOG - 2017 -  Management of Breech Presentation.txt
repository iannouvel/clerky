Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Breech presentation at term
- Unsuccessful or declined external cephalic version (ECV)
- Risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section
- Risk of perinatal mortality approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39+0 weeks; approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth
- Increased risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications with planned vaginal breech birth
- Small reduction in perinatal mortality with planned caesarean section compared to planned vaginal breech delivery

Treatment and Management:
- Offer external cephalic version (ECV) unless there is an absolute contraindication
- Counsel on risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section
- Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care
- Continuous fetal monitoring may improve outcomes
- Delivery in a hospital with immediate access to cesarean section
- Adherence to a protocol for management to reduce neonatal morbidity
- Assistance during active second stage without traction if delay or poor fetal condition
- Avoid fetal trauma by grasping fetus around pelvic girdle and avoiding hyperextension of the neck
- Selective episiotomy over routine episiotomy
- Intervention to expedite breech birth if evidence of poor fetal condition or significant delays
- Individualized management for preterm breech birth based on various factors
- Planned caesarean section for preterm breech presentation in cases of maternal or fetal compromise
- Planned caesarean section for first twin in twin pregnancy with breech presentation

Monitoring Requirements:
- Antenatal assessment for risk factors such as hyperextended neck on ultrasound or high estimated fetal weight
- Monitoring fetal position during delivery
- Monitoring and managing carefully the position of the fetus during delivery

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Absolute contraindication to external cephalic version (ECV)
- Risks associated with planned caesarean section in future pregnancies
- Risks of opting for vaginal birth after caesarean section
- Increased risk of complications at repeat caesarean section
- Risk of an abnormally invasive placenta
- Small increase in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies with caesarean section
