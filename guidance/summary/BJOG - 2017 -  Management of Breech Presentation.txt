Women with breech presentation at term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) unless contraindicated; planned caesarean section reduces perinatal mortality compared to planned vaginal breech delivery; risks of caesarean section include future pregnancy complications; vaginal breech birth increases short-term complications but not long-term morbidity; safety of vaginal breech delivery depends on case selection, skilled birth attendants, and hospital setting with immediate cesarean access; continuous fetal monitoring is recommended; maneuvers to avoid fetal trauma should be followed, with selective episiotomy and careful fetal position management; preterm breech birth requires individualized management; planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation in cases of compromise; in twin pregnancies with breech presentation, caesarean section for the first twin is recommended; organizational support for vaginal breech delivery services is crucial. Future research should focus on all-fours position, pelvimetry, and epidural analgesia in vaginal breech birth; audit topics include documentation, delivery rates, and outcomes.
