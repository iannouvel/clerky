The clinical guideline on the management of breech presentation provides recommendations for healthcare professionals and pregnant women. Key points include offering external cephalic version (ECV) for term breech presentations, counseling on risks and benefits of ECV and mode of delivery options, and discussing planned vaginal breech delivery versus caesarean section. Caesarean section reduces perinatal mortality compared to vaginal breech birth, but has associated risks. Skilled intrapartum care and proper case selection are crucial for the safety of vaginal breech delivery. Management should include continuous fetal monitoring, selective episiotomy, and avoiding fetal trauma. In preterm breech births, individualized management is recommended. For twin pregnancies with breech presentation, caesarean section for the first twin is advised. Organizational support for vaginal breech delivery services is essential. Future research areas and audit topics are outlined. The guideline emphasizes evidence-based decision-making and standardized methodology in developing recommendations.
