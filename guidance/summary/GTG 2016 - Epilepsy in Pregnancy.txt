Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Diagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform seizures should be made by a neurologist; different types of epilepsy should be assessed for specific risks to the mother and baby
- Other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnant women
- Women with epilepsy planning pregnancy should have a clinician manage their antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) based on fetal risk and seizure control
- Folic acid intake and minimizing AED exposure can reduce congenital malformations
- Regular antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team is recommended; screening for fetal abnormalities and monitoring AED levels in pregnancy should be individualized
- Seizures in labor should be managed promptly to avoid complications; pain relief options for women with epilepsy in labor should be prioritized
- Postnatal care should include continued AED use and monitoring for seizure triggers; neonates exposed to AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects
- Effective contraception is important for women with epilepsy to stabilize their condition and optimize outcomes

Treatment and Management:
- Prepregnancy counseling for women with epilepsy (WWE) should discuss the risk of congenital malformations based on AED exposure and emphasize the importance of folic acid supplementation
- AED polytherapy should have a detailed discussion with the epilepsy specialist on the risks and benefits prior to planning pregnancy
- Pregnant women should be informed that two-thirds will not have seizure deterioration in pregnancy
- Healthcare professionals should provide verbal and written information on prenatal screening, risks of self-discontinuation of AEDs, effects of seizures and AEDs on the fetus, and breastfeeding
- WWE should have access to regular planned antenatal care with a designated epilepsy care team
- Serial growth scans are required for detection of small-for-gestational-age babies in WWE exposed to AEDs
- Parenteral vitamin K supplementation should be offered routinely to babies born to mothers on enzyme-inducing AEDs

Monitoring Requirements:
- Pregnant WWE should be regularly assessed for risk factors for seizures, adherence to AEDs, and seizure type and frequency
- Neonates born to WWE taking AEDs should be monitored for adverse effects
- Breastfeeding is encouraged, and monitoring for cognitive outcomes in children exposed to certain AEDs is recommended

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Avoid sodium valproate and AED polytherapy if possible; however, if the risk of maternal seizure deterioration is high, continuation may be advised
- Non-epileptic attack disorder should be managed with specialist psychiatric or psychological services
- Caution advised for pethidine use in labor for WWE
- WWE at risk of peripartum seizures should deliver in a consultant-led unit with resuscitation facilities
- AED dose adjustments may be needed post-delivery to avoid toxicity
