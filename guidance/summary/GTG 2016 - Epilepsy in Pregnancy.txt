The clinical guideline on epilepsy in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis by a neurologist, assessment of risks to the mother and baby, and consideration of differential diagnoses for seizures in pregnant women. Management includes individualized care for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) based on fetal risk and seizure control, folic acid intake, and minimizing AED exposure to reduce congenital malformations. Regular antenatal care with an epilepsy care team, monitoring for fetal abnormalities, and managing seizures in labor are critical. Postnatal care involves continued AED use, monitoring neonates for adverse effects, and ensuring effective contraception. Healthcare providers should be knowledgeable about disability legislation protecting individuals with epilepsy. The guideline underscores the importance of preconception counseling, monitoring AED exposure, and optimizing outcomes for women with epilepsy during pregnancy.
