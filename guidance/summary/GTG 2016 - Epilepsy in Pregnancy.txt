The clinical guideline on epilepsy in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of proper diagnosis and management of epilepsy during pregnancy. It stresses the need for specialized care from a neurologist, assessment of risks to both mother and baby, and individualized treatment plans based on fetal risk and seizure control. The guideline also addresses the impact of antiepileptic drugs on pregnancy outcomes, the importance of folic acid intake, and the need for regular antenatal care with an epilepsy care team. Additionally, it provides recommendations for managing seizures during labor, monitoring AED levels, and postnatal care to ensure the well-being of both the mother and baby. Effective contraception is highlighted as crucial for stabilizing the condition and optimizing outcomes for women with epilepsy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to provide evidence-based information and support to empower women with epilepsy to make informed choices regarding their pregnancy and epilepsy management.
