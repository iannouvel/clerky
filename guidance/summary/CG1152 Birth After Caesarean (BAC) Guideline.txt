**Birth After Caesarean Section (BAC) Guideline Summary**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing women with a previous caesarean section (CS) who are considering vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) or elective repeat CS (ERCS). Key points include:  

- **Antenatal Counseling**: Women should receive individualized counseling on VBAC feasibility, risks, and benefits. Shared decision-making is essential.  
- **VBAC Eligibility**: Contraindications include â‰¥3 prior CS, previous uterine rupture/dehiscence, non-low transverse incisions, or recurring CS indications.  
- **Intrapartum Care**: Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is mandatory during VBAC. Epidural analgesia is permitted, and mobility should be encouraged.  
- **Emergency Management**: Suspected uterine rupture warrants immediate CS. Active third-stage management is recommended.  
- **Labor Options**: Women in spontaneous labor before ERCS date may attempt VBAC if eligible. Induction/augmentation requires consultant approval.  
- **Post-Dates Management**: At 41 weeks, options include membrane sweep, induction (ARM/balloon catheter), or ERCS.  

The guideline emphasizes informed choice, safety, and consultant-led decision-making for induction/augmentation. Audit standards include VBAC success rates and documented counseling.
