External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to manipulate the fetus into a cephalic presentation to reduce the risk of non-cephalic presentation at birth. ECV is most effective after 36 weeks of gestation, with a success rate of approximately 50%. While ECV can decrease the need for a caesarean section, it may increase the risk of preterm birth. ECV should be performed by trained practitioners in facilities with monitoring and surgical delivery capabilities. Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended for D-negative women undergoing ECV. Pain management during ECV may be considered for women who cannot tolerate the procedure. Further research is needed to improve the detection and success rate of ECV.
