The SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 456 emphasizes the importance of prenatal screening for fetal chromosomal anomalies. Recommendations include offering cell-free DNA screening for common trisomies to all pregnant individuals, as well as first- and second-trimester ultrasounds for anomaly detection. Health care providers should be knowledgeable about screening options, and patients should be offered various screening and diagnostic choices. Factors affecting the risk of aneuploidy and major congenital anomalies should be considered, with invasive testing recommended for high-risk cases. Non-invasive prenatal testing, such as maternal plasma cfDNA screening, is an effective method for early detection and can be integrated into clinical practice with proper patient management.
