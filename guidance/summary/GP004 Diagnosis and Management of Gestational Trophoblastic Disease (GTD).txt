The guideline on Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) provides recommendations for diagnosis and management. GTD comprises pregnancy-related tumors with trophoblastic tissue proliferation. Clinical features include irregular bleeding, hyperemesis, and uterine enlargement. Ultrasound aids in diagnosis, but histological examination confirms it. Complete and partial moles have distinct genetic origins. Suction curettage is preferred for evacuation. Follow-up at a specialized center is crucial. Contraception and delaying pregnancy until hCG levels normalize are advised. GTN is indicated by persistent Î²hCG elevation. In twin pregnancies with a molar component, consider fetal karyotyping. Regular surveillance is essential, and any abnormal bleeding post-pregnancy warrants evaluation.
