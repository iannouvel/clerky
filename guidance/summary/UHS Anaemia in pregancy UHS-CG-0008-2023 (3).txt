The clinical guideline focuses on the management of anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Key recommendations include screening for anaemia at booking and 28 weeks, providing dietary advice to meet increased iron requirements, and initiating treatment if hemoglobin levels are below certain thresholds. Management strategies include dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in pregnancy, with symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Consequences of anaemia include increased risks of perinatal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and preterm birth. Monitoring hemoglobin levels, offering prophylactic iron to high-risk individuals, and considering intravenous iron therapy in specific cases are essential components of care. Prioritizing iron infusion for pregnant individuals with low hemoglobin levels approaching term and postpartum monitoring are critical for reducing complications. Blood transfusion should be considered after careful evaluation and exploring alternative treatments, with thorough documentation and informed consent from patients.
