This document provides evidence-based guidance for managing anaemia during pregnancy and the postnatal period. It covers causes, consequences, screening, and treatment options for iron deficiency, including dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy. Monitoring hemoglobin levels is crucial, and treatment should be tailored based on individual needs and responses. Special considerations are outlined for high-risk individuals and those with contraindications for certain treatments. Prioritizing iron infusion for pregnant individuals with low hemoglobin levels approaching term is recommended to reduce the risk of postpartum complications. Blood transfusion should be considered cautiously, with informed consent and documentation of discussions.
