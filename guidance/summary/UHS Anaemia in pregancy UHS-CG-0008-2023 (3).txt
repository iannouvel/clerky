Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Anaemia in pregnancy is diagnosed based on hemoglobin levels.
- Causes of anaemia in pregnancy include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and other inflammatory disorders.
- Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
- Screening for anaemia should be done at booking and at 28 weeks of gestation.
- Treatment should be initiated if hemoglobin levels are below certain thresholds.

Treatment and Management:
- Management includes dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy.
- Dietary advice should be given to meet increased iron requirements during pregnancy.
- Oral iron supplementation is recommended once iron deficiency occurs.
- Oral iron replacement therapy should be recommended if anemia is diagnosed, with a recommended elemental iron dose of 40-80 mg each morning or alternate day.
- Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, with further checks depending on the degree of anemia and gestational period.
- Intravenous iron therapy can be considered in cases of non-compliance, intolerance to oral preparations, malabsorption, GI diseases, or poor response to oral iron.
- IV iron therapy should not be administered out of hours to reduce the risk of adverse reactions.
- Contraindications for IV iron therapy include a history of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, first trimester of pregnancy, acute or chronic bacteremia, and decompensated liver disease.
- Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos is the preparation used for IV iron therapy.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor hemoglobin levels regularly.
- Offer oral iron replacement if needed postpartum.
- Monitor Hb levels postpartum for pregnant individuals who received iron therapy.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications for IV iron therapy include a history of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, first trimester of pregnancy, acute or chronic bacteremia, and decompensated liver disease.
- Risks factors for blood transfusion include moderate symptoms of anaemia postpartum, careful evaluation, and exploration of alternative treatments.
