Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings are key factors in assessing the risk of malignancy
- Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules can aid in estimating the risk of malignancy
- Specific ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy warrant referral to a gynaecological oncology service
- Asymptomatic women with small simple ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly
- Women with simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter should have yearly ultrasound follow-up

Treatment and Management:
- Conservative management and laparoscopic techniques recommended for benign ovarian masses
- Referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases
- Combined oral contraceptives not helpful for functional ovarian cysts
- Laparoscopic approach preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses
- Aspiration of ovarian cysts less effective with high recurrence rate
- Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes

Monitoring Requirements:
- Yearly ultrasound follow-up for women with simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Combined oral contraceptives not helpful for functional ovarian cysts
- Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons
- Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent potential malignancy
- Removal of an ovary should be discussed preoperatively
