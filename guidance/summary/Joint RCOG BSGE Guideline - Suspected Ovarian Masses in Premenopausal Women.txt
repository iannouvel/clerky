Initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women involve referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases; conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign masses. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings guide malignancy risk assessment, with referral for specific suspicious ultrasound findings. Yearly ultrasound follow-up is advised for simple ovarian cysts of 50â€“70 mm; persistent or increasing cysts may require further imaging or surgery, especially for mature cystic teratomas. Laparoscopic management is preferred for benign cysts, with experienced surgeons recommended. Aspiration of cysts is less effective, and spillage should be avoided to prevent malignancy. Tertiary tests for ovarian cancer detection include three-dimensional vascularity quantification. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy post-laparoscopy. Various studies evaluate risk indices, sonography quality, and differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Expectant management is suitable for asymptomatic simple cysts. Hormonal treatment is not effective for functional cysts. Surgical approach should consider cyst size, with laparoscopic excision preferred for better outcomes. Monitoring parameters include ultrasound follow-up frequency and assessment of cyst growth. Contraindications include ineffective hormonal treatment and inadequate surgical expertise.
