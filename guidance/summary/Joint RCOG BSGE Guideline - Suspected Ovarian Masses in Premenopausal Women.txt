The RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 62 focuses on the management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. Key recommendations include conservative management and laparoscopic techniques for benign masses, referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases, and the use of serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings to assess malignancy risk. Expectant management is suitable for asymptomatic women with small simple cysts. Surgical intervention is recommended for persistent or increasing cysts, especially in cases of mature cystic teratomas. Laparoscopic approach by experienced surgeons is preferred for elective surgical management, with careful consideration to avoid spillage of cyst contents. The guideline emphasizes early diagnosis and referral for improved outcomes and highlights the importance of accurate risk assessment using tools like the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules.
