**Clinical Guideline Summary: Penthrox in Ambulatory Gynaecology**  

This guideline outlines the use of Penthrox (methoxyflurane) for acute pain management in adults undergoing ambulatory gynaecological procedures. Key recommendations include offering Penthrox for procedures such as outpatient hysteroscopy, colposcopy, and other minor interventions, with consideration of contraindications (e.g., renal impairment, pregnancy, or hypersensitivity).  

Administration should follow strict dosing protocols (inhaled via a hand-held device, typically 3-6 mL per procedure), with monitoring for side effects (dizziness, nausea, or rarely, hepatotoxicity). Staff must be trained in safe prescribing, administration, and emergency management.  

Storage must comply with regulatory requirements, and effectiveness should be assessed using pain scores and procedural success rates. Implementation involves dissemination via email, clinical governance sessions, and inclusion in CPD training. Access is provided through OneDrive and the intranet, with outdated versions removed to ensure compliance. Specialist oversight (e.g., gynaecology matrons) ensures adherence among nurses and allied health professionals.
