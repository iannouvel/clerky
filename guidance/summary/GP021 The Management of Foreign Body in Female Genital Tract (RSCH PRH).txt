**Clinical Guideline Summary: Management of Foreign Body in Female Genital Tract**  

This protocol outlines the assessment and management of suspected foreign bodies in the female genital tract. Applicable to women of all ages, causes include accidental insertion, self-insertion (including in children), sexual abuse, or mental health concerns.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Urgent referral** is required for severe symptoms (e.g., sharp objects, heavy bleeding, signs of infection). Non-urgent cases should be assessed during routine hours.  
- **Assessment** includes a detailed history (duration, type of object) and examination. Investigations (e.g., imaging, swabs) may be needed to rule out complications.  
- **Treatment** depends on severity: sharp or embedded objects require prompt removal, while non-urgent cases may be managed conservatively.  
- **Aftercare:** Most patients can be discharged same-day. Mental health support should be considered for habitual inserters.  

**Compliance Monitoring:** Regular audits ensure adherence to the protocol. Clinical judgement remains essential in individual cases.
