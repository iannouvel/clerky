RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, aiming to reduce serious complications associated with laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons are advised to be trained in safe techniques, insert the primary trocar at 90 degrees to the skin, and maintain intra-abdominal pressure before insertion. Alternative entry techniques and sites, such as Palmer's point, are recommended in certain cases. Special care is needed for entry in specific patient populations. Documentation of counseling and reporting adverse events are essential. The guideline emphasizes the importance of appropriate training, supervision, and experience in laparoscopic surgery, with recommendations based on expert opinions and clinical experiences.
