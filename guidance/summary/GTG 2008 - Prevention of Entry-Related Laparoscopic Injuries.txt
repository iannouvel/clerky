The RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques, inserting the primary trocar at 90 degrees to the skin; Veress needle or open (Hasson) approaches are acceptable. Surgeons must be aware of associated risks, including bowel, urinary tract, and major blood vessel injuries. Intra-abdominal pressure should be 20-25 mmHg before trocar insertion, with alternative sites like Palmer's point considered in specific cases. Secondary ports should be inserted under direct vision at 20-25 mmHg, with special considerations for obese, thin, or nulliparous patients. Documentation of counseling and adverse events is crucial. Contraindications and risk factors include inadequate training and experience in laparoscopy.
