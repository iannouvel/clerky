The RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing gynaecological laparoscopic injuries during entry techniques. Key recommendations include training surgeons in safe laparoscopic techniques, inserting the primary trocar at a 90-degree angle to the skin in a controlled manner, and maintaining intra-abdominal pressure at 20-25 mmHg before trocar insertion. The guideline discusses using the Veress needle or open (Hasson) approach for entry, with no significant safety advantage to either technique. Alternative sites for entry include Palmer's point, especially in cases of previous surgery or splenomegaly. Special considerations are outlined for obese, thin, and young nulliparous women. Surgeons are advised to inform patients of risks and potential complications, ensure appropriate training and supervision, and document counseling and adverse events. The guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized patient care and local adoption of recommendations.
