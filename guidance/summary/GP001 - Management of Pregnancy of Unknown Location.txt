**Summary of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) Management**  

PUL is diagnosed when a pregnancy test is positive but no intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy is visualized on ultrasound. The primary goal is to determine pregnancy location while minimizing complications.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- Assume ectopic pregnancy until confirmed otherwise.  
- Monitor with serial hCG and progesterone levels to guide management.  
- Conservative management is preferred unless symptoms worsen or hCG trends suggest pathology.  
- Avoid methotrexate for PUL without confirmed ectopic pregnancy.  

**Critical Steps:**  
- Provide clear written instructions on emergency symptoms (severe pain, dizziness).  
- Advise against travel to areas without immediate medical access.  
- Individualize further management (repeat scans, laparoscopy) based on clinical suspicion.  

All women should receive prompt follow-up and counseling on potential risks.
