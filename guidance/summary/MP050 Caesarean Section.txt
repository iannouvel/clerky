### **Caesarean Section Protocol Summary**  

This protocol outlines standardized practices for caesarean sections (CS), covering classification, surgical techniques, and post-operative care. CS is categorized into four urgency levels (1-4). Key recommendations include:  

#### **Surgical Techniques**  
- Avoid routine suturing of visceral/parietal peritoneum.  
- Close subcutaneous tissue only if fat depth >2cm.  
- Prefer sutures over staples for skin closure to reduce wound dehiscence.  
- Avoid superficial wound drains; consider negative pressure therapy for BMI ≥35.  
- Use forceps only if fetal head delivery is difficult.  

#### **Cord Management & Medications**  
- Delayed cord clamping is routine; cord milking is an alternative if delayed clamping is unsuitable.  
- Administer oxytocin (5 units IV) post-cord clamping; avoid routine 40-unit infusions.  
- Obtain cord blood samples in Category 1/2 CS, Rh-negative cases, or abnormal antibodies.  

#### **Pre- & Post-Operative Care**  
- Offer antenatal corticosteroids for elective CS before 38+6 weeks.  
- Enhanced recovery pathways should be considered for non-complex elective cases.  
- Pre-op assessment within 24-48 hours before planned CS.  
- Post-op analgesia must be prescribed and administered.  
- Remove urinary catheter once mobile, ≥6 hours after last epidural dose.  
- Assess for urinary symptoms (UTI, retention, injury) and heavy bleeding (endometritis vs. retained products).  

#### **Discharge & Future Pregnancies**  
- Discuss VBAC suitability and future pregnancy implications before discharge.  
- Complete discharge summaries with CS category and complications.  
- Advise resuming activities (driving, exercise, intercourse) based on recovery.  

#### **Risk Comparisons**  
- CS reduces urinary/fecal incontinence and OASIS risk compared to vaginal birth.  
- Similar risks for VTE, neonatal admission, major hemorrhage, and postnatal depression.  

This protocol ensures evidence-based, patient-centered care for CS while optimizing outcomes.
