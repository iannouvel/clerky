RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, which can occur during blind insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae. Complications from laparoscopic surgery are not uncommon, with rates ranging from 1.0/1000 to 12.5/1000, and major complications including bowel, urological, and vascular injuries. The guideline emphasizes the importance of optimizing entry techniques, proper training, and equipment use to reduce these risks. Alternative entry sites and techniques are discussed, with recommendations for obese and thin women. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques and ensure appropriate staff training. Adherence to these guidelines can help prevent entry-related complications during laparoscopic procedures.
