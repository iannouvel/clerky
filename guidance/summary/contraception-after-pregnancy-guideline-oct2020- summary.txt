The FSRH Guideline on Contraception After Pregnancy provides comprehensive recommendations for healthcare providers on discussing and providing contraception to women postpartum. The guideline emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making, access to a range of contraceptive methods, and obtaining valid consent before providing contraception. It covers various contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), barrier methods, and emergency contraception, with considerations for different scenarios such as breastfeeding, abortion, and gestational trophoblastic disease. The guideline also addresses the need for timely and accurate information, person-centered care, and monitoring of outcomes for quality improvement. Healthcare providers are encouraged to follow the guideline to ensure safe and appropriate contraceptive care for women after pregnancy.
