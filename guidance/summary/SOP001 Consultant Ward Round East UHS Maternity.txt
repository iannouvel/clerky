**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Consultant-Led Ward Rounds in Obstetrics & Gynaecology**  

This guideline outlines the responsibilities of on-call consultants in ensuring structured, consultant-led ward rounds to enhance patient safety and care quality. Ward rounds must be conducted twice daily with specified timings, ensuring acute obstetric admissions are reviewed within 14 hours and daily gynaecology rounds are completed.  

Consultants must maintain a presence on the labor ward during designated hours, with clear escalation protocols for urgent clinical scenarios. Professional behavior, multidisciplinary collaboration, and timely decision-making are emphasized. Compliance with RCOG standards and Ockenden Immediate Essential Actions is mandatory.  

Key responsibilities include leading ward rounds, reviewing high-risk cases, and ensuring effective handovers. The Chief of Service and clinical leads oversee adherence to this SOP. The guideline ensures consistent, structured care while optimizing consultant availability for acute and routine obstetric/gynaecological management.
