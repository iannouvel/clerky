### **Summary of Perineal Trauma & Repair Clinical Guideline**  

This guideline outlines best practices for preventing, recognizing, classifying, and repairing obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI) and perineal trauma. Key risk factors for OASI include Asian ethnicity, nulliparity, fetal macrosomia (>4kg), shoulder dystocia, and prolonged second stage of labor. The **OASI care bundle** emphasizes informed consent, mediolateral episiotomy (60Â° angle at crowning), manual perineal protection (bimanual technique), and perineal warming.  

**Perineal examination** (including rectal assessment) is mandatory after all vaginal births, with tears classified per RCOG criteria. **Repair** should be performed by trained midwives or obstetricians, prioritizing hemostasis and infection prevention. **Third- and fourth-degree tears** require prompt repair in theatre under regional/general anesthesia, with buried knots to prevent migration. Post-repair, rectal and vaginal integrity must be confirmed.  

**Postpartum care** includes antibiotics (for high-grade tears), analgesia, laxatives, high-fiber diet, and pelvic floor exercises. **Documentation** must detail repair technique, suture material, and post-procedure checks. Incident reporting is mandatory for OASI cases.  

**Special considerations:**  
- Labial/clitoral tears require aesthetic repair and analgesia.  
- Water birth lacerations should be sutured immediately if bleeding.  
- Women with prior OASI should deliver under experienced supervision.  

**Follow-up** includes wound monitoring, physiotherapy referral, and counseling on future birth options. The guideline ensures compliance with human rights (FREDA principles) and mandates staff training via accessible digital platforms.
