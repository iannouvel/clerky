The clinical guideline for the use of Carbetocin in preventing postpartum hemorrhage during caesarean birth recommends administering Carbetocin instead of oxytocin after the birth of the baby, with a dose of 100 micrograms over 1 minute. Responsibilities include maintaining stock levels, appropriate preparation and administration, and monitoring uterine tone and lochia. Contraindications include pregnancy, hypersensitivity to Carbetocin, severe cardiovascular disorders, and severe pre-eclampsia. Cautions for use include cardiovascular disease, severe hypotension, and pre-eclampsia. Common adverse effects may include headache, nausea, hypotension, and chest pain. Training should involve resources like the BNF and SPC Carbetocin. Monitoring should ensure compliance with the guideline.
