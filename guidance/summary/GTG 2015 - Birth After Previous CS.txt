This clinical guideline on Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth provides recommendations for antenatal care, counselling, and decision-making for women with prior cesarean deliveries. It discusses the suitability of planned vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) for most women with a single prior cesarean, contraindications to VBAC, and factors influencing VBAC success rates. The guideline emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring during VBAC, the risks associated with induction or augmentation of labor, and the timing and perioperative care for elective repeat cesarean sections. It also highlights the need for personalized decision-making, patient counseling, and further research on predicting successful VBAC outcomes.
