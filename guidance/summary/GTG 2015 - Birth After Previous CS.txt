Antenatal care for Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth involves using a checklist for VBAC or ERCS counseling and decision-making; VBAC is suitable for most women with a singleton pregnancy and prior lower segment caesarean delivery, with contraindications being previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar; Labour for women with two or more prior caesareans should be in a center with immediate surgical delivery capability; VBAC success rate is 72-75%, enhanced by previous vaginal delivery; VBAC should occur in a well-equipped delivery suite with continuous monitoring, as induction or augmentation of labor increases uterine rupture risk; ERCS after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis is recommended; VBAC may not be suitable in certain circumstances like post-dates or twin gestation; VBAC after senior obstetrician counseling can be offered to women with two or more prior caesarean deliveries; Antenatal counseling should address factors increasing uterine rupture risk, and decision-making should consider risks and benefits of VBAC versus ERCS; Consider corticosteroids if ERCS is pre-39 weeks; Thromboprophylaxis method per RCOG guidance; NICE induction of labor guideline recommends induction from 41+0 weeks; Monitoring for uterine rupture signs and symptoms is crucial during VBAC; Patient decision-making aids and personalized care are important; Future research should focus on high/low-risk VBAC prediction and stillbirth prevention in prior caesarean deliveries.
