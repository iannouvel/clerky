Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Suitable candidates for planned VBAC: women with a singleton pregnancy and previous lower segment caesarean delivery
- Contraindications to VBAC: previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar
- Factors influencing VBAC success: previous vaginal delivery, maternal height, age, BMI, gestation, and birthweight
- Complications: uterine rupture (disruption of uterine muscle), uterine dehiscence (disruption with intact uterine serosa)
- Risks: perinatal mortality (stillbirths and neonatal deaths), neonatal respiratory morbidity

Treatment and Management:
- Planned VBAC with continuous monitoring in a well-equipped delivery suite
- Induction or augmentation of labor increases risk of uterine rupture
- ERCS after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis
- Consideration of maternal corticosteroids if ERCS before 39 weeks
- Multidisciplinary management of placenta praevia
- Individualized approach for women with special circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age ≥40
- Counseling on risks and benefits of planned VBAC versus ERCS

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor for signs of uterine rupture during VBAC
- Assess for maternal infection risk with perioperative preincision antibiotics
- Follow RCOG guidance for thromboprophylaxis

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications to VBAC: previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar
- Risk factors for uterine rupture: short inter-delivery interval, maternal age, obesity, and myometrial thickness
- Cautious approach for special circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age ≥40
