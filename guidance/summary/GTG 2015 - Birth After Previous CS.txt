The clinical guideline on birth after previous caesarean birth recommends antenatal care involving counseling and decision-making checklists for vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) or elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS). Most women with a singleton pregnancy and prior lower segment caesarean delivery are suitable for planned VBAC, with contraindications including previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. VBAC success rates are 72-75%, with continuous monitoring and labor in specialized centers advised. ERCS is recommended after 39+0 weeks, with consideration of maternal and fetal risks. Counseling should cover success rates, uterine rupture risks, and maternal outcomes. Factors influencing VBAC success include previous vaginal delivery and maternal characteristics. The guideline emphasizes personalized decision-making, patient preferences, and the importance of informed consent for mode of delivery. VBAC is generally considered safe for most women with a single prior caesarean, with special considerations for those with multiple prior caesareans.
