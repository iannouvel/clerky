**Waterbirth Protocol Summary (MP039)**  

This protocol outlines standards for safe waterbirths in low-risk pregnancies from 37 weeks. Key recommendations include:  

- **Eligibility:** Low-risk women in established labour may use the pool. Exclusions include multiple births, abnormal fetal monitoring, and breech presentation.  
- **Preparation:** Midwives must discuss birth plans, ensure a calm environment, and verify the pool meets British Standards (clean, functional, with a thermometer).  
- **Labour & Birth:** Water temperature should not exceed 37Â°C. Encourage movement and maintain hygiene. Continuous risk assessments and observations are required.  
- **Third Stage:** Physiological or active management is permitted, with close monitoring of blood loss.  
- **Post-Birth Care:** Prioritize skin-to-skin contact, maternal warmth, and monitoring for bleeding.  
- **Emergencies:** Immediate action is required for shoulder dystocia, PPH, or maternal collapse. Evacuate the pool using an emergency net if needed.  
- **Breech & Home Births:** Waterbirth is contraindicated for breech; home waterbirths follow a separate protocol (MP060).  
- **Hygiene:** The pool must be cleaned before each use and every 24 hours.  

The protocol emphasizes prompt emergency response while respecting maternal autonomy where safe.
