### **Cord Prolapse Management Summary**  

Cord prolapse occurs when the umbilical cord descends past the presenting fetal part after membrane rupture, with an incidence of 0.1â€“0.6%. Risk factors include breech presentation, long cord, and artificial rupture of membranes.  

**Key Management Steps:**  
- **Immediate action** upon diagnosis: Call for help, prepare for emergency cesarean section.  
- **Antenatal care:** High-risk pregnancies (e.g., breech) should be reviewed by an obstetric consultant; urgent hospital presentation if labor signs occur.  
- **Postnatal care:** Offer debriefing to reduce post-traumatic stress.  
- **Training & Audit:** Annual obstetric emergency training, mandatory clinical incident reporting, and audits in hospital/community settings.  

**Governance:**  
- Aligns with NICE (2023) Intrapartum Care guidelines.  
- Replaces previous protocols (MP047, CG12026).  
- Approved by Obstetric, Governance, and Clinical Document Approval Groups.  
- Next review due November 2027.
