The clinical guideline for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage focuses on diagnosing and managing early pregnancy complications in women up to 13 weeks pregnant. Recommendations include providing support, information, and early pregnancy assessment services, as well as recognizing symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy. Healthcare professionals should treat women with dignity, offer evidence-based information, and refer unstable women to A&E. The guideline also covers management options such as medical and surgical treatments for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Research is needed to understand the psychological impact of different management strategies and improve emotional recovery for affected women. Early diagnosis and proper management are crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths associated with ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages.
