The clinical guideline on the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying risk factors and monitoring patients. It classifies hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia and recommends various diagnostic and surveillance methods. Treatment options include observation, progestogens, and surgical management in certain cases. The guideline also addresses specific considerations for women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, those wishing to conceive, and those on hormone replacement therapy. The use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is recommended for hyperplasia without atypia. Further research is needed to determine the most appropriate management approach, and regular endometrial surveillance is recommended for all patients.
