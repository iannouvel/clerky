This clinical guideline highlights the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic hysterectomy techniques, but also notes the higher risk of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Specialized training is recommended for healthcare professionals to ensure safe performance of these procedures. Different laparoscopic procedures are outlined for various benign conditions and cancers of the uterus and ovaries. While laparoscopic techniques have been shown to reduce hospital stay and recovery time, there is a higher incidence of major bleeding and urinary tract injuries. Healthcare providers should consider this guidance when making decisions for patients, with local implementation being the responsibility of commissioners and providers.
