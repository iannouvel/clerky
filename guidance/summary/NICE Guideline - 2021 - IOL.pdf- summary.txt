The clinical guideline on inducing labor focuses on providing information and support for pregnant women considering induction. Discussions should include preferences for birth mode, risks and benefits of induction, and alternative options. Additional monitoring may be recommended for women from minority ethnic backgrounds or living in deprived areas. Recommendations cover preterm and term prelabour rupture of membranes, breech position, fetal growth restriction, and more. Monitoring fetal wellbeing, avoiding complications, and providing pain relief are essential during induction. The guideline also addresses the use of different methods for induction based on Bishop score and the importance of respecting women's choices.
