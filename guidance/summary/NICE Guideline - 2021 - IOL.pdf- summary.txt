The clinical guideline on inducing labor focuses on providing pregnant women with information and support to make informed decisions. Discussions should include preferences for birth, risks and benefits of induction, and alternative options. Additional monitoring may be recommended for certain groups. The guideline covers topics such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, breech position, fetal growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death. Recommendations include monitoring uterine activity, managing hyperstimulation, offering various induction methods, and providing pain relief options. The guideline aims to reduce risks and ensure individualized care for women considering induction of labor.
