The clinical guideline for the management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) emphasizes the importance of recording symptoms prospectively over two cycles using a symptom diary for diagnosis. Referral to a gynaecologist should be considered if simple measures fail, and a multidisciplinary team may be beneficial for severe cases. First-line pharmaceutical interventions include drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives and percutaneous estradiol with cyclical progestogens. Cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs are recommended for severe PMS, while spironolactone can be used for physical symptoms. Surgical options like hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy may be considered in cases where medical management has failed. Complementary therapies and nutritional supplements can also be effective in managing PMS symptoms.
