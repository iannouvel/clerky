External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position, reducing the need for a caesarean section. Success rates are around 50%, with possible increased risks of caesarean section and instrumental delivery during labor. Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve success rates, and ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks gestation. Regional analgesia is not routinely recommended but can be considered. ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners in facilities with monitoring and surgical delivery capabilities. Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended for D negative women undergoing ECV. Future research should focus on improving detection, uptake, and success rates of ECV.
