The November 2017 clinical guideline on Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) provides evidence-based recommendations for investigating and managing women with two or more pregnancy losses. Key points include addressing psychosocial needs, educating on lifestyle factors affecting RPL, tailoring diagnostic investigations based on history and genetic analysis, and emphasizing personalized care and shared decision-making. The guideline advises against certain tests like cytokine testing while recommending ANA testing, thyroid screening, and thrombophilia screening, particularly for APS. Treatment options may include anticoagulant therapy, addressing thyroid dysfunction, and considering genetic abnormalities based on individual risk factors. Uterine anatomy assessment, male lifestyle factors, and genetic counseling for abnormal results are also highlighted. Lifestyle modifications, psychological support, and specialized RPL clinics are recommended for comprehensive care. The guideline also underlines the importance of assessing homocysteine levels, uterine malformations, male factors, prognostic factors, and treatment options for RPL. Further research is needed to enhance management strategies in RPL.
