**Summary of PMRT Investigations SOP**  

This SOP outlines the structured investigation process for stillbirths and neonatal deaths using the Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT). It applies to late fetal losses, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and post-neonatal deaths. The goal is to conduct multidisciplinary reviews to determine causes, improve care, and meet reporting obligations (MBRRACE-UK).  

Key steps include:  
- **Initial actions**: Classify cases as serious incidents, secure medical records within 72 hours, and conduct an initial review.  
- **Communication**: Ensure accessible support for families (BSL interpreters, translation services, text/SMS options). Anticipated delays must be communicated.  
- **Review process**: A multidisciplinary team (MDT), including external reviewers, examines care, records, and post-mortem findings (if applicable). HSIB investigates early neonatal deaths under specific criteria.  
- **Family engagement**: Provide feedback opportunities, share the PMRT report face-to-face, and offer ongoing support contacts.  
- **Staff support**: Facilitate debriefs, coroner statements, and signpost to wellbeing resources.  
- **Monitoring**: Quarterly audits ensure compliance with NHS Resolution Safety Action 10.  

The SOP emphasizes transparency, family-centered communication, and systematic learning to enhance perinatal care.
