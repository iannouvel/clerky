The clinical guideline for Placenta Praevia and Placenta Accreta provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of these conditions during pregnancy and delivery. Key points include risk factors, antenatal care, delivery planning, and postpartum management. The guideline emphasizes the importance of tailored care based on individual circumstances and symptoms, as well as the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, anesthetists, and hematologists. Recommendations for delivery timing, mode of delivery, and potential complications are outlined, with a focus on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. Future research areas are identified to improve patient care and outcomes for women with placenta praevia and placenta accreta.
