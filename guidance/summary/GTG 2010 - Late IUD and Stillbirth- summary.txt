The clinical guideline for late intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth aims to provide evidence-based options for women who have experienced a late IUFD after 24 weeks of pregnancy. It emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis using real-time ultrasonography and recommends a range of tests to identify potential causes. Recommendations include antenatal care in subsequent pregnancies, induction of labor using mifepristone and misoprostol, and monitoring for complications such as gestational diabetes. The guideline also addresses the emotional impact of stillbirth on parents, offering support services and counseling. It highlights the need for standardized care, training, and ongoing research in this area.
