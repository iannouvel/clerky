The clinical guideline provides recommendations for managing HIV in pregnant and postpartum women to prevent vertical transmission to infants. Key points include initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all pregnant women, monitoring CD4 cell counts and viral loads, and choosing specific ART regimens based on viral load levels. Delivery mode recommendations vary based on viral load levels. Postpartum care stresses continuing cART, mental health assessment, and infant monitoring. The guideline also covers psychosocial care, sexual health screening, and infant feeding guidance. It emphasizes multidisciplinary care, peer support, mental health assessment, and social support for women with HIV during and after pregnancy to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce vertical transmission rates through evidence-based strategies.
