The clinical guideline provides guidance on the treatment and management of women living with HIV during pregnancy and postpartum, as well as their infants. Recommendations include the use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent vertical transmission of HIV, mode of delivery, and management of specific patient populations. Updates include prevalence data on HIV in pregnancy, infant feeding advice, and expanded sections on psychosocial care. The guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach, regular monitoring of viral load and CD4 cell counts, and lifelong ART for all pregnant women. The goal is to optimize the health of both mothers and infants while reducing vertical transmission rates.
