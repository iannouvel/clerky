Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation during pregnancy and lifelong treatment for pregnant women living with HIV
- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression
- Sexual health screening for newly diagnosed pregnant women with HIV
- Continuation of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for women conceiving on cART
- Recommendation of Tenofovir DF or abacavir with emtricitabine or lamivudine as nucleoside backbone
- Deferral of invasive prenatal diagnostic testing until HIV status is known
- Mode of delivery based on maternal viral load

Treatment and Management:
- Multidisciplinary antenatal HIV care
- Peer support for pregnant women living with HIV
- HIV resistance testing before treatment initiation
- Regular CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load tests for women conceiving on cART
- Initiation of treatment for pregnant women with baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL by the start of the second trimester
- Integrase inhibitor-based regimens for certain patients
- Discussion of dolutegravir use in pregnancy considering risks of neural tube defects
- Monitoring of liver function tests and interventions for unsuppressed viral load
- Postpartum care including cART continuation, mental health evaluation, and contraception discussion

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitoring of CD4 cell counts throughout pregnancy
- Regular HIV viral load tests during pregnancy
- Monitoring of liver function tests
- Monitoring of infant HIV status with molecular diagnostics and antibody testing

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Deferral of invasive prenatal diagnostic tests until viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL
- Immediate testing required if viral load is ≥400 copies/mL, with cART and nevirapine administration
- Vaginal delivery supported for viral load <50 copies/mL, cesarean section recommended for viral load ≥400 copies/mL
- Postpartum zidovudine infusion recommended for viral load >1000 copies/mL
- Breastfeeding supported for virologically suppressed women, formula feeding recommended otherwise

Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Increased risk of preterm delivery with protease inhibitors vs nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based HAART during pregnancy
- No difference in risk of preterm birth between lopinavir/ritonavir vs efavirenz-based ART
- Unique management considerations for HIV, chronic HBV infection, and pregnancy
- Routine monitoring of liver function tests throughout pregnancy and postpartum
- Management of women with both HCV and HIV during pregnancy
- Fetal ultrasound imaging recommended regardless of maternal HIV status
- Mode of delivery based on plasma viral load results at 36 weeks

Treatment and Management:
- Referral to specialist for comprehensive care for HIV, chronic HBV infection, and pregnancy
- Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and lamivudine as backbone for HIV/HBV co-infection treatment
- Consideration of tenofovir alafenamide after first trimester
- Maternal cART with prompt neonatal immunoprophylaxis for preventing vertical transmission of HBV
- Immediate neonatal immunisation within 24 hours of delivery
- Zidovudine monotherapy or combination post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for infants based on risk level
- Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected infants
- Breastfeeding advice for women with HIV

Monitoring Requirements:
- Regular monitoring of liver function tests throughout pregnancy and postpartum
- Regular monitoring of plasma viral load for risk level determination and treatment approach
- Monthly clinic visits for HIV RNA viral load testing during and after breastfeeding
- Disclosure of HIV status to partner/family and healthcare provider
- Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection in infants

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Relative contraindication of liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry during pregnancy
- Contraindication of ribavirin in pregnancy and avoidance in male partners of pregnant women
- Immediate discontinuation of ribavirin if pregnancy occurs during treatment
- Limited duration of PEP for infants, not exceeding 2 weeks for very low-risk or 4 weeks for low-risk infants even if breastfed
