Clinical guidance for managing HIV in pregnant and postpartum women and infants involves antenatal care, peer support, depression assessment, sexual health screening, HIV resistance testing, CD4 cell count monitoring, initiating ART during pregnancy with Tenofovir DF or abacavir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine, considering integrase inhibitors, starting cART immediately if presenting after 28 weeks, deferring invasive prenatal testing until HIV status known, deferring invasive tests until viral load <50 copies/mL, using cART and nevirapine for immediate testing, vaginal delivery for viral load <50 copies/mL, CS for viral load ≥400 copies/mL, PLCS for viral load 50-399 copies/mL, Zidovudine infusion for viral load >1000 copies/mL, facility birth with pediatric care, water births for viral load <50 copies/mL, infant monitoring with molecular diagnostics and antibody testing, continuing cART postpartum, mental health evaluation, contraception discussion, and cervical cytology. Considerations include individualizing treatment, avoiding Zidovudine monotherapy, starting treatment for viral load >100,000 copies/mL by second trimester, using integrase inhibitors for high viral load, monitoring NNRTIs and integrase inhibitors, considering PI dose adjustments, switching from cobicistat to ritonavir with PIs, and continuing ART postpartum. Monitoring, adherence, triple antiretroviral therapy for prevention, no preterm birth risk difference between lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz-based ART, liver function tests, tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and lamivudine for HIV/HBV co-infection, HAV vaccine for HBV/HIV co-infection, avoiding ribavirin in pregnancy for HCV, immediate HBV neonatal immunization, vaginal delivery if viral load <50 copies/mL, PLCS if ≥400 copies/mL, zidovudine monotherapy for low-risk neonates, combination PEP for high-risk, cART for HIV and HCV postpartum, HAV vaccination for HCV/HIV co-infection, zidovudine monotherapy for neonates of cART mothers, breastfeeding advice per viral load, monthly HIV RNA viral load testing during and after breastfeeding, partner and provider HIV status disclosure, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-exposed uninfected children, risk-adapted HIV-1 transmission prophylaxis, mental health assessment, contraceptive discussion postpartum, 3-month cytology post-delivery, partner and older children testing for new diagnoses, and specific zidovudine dosing in infants.
