The clinical guideline for the management of monochorionic twin pregnancies emphasizes the importance of early ultrasound examinations to assess fetal viability, gestational age, and chorionicity. Regular fetal ultrasound assessments are recommended every two weeks from 16 weeks onwards until delivery, with screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities offered. Specific complications such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome should be monitored, and treatment should be managed in fetal medicine centers with specialist expertise. Delivery of monochorionic twins should be discussed, with elective delivery offered from 36 weeks. Selective reduction may be necessary in higher order pregnancies, and discordant abnormalities should be promptly assessed and managed in fetal medicine centers. Monitoring for fetal anaemia and neurological morbidity is also highlighted in the guideline.
