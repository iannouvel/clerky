The clinical guideline for the management of monochorionic twin pregnancies emphasizes the importance of early ultrasound examinations to assess fetal viability, chorionicity, and potential complications such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Regular fetal ultrasound assessments and screenings for chromosomal abnormalities and structural issues are recommended throughout the pregnancy, with delivery options discussed from 36 weeks onwards. Specialized fetal medicine centers should manage conditions like TTTS, selective growth restriction, and single twin demise. Monitoring for fetal anomalies, growth discrepancies, and neurological morbidity is crucial, with interventions such as fetoscopic laser ablation recommended for TTTS cases. The guideline also highlights the need for ongoing research and training in managing monochorionic twin pregnancies effectively.
