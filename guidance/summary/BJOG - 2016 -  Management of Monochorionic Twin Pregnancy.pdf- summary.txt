The clinical guideline for the management of monochorionic twin pregnancies emphasizes the importance of early ultrasound examinations to assess fetal viability, gestational age, and chorionicity. Regular fetal ultrasound assessments are recommended every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards until delivery, with screening for chromosomal abnormalities and specific complications such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Treatment for conditions like TTTS should be managed in fetal medicine centers with specialist expertise. Delivery of monochorionic twins should be discussed and elective delivery offered from 36 weeks. Selective reduction may be necessary in higher order pregnancies with monochorionicity. Monitoring for complications and abnormalities in monochorionic twins is crucial for optimal management.
