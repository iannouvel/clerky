This guideline focuses on midwifery care during the latent phase of labor, emphasizing emotional and physical support for women. It defines the latent and established first stages of labor, outlines staff responsibilities, and provides criteria for clinical assessment. Antenatal education, telephone advice, and fetal heart rate monitoring are discussed. Women are encouraged to remain at home during the latent phase, engaging in normal activities and utilizing pain management techniques such as breathing exercises, water immersion, massage, aromatherapy, yoga, and acupressure. Distractions, TENS machines, hot water bottles, various positions, and breathing techniques are recommended at home. In a hospital setting, analgesic options like Paracetamol, codeine, or opioids may be offered, with careful consideration of side effects. Sedatives like Temazepam may be used for sleep disturbances. Women should be educated on symptoms necessitating immediate medical attention.
