**Summary of Clinical Guideline for Multiple Pregnancy and Birth**  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Chorionicity determination** via early ultrasound is critical for risk stratification and management.  
- **Referral pathways:** Twin pregnancies to obstetric-led care by 16 weeks; triplets directly to fetal medicine.  
- **Active management of third stage** (oxytocin 10 IU IM) is recommended to reduce postpartum hemorrhage risk.  

**Clinical Monitoring & Interventions:**  
- **Frequent growth scans** based on chorionicity (e.g., every 2–4 weeks for monochorionic twins).  
- **Continuous CTG monitoring** in labor (>26 weeks), with ultrasound confirmation of fetal positions.  
- **Preterm labor (23–25+6 weeks):** Senior obstetrician involvement, neonatal team alert, and IV access with FBC/Group & Save.  

**Labor & Delivery:**  
- **Staffing:** Middle-grade/consultant obstetrician must attend delivery; neonatal support required.  
- **Second twin management:**  
  - Expedite delivery (ideally within 45 minutes of first twin).  
  - External/internal version or cesarean if malposition or fetal compromise.  
- **Delivery setting:** Theater transfer if complications arise.  

**Antenatal Care Schedule:**  
- **Twins:** Consultant-led care with structured scans (e.g., anomaly scan at 20 weeks, growth scans from 24 weeks).  
- **Triplets:** Fetal medicine team oversight, with scans every 2 weeks from 16 weeks.  
- **Corticosteroids** for fetal lung maturation if preterm delivery anticipated.  

**Patient Counseling:**  
- Discuss risks (preterm labor, TTTS, delivery mode options) and provide emotional/support group referrals.  
- **Birth planning:** Timing (e.g., planned delivery at 37 weeks for twins, 35 weeks for triplets) and mode (vaginal vs. cesarean) individualized.  

**Critical Actions:**  
- Avoid physiological third-stage management in multiples.  
- Ensure multidisciplinary coordination (obstetrics, neonatology, anesthesia) for high-risk deliveries.  
- Document and communicate care plans clearly in handheld notes.
