**Clinical Guideline Summary: Urinary Incontinence Surgery Management**  

This guideline outlines standardized care for women undergoing urinary incontinence surgery, emphasizing evidence-based practices while allowing for clinical judgment.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Pre-Operative:** Patients should fast from midnight and adhere to routine observations and enhanced recovery protocols.  
- **Post-Operative Bladder Care:** Most procedures do not require catheterization. Ensure spontaneous voiding before discharge and monitor for retention.  
- **PVR/TWOC Management:** Measure post-void residual (PVR) within 4 hours post-surgery. Catheterize if residuals are high.  
- **Discharge Criteria:** Patients may eat/drink post-recovery and can be discharged once voiding adequately and clinically stable.  
- **Follow-Up:** Scheduled urogynecology clinic visits for ongoing assessment.  

**Clinical Considerations:**  
- Urinary incontinence affects 15-30% of women >65 years, significantly impacting quality of life.  
- Avoid unnecessary catheterization unless retention is confirmed.  
- Early mobilization and oral intake support recovery.  

This protocol ensures efficient, patient-centered care while minimizing complications.
