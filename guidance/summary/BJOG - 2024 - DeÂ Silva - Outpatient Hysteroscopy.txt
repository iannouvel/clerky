Gynaecology departments should offer outpatient hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding, reproductive issues, and IUD procedures; provide pre-appointment information on benefits, risks, and analgesia; consider vaginoscopy as the standard technique; prefer mechanical tissue removal systems over bipolar electrodes; use saline at low pressure; avoid routine conscious sedation; obtain informed consent and perform safety checks, excluding pregnancy; discuss findings and offer recovery area post-procedure; consider NSAIDs, TENS, opioids, or antispasmodics for pain management; avoid routine cervical dilatation; consider local anesthesia based on approach; monitor conscious sedation closely if used; use smaller diameter hysteroscopes for reduced pain and better outcomes; avoid routine antibiotic prophylaxis; document findings systematically; and collect data for quality assurance. Studies have shown effectiveness of different pain management methods, cervical preparation medications, hysteroscope types, and anesthesia techniques in improving patient comfort and procedural success during outpatient hysteroscopy.
