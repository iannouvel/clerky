Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Indications for outpatient hysteroscopy include abnormal uterine bleeding, reproductive issues, and intrauterine device management.
- Diagnostic criteria include providing written information to patients before the procedure, discussing benefits and risks, and ensuring patient awareness of anesthesia options.
- Clinical presentations may involve pain and distress during the procedure, requiring patient communication with the clinical team.

Treatment and Management:
- Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), opioids, and antispasmodics for pain management prior to hysteroscopy.
- Consideration of cervical preparation with vaginal prostaglandins in selected cases.
- Preference for mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems over miniature bipolar electrodes.
- Avoidance of routine conscious sedation in outpatient hysteroscopy procedures.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor for pain levels and distress during the procedure.
- Monitor for side effects of pain management medications.
- Monitor for complications such as vasovagal reactions and uterine trauma.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Avoid routine cervical dilatation before outpatient hysteroscopy.
- Use caution with conscious sedation, ensuring appropriate patient selection and monitoring.
- Consider individual contraindications to specific pain management medications.
