Recommendations for outpatient hysteroscopy include providing written information before the appointment, offering various analgesic options, avoiding routine conscious sedation, and using vaginoscopy as the standard technique. Mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems are preferred, and saline should be instilled at low pressure for optimal visualization. Cervical preparation with prostaglandins can be considered in selected cases. Flexible hysteroscopes and smaller-diameter instruments are associated with less pain and better outcomes. Monitoring for adverse events and ensuring informed consent are crucial. Studies have evaluated pain management methods and cervical preparation efficacy in outpatient hysteroscopy. Different hysteroscope types and medications can impact patient experience and procedure success.
