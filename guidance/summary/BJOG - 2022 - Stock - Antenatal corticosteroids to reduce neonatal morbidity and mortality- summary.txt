Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended within seven days prior to preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal death, as well as respiratory distress syndrome. For planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, potential risks and benefits should be discussed. Corticosteroids should be offered between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks for imminent preterm birth. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm premature rupture of membranes at increased risk of preterm birth. Birth should not be delayed for antenatal corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids and their effectiveness in various populations and circumstances.
