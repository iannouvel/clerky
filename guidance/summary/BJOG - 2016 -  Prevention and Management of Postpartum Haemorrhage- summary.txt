The clinical guideline for the Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage emphasizes the importance of identifying and managing risk factors for PPH, offering uterotonics during labor, and considering additional treatments like tranexamic acid for high-risk cases. Communication, multidisciplinary care, and prompt resuscitation measures are essential in managing PPH, with surgical interventions considered if pharmacological measures fail. The guideline also discusses the use of various techniques like uterine balloon tamponade, haemostatic suturing, and selective arterial occlusion for controlling bleeding. Training, documentation, and debriefing after each case are highlighted as crucial components of optimal PPH management.
