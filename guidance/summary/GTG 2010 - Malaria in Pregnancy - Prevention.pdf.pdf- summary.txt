The clinical guideline on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy provides recommendations for UK residents traveling to endemic areas. Pregnant women are at risk of complications from malaria, including reduced birth weight and maternal mortality. The guideline advises on travel recommendations and preventive measures, such as chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine in chloroquine-resistant areas. Chloroquine and proguanil are safe but not effective in these areas, while doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Standby emergency treatment for suspected malaria should be quinine and clindamycin. The guideline emphasizes the importance of awareness, prompt medical attention, and education on preventive measures for pregnant women.
