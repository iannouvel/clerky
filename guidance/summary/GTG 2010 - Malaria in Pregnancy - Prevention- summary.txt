The clinical guideline on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy provides information for UK residents traveling to endemic areas. Pregnant women are at risk of complications from malaria, including reduced birth weight in the fetus. Prevention strategies include avoiding travel to endemic areas if possible, using chemoprophylaxis in high-risk areas, and practicing bite prevention. Mefloquine is the preferred drug for chemoprophylaxis, with other options available if necessary. Standby emergency treatment should be provided to pregnant travelers, and written instructions for standby treatment are recommended. The guideline also includes recommendations for preventing anaemia in pregnancy and grades of recommendations based on evidence levels.
