### **Summary of GP015: Management of Patients Admitted for Vaginal Wall Repair**  

This guideline outlines the standardized management of patients undergoing vaginal wall repair (anterior/posterior colporrhaphy) for prolapse. Key principles include preoperative optimization, perioperative care, and postoperative follow-up to minimize complications.  

**Preoperative Management:**  
- Confirm diagnosis via clinical assessment (POP-Q staging if applicable).  
- Exclude urinary symptoms (consider urodynamics if indicated).  
- Optimize medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, anticoagulation).  
- Ensure informed consent, including risks (e.g., dyspareunia, recurrence).  

**Postoperative Bladder Care:**  
- Indwelling catheter for 24â€“48 hours post-surgery; trial without catheter (TWOC) before discharge.  
- Monitor for urinary retention; intermittent catheterization if needed.  
- Exclude UTI if symptomatic.  

**Postoperative Prescriptions & Follow-Up:**  
- Analgesia (avoid NSAIDs if contraindicated).  
- Prophylactic antibiotics if catheterized.  
- Laxatives to prevent straining.  
- Follow-up at 6 weeks to assess healing, prolapse recurrence, and complications (e.g., mesh exposure).  

**Standards & Compliance:**  
- Adherence to catheter protocols, infection prevention, and timely discharge planning.  
- Audit compliance with perioperative care pathways.  

This protocol ensures safe, evidence-based management of vaginal wall prolapse repair.
