The clinical guideline focuses on improving the safety of pregnant women cared for by midwives who are friends or relatives. It outlines responsibilities, emphasizing the need for midwives to follow a structured framework for supervision. Midwives must understand and apply the guidance, maintaining appropriate boundaries and seeking advice if conflicts of interest arise. The guideline covers antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care for friends or relatives. Failure to adhere to the procedure may result in adverse outcomes for the mother or baby and impact the midwife's wellbeing. Compliance with the guideline will be monitored during annual appraisals and supervision checks.
