**Summary of Clinical Guideline for Assisted Delivery**  

Key recommendations include positioning the mother flat or in McRobertsâ€™ maneuver to facilitate delivery. Apply suprapubic pressure if shoulder dystocia is suspected. If ineffective, proceed with internal maneuvers (e.g., delivery of the posterior arm or rotating the shoulders obliquely). Episiotomy may be performed if required. If unsuccessful, escalate to the Consultant Obstetrician and Anaesthetist promptly.  

Document the use of the OASI care bundle (Yes/No). Record the mode of delivery for the head (spontaneous, ventouse, or forceps) and fetal position during dystocia. Essential neonatal details include birth weight, Apgar scores, and cord gases. Provide a clear explanation to parents and ensure pediatric assessment post-delivery. Note if the baby requires admission to the Neonatal Unit (NNU) and document staff attendance at birth.  

Critical management steps emphasize timely intervention, clear communication, and thorough documentation to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes.
