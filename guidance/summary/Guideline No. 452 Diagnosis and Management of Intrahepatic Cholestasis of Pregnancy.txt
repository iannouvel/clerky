Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a common liver condition in late pregnancy characterized by itching and elevated bile acids, posing risks such as preterm birth and stillbirth. Treatment involves ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth based on bile acid levels. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common. Clinicians should suspect ICP in pregnant individuals with itching, confirm with bile acid testing, offer ursodeoxycholic acid, and monitor based on bile acid levels. Continuous fetal monitoring during labor is recommended. Maternal and fetal risks include pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the main treatment, with potential benefits in reducing preterm birth risk. Referral to a specialist may be needed for refractory cases. Postpartum follow-up, contraception considerations, and recurrence risk should be addressed. The World Health Organization recommends combined contraception postpartum for those with ICP. Further research is needed to enhance understanding and management of ICP.
