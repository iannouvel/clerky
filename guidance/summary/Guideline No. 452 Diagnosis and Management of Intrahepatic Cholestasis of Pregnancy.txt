Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver condition that can have serious consequences for both the mother and the fetus. It is characterized by itching and elevated bile acids, and can lead to preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment involves medication to alleviate symptoms and early delivery based on bile acid levels. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common, and monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Close monitoring during labor is recommended, and resolution of symptoms should be confirmed postpartum. Patients and family members are at higher risk for ICP in future pregnancies, and contraceptive options should be discussed.
