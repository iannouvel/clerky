Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is characterized by itching and elevated serum bile acids
- Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth
- Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated total serum bile acids
- Common symptoms include pruritus
- Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities

Treatment and Management:
- Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is recommended for treating itching
- Planned early birth based on bile acid levels is advised
- Referral to a specialist for refractory cases may be beneficial
- Continuous fetal monitoring during labor is recommended
- Postpartum confirmation of symptom resolution is necessary
- World Health Organization endorses postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception for individuals with ICP

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitoring of bile acid levels for fetal outcomes
- Follow-up laboratory testing to assess fetal risk
- Consider fetal monitoring with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasound
- Delivery timing based on the highest recorded non-fasting bile acid level

Contraindications and Cautions:
- No specific contraindications mentioned
- Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities
- Individuals with ICP are at an increased risk of acquiring metabolic disease during adulthood
