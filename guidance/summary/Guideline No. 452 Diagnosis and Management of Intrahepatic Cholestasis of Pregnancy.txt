Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) presents in late pregnancy with itching and elevated bile acids, associated with perinatal risks like preterm birth and stillbirth; diagnosis involves bile acid testing. Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid for itching and planned early birth guided by bile acid levels; fetal monitoring during labor is advised. Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is common. Risk factors for ICP include advanced maternal age, multiparity, diabetes, and certain ethnicities. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the mainstay treatment, potentially reducing preterm birth risk; refractory cases may require specialist referral. Follow-up monitoring postpartum is crucial. Fetal monitoring and delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels. Recurrence risk in future pregnancies is high, and individuals with ICP are at increased risk of metabolic disease. Contraception with combined estrogen-progestin is endorsed postpartum. Differential diagnoses include AFLP, autoimmune hepatitis, and HELLP syndrome. Recommendations for iatrogenic birth are based on non-fasting bile acid levels.
