### **Diabetes in Pregnancy Maternity Protocol (MP018) – Summary**  

This protocol applies to pregnant individuals with pre-existing or gestational diabetes, emphasizing structured care to optimize outcomes.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Pre-existing Diabetes:** Pre-pregnancy planning and routine monitoring are essential.  
- **Glycaemic Targets:** Maintain fasting glucose ≤6.0 mmol/L and postprandial ≤7.8 mmol/L.  
- **Insulin Management:** Offer insulin pump therapy if needed; educate on hypoglycemia and provide glucagon.  
- **MODY Diabetes:** Genetic testing is required; manage similarly to pre-existing diabetes.  
- **Gestational Diabetes:** Offer metformin or insulin if diet/exercise fails to control glucose.  

**Critical Management Steps:**  
- **Antenatal Care:** Regular monitoring, 20-week ultrasound, and individualized management plans.  
- **Delivery:** Continuous glucose monitoring during labor; stop VRIII at delivery.  
- **Neonatal Care:** Monitor babies for hypoglycemia post-birth.  
- **Postpartum:** Return insulin to pre-pregnancy levels; check HbA1c at 6–13 weeks. Advise on future diabetes risk and annual screening for gestational diabetes cases.  

**Documentation & Multidisciplinary Care:**  
- Maintain accurate records, including MDT involvement and antenatal schedules.  
- Provide lifestyle and weight management advice throughout pregnancy and postpartum.  

This protocol ensures structured, evidence-based care for diabetic pregnancies to minimize complications.
