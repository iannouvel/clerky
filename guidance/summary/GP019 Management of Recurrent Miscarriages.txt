**Summary of Recurrent Miscarriage Guideline (GP019)**  

This guideline outlines the management of recurrent miscarriage, defined as three or more consecutive first-trimester losses, one or more second-trimester losses, or two losses in women aged â‰¥38. Key investigations include testing for **antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS)** (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies) six weeks post-loss. **Karyotyping** of pregnancy tissue is recommended after the third miscarriage. A **thrombophilia screen** is advised only for second-trimester losses, with LMWH considered if positive.  

Women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage should receive **reassurance and early EPU contact** in future pregnancies. Anti-D administration follows standard miscarriage protocols. Management decisions should involve **consultant input**, particularly for thrombophilia treatment. Staff must apply **professional judgment** while adhering to protocol standards. Regular review ensures alignment with national recommendations.
