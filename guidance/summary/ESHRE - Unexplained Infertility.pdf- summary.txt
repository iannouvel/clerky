The clinical guideline on unexplained infertility emphasizes the controversial nature of the diagnosis, which is made when no abnormalities are found in the reproductive systems of both partners. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology developed a comprehensive guideline that includes tests for confirmation of ovulation, evaluation of ovarian reserve, and exclusion of uterine anomalies. The guideline recommends against unnecessary testing such as laparoscopy and post-coital tests. It also advises against certain treatments like IVF over IUI with ovarian stimulation. The guideline highlights the importance of considering individual characteristics, preferences, beliefs, and values in making clinical decisions for couples with unexplained infertility.
