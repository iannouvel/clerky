The clinical guideline recommends the use of Carbetocin to prevent postpartum hemorrhage after caesarean birth in theatre. It is suggested as an alternative to oxytocin and should be offered to all patients undergoing a caesarean birth, unless contraindicated. Carbetocin should be administered after the birth of the baby and as soon as possible after umbilical cord clamping, with a recommended dose of 100 micrograms over 1 minute. Contraindications include pregnancy, hypersensitivity to Carbetocin, and serious cardiovascular disorders. Cautions for use include cardiovascular disease, severe hypotension, and pre-eclampsia. Common adverse effects may include nausea, headache, and hypotension. Monitoring arrangements should include compliance with guidelines and reviewing incident cases.
