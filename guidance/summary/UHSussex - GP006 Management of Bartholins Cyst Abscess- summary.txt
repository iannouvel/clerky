Bartholin's cyst is a build-up of mucous in the Bartholin's gland, while Bartholin's abscess is an infected cyst causing inflammation and pain. Management involves surgical intervention for abscesses, with outpatient options like the WORD catheter for women under 40. Marsupialization is recommended for women over 40 due to the risk of adenocarcinoma. The WORD catheter provides a drainage option, while marsupialization requires general anesthesia. Discharge planning includes education, follow-up, and no routine antibiotics. Recurrent abscesses may indicate further investigation. Both procedures have pros and cons, with the WORD catheter offering convenience and a high success rate, while marsupialization requires more recovery time but has long-term data available.
