### **Pregnancy Loss > 14 Weeks: Clinical Summary**  

This protocol provides structured guidance for managing pregnancy loss after 14 weeks, including stillbirth, termination of pregnancy (TOP), and neonatal death. Key principles emphasize compassionate, individualized care while following clinical best practices.  

#### **Immediate Management**  
- Confirm fetal demise via ultrasound and inform the Registrar/Consultant.  
- Offer emotional support and clear explanations.  
- Vaginal birth is preferred, but caesarean may be considered based on maternal condition and preference.  

#### **Induction & Labour**  
- Induction regimens (mifepristone/misoprostol) vary by gestation.  
- Women with prior caesarean should discuss risks/benefits of induction.  
- Expectant management is an option if no complications arise.  
- Provide liberal analgesia, including regional anesthesia and patient-controlled options.  

#### **Post-Delivery Care**  
- Encourage memory-making (holding, photographs, handprints).  
- Offer post-mortem (PM) examination and placental histology.  
- Discuss funeral arrangements, including religious/cultural considerations.  
- Provide bereavement support (chaplaincy, SANDS, memory boxes).  

#### **Legal & Follow-Up**  
- Stillbirth (>24 weeks) requires certification and registration within 42 days.  
- Neonatal deaths must be reported to the coroner.  
- Follow-up within one week of discharge, including community midwife support.  
- Staff should document care and complete required paperwork (e.g., Datix).  

#### **Additional Considerations**  
- Twin loss: Support parents with memory-making and identify surviving twin (e.g., butterfly stickers).  
- Fathers, siblings, and extended family may need grief support.  
- Staff involved in bereavement care should access support as needed.  

This protocol ensures structured, sensitive care while respecting parental choices and legal requirements.
