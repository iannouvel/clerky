The NICE clinical guideline on preterm labor and birth aims to reduce the risks associated with preterm birth for both the baby and the mother. It provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, maternity service providers, and women at increased risk of preterm labor or having a planned preterm birth. The guideline covers various treatments, including prophylactic vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage, to prevent or delay early labor and birth. It also addresses the use of magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection, fetal monitoring options, mode of birth considerations, and the importance of identifying infections in women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Further research is recommended to improve outcomes for women and their babies.
