The NICE clinical guideline on preterm labor and birth, updated in June 2022, provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, maternity service providers, and women at risk of preterm birth. It advises on interventions such as prophylactic vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage for high-risk women, as well as the use of maternal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. The guideline also covers fetal monitoring, mode of birth, and infection management in preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Research recommendations include investigating the effectiveness of repeat corticosteroids and prophylactic progesterone. Overall, the guideline aims to reduce the risks associated with preterm birth and improve outcomes for both mother and baby.
