The NICE guideline on preterm labor and birth aims to reduce the risks associated with preterm birth for both the baby and the mother. It provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and women at increased risk of preterm labor or having a planned preterm birth. The guideline covers various treatments, including prophylactic vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage, tocolysis, maternal corticosteroids, and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. It also discusses fetal monitoring, mode of birth, and the importance of identifying infection in women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. The guideline emphasizes the need for further research on certain treatments and outcomes related to preterm birth.
