**Maternity Pressure Area Care Guideline Summary**  

This guideline outlines best practices for preventing and managing pressure area damage in intrapartum and postnatal women. Key risk factors include limited mobility, diabetes, poor circulation, medical devices, and prior pressure ulcers. Nutritional monitoring is essential for prevention.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Risk Assessment & Prevention:** Conduct skin assessments on admission, document care plans, and use pressure-reducing equipment for high-risk women.  
- **Intrapartum Care:** Maintain hygiene with regular pad changes, cleansing foam, barrier cream, and encourage mobilization.  
- **Elective C-Section Care:** Assess skin pre/post-surgery, ensure hydration, and follow pressure ulcer prevention measures.  
- **Postnatal Care:** Monitor diabetic mothers’ blood glucose, promote hygiene, and provide pressure care advice.  
- **Diagnosis & Management:** Differentiate pressure ulcers from moisture lesions, categorize ulcers (1–4, unstageable, deep tissue injury), and refer to tissue viability for severe cases.  
- **Audit:** Annual audits align with NICE CG179, reporting findings to governance boards.  

**Critical Actions:**  
- Document support surface rationale and compliance.  
- Perform regular skin inspections and update care plans.  
- Reposition patients as needed and educate on mobility.  
- Manage incontinence with barrier creams and hygiene protocols.  
- Assess nutrition/hydration and provide patient education.  

**Audit Tool:** Tracks compliance, wound documentation, and tissue viability referrals.
