**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Infant Feeding and Bonding in CCU**  

This guideline supports postnatal care in critical care units (CCU) to minimize mother-baby separation and promote breastfeeding. Key recommendations include:  

- **Mother-Baby Togetherness:** Ensure mothers/birthing parents remain with their baby in CCU, supported by a birth partner or maternity staff.  
- **Skin-to-Skin Contact:** Encourage early and frequent skin-to-skin contact to enhance bonding and reduce infection risks.  
- **Breastfeeding Support:** Assist with breastfeeding initiation and maintenance. If the mother is sedated or separated, provide a breast pump and guide its use, especially if the infant is >24 hours old.  
- **Shared Decision-Making:** When the mother is sedated, the birth partner, nursing, and maternity staff should collaborate to facilitate baby contact based on the motherâ€™s presumed wishes.  
- **Infection Prevention:** Skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are protective measures.  
- **Medication Safety:** Ensure prescribed medications are compatible with breastfeeding.  

The guideline emphasizes continuity of care, maternal-infant bonding, and lactation support while maintaining infection control standards.
