The clinical guideline focuses on the laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. It emphasizes the importance of experienced laparoscopists to ensure maternal and fetal safety, with studies showing better outcomes and fewer complications with laparoscopic surgery. The guideline discusses the risks and benefits of laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy, recommending careful consideration of anaesthetic risks, uterine displacement, and monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being during surgery. It also addresses the controversies surrounding laparoscopic appendicectomy and cholecystectomy in pregnancy, as well as the management of ovarian cysts and adnexal masses. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic procedures in pregnant women.
