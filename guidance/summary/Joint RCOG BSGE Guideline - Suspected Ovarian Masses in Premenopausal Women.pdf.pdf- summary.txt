This guideline provides recommendations for the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. Most masses are benign, and laparoscopic surgery is recommended for benign masses. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised if malignancy is suspected. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, and risk of malignancy can be estimated using the Risk of Malignancy Index. Women with simple ovarian cysts may not require follow-up, but larger or persistent cysts may need further imaging or surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred for elective management of benign masses. Other topics include risk assessment, differential diagnosis, and surgical management of ovarian masses.
