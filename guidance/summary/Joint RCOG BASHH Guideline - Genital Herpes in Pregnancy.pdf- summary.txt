The clinical guideline on the management of genital herpes in pregnancy provides recommendations for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. It covers antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, emphasizing the importance of reducing neonatal transmission risk. Treatment with aciclovir, paracetamol, and lidocaine gel is recommended for symptom relief, with daily suppressive aciclovir from 36 weeks of gestation to reduce viral shedding. Caesarean section is advised for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester. The guideline also addresses the management of recurrent genital herpes, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, and HIV-positive women with genital HSV infection. Recommendations are based on evidence levels and grading.
