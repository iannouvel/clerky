The clinical guideline on the Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy provides recommendations for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. Treatment with aciclovir is recommended to reduce symptoms and viral shedding, with daily suppressive therapy from 36 weeks of gestation. Caesarean section is advised for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester. Recurrent genital herpes poses a lower risk of neonatal transmission, with vaginal delivery recommended in such cases. The guideline emphasizes the importance of preventing postnatal transmission of HSV.
