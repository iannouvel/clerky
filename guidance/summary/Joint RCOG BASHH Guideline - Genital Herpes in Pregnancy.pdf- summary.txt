The clinical guideline on the Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy provides recommendations for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. Treatment options include oral or intravenous aciclovir, paracetamol, and lidocaine gel for symptomatic relief. Daily suppressive aciclovir from 36 weeks of gestation is recommended to reduce HSV lesions and asymptomatic shedding. Caesarean section is advised for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester. The guideline also includes recommendations for managing neonates and preventing postnatal transmission of HSV.
