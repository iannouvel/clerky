### **Summary of Clinical Guidelines for Medical Conditions in Pregnancy**  

#### **Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy**  
Cardiac disease is a leading cause of maternal mortality, particularly due to acquired heart disease. Pre-pregnancy assessment is essential for women with known cardiac conditions. Antenatal care should involve a **Combined Cardiac Obstetric clinic**, with inpatient monitoring for high-risk cases (e.g., congenital heart disease). A **delivery plan** must be established by **36 weeks**, with careful fluid and medication management during labour.  

#### **Epilepsy in Pregnancy**  
Seizure management follows a structured approach:  
- **First-line:** IV **benzodiazepines** if seizure >5 minutes.  
- **Second-line:** IV **phenytoin** if seizure persists.  
- **Status epilepticus:** Requires **IV phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and anaesthetic support**.  
- **Post-seizure care:** Assess injuries, monitor maternal/fetal wellbeing, and document interventions.  
- **Postnatal care:** Review medications, encourage breastfeeding, and refer for contraception.  

#### **Thyroid Disorders in Pregnancy**  
- **Hypothyroidism:** Requires **levothyroxine** with dose adjustments.  
- **Hyperthyroidism:** Managed with **propylthiouracil (PTU) or carbimazole** (avoid in first trimester).  
- **Contraindications:** Radioactive iodine and surgery.  
- **Postpartum thyroiditis:** Monitor for up to a year postpartum.  

#### **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in Pregnancy**  
- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria & cystitis:** Treat with **nitrofurantoin (avoid near term) or cephalexin**.  
- **Pyelonephritis:** Requires **IV antibiotics (cefuroxime)** and hospital admission.  
- **Recurrent UTIs:** Prophylaxis with **low-dose cephalexin**.  

#### **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) & Dialysis in Pregnancy**  
- **CKD:** Associated with **preterm birth & hypertension**; requires **multidisciplinary care**.  
- **Dialysis:** Increased pregnancy risk with **residual renal function**; aim for **predialysis urea <20 mmol/L**.  
- **Anemia management:** Adjust **erythropoietin** and consider **IV iron**.  

#### **Renal Transplant in Pregnancy**  
- **Pre-pregnancy counseling:** Discuss **graft function & immunosuppression risks**.  
- **Antenatal care:** Monitor **blood pressure (<135/85 mmHg)** and **renal function**.  
- **Delivery:** Aim for **38-40 weeks**, vaginal birth preferred unless complications arise.  

These guidelines ensure **safe maternal and fetal outcomes** through structured monitoring and timely interventions.
