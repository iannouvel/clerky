Management of inherited bleeding disorders in pregnancy involves monitoring and maintaining factor levels, offering prenatal diagnosis for severe hemophilia carriers, utilizing treatments like tranexamic acid and factor concentrates, and providing antenatal care by a multidisciplinary team. Postpartum management includes maintaining factor levels and monitoring for bleeding. Neonatal management involves diagnostic testing, administering vitamin K, and considering prophylaxis in severe cases. Women with VWD have an increased bleeding risk during pregnancy, and intrapartum management should focus on maintaining VWF activity levels. Factor XI deficiency poses risks of PPH and can be managed with tranexamic acid, factor XI concentrate, and FFP. Tailoring treatment for rare bleeding disorders involves adjusting interventions based on individual bleeding patterns. Genetic testing for at-risk fetuses can be done through CVS or amniocentesis, and PGD is an option for couples at risk of heritable disorders. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential during pregnancy and delivery for women with inherited bleeding disorders.
