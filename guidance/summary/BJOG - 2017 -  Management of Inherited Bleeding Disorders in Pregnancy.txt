Inherited bleeding disorders in pregnancy necessitate assessing hemophilia phenotypes and baseline factor levels pre-conception, offering carriers of severe hemophilia prenatal diagnosis, and ensuring multidisciplinary antenatal care with factor levels above 0.5 iu/ml during pregnancy. Von Willebrand disease management involves classifying based on VWF deficiency, checking VWF levels pre-conception, and maintaining levels above 0.5 iu/ml using DDAVP or VWF-containing concentrates if VWF activity or factor VIII levels are <0.50 iu/ml. Neonatal management includes diagnostic testing, cord blood sampling, and vitamin K administration; individualized treatment plans are required for fibrinogen disorders, factor XI deficiency, and other rare bleeding disorders. Postpartum, maintain factor levels, offer tranexamic acid, avoid thromboprophylaxis with low factor levels, and consider central neuraxial anesthesia cautiously. Avoid central neuraxial anesthesia, postpartum thromboprophylaxis, and NSAIDs in women with severe deficiencies; administer prothrombin complex concentrate for factor II activity <0.2 iu/ml, FFP for factor V activity <0.2 iu/ml, recombinant factor VIIa for factor VII activity <0.2 iu/ml, and prothrombin complex concentrate for factor X activity <0.3 iu/ml. Antenatal prophylaxis may include prothrombin complex concentrate for maintaining factor X >0.01 iu/ml and factor XIII concentrate to maintain factor XIII >0.2 iu/ml. Plan deliveries carefully in Bernard Soulier Syndrome with platelet transfusions and/or recombinant factor VIIa; avoid central neuraxial anesthesia and use tranexamic acid. In Glanzmann thrombasthenia, offer prepregnancy counseling, consider platelet transfusions, recombinant factor VIIa, and avoid DDAVP. For factor XI deficiency, consider FXI concentrate and monitor for thrombosis risk; for factor XIII deficiency, use Corifact/Fibrogammin/C226P prophylactically and consider recombinant factor XIII. Use fibrinogen concentrate for afibrinogenemia prophylaxis; follow guidelines for rare bleeding disorders diagnosis and treatment. Offer CVS for at-risk fetuses and consider amniocentesis for delivery planning; perform genetic analysis for familial mutations and consider PGD for heritable disorders. Stratify neonatal bleeding risk and manage accordingly based on specific diagnoses and platelet activity in term neonates.
