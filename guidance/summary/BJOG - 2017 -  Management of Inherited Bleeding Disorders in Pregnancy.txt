The clinical guideline focuses on managing inherited bleeding disorders in pregnancy, including hemophilia, von Willebrand disease (VWD), factor XI deficiency, and rare bleeding disorders. Recommendations include determining baseline factor levels pre-pregnancy, genetic counseling for carriers, monitoring and maintaining factor levels during pregnancy, and multidisciplinary antenatal care. Treatment options for VWD include DDAVP, VWF concentrates, tranexamic acid, and factor replacement. Factor XI deficiency management involves tranexamic acid, factor XI concentrate, and FFP, with personalized labor and delivery plans. Individualized treatment plans based on factor levels and bleeding phenotype are crucial. Recommendations include tailored management strategies, avoiding certain medications, and personalized care for optimal outcomes. Specific guidance is provided for labor, delivery, and postpartum care, including prophylactic treatments and genetic testing for at-risk fetuses. Neonatal bleeding risks and management are categorized based on specific diagnoses, with detailed strategies for term neonates.
