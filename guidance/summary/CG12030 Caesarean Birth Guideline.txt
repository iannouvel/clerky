### **Caesarean Section (CS) Clinical Guideline Summary**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for safe and consistent CS management, covering both planned and emergency procedures.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Indications:** CS is recommended for specific clinical scenarios (e.g., breech presentation, certain infections). Maternal request requires consultant evaluation.  
- **Timing:** Elective CS should not occur before 39 weeks unless medically indicated.  
- **Categories:**  
  - **Category 1 (immediate threat to life):** Perform within **30 minutes**.  
  - **Category 2 (maternal/fetal compromise, not immediately life-threatening):** Within **75 minutes**.  
  - **Categories 3 & 4:** Scheduled based on clinical need.  

**Critical Management Steps:**  
- **Preoperative:** Antenatal assessment, prophylactic antibiotics, antacids, and thromboprophylaxis.  
- **Anaesthesia:** Regional preferred; general anaesthesia requires rapid sequence induction.  
- **Intraoperative:**  
  - Carbetocin for hemorrhage prevention.  
  - Skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding support encouraged.  
  - Surgical techniques optimized for safety.  
- **Postoperative:**  
  - Regular analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids as needed).  
  - Early mobilization, catheter removal within 12â€“24 hours.  
  - Monitoring for complications (infection, hemorrhage, thromboembolism).  

**Risks & Outcomes:**  
- **Increased risks with CS:** Hysterectomy, placenta accreta in future pregnancies, neonatal respiratory issues.  
- **Reduced risks:** Perineal trauma, urinary incontinence (vs. assisted vaginal birth).  
- **Similar risks:** Thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, postnatal depression.  

**Emergency CS Outside Theatre:** Requires rapid coordination of equipment and personnel.  

**Postoperative Observations:**  
- **First 2 hours:** Hourly monitoring (vitals, pain, bleeding).  
- **Stable patients:** Reduce to 4-hourly observations.  

This guideline ensures standardized, high-quality care for women undergoing CS while supporting informed decision-making.
