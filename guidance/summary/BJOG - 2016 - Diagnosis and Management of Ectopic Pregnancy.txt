The clinical guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy emphasizes the importance of transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosis, visualizing adnexal masses for tubal ectopic pregnancies, and using serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels for management planning. Specific criteria exist for diagnosing various types of ectopic pregnancies, with surgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatment options available. Long-term fertility prospects should be discussed with patients, and support and counseling should be offered during treatment. Providers should have appropriate training for ultrasound-guided needle techniques, and anti-D immunoglobulin should be offered to women with ectopic pregnancies. The guideline also addresses the management of different types of ectopic pregnancies and provides recommendations for future studies and auditable topics.
