The clinical guideline on ectopic pregnancy diagnosis and management stresses the use of transvaginal ultrasound and beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels for diagnosis. Treatment options include surgical, pharmacological, and conservative approaches tailored to the type of ectopic pregnancy. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be offered, and long-term fertility prospects discussed. Methotrexate is recommended as first-line treatment in specific cases, with expectant management suitable in selected cases. Various surgical techniques are available based on the type of ectopic pregnancy. Support and counseling are essential during treatment. Providers need appropriate training in ultrasound, surgical, and medical management. Follow-up plans should be documented, with a 3-month waiting period before conceiving post-methotrexate treatment. The guideline also suggests areas for future research and audit topics to ensure quality care, addressing fertility outcomes, Rh immune globulin use, surgical approaches, and psychological effects on patients.
