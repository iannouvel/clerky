Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Transvaginal ultrasound confirms tubal ectopic pregnancy with visualization of an adnexal mass
- Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) levels guide management planning
- Ultrasound is primary for diagnosing caesarean scar pregnancy
- Specific criteria exist for diagnosing different ectopic pregnancy types
- Treatment options include surgical, pharmacological, and conservative approaches
- Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended for women with ectopic pregnancies
- Discuss long-term fertility post-ectopic pregnancy
- Offer support and counseling during treatment

Treatment and Management:
- Methotrexate is first-line for specific criteria
- Expectant management is an option in selected cases
- Inic acid rescue regimen is successful
- Treatment methods: ultrasound-guided aspiration with methotrexate, endoscopic approaches, hysteroscopic resection
- Laparoscopic removal recommended for cornual pregnancies
- Surgical treatment preferred for ovarian pregnancies
- Laparoscopic removal option for early abdominal pregnancy
- Anti-D prophylaxis for RhD-negative women
- Muscle relaxation training may benefit methotrexate treatment
- Wait 3 months before conception post-methotrexate treatment

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor serum b-hCG levels
- Repeat b-hCG levels in 48 hours for further guidance
- Discuss long-term fertility prospects
- Record follow-up plans clearly

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Methotrexate success higher with smaller b-hCG level increases pre-administration
- Providers need appropriate training in surgical, ultrasound, and medical techniques
- Conceiving within 3 months of methotrexate use may have risks but not an indication for termination
