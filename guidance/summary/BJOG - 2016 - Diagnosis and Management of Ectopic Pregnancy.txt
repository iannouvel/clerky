Transvaginal ultrasound is key for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy; visualizing an adnexal mass is crucial. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) aids in management planning. Ultrasound is primary for caesarean scar pregnancy diagnosis. Specific criteria exist for diagnosing various ectopic pregnancy types. Surgical, pharmacological, and conservative treatments are available, with Methotrexate as first-line for specific criteria. Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended, and training in ultrasound-guided needle techniques is essential. Monitoring b-hCG levels is crucial for management decisions. Laparoscopic removal is recommended for cornual pregnancies, and definitive surgical treatment is preferred for ovarian pregnancies. Counseling on waiting before conception after Methotrexate is essential. Risk factors include tubal damage and smoking. Incidence in the UK is around 11/1000 pregnancies. Contraindications include pregnancy of unknown location. Methotrexate manufacturers recommend waiting 3 months before conception. Support and counseling are essential during treatment. Future studies should focus on specific topics. Dedicated early pregnancy clinics are recommended for management. Diagnostic criteria for various types of ectopic pregnancies are outlined. Specific interventions such as laparoscopic management, salpingotomy, salpingectomy, and laparoscopic loop ligature are recommended based on the clinical presentation. Monitoring parameters include fertility outcomes, tubal patency, ovarian reserve, and reproductive outcomes following treatments. Use of Rh immune globulin and anti-D immunoglobulin for hemolytic disease prevention are highlighted.
