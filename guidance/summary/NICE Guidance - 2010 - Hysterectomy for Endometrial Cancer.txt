Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a safe and effective option for endometrial cancer when proper clinical governance, consent, and audit arrangements are in place. Patient selection by a multidisciplinary gynecological oncology team is crucial. Advanced laparoscopic skills are necessary, and additional training is recommended. The procedure offers a less invasive approach with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery. Conversion to laparotomy rates may vary, but postoperative complications are generally lower with laparoscopic hysterectomy. More data on long-term outcomes are needed for future evaluations.
