Laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer is a safe and effective procedure when conducted by a multidisciplinary team with advanced laparoscopic skills. Proper patient selection and additional training are crucial. The surgery offers a less invasive alternative with faster recovery times than open surgery. Conversion to laparotomy rates may vary, but overall postoperative complications are lower with laparoscopic hysterectomy. However, more data on long-term outcomes are needed for future assessments. It is essential to have appropriate clinical governance, consent procedures, and audit mechanisms in place to ensure the success and safety of laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer.
