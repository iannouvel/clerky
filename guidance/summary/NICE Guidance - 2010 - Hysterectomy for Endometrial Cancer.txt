Laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer is safe and effective with appropriate clinical governance, consent, and audit arrangements. Patient selection by a multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team is crucial. Advanced laparoscopic skills are necessary, with additional training suggested. The procedure offers a less invasive approach with shorter recovery times than open surgery. Variable conversion to laparotomy rates exist, but postoperative complications are lower with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Long-term outcome data is needed for future evaluations.
