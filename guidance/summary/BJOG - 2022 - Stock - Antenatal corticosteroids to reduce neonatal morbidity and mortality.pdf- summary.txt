Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended for women at risk of preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, and other complications. Timing of administration is crucial, with the most significant benefits seen when given within 48 hours prior to birth. There are potential risks, including effects on fetal growth and long-term development, particularly in term-born infants. Women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes should also be offered corticosteroids. Repeat courses may be considered in specific circumstances. While corticosteroids have proven benefits, caution is advised in certain situations, such as systemic infection. Overall, the benefits of antenatal corticosteroids outweigh the risks when administered appropriately.
