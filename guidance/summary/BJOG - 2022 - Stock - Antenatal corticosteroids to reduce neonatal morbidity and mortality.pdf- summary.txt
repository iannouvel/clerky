Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended for women at risk of preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, and other complications. An informed discussion should take place for planned caesarean births between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks. Corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks when imminent preterm birth is anticipated or in cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Timing is crucial, with the best outcomes seen when administered within 48 hours prior to birth. However, there are potential risks, including effects on fetal growth and long-term development. Overall, the benefits of antenatal corticosteroids outweigh the risks in most cases.
