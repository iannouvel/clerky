Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended for women at risk of preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality, respiratory distress syndrome, and intraventricular hemorrhage. The timing of administration is crucial, with benefits seen when given within 48 hours prior to birth. However, risks such as reduced birth weight and potential long-term effects on child development exist, especially if birth is delayed more than 7 days after treatment. Repeat courses may be considered for women at continued risk of preterm birth. Overall, antenatal corticosteroids are effective in improving neonatal outcomes, but careful consideration of risks and benefits is necessary for each individual case.
