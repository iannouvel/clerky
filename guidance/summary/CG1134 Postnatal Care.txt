The clinical guideline outlines comprehensive postnatal care for women, birthing parents, and newborns. It stresses the importance of assessing physical and emotional well-being, monitoring for complications, and providing support and education. Key recommendations include minimum postnatal visit schedules, recognizing 'red flags' for serious illness in newborns, addressing jaundice concerns, completing necessary assessments during inpatient care, and ensuring a smooth transition to community care. Specific guidance is provided on discharge procedures, follow-up appointments, managing complex cases, and language support. The guideline also emphasizes the need for thorough documentation, coordination of care for women with complex needs, and auditing practices to ensure quality care delivery. Additional resources include information on out-of-area discharges and discharge checklists for parents.
