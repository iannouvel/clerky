Bartholin's cyst is a blockage of the Bartholin's gland duct, while abscess is an infection of the gland leading to inflammation. Cysts may present as painless masses, while abscesses cause pain and swelling. Surgical intervention is needed for abscesses, with Word catheter or marsupialisation options. Word catheter is outpatient and less invasive, while marsupialisation requires general anesthesia. Post-op care includes removing the catheter and monitoring. Antibiotics are not routine unless there is cellulitis or PID/STI. Excision should be done by a consultant. Vulval abscesses can be managed conservatively or with incision and drainage. Compliance with the protocol is crucial.
