Bartholin's cyst is a buildup of sterile mucous in the Bartholin's gland, while Bartholin's abscess is an infection that causes inflammation and abscess formation. Management involves monitoring cysts for signs of abscess, with surgical intervention needed for abscesses. Word catheter insertion is an outpatient option for women under 40, while marsupialisation is recommended for those over 40 due to cancer risk. Excision should be done by a consultant, and antibiotics are not routinely needed. Vulval abscesses can be managed conservatively or with incision and drainage. Compliance with the protocol is crucial, and discharge planning should include follow-up care and removal of the catheter.
