Bartholin's cyst is a benign condition caused by blockage of the Bartholin's gland duct, while Bartholin's abscess is an infected cyst that requires surgical intervention. Management includes outpatient Word catheter insertion for younger women and marsupialisation under general anaesthetic for older women due to cancer risk. Vulval abscesses should be managed conservatively or with incision and drainage. Monitoring compliance with the protocol is crucial. Word catheter has a high success rate and minimal downtime, while marsupialisation requires general anaesthesia and may have a higher recurrence rate. Discharge planning should include removal of the catheter and follow-up care with medical professionals.
