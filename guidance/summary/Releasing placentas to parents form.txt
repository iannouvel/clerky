### **Summary of Clinical Guideline: Releasing Placentas to Parents**  

Placentas released to parents must be sealed in two bags and stored in a leak-proof container. They should be refrigerated (separate from food) for 48â€“72 hours before disposal. Strict hygiene measures must be followed to minimize infection risks, including avoiding contact with open wounds.  

For burial, the placenta must be free of plastic cord clamps and buried at least 1 meter deep in biodegradable material, avoiding areas near water sources to prevent contamination. Local regulations should be followed. Placentas cannot be disposed of in household waste but may be returned to the hospital for proper disposal if needed.
