**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Baby Abduction & Newborn Security v1.0**  

This guideline aims to prevent newborn abduction in hospital settings while promoting maternal-infant bonding. Key recommendations include strict adherence to identification protocols (matching bands for mothers, babies, and staff), enhanced security measures (e.g., CCTV), and immediate action if abduction is suspected. Staff across maternity, security, and portering must respond swiftly, securing the ward, notifying authorities, and supporting affected families.  

Critical steps in suspected abduction include confirming the event, raising an alarm, and initiating a multidisciplinary review. Regular staff training and incident monitoring are emphasized. The guideline ensures compliance with human rights principles and is disseminated via standard channels, accessible on SharePoint, with outdated versions removed. A quick-reference action guide and abduction log are provided for rapid response.
