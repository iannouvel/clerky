The Maternal and Birthing Parent Antenatal Screening Tests Guideline aims to provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare staff involved in antenatal screening. Key recommendations include offering screening tests at booking appointments between 8-10 weeks, ensuring timely reporting and actioning of results, handling subsequent miscarriages appropriately, and offering anomaly scans between 18-20 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy. The guideline emphasizes informing individuals of abnormal scan results promptly and ensuring discussions with healthcare providers. Screening for infectious diseases, hemoglobin variants, HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Syphilis is also outlined, with specific procedures for each. Failsafe processes are in place for various screenings, and staff training and quality monitoring standards are highlighted for compliance and improvement.
