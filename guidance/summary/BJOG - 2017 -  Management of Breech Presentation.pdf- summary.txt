The clinical guideline for the management of breech presentation at term recommends offering external cephalic version (ECV) to women unless there is an absolute contraindication. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery. Planned caesarean section is associated with a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared to planned vaginal breech delivery. Skilled intrapartum care and appropriate selection of pregnancies can make planned vaginal breech birth nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. Clinicians should provide unbiased counseling to ensure proper understanding of the risks and benefits of different options. Antenatal assessment, skilled birth attendants, and individualized intrapartum management are crucial for the safety of vaginal breech delivery. Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse skills needed during vaginal breech birth, and departments should develop guidelines for case selection and management to reduce complications.
