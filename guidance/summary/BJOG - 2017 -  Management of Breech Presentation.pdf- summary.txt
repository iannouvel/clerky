The clinical guideline for the management of breech presentation at term recommends offering external cephalic version (ECV) to women unless there is an absolute contraindication. The guideline discusses the risks and benefits of ECV, planned caesarean section, and vaginal breech delivery. It emphasizes the importance of proper counseling to ensure women understand the risks associated with each option. Skilled intrapartum care and selection of appropriate pregnancies can make planned vaginal breech birth nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. The guideline also covers factors affecting safety, intrapartum assessment, and management during vaginal breech birth, as well as the role of simulation equipment and guidelines for reducing complications.
