The clinical guideline for the management of breech presentation at term recommends offering external cephalic version (ECV) to women unless there is an absolute contraindication. It discusses the risks and benefits of ECV versus planned caesarean section, emphasizing that caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared to vaginal breech delivery. The guideline highlights the importance of antenatal assessment, skilled intrapartum care, and individualized management during labor. It also provides recommendations for delivery positions, assistance without traction, and the use of simulation equipment for training. The guideline suggests developing departmental guidelines for case selection and management to reduce complications during vaginal breech birth.
