This clinical guideline on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) emphasizes the importance of health professionals being aware of the short- and long-term complications of FGM, legal responsibilities, and providing sensitive care to affected women. It highlights the need for reporting to the police if FGM is confirmed in a girl under 18, and that re-infibulation is illegal. Management of FGM includes psychological assessment, testing for infections, referral to appropriate services, and de-infibulation if necessary. In pregnancy, early identification of women with FGM is crucial, along with appropriate care and follow-up post-delivery. Legal and regulatory processes must be adhered to, and future research and audit topics are suggested for improvement in care.
