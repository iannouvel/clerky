Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a chronic pain condition that requires a thorough initial assessment, including a medical history, physical examination, and urine testing. BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other conditions should be ruled out before treatment. Conservative treatments such as dietary modifications and stress management should be considered first, with pharmacological treatments like oral amitriptyline or cimetidine as options if conservative treatments fail. Intravesical treatments may be used if other treatments are unsuccessful. Referral to secondary care may be necessary for patients who do not respond to initial treatments. Pregnancy can impact BPS symptoms, and safe treatment options are available during pregnancy. Support groups can provide valuable resources for patients with BPS.
