The clinical guideline for the Management of Ovarian Cysts in Postmenopausal Women emphasizes the importance of assessing ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women through serum CA125 levels and transvaginal ultrasound scans. It highlights the significance of a thorough medical history, physical examination, and imaging in evaluating the risk of malignancy. The guideline recommends the use of the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) for triaging women with suspected ovarian cancer and provides recommendations for surgical management based on risk assessment. Referrals to specialist gynaecological oncology services are advised for high-risk cases, while low-risk cases can be managed in general gynaecology or cancer units. Further research is recommended to address areas of clinical uncertainty.
