The clinical guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management by NICE provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and individuals with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. It emphasizes the importance of patient involvement in decision-making, inclusive language, and individualized treatment based on symptoms and preferences. The guideline covers referral, diagnosis, monitoring, pain management, non-pharmacological and surgical options, and fertility considerations. It highlights the need for thorough assessment, including imaging and laparoscopy, and offers guidance on hormonal and surgical treatments. The guideline also suggests considering alternative treatments for women with persistent pain and exploring lifestyle interventions for symptom management. Research questions focus on the effectiveness of laparoscopic treatment, lifestyle interventions, support interventions, and hormonal treatments on fertility outcomes in endometriosis patients.
