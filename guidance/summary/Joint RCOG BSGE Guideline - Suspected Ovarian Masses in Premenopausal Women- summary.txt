This guideline provides recommendations for the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It emphasizes the importance of differentiating between benign and malignant masses, with conservative management recommended for many cases. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised for suspicious masses. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging method, with additional tests like CA-125, LDH, and hCG recommended in specific cases. The Risk of Malignancy Index is used to estimate the risk of malignancy, and simple ultrasound rules can help classify masses. Surgical intervention may be necessary for persistent or growing cysts, with laparoscopic surgery preferred for benign masses.
