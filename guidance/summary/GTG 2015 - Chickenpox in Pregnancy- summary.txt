Green-top Guideline No. 13 on Chickenpox in Pregnancy recommends varicella vaccination for non-immune pregnant women and those planning pregnancy. Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles, and seek immediate care if exposed. VZIG may be offered if necessary. Hospital referral is recommended for severe cases. Risks to the fetus include fetal varicella syndrome, and neonates should be monitored for infection. Varicella vaccination is cost-effective for seronegative women. Pregnant women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks after vaccination. Routine screening for varicella immunity may be considered for women from tropical areas. Awareness of risks and appropriate care are crucial in managing chickenpox in pregnancy.
