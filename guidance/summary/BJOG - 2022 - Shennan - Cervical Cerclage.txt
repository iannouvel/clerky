Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births are candidates for history-indicated cervical cerclage.
- Singleton pregnant women with a history of spontaneous second-trimester loss or preterm birth may receive cerclage if the cervix measures 25mm or less before 24 weeks gestation.
- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended for singleton pregnant women without other risk factors who incidentally have a short cervix identified on a late second-trimester ultrasound.
- Transvaginal cerclage may be considered in women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage.
- Emergency cerclage in singleton pregnancies may help delay birth and reduce the chance of birth before 34 weeks gestation.
- The choice of transvaginal cerclage technique should be at the surgeon's discretion, with placement as high as possible.

Treatment and Management:
- History-indicated cerclage is recommended for women with three or more previous preterm births.
- Ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.
- Transabdominal cerclage insertion may be discussed for women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage.
- Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy.
- Emergency cerclage should be individualized, considering parental views.
- Contraindications to cerclage insertion include active preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, vaginal bleeding, PPROM, fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death.
- Women should be informed of potential complications before cerclage insertion.
- Investigations before insertion should include first-trimester ultrasound and aneuploidy screening.
- Perioperative tocolysis is not recommended.
- Antibiotic prophylaxis at cerclage placement is at the discretion of the operating team.
- Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure.
- The choice of suture material and technique should be at the surgeon's discretion.
- Additional cervical occlusion suture is not routinely recommended.
- Cerclage should be removed before labor, usually between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks of gestation.
- In cases of PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks, cerclage should be removed.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor for potential complications such as PPROM, second-trimester loss, preterm labor, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage.
- Monitor for maternal pyrexia post-cerclage insertion.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications to cerclage insertion: active preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, continuing vaginal bleeding, PPROM, fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, fetal death.
- Risk factors include potential complications such as bladder damage, cervical trauma, membrane rupture, bleeding, and maternal pyrexia post-cerclage insertion.
