Cervical cerclage is recommended for women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births or a cervix measuring 25mm or less before 24 weeks with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth. Transabdominal cerclage may be considered after unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage. Emergency cerclage can delay birth before 34 weeks. Contraindications include active preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, vaginal bleeding, PPROM, fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Complications may include PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labor, infection, bleeding, bladder or cervical damage, and maternal pyrexia. Antibiotic prophylaxis is discretionary, and cerclage removal is typically done between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks. Delayed removal may increase sepsis risk. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies, Mullerian anomalies, previous cervical surgery, or incidental short cervix on ultrasound. Monitoring should be individualized, and adjuvant management tailored based on clinical circumstances. Further research is needed on suture material efficacy and the role of additional cervical occlusion.
