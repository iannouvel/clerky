The Green-top Guideline No. 75 on Cervical Cerclage provides recommendations for the insertion and management of cerclage in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss. Key recommendations include offering history-indicated cerclage for women with specific risk factors, considering cerclage for women with a short cervix and certain histories, and individualizing care for emergency cerclage cases. The guideline emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making, potential complications, and the choice of suture material and technique. It also highlights that cerclage is not recommended for certain conditions like multiple pregnancies or Mullerian anomalies. The guideline suggests that further research is needed in some areas and provides insights into the removal of cerclage, adjuvant management, and post-cerclage care.
