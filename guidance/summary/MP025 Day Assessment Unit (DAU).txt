### **Summary of DAU Maternity Protocol (MP025) – University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust**  

**Key Principles & Scope:**  
This protocol provides standardized guidance for managing women attending the Day Assessment Unit (DAU) at PRH or RSCH. It applies to midwives, obstetricians, and the management team, ensuring consistent care.  

**Referrals & Assessments:**  
- **Ultrasound Scans (USS):** Urgent scans booked via DAU for specific indications.  
- **Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU):** Handles early pregnancy concerns; DAU manages 2nd/3rd trimester issues.  
- **Referrals:** Community midwives/GPs refer to DAU with appropriate documentation. Direct admission to Delivery Suite if needed.  

**Clinical Conditions & Management:**  
- **Vaginal Bleeding:** Requires maternal observations (BP, pulse, urinalysis) and fetal assessment (CTG if ≥26 weeks). Registrar review and consultant discussion if concerns.  
- **Small for Dates:**  
  - Abnormal Doppler (UA PI >95th, MCA PI <5th, absent/reversed EDF) → urgent consultant review, possible steroids/C-section.  
  - Normal Doppler → fortnightly growth scans.  
- **Large for Dates (Non-Diabetic):**  
  - If clinically large (>3cm) with no risk factors → no scan needed.  
  - Check for glycosuria; if positive, refer for GTT.  
  - Suspected polyhydramnios → DAU review ± USS.  
- **Growth Scans:** Additional scans may be required for high-risk maternal conditions, followed up in ANC or DAU.  

**Induction of Labour (IOL):**  
- Low-risk pregnancies follow **MP033 (IOL Protocol)**.  
- PRH: Contact triage for IOL booking.  
- RSCH: Complete BadgerNet referral; Sussex House midwife schedules IOL.  
- Women declining IOL at 42 weeks managed per **MP033**.  

**GTT Booking:**  
- PRH: Direct referral to phlebotomy; ANC reviews results.  
- RSCH: High-risk women (obesity/diabetes) referred from community/DAU/ANC.  
  - Normal GTT (<7.8 mmol/L): No follow-up.  
  - Abnormal (≥7.8 mmol/L): Managed per diabetes protocol (**MP018**).  

**Musculoskeletal Issues:**  
- Refer to DAU for assessment; ANC manages pain/social/birth planning.  

This protocol ensures structured, risk-based care for maternal and fetal well-being.
