The clinical guideline on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy provides recommendations for UK residents traveling to endemic areas. Pregnant women are at risk of complications from malaria, including reduced birth weight and maternal mortality. The guideline advises on travel recommendations, chemoprophylaxis, and emergency treatment for pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas. Mefloquine is recommended for pregnant women in chloroquine-resistant areas, while chloroquine and proguanil are safe but not effective in these regions. The guideline also emphasizes the importance of awareness, prompt medical attention, preventive measures, and education for pregnant women. Evidence-based recommendations are provided based on the level of evidence and expert opinion.
