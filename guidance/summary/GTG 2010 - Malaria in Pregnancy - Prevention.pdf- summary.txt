The clinical guideline on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy provides recommendations for UK residents traveling to endemic areas. Pregnant women are at risk of severe complications from malaria, including reduced birth weight and maternal mortality. The guideline emphasizes the importance of considering travel postponement and seeking advice on malaria risks and prevention strategies if travel is unavoidable. Chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine is recommended for pregnant women in chloroquine-resistant areas. Insecticide-treated bednets and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are recommended for preventing anaemia in highly malarious areas. The guideline also outlines grades of recommendations and evidence levels to guide clinical practice.
