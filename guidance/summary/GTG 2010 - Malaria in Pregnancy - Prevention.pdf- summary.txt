The clinical guideline on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy provides information for clinicians on how to prevent malaria in pregnant women traveling to endemic areas. Malaria, caused by the Anopheles mosquito, can be life-threatening for pregnant women and their babies. The guideline recommends postponing travel to endemic areas if possible and seeking guidance on malaria risks and prevention strategies if travel is unavoidable. Chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine is recommended for pregnant women in chloroquine-resistant areas. Pregnant women should be educated on preventive measures and provided with written information. The guideline also includes recommendations on safe and effective medications, as well as standby emergency treatment for suspected malaria.
