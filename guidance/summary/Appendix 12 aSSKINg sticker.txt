The Askincare Bundle provides guidelines for the prevention and management of pressure injuries. Key recommendations include assessing risk factors, observing pressure areas every 12 hours, using appropriate support surfaces like foam mattresses and cushions, offloading heels with pillows or heel boots, and implementing regular position changes. Incontinence care involves using specific cleansers and barrier creams. Nutritional assessment using the MUST score, monitoring, and support are essential, with referrals to dietitians as needed. The bundle emphasizes the importance of proactive prevention strategies, including education on pressure injury prevention.
