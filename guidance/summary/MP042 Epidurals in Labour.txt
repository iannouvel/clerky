**Summary of Epidural in Labour Guideline (MP042)**  

This protocol outlines standards for epidural analgesia during labour, including indications, contraindications, responsibilities, and management of complications.  

**Indications:** Maternal request, obstetric/medical conditions benefiting from analgesia. **Contraindications:** Sepsis, clotting disorders, hypovolemia, local anesthetic allergy.  

**Responsibilities:**  
- **Midwives:** Provide unbiased information, check platelet count, ensure equipment, and request anaesthetist review.  
- **Anaesthetists:** Explain procedure, obtain consent, establish analgesia, and prescribe drugs.  

**Equipment & Monitoring:**  
- IV access, epidural pump, oxygen, and resuscitation trolley must be available.  
- Monitor maternal vitals (BP, pulse, block level, motor function) and fetal heart rate continuously.  

**Management:**  
- **Analgesia:** Maintain via PCEA (patient-controlled); bolus top-ups if needed.  
- **Urinary retention:** Catheterize if unable to void; consider re-catheterization post-delivery.  

**Complications & Emergency Actions:**  
- **Hypotension/bradycardia:** Stop infusion, give oxygen, IV fluids.  
- **High block/toxicity:** Stop pump, urgent anaesthetic review.  
- **Dural puncture:** Re-site epidural or intrathecal dose; post-dural headache may require blood patch.  

**Postnatal Care:**  
- Suspected dural puncture must be communicated to GP.  
- Follow-up includes procedure details and blood patch history. Contact hospital if complications arise.
