Cord prolapse management involves the descent of the umbilical cord past the presenting part in the presence of ruptured membranes. Immediate action is crucial, with methods like bladder filling to relieve cord compression. In the hospital setting, a category 1 caesarean birth within 30 minutes is recommended for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns. Training for staff, monitoring through incident forms, and postnatal debriefing are crucial. Risk factors include long cord, breech presentation, and iatrogenic factors like artificial rupture of membranes. The incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%, with higher rates in breech presentations. Immediate transfer to a labor ward is advised in community settings. This protocol aims to ensure timely and appropriate management of cord prolapse to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.
