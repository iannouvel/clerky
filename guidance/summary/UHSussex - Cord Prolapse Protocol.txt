Cord prolapse is diagnosed when the umbilical cord descends through the cervix alongside or beyond the presenting part with ruptured membranes. Incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%, higher in breech presentations, with risk factors including long cord and breech presentation. Immediate interventions like bladder filling are crucial; in hospitals, perform a category 1 caesarean birth within 30 minutes for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns, while in community settings, transfer to a labor ward immediately. Staff training, incident form monitoring, and postnatal debriefing are recommended to reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.
