The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics emphasizes the importance of optimizing haemoglobin levels in pregnant women, with recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of anaemia. It outlines the use of oral and parenteral iron therapy, as well as the potential role of recombinant human erythropoietin in non-end-stage renal anaemia. The guideline also provides recommendations for active management of the third stage of labour to minimize blood loss, consent for blood transfusion, and requirements for blood product specification in pregnancy. Strategies to minimize the use of banked blood, including the use of intraoperative cell salvage, are also discussed. Recommendations for the management of obstetric haemorrhage with blood components, mechanical strategies to reduce postpartum blood loss, and the use of tranexamic acid are included. Overall, the guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide clinicians in the management of blood transfusion in obstetric care.
