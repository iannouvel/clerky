The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics provides recommendations for reducing the risk of transfusion in pregnant women. It emphasizes optimizing haemoglobin levels through oral iron supplementation, active management of the third stage of labor, and delivering in hospitals for high-risk women. The guideline outlines consent procedures for blood transfusion, requirements for blood group and screen samples, and blood product specifications during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Strategies to minimize the use of banked blood, such as intraoperative cell salvage, are discussed. Mechanical strategies and specific blood components are recommended for managing obstetric hemorrhage. The guideline also addresses patient blood management and recommendations for Jehovah's Witnesses.
