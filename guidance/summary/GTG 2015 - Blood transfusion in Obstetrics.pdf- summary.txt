The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics provides recommendations on reducing the risk of transfusion through optimizing haemoglobin levels, screening for anaemia, and active management of labour. It emphasizes the importance of obtaining consent for transfusions, monitoring blood group and antibody status, and using specific blood components based on individual needs. Strategies to minimize the use of banked blood include using cell salvage and mechanical strategies to reduce blood loss. The guideline also addresses the management of obstetric haemorrhage with blood components, including red cells, FFP, and cryoprecipitate. Patient blood management, including iron therapy and autologous blood deposit, is highlighted as key strategies to minimize transfusion. Recommendations for future research and auditable topics are also provided.
