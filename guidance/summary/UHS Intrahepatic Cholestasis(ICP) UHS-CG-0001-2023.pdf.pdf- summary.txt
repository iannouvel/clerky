The UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline provides evidence-based guidance for diagnosing and managing ICP in pregnant women. It covers diagnosis, maternal and perinatal risks, management (including drug treatment and timing of birth), intrapartum care, postnatal care, and subsequent pregnancies. ICP affects 0.7-1.5% of pregnancies, with a high recurrence rate in future pregnancies. Diagnosis is based on itching and elevated bile acid levels, with additional investigations for atypical cases. Management includes consultant-led care, regular monitoring, and drug treatment. Timing of birth should be planned based on peak bile acid concentration. Postnatal care involves monitoring for resolution of symptoms. Audit questions are provided for quality improvement.
