The NICE antenatal care guideline emphasizes involving partners in care decisions, comprehensive care provision, and risk assessment for pregnant women. Recommendations include assessing risk factors for conditions like venous thromboembolism, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia at the first antenatal appointment and monitoring blood pressure and proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Symphysis fundal height should be measured after 24 weeks, with ultrasound scans considered for concerns. Discussion on fetal movements, breech presentation, birth preferences, and prolonged pregnancy options is advised. Interventions for nausea and vomiting include ginger for mild-to-moderate cases and antiemetics for more severe symptoms. Lifestyle advice, antacids, and alginates are recommended for heartburn. Treatments for vaginal discharge include antifungals and antibiotics. Physiotherapy and lumbopelvic belts are suggested for pelvic girdle pain. Unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks warrants secondary care review. Healthcare professionals should address disparities in maternal mortality rates, inquire about domestic abuse and female genital mutilation, and identify cardiac conditions. Recommendations aim to improve antenatal care practices, enhance patient engagement, and reduce adverse outcomes.
