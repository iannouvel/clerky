The NICE antenatal care guideline emphasizes the importance of involving partners in care decisions, providing comprehensive care for pregnant women, and addressing common problems during pregnancy. Recommendations include assessing risk factors, discussing fetal movements, offering support for women with increased risk factors, and providing information on various aspects of antenatal care. The guideline also covers interventions for nausea and vomiting, heartburn, and pelvic girdle pain. It highlights the importance of addressing inequalities in care, discussing sleep positions to reduce stillbirth risk, and providing peer support services. The guideline aims to improve antenatal care practices without major changes in practice.
