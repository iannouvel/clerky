The NICE Antenatal Care Guideline provides recommendations for organizing and delivering antenatal care, addressing routine clinical care, information provision, and managing common pregnancy issues. Key points include involving partners in care decisions, assessing risks such as domestic abuse and female genital mutilation, monitoring fetal growth and well-being, discussing fetal movements, and identifying breech presentation. Recommendations emphasize individualized care, clear communication, and support for pregnant women's needs and preferences. Antenatal appointments should include assessing risks for conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, monitoring blood pressure and urine protein levels, and discussing birth preferences. The guideline also covers interventions for issues like nausea and vomiting, heartburn, pelvic girdle pain, and vaginal discharge. Additionally, it addresses the importance of sleep position after 28 weeks to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Overall, the guideline aims to enhance antenatal care quality and outcomes for pregnant women and their babies.
