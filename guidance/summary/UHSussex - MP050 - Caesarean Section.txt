The Caesarean Section Protocol, MP050, provides guidelines for healthcare professionals involved in caesarean sections. It covers various categories of caesarean sections, emphasizing the importance of documentation and adherence to safety checklists. Recommendations include avoiding routine suturing of peritoneum and subcutaneous tissue, preferring sutures over staples for skin closure, and considering negative pressure wound therapy for high BMI individuals to reduce infections. Other key points include delayed cord clamping, cord milking when necessary, administering oxytocin appropriately, and ensuring newborn resuscitation readiness. The protocol also stresses early skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding support post-operation. It highlights the need for VTE risk assessment, discussions on future pregnancies, and thorough discharge planning. The document also outlines risks and outcomes associated with caesarean versus vaginal delivery, urging timely referrals and collaboration with obstetric anesthetists.
