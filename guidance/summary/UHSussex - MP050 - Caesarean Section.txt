Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Categories of caesarean section: emergency, urgent, scheduled, and elective
- Considerations for all caesarean births: intra-operative cell salvage, blood transfusion, PPI/Sodium Citrate, antibiotics, and surgical techniques
- Specific protocols for wound closure, cord clamping, oxytocin administration, and resuscitation of newborn babies
- Recommendations for early skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation post-caesarean birth
- Monitoring parameters: VTE risk assessment, wound infection signs, and postnatal complications

Treatment and Management:
- Avoid routine suturing of visceral or parietal peritoneum in caesarean birth
- Close skin with sutures instead of staples to reduce wound dehiscence risk
- Consider negative pressure wound therapy for BMI â‰¥35 kg/m2 to reduce wound infection risk
- Administer oxytocin 5 units post-cord clamping; consider prophylactic oxytocin 40 units infusion for PPH risk
- Offer delayed cord clamping and cord milking as appropriate
- Ensure presence of skilled practitioner for newborn resuscitation during caesarean under general anesthesia or fetal compromise
- Provide VTE risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis for all mothers
- Discuss implications for future pregnancies, discharge planning, and postnatal care comprehensively

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor wound for signs of infection, separation, or dehiscence
- Assess and manage heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding post-caesarean appropriately
- Document discussions on future pregnancies, complications, and discharge plans
- Inform GP of follow-up investigations post-discharge and abnormal results

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Avoid routine use of superficial wound drains, staples for skin closure, and forceps in caesarean birth
- Caution in using oxytocin 40 units infusion routinely; consider only for PPH risk patients
- Referral for debriefing may be warranted for some mothers post-caesarean birth
- Discuss risks and benefits of caesarean birth comprehensively with patients
- Be alert to increased VTE risk and respiratory/leg symptoms in post-caesarean mothers
