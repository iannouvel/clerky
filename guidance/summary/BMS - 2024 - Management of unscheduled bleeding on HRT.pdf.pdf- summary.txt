The British Menopause Society provides guidelines for managing unscheduled bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Assessment should include a thorough history, examination, and initial investigations. Endometrial cancer risk factors in HRT users are discussed, with recommendations for managing risk based on HRT regimen and progestogen type. Conservative management strategies are outlined for women with no endometrial cancer risk factors. For women with risk factors, further assessment and adjustments in progestogen or HRT preparation may be necessary. Different types of progestogens and routes of HRT administration should be considered to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes. Endometrial assessment and biopsy may be required in certain cases.
