The clinical guideline on Cervical Cerclage provides key recommendations for women at risk of preterm birth or second trimester fetal loss, including offering history-indicated cerclage for women with multiple previous preterm births and considering cerclage for those with a short cervix. The guideline discusses the effectiveness of cerclage, the types of cerclage procedures, and potential complications. It emphasizes individualized care and informed decision-making, with considerations for suture materials, removal timing, and perioperative management. The guideline also highlights ongoing research in cerclage techniques and outcomes, aiming to improve the prevention of preterm birth in high-risk pregnancies.
