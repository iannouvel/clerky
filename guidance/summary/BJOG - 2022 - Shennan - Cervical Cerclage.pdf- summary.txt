The clinical guideline on cervical cerclage provides key recommendations for the use of cerclage in women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss. It recommends cerclage for women with a history of three or more previous preterm births or a cervix measuring 25mm or less. The guideline also outlines considerations for unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, transabdominal cerclage, and emergency cerclage. It emphasizes the importance of individualized care, informed decision-making, and monitoring for potential complications. Further research is needed in areas such as cerclage in women with Mullerian anomalies or previous cervical surgery. The guideline aims to support healthcare providers in optimizing care for women at risk of preterm birth.
