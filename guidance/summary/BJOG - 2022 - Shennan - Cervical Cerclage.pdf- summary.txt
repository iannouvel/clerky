The clinical guideline on Cervical Cerclage (Green-top Guideline No. 75, June 2022) provides key recommendations for the use of cerclage in women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss. It highlights the importance of history-indicated cerclage for women with three or more previous preterm births and ultrasound-indicated cerclage for those with a short cervix measuring 25mm or less. The guideline emphasizes the need for individualized care, considering factors such as BMI, previous unsuccessful cerclage, and the type of suture material used. It also discusses potential complications, timing of cerclage removal, and ongoing research in the field.
