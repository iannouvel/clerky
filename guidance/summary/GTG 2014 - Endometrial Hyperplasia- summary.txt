The clinical guideline on the management of endometrial hyperplasia categorizes the condition into two groups based on cytological atypia and provides recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound, with progestogen therapy recommended as first-line treatment for hyperplasia without atypia. Hysterectomy is indicated in cases of no regression or relapse. Atypical hyperplasia should undergo total hysterectomy, with consideration for fertility preservation in select cases. Regular follow-up and surveillance are essential for all patients. The guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment plans and ongoing research to address areas of uncertainty.
