The clinical guideline for assisted vaginal birth emphasizes the importance of preparation, assessment, and careful management to ensure safe and effective outcomes. Continuous support during labor, different positions in the second stage of labor, and delayed pushing can impact the need for assisted vaginal birth. Obstetricians should use a standard classification system for assisted vaginal birth, obtain consent, and perform the procedure with necessary knowledge and skills. Instruments should be chosen based on clinical circumstances and operator skill. Aftercare should include prophylactic antibiotics, pain relief, and education on potential risks. Documentation and follow-up care are essential for optimal outcomes.
