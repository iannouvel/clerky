The clinical guideline for assisted vaginal birth highlights the importance of preparation, assessment, and careful management during the procedure. Continuous support during labor, different positions in the second stage, and delayed pushing can impact the need for assisted vaginal birth. Operators should have the necessary knowledge and skills, with obstetric trainees receiving appropriate training. Instruments should be chosen based on clinical circumstances and operator skill level, with careful consideration of the risks involved. Aftercare should include prophylactic antibiotics, pain relief, and education on potential risks. Documentation, consent, and monitoring of adverse outcomes are crucial for safe and effective assisted vaginal birth.
