The NICE guideline on preterm labor and birth, last updated in June 2022, aims to reduce risks for babies born before 37 weeks. It offers recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and women at risk of preterm labor or planned early birth. Prophylactic vaginal progesterone or cervical cerclage is recommended for women with a history of preterm birth or short cervix. Diagnostic tests for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes are outlined, with caution against unnecessary interventions. Maternal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection are discussed, along with fetal monitoring and mode of birth considerations. Research gaps are highlighted, emphasizing the need for further studies on treatment effectiveness and long-term outcomes.
