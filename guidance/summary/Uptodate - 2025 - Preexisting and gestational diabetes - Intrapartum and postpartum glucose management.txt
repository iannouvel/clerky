Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Diagnostic criteria include maternal hyperglycemia during labor, with glycemic targets set at 70 to 125 mg/dL.
- Clinical presentations may involve metabolic demands of labor, food restriction, and the use of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids.
- Maternal hyperglycemia during labor is associated with fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Treatment and Management:
- Individualized glucose monitoring and insulin management based on diabetes type and glucose levels.
- Continuous glucose monitoring devices and protocols for intrapartum intravenous insulin are available.
- Neonatal hypoglycemia from maternal hyperglycemia requires monitoring and management.
- Insulin pump users can continue use during labor, with specific management protocols in place.
- Patients on metformin should hold the medication on admission for delivery.
- Insulin management is crucial for scheduled cesarean births, with specific strategies for different types of diabetes.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Glucose levels should be monitored every hour for patients on insulin during labor.
- Postpartum glycemic monitoring and targets are recommended, with adjustments based on capillary blood glucose levels.
- Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin regimen is necessary postpartum.
- Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is recommended.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Patients with persistently high blood glucose levels may require insulin infusion despite subcutaneous correctional insulin.
- Close follow-up for the development of overt diabetes is necessary for patients with gestational diabetes.
