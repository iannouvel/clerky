In pregnancies complicated by diabetes, maintaining maternal euglycemia during labor is crucial to reduce adverse outcomes. Glycemic targets should be 70-125 mg/dL, individualized based on diabetes type. Maternal hyperglycemia during labor can lead to fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Insulin pumps can be used during labor, with protocols for intravenous insulin available. Postpartum insulin dosing is typically 30-35% of antenatal doses, adjusted based on glucose levels. Breastfeeding may lower insulin requirements. Metformin is recommended for type 2 diabetes postpartum and is compatible with breastfeeding. Close glucose monitoring postpartum is essential. Gestational diabetes may not need medication postpartum. Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is advised. Subcutaneous correctional insulin is often sufficient for managing gestational diabetes during labor, with insulin infusion an option if needed.
