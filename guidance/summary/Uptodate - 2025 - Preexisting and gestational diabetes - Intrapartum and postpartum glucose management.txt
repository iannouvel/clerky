In pregnancies complicated by diabetes, maintaining maternal glycemic levels between 70 and 125 mg/dL during labor is crucial to reduce adverse outcomes. Factors influencing glycemic control include labor metabolic demands, food intake restrictions, and dextrose-containing IV fluids. Maternal hyperglycemia correlates with fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Individualized glucose monitoring and insulin management based on diabetes type are recommended, with options for continuous glucose monitoring and intrapartum intravenous insulin protocols. Neonatal hypoglycemia due to maternal hyperglycemia requires monitoring and intervention. Insulin pump users can continue during labor; if not, standard insulin infusion protocols apply. Metformin should be paused upon admission for delivery. Scheduled cesarean births involving insulin require close glucose monitoring and insulin correction. Postpartum insulin dosing is typically 30-35% of antenatal doses, with adjustments based on capillary glucose levels. Insulin degludec may be withheld postpartum to prevent hypoglycemia. Close monitoring and insulin regimen adjustments are essential postpartum, with potential lower insulin needs during breastfeeding. Metformin is suitable postpartum for type 2 diabetes, compatible with breastfeeding. Gestational diabetes may not necessitate postpartum medication. Follow-up testing for diabetes postpartum is advised. For gestational diabetes in labor, subcutaneous insulin is the initial approach, escalating to infusion if glucose levels exceed 125 mg/dL persistently. Regular monitoring for diabetes development postpartum is essential.
