In pregnancies complicated by diabetes, maintaining optimal blood glucose levels during labor is crucial to prevent adverse outcomes. Glycemic targets of 70 to 125 mg/dL are recommended. Maternal hyperglycemia during labor can lead to fetal hypoxemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Individualized glucose monitoring and insulin management, including the use of continuous glucose monitoring devices and intravenous insulin protocols, are essential. Patients on insulin pumps can continue use during labor, with specific management protocols in place. For cesarean births, insulin pump users can follow hospital policies, while patients with gestational diabetes may require subcutaneous correctional insulin. Postpartum, insulin dosing is typically reduced, with close monitoring and adjustments necessary. Metformin is recommended for postpartum type 2 diabetes and is safe for breastfeeding. Follow-up testing and monitoring for diabetes postpartum are essential. Gestational diabetes may not require medication postpartum, and breastfeeding may lower insulin requirements. Close monitoring of glucose levels is crucial postpartum, with insulin adjustments based on individual needs.
