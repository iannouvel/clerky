Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is diagnosed when a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound showing neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy.
- Patients with PUL may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of early pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.
- Differential diagnosis includes early IUP, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and rare entities.

Treatment and Management:
- Initial evaluation involves history, physical examination, and transvaginal ultrasound.
- Further diagnostic workup is based on ultrasound findings.
- Serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements and transvaginal ultrasound assessments are done for selected patients.
- Management depends on hemodynamic stability and pregnancy desires. Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate surgical intervention, while stable patients may undergo expectant management with regular hCG and ultrasound assessments.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor serial serum hCG levels.
- Monitor transvaginal ultrasound assessments.
- Monitoring frequency should be based on clinical judgment.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Hemodynamically unstable patients are contraindicated for expectant management.
- Uncommon or rare etiologies such as malignancy, pituitary hCG production, and heterophilic antibodies are cautionary factors.
- Patients with desired pregnancies require special considerations in management.
