Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is diagnosed when a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showing neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with early pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy symptoms. Initial evaluation includes history, physical exam, and TVUS, with further workup based on findings. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and TVUS are needed for selected cases. Management depends on hemodynamic stability and pregnancy desires, with unstable patients needing immediate surgical intervention and stable patients potentially undergoing expectant management with regular hCG and TVUS monitoring. Proactive intervention is considered for undesired pregnancies, while caution is advised for patients with persistent hCG elevations or nonpregnancy-related causes. Hemodynamically unstable patients, rare etiologies, and desired pregnancies have distinct management approaches.
