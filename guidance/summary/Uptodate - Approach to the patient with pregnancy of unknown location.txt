Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) refers to a scenario where a patient with a positive pregnancy test has a transvaginal ultrasound showing neither an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) nor an ectopic pregnancy. The management of PUL involves continued evaluation until a final diagnosis is reached to prevent severe maternal outcomes. Initial assessment includes history, physical examination, and ultrasound, with further workup based on findings. Serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements and ultrasound assessments are crucial. Management varies based on stability and patient desires, with hemodynamically unstable cases needing immediate intervention, stable cases potentially undergoing expectant management, and undesired pregnancies requiring proactive intervention. Special consideration is given to patients with persistent hCG elevations or non-pregnancy-related causes. The algorithm does not apply to unstable patients or rare conditions like malignancy or pituitary hCG production. Patients desiring pregnancy are managed differently.
