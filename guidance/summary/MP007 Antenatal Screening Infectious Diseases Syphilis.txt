### **Summary of Antenatal Syphilis Screening Guidelines**  

All pregnant women should be offered syphilis screening at booking, with clear pre-test information to support informed choice. Late or unbooked pregnancies require prompt screening. Declining screening should be documented, with follow-up discussions encouraged. Blood samples must be properly labeled, and unacceptable samples repeated within 10 working days.  

Results are available within 5 working days via ICE or phone. Requestors must follow up within 10 days, documenting actions. Missing results should be addressed at the next antenatal appointment. Negative results do not guarantee immunity; repeat screening is possible if risk factors arise.  

Positive results require confirmatory testing and treatment, typically with penicillin. Specialist consultation is advised for penicillin allergies or complex cases. Suspected congenital syphilis warrants joint pediatric and obstetric management.  

Midwives must document delays in repeat samples and ensure results are available at the dating scan. Governance includes incident reporting, minimum audit standards, and staff training. Patient information resources should be provided for further details.  

Untreated maternal syphilis risks congenital infection, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and long-term complications. Early detection and treatment significantly improve maternal and fetal outcomes.
