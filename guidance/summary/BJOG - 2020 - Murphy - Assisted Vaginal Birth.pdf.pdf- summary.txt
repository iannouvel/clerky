The clinical guideline for assisted vaginal birth emphasizes the importance of preparation, assessment, and careful management to ensure safe and effective delivery. Continuous support during labor, different positions, and delayed pushing can impact the need for assisted vaginal birth. The use of a standard classification system is recommended, and consent should be obtained before the procedure. Training and expertise are crucial for operators, with instruments chosen based on clinical circumstances and skill level. Aftercare includes prophylactic antibiotics, pain relief, and education on potential complications. Monitoring and documentation are essential, with a focus on patient safety and communication. Postnatal support and counseling are also emphasized for women after assisted vaginal birth.
