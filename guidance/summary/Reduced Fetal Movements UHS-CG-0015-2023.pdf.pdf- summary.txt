The Reduced Fetal Movements Guideline aims to reduce avoidable stillbirths by ensuring pregnant women and people are aware of reporting reduced fetal movements. Developed by obstetric Leads and a Clinical Effectiveness Midwife, the guideline provides recommendations for managing reduced fetal movements in both community and hospital settings. Key risk factors associated with RFMs are highlighted, along with the importance of prompt assessment and referral. The guideline outlines specific management protocols based on gestational age, risk factors, and fetal assessment results. Continuous monitoring and follow-up are emphasized, with process and outcome indicators to track adherence and effectiveness.
