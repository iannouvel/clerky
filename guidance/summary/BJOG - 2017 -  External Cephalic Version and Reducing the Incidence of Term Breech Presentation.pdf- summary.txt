The clinical guideline on External Cephalic Version (ECV) outlines the procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position, with a success rate of approximately 50% and a reduction in the likelihood of a caesarean section. Factors such as timing, tocolysis, anesthesia, and patient satisfaction are important considerations. The guideline recommends offering ECV at term from 37 weeks of gestation and suggests using moxibustion as an alternative method for breech presentation. Further research is needed to address areas of clinical uncertainty and improve antenatal detection, uptake, and success rates of ECV. The guideline emphasizes the importance of trained practitioners, monitoring facilities, and patient education in the ECV process.
