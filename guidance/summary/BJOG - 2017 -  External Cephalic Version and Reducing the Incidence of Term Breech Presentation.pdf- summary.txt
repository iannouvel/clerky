External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position, reducing the need for a caesarean section. Success rates are around 50%, with slightly higher rates of caesarean section and instrumental delivery post-ECV. Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve success rates, and ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks gestation. Regional analgesia is not routinely recommended but may be considered. ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners in facilities with monitoring and surgical delivery capabilities. Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended for D negative women undergoing ECV. Further research is needed in areas of clinical uncertainty.
