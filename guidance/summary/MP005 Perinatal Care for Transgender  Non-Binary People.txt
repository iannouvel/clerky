**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Perinatal Care for Trans and Non-Binary People**  

This guideline outlines best practices for providing respectful, inclusive perinatal care to trans and non-binary individuals. Key principles include using preferred names and pronouns, ensuring privacy, and maintaining dignity. Pre-conception care should address fertility and hormone therapy considerations. Antenatal care must include discussions on gender dysphoria, trauma-informed examinations, and individualized support.  

During **intrapartum care**, catheterization requires awareness of anatomical variations—particularly after lower surgery—with standard-length catheters used if needed. **Postnatal care** should offer choice in ward placement (side room or shared) and address chest health, including mastitis risk post-top surgery. Infant feeding options (chestfeeding/expressing) should be discussed, acknowledging possible limitations post-surgery. Postnatal depression screening is essential, with heightened awareness for those with prior testosterone use. Legal birth registration constraints (recording as "Mother") should be sensitively communicated. Contraception should be discussed post-birth.  

Key terminology clarifies distinctions (e.g., gender identity vs. expression) and emphasizes trauma-informed, person-centered communication. A **"My Language Preferences"** tool standardizes respectful terminology for anatomical references. The guideline aligns with NMC and NICE standards, prioritizing dignity, autonomy, and individualized care.
