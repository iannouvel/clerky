### **Obstetric Haemorrhage Protocol Summary – University Sussex Hospital NHS Trust**  

This protocol outlines the management of **antepartum hemorrhage (APH), placental abruption, placenta praevia, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and women declining blood products**.  

#### **Key Definitions:**  
- **Minor APH:** <50ml bleeding after 24 weeks.  
- **Major APH:** >50ml or signs of concealed bleeding.  
- **Minor PPH:** 500-1000ml blood loss within 24h of birth.  
- **Major PPH:** >1000ml blood loss.  
- **Massive PPH:** Sudden loss ≥2L.  

#### **Management Principles:**  
- **APH:** Assess cause (placental abruption, praevia, trauma), monitor maternal/fetal status, and escalate if major bleeding.  
- **Placenta Praevia:** Consultant-led care, elective C-section for asymptomatic cases, emergency delivery with obstetrician, oxytocin, and neonatology support.  
- **PPH:** Immediate resuscitation, oxytocin administration, blood product transfusion if needed, and monitoring of Hb/coagulation.  
- **Massive Hemorrhage:** Follow hemorrhage protocol—rapid resuscitation, hemostasis, and urgent blood product replacement.  

#### **Women Declining Blood Products:**  
- Consultant obstetrician and anesthetist review antenatally.  
- Document individualized management plan.  
- Follow Jehovah’s Witness protocols for elective surgery.  
- Optimize iron stores and Hb pre-delivery.  

#### **Post-Hemorrhage Care:**  
- Thromboprophylaxis once bleeding controlled.  
- FBC before discharge.  
- Senior-led debriefing.  
- Datix reporting for losses >1500ml.  

Clear communication, multidisciplinary teamwork, and prompt escalation are critical in hemorrhage management.
