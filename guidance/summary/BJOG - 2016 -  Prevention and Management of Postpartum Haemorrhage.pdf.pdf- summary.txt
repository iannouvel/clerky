This clinical guideline focuses on the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). It emphasizes identifying and managing risk factors throughout pregnancy, treating antenatal anemia, and offering prophylactic uterotonics during labor. Recommendations include using oxytocin for vaginal deliveries and considering tranexamic acid for cesarean sections. Communication and multidisciplinary care are essential in managing PPH, along with resuscitation measures and blood transfusion based on clinical assessments. Various surgical interventions, such as uterine balloon tamponade and hysterectomy, may be necessary if pharmacological measures fail. Training, documentation, and debriefing are crucial for optimal PPH management.
