**Summary of NRT Supply Protocol for Pregnant Patients**  

This protocol allows registered midwives and tobacco dependency advisors at University Hospitals Sussex Foundation Trust to directly supply nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to pregnant patients aged 12+ who smoke and are engaged in stop-smoking support. NRT, classified as a General Sales List (GSL) medicine, can be provided without a Patient Group Direction (PGD) or Patient Specific Direction (PSD).  

Key points:  
- **Eligibility**: Pregnant patients over 12 who smoke and are actively seeking to quit, with some exclusions.  
- **NRT Forms & Dosage**: Various NRT products can be supplied, adhering to specified dosage and quantity guidelines.  
- **Staff Requirements**: Providers must hold NCSCT Level 2 training and ensure proper storage and handling of NRT.  
- **Documentation**: Accurate records of NRT supply and patient details must be maintained.  
- **Review**: Protocol authorization must be renewed annually.  

This ensures safe, structured support for smoking cessation in pregnancy.
