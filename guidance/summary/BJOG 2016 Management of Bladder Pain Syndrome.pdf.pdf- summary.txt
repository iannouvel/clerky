It emphasizes the importance of a thorough medical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations to rule out other conditions. Conservative treatments such as dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia are recommended initially, with options for intravesical treatments and further interventions for refractory cases.

Overall, the guideline aims to provide a comprehensive approach to managing BPS and improving patient outcomes.
