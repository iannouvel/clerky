**Summary of Miscarriage Management Guidelines**  

These guidelines provide a structured approach to managing miscarriage, defined as pregnancy loss before 22 weeks, with key symptoms including bleeding and pelvic pain. Diagnosis is confirmed via transvaginal ultrasound to assess pregnancy viability.  

**Management Options:**  
- **Conservative Management:** First-line for early first-trimester miscarriage, with follow-up scans as needed.  
- **Medical Management:** Offered if conservative management is unsuitable, with clear instructions on expected symptoms and when to seek help.  
- **Surgical Management:** Includes counseling, consent, and anti-D prophylaxis for Rh-negative women.  

**Follow-Up & Support:**  
- Provide verbal and written information, including emotional support resources.  
- Offer follow-up appointments and sensitive communication regarding loss.  
- For losses between 12â€“23 weeks, offer the *'Your Baby'* information leaflet and discuss memorial options (e.g., hospital remembrance books, annual memorial services).  

**Funeral Arrangements:**  
- Families may arrange private funerals (burial/cremation) with a funeral director; the hospital provides a list if needed.  
- If no arrangements are made within 30 days, the hospital will conduct a cremation without a service.  

**Support Contacts:**  
Includes hospital bereavement services, chaplaincy, counseling, and national organizations (e.g., Miscarriage Association, SANDS).  

*Note: Professional judgment applies, and protocols should be regularly reviewed.*
