**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Prevention of Acid Aspiration Syndrome**  

This guideline addresses the increased risk of acid aspiration during late pregnancy and labor. Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for peri-partum procedures. Risk stratification identifies low- and high-risk women, with tailored interventions for labor, elective, and emergency caesarean sections.  

Key recommendations include:  
- **Antacid prophylaxis** (e.g., sodium citrate) for high-risk women.  
- **Oral medications** (H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors) to reduce gastric acidity.  
- **Dietary restrictions** (avoiding solids in active labor) and clear fluid intake guidelines.  
- **Neuraxial anesthesia** as the preferred method to minimize aspiration risk.  

High-risk factors include obesity, delayed gastric emptying, and emergency procedures. Management prioritizes minimizing gastric volume and acidity while ensuring safe anesthesia administration. Clear protocols are provided for both elective and emergency scenarios to mitigate aspiration risk effectively.
