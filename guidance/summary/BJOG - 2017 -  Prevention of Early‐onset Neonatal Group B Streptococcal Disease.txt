Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Universal bacteriological screening not recommended for GBS
- IAP offered to women with previous baby affected by GBS disease
- Immediate IAP for known GBS carriers at term
- Pyrexial women in labor to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis not recommended for low-risk term babies
- Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated promptly

Treatment and Management:
- Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy
- Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered for known GBS carriers
- Benzylpenicillin recommended for IAP; Cephalosporin for penicillin allergy
- Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated with penicillin and gentamicin promptly

Monitoring Requirements:
- Evaluation of babies for infection indicators should be done at birth
- Babies of mothers who had a previous baby with GBS disease should be monitored closely for at least 12 hours
- Well babies at risk of EOGBS disease should be monitored closely for signs of infection

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Antibiotic prophylaxis not required for planned caesarean sections without labor
- Antenatal treatment for GBS carriage not recommended
- Immediate IAP not recommended for women not in labor with preterm planned caesarean section
- Adverse effects of IAP should be considered
- Vaginal cleansing in labor does not reduce the risk of neonatal GBS disease
