Pregnant women should receive information leaflets; universal bacteriological screening is not recommended. Clinicians should know GBS disease risk factors. IAP is advised for women with prior GBS-affected babies. Antenatal GBS carriage treatment is not recommended; induction method should not vary based on GBS status. Membrane sweeping is not contraindicated in GBS carriers. Antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary for planned C-sections without labor; immediate IAP is recommended for term GBS carriers. Pyrexial women should get broad-spectrum antibiotics in labor. IAP is advised for confirmed preterm labor; PCR testing at labor onset is not recommended. Water birth is not contraindicated for GBS carriers; postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. Breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status. Babies showing abnormal behavior should seek medical advice; term babies of IAP-receiving mothers do not need special observation. Treat babies with EOGBS signs promptly; evaluate for infection indicators at birth. Routine GBS testing in pregnancy is not recommended due to potential harms; be aware of clinical risk factors. Antibiotic prophylaxis is for GBS bacteriuria; IAP is recommended for known GBS carriers. Immediate IAP and induction are advised for GBS carriers at term; consider broad-spectrum antibiotics in intrapartum pyrexia. IAP is recommended for confirmed preterm labor; not for preterm planned C-sections without labor. Polymerase chain reaction testing at labor onset is not recommended. Water birth is not contraindicated if IAP is given. Swabs for GBS should be transported and processed promptly. Use benzylpenicillin for IAP; cephalosporin for penicillin allergy. Monitor babies closely if mothers decline IAP. Consider adverse effects of IAP; vaginal cleansing does not reduce GBS risk. Seek medical advice for abnormal newborn behavior; term babies of IAP-receiving mothers do not need special observation. Monitor babies closely for infection signs if mothers did not receive adequate IAP. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for asymptomatic term infants. Treat EOGBS babies with penicillin and gentamicin promptly; encourage breastfeeding. Monitor babies of previous GBS-affected mothers closely. No evidence discourages breastfeeding due to GBS risk. Guidelines are not prescriptive; document deviations from local protocols.
