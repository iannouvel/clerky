The clinical guideline for the prevention of early-onset neonatal Group B Streptococcal (EOGBS) disease provides recommendations for managing pregnant women at risk and newborns exposed to GBS. Key points include: universal screening is not recommended, clinicians should be aware of risk factors, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) should be offered to high-risk women, IAP is recommended for confirmed preterm labor, immediate IAP for known GBS carriers at term, and prompt treatment for babies with signs of EOGBS disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not needed for all cases, and postnatal prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. Breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status. Monitoring and early treatment are crucial for babies at risk. The guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized care based on clinical factors and available treatment options. Local protocols should be followed, with any deviations documented.
