The clinical guideline for the Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of clinical risk factors for GBS disease and provides recommendations for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for known carriers. While routine testing for GBS in pregnancy is not recommended due to potential inaccuracies and risks, IAP should be offered to women with previous GBS infection or bacteriuria. Immediate IAP is recommended for known carriers at term, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered for pyrexial women in labor. Babies showing signs of EOGBS disease should be promptly treated, and breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status. Close monitoring is advised for babies of mothers who decline IAP. The guideline also addresses various studies related to GBS colonization, antibiotic treatment, and maternal and infant outcomes, providing a comprehensive overview of evidence-based recommendations. It is important to consider individual patient data and local protocols when implementing these guidelines.
