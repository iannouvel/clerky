This clinical guideline focuses on the laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as appendicitis, gall bladder disease, and ovarian tumors. It emphasizes the importance of experienced laparoscopists performing these procedures to ensure optimal outcomes for both the mother and fetus. The guideline discusses the benefits of laparoscopic surgery, including faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower wound infection rates, while also addressing potential risks such as haemorrhage and organ trauma. Recommendations are provided for the timing of surgery, anesthesia management, insufflation pressures, energy modalities, specimen extraction, and post-operative care. The guideline highlights the need for further research and the importance of a multi-disciplinary team in the care of pregnant women undergoing laparoscopic surgery.
