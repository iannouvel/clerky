Summary: Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnant women are crucial to prevent adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Symptoms include flu-like illness, and prompt investigation and blood films are necessary for diagnosis. Treatment varies based on the severity of the infection, with IV artesunate recommended for severe cases and quinine with clindamycin for uncomplicated malaria. Artemisinin-based therapies are preferred in the second and third trimesters, and chloroquine is no longer recommended for P. falciparum due to resistance. Monitoring for complications and expert consultation are essential for managing malaria in pregnancy effectively.
