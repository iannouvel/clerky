Overall, the clinical guideline emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of malaria in pregnant women to prevent adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Different treatment regimens are recommended for uncomplicated and severe malaria, with IV artesunate being the preferred option for severe cases. Quinine and clindamycin are commonly used for treatment, although clindamycin should be avoided in pregnancy. Monitoring for clinical deterioration and seeking expert advice for severe cases are also highlighted. The guideline also discusses the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters, as well as the potential persistence of Plasmodium falciparum in the placenta despite treatment.
