The Perinatal Collapse in Pregnancy & Puerperium Maternity Protocol provides guidelines for managing maternal collapse, a rare but life-threatening event during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Key recommendations include prompt resuscitation, use of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS), involvement of specialist clinicians for complex cases, and collaboration between different healthcare professionals for effective management. Common causes of maternal collapse discussed include major obstetric hemorrhage, cardiac disease, thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, drug toxicity, eclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage, and anaphylaxis. The protocol emphasizes the importance of following Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines, considering aortocaval compression in pregnant women, and performing perimortem caesarean section if needed. Debriefing, training, and auditing are recommended for continuous improvement in managing maternal collapse.
