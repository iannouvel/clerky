The **Maternity Telephone Triage SOP** provides standardized guidance for telephone management of maternity patients at UH Sussex SRH & WH. It ensures consistent, safe, and efficient care delivery by midwives and medical staff. Key responsibilities include adhering to the SOP, exercising professional judgment, and maintaining accessibility of the document.  

Triage is conducted via **NetCall** or diverted to the labor ward, with assessments determining the appropriate care pathway. All telephone advice must be documented in **MIS (Maternity Information System)**. A critical rule is advising patients to attend in person by the **third call** unless concerns are resolved.  

Escalation pathways are available for patients raising concerns about their care. Appendices include a **telephone triage assessment card** and specific pathways for different clinical scenarios.  

This SOP (SP22003 v1.1, July 2023) supports quality, safety, and patient satisfaction while streamlining maternity telephone triage services.
