They should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation with imminent preterm birth anticipated, including those with twins and triplets. For planned caesarean births between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, a discussion about corticosteroids' risks and benefits is advised. Corticosteroids are effective within 48 hours before birth, with benefits even within 24 hours. Late preterm births (35+0 to 36+6 weeks) should consider corticosteroids, but risks like neonatal hypoglycemia must be weighed. Women with diabetes can receive corticosteroids with additional monitoring. Corticosteroids should not delay birth if necessary for the mother or baby's health. Limited evidence supports repeated corticosteroid courses, with a maximum of three courses, and caution is advised in systemic infections. Future research should focus on effectiveness in various conditions and potential off-target effects.",

    "RCOG - 2025 - GTG 76 -Management of Thyroid Disorders in Pregnancy.txt": "The clinical guideline for the management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of using trimester- and manufacturer-specific pregnancy reference ranges for thyroid function tests. Recommendations include iodine supplementation, targeted testing for high-risk populations, and levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism. Women on levothyroxine should increase their dose upon pregnancy confirmation and undergo regular monitoring. Testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies is not recommended unless there is thyroid dysfunction. Antithyroid drugs should be used cautiously in hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, with propylthiouracil preferred. Postpartum thyroiditis management involves monitoring and possible levothyroxine replacement. The guideline also addresses the impact of iodine deficiency on fetal development and the importance of maintaining optimal thyroid function for maternal and fetal health. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction can have lasting consequences like hypothyroidism. Monitoring thyroid function in pregnant women with thyroid antibodies is crucial to prevent postpartum depression. Selenium supplementation may impact postpartum thyroid status in women with thyroid antibodies. Safety of iodine supplementation in these women needs further investigation. These guidelines are meant as general recommendations, not prescriptive directions. Deviations from local protocols should be documented in the patient's case notes.",
    "CG1114 Breech guideline.txt": "The Breech Management v6.0 guideline focuses on external cephalic version (ECV) and vaginal breech birth for obstetric management. It defines different types of breech presentations and emphasizes the importance of timely assessment for suspected breech presentation after 36 weeks gestation.

The guideline aims to improve clinical practice based on current evidence and best practices.",
    "MP003 Antenatal Screening - Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia.txt": "Antenatal screening for Sickle Cell and Thalassemia is essential in maternity care to identify women and couples at risk of having affected pregnancies. Screening should be offered to all pregnant women, ideally before 10 weeks of pregnancy. Couples aware of their carrier status should be referred for further assessment. Screening based on the Family Origin Questionnaire may not identify all carriers. Women have the right to decline screening, which can be done later through their midwife. Results are typically available within 3 working days, falling into categories like non-carrier, inconclusive, or carrier. Follow-up of paternal blood results is crucial for risk assessment. Couples at high risk should be referred for discussions about prenatal diagnosis. Postnatal testing is available for babies born to at-risk couples who declined prenatal diagnosis.

Additional investigations are not routinely recommended unless itch is severe or associated with other conditions. Severe or atypical cases should be discussed with a hepatologist. Confirming ICP postnatally is crucial, with a focus on symptom resolution and normal liver function tests. The risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acid concentrations, warranting planned birth timing. Ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP. No treatments have been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes or reduce bile acid concentrations significantly. Ursodeoxycholic acid is not routinely recommended for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP. Active management with planned early birth is suggested to reduce adverse outcomes, and close monitoring with regular tests and measurements is essential. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies. Follow-up postpartum is advised to confirm resolution. In subsequent pregnancies, baseline tests should be performed, and repeat testing should be based on clinical indications. Future research should focus on prognostic tools, testing for gestational diabetes, and effective treatments for itching and adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.",

It suggests re-examination or referral if fetal sex cannot be determined and highlights the need for reports to include a visible alert about the presence of fetal sex details. Overall, the guideline underscores the significance of fetal genitalia assessment in routine second-trimester ultrasounds and stresses the importance of communicating fetal sex information to patients while upholding their preferences.",
    "GTG 2011 - Pregnancy and Breast Cancer.txt": "The clinical guideline focuses on managing breast cancer in women of childbearing age. Key recommendations include multidisciplinary team treatment, tailored therapy based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage, and non-hormonal contraception post-treatment. Women planning pregnancy post-breast cancer should consult with specialists, with most advised to wait at least 2 years after treatment. Fertility preservation options, like GnRH analogues and cryopreservation, should be discussed before treatment. Pregnancy after breast cancer should be jointly supervised, with considerations for cardiomyopathy risk, delivery complications, and breastfeeding. Assisted reproduction post-treatment may be limited, and hormone replacement therapy may be needed for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause. Addressing reproductive concerns and fertility preservation options is crucial for young women with breast cancer.",
    "FIGO - 2015 - Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring - Cardiotocography.txt": "The FIGO consensus guidelines on intrapartum fetal monitoring recommend that cardiotocography (CTG) should not replace clinical judgment but be used in high-risk situations for fetal hypoxia. Continuous CTG is advised when abnormalities are detected during intermittent auscultation. Maternal positioning during monitoring is crucial, avoiding prolonged supine recumbent positions. Initial monitoring should be external fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, with simultaneous maternal heart rate monitoring in specific cases. Analysis of CTG tracings involves assessing baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions. Management of fetal hypoxia/acidosis requires prompt intervention and addressing underlying causes. Continuous CTG may not significantly improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary interventions.

Key recommendations include assessing deep endometriosis extent, interpreting MRI scans by a specialist, considering laparoscopy for diagnosis even with normal ultrasound, offering treatment based on symptoms rather than stage, and discussing surgical options with patients. Management may involve hormonal or surgical treatment, with excision preferred over ablation for endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended for endometriosis, especially in cases involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter. Hormonal treatment alone is not advised for women trying to conceive. Research recommendations include exploring pain management programs, assessing the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions, and determining optimal hormonal treatment doses for fertility outcomes in endometriosis patients prioritizing fertility. The guideline emphasizes the impact of endometriosis on quality of life and the need for tailored information and support interventions for patients and their partners.",
