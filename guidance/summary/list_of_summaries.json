    "NICE Guidance - 2010 - Hysterectomy for Endometrial Cancer.pdf": "Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a safe and effective option for endometrial cancer, with patient selection by a gynaecological oncology team and advanced laparoscopic skills required. The procedure offers a less invasive approach with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery, and similar overall survival rates to abdominal hysterectomy. Hospital stays are significantly shorter with laparoscopic hysterectomy, but rates of conversion to laparotomy and postoperative complications are reported. Potential adverse events include bladder dysfunction and intra-abdominal abscess. Special training is recommended for clinicians performing laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer to ensure optimal outcomes.",

    "RCOG 2013 - Induction of Labour at Term in  Older Mothers.pdf": "The clinical guideline on induction of labour at term in older mothers emphasizes the increased risks faced by women aged 40 and older, including higher rates of obstetric complications and stillbirth. Inducing labour at 39-40 weeks may reduce the risk of stillbirth and improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the caesarean section rate. However, there is limited data on the impact of this policy on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of induction of labour in advanced maternal age, with a specific focus on nulliparous women over 35 years old.",
