    "Joint RCOG BSGE Guideline - Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women.pdf.pdf": "This guideline provides guidance on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. Most masses are benign, and laparoscopic surgery is recommended for benign masses. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised if malignancy is suspected. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, and risk of malignancy can be estimated using the Risk of Malignancy Index. Follow-up for simple ovarian cysts varies based on size and persistence. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred for elective management of benign masses, and careful consideration should be given to the decision to perform an oophorectomy. The guideline also covers topics such as tumor vascularity assessment, differential diagnosis, and risk of malignancy indices.",
    "NICE Guideline - 2021 - IOL.pdf.pdf": "The clinical guideline on inducing labor focuses on providing information and support for pregnant women considering induction.

    "RCOG 2013 - Induction of Labour at Term in  Older Mothers.pdf.pdf": "The clinical guideline on induction of labour in older mothers highlights the increased risks for both mother and baby associated with advanced maternal age. Stillbirth rates are higher in women aged 40 and older, making earlier induction of labour a justifiable option to reduce this risk. Induction has been shown to improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the rate of caesarean sections. However, there is a lack of data on the impact of induction on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Further research is needed to better understand the effects and benefits of induction of labour in advanced maternal age.",
