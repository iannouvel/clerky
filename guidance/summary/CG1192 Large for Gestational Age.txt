**Large for Gestational Age (LGA) Guideline Summary**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing suspected LGA fetuses, applicable to all maternity care providers. LGA and macrosomia increase risks such as shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, and perinatal complications. Antenatal management includes fundal height monitoring, with ultrasound referral if indicated. From 38 weeks, discuss induction of labor to mitigate risks, though it may increase perineal trauma. Cesarean birth is recommended for high-risk cases.  

Birth options include expectant management, induction, or cesarean. Induction reduces shoulder dystocia risk but raises perineal tear likelihood, while perinatal death, brachial plexus injury, and emergency cesarean rates remain comparable. Shared decision-making is essential, balancing clinical risks with patient preferences. Respect the individualâ€™s informed choice regarding birth planning.
