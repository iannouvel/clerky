Endometrial hyperplasia should be classified using the WHO system and diagnosed via endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens, particularly LNG-IUS, are first-line for hyperplasia without atypia lasting at least 6 months with follow-up biopsies. Surgical management may be needed in some cases, while atypical hyperplasia warrants total hysterectomy. HRT use should be cautious. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to polyps should be completely removed. Regular surveillance is recommended. LNG-IUS is preferred over oral progestogens for its efficacy and fewer side effects. Hysterectomy is advised for atypical hyperplasia, with fertility preservation counseling. Women on tamoxifen should be monitored for hyperplasia and consider LNG-IUS. Endometrial polyps should be completely removed. Research gaps include biomarker utility and weight loss effects on regression. Endometrial thickness should be monitored, and individualized treatment decisions are crucial.
