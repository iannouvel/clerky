The clinical guideline on the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying and monitoring risk factors, utilizing the WHO classification for diagnosis, and employing methods like endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy for surveillance. Progestogens, particularly the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), are recommended as first-line treatment for hyperplasia without atypia, with a minimum treatment duration of 6 months and follow-up biopsies. Surgical options may be considered in certain cases, with total hysterectomy advised for atypical hyperplasia. Women desiring fertility preservation should be counseled on risks, and hormone replacement therapy should be used cautiously. Regular surveillance is crucial, and management decisions should be individualized. The guideline also addresses specific scenarios like hyperplasia related to tamoxifen use and endometrial hyperplasia within polyps. Future research recommendations include exploring biomarkers and weight loss effects on regression.
