The clinical guideline for the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying and monitoring risk factors, utilizing the WHO classification for diagnosis, and implementing appropriate surveillance methods such as endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens, particularly the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), are recommended for managing hyperplasia without atypia, with surgical options considered in certain cases. Total hysterectomy is advised for atypical hyperplasia, especially for women no longer requiring fertility. The guideline also addresses specific considerations for women on hormone replacement therapy, adjuvant breast cancer treatment, and tamoxifen therapy. Regular surveillance and follow-up biopsies are essential for monitoring disease regression and progression. Future research recommendations and auditable topics are highlighted, along with useful links and support groups for further information and support.
