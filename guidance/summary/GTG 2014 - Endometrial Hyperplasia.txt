Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Endometrial hyperplasia is classified by the WHO into two groups based on cytological atypia.
- Diagnosis requires histological examination through endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy.
- Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling, transvaginal ultrasound, and hysteroscopy.
- Progestogens are effective in managing hyperplasia without atypia, with LNG-IUS being the first-line treatment.
- Surgical management may be considered in certain cases, with total hysterectomy recommended for atypical hyperplasia.
- Women wishing to preserve fertility should be counseled about the risks.

Treatment and Management:
- Progestogens, especially LNG-IUS, are recommended for hyperplasia without atypia, with treatment lasting at least 6 months.
- Surgical management, such as hysterectomy, may be considered if regression does not occur.
- Atypical hyperplasia should be managed with total hysterectomy.
- Women with endometrial hyperplasia on HRT should consider switching to continuous progestogen intake.
- Complete removal of endometrial polyps is recommended.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Endometrial surveillance every 6 months during treatment.
- At least two consecutive negative biopsies before discharge.
- Routine endometrial surveillance with biopsies every 3 months for women with atypical hyperplasia not undergoing hysterectomy.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in women with a uterus.
- Women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer should be monitored for hyperplasia.
- Women with endometrial hyperplasia on tamoxifen should reassess the need for tamoxifen with their oncologist.
