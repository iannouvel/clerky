The clinical guideline for the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage emphasizes the importance of identifying and managing risk factors throughout pregnancy. It recommends treating antenatal anemia, offering prophylactic uterotonics during labor, and considering tranexamic acid for high-risk cases. Communication and multidisciplinary care are crucial in managing PPH, with resuscitation measures and blood transfusions based on clinical assessments. Surgical interventions may be necessary if pharmacological methods fail. The guideline also covers various treatment options such as uterine balloon tamponade, haemostatic suturing, and selective arterial occlusion. Training, documentation, and debriefing after PPH events are essential for optimal management.
