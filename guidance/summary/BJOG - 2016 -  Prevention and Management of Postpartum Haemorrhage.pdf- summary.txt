The clinical guideline for the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage emphasizes the identification and management of risk factors throughout pregnancy. Antenatal anaemia should be treated to reduce PPH risk, and prophylactic uterotonics should be offered during the third stage of labor. Communication and multidisciplinary care are essential for managing PPH, with resuscitation measures and blood transfusion based on clinical assessments. Various pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical methods should be used to control bleeding, with surgical interventions considered if pharmacological measures fail. Training, preparation, and accurate documentation are crucial for optimal PPH management, with protocols in place for staff training and incident reviews.
