The clinical guideline for the Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage emphasizes the identification and management of risk factors throughout pregnancy. Antenatal anaemia should be treated, uterine massage is not beneficial, and prophylactic uterotonics should be offered during the third stage of labor. Communication and multidisciplinary care are crucial, and resuscitation measures should be followed for minor and major PPH. Blood transfusion should be based on assessments, and surgical interventions may be necessary if pharmacological measures fail. Various treatment options including uterine balloon tamponade, haemostatic suturing, and arterial ligation are available. Training and preparation are essential for optimal management, and accurate documentation and debriefing should be conducted after PPH events.
