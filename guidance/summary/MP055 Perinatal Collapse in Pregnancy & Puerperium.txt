**Summary of Perinatal Collapse in Pregnancy & Puerperium Protocol (MP055)**  

Maternal collapse is a rare but critical event requiring immediate resuscitation to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. Key causes include major obstetric hemorrhage (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage, placental abruption), cardiovascular events, thromboembolism, sepsis, anaphylaxis, and metabolic disturbances.  

**Immediate Management:**  
- Call for help, assess for signs of life, and initiate basic/advanced life support (ABCDE approach).  
- Administer high-flow oxygen, secure IV access, and provide fluid resuscitation.  
- Relieve aortocaval compression in women >20 weeks via left uterine displacement.  
- If cardiac arrest occurs, perform chest compressions and consider perimortem cesarean delivery within 5 minutes if gestation is viable.  

**Monitoring & Early Recognition:**  
- Use the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS) for antenatal/postnatal women with risk factors or complications.  
- Fast-bleep the Obstetric Registrar for clinical deterioration or loss of consciousness.  

**Specialist Involvement:**  
- Engage hematologists, microbiologists, anesthetists, and ICU consultants as needed for complex cases (e.g., hemorrhage, sepsis, anaphylaxis).  

**Post-Collapse Care:**  
- Debrief the woman, family, and staff to address psychological impacts (e.g., PTSD, tocophobia).  
- Ensure accurate documentation and incident reporting.  

**Training & Responsibilities:**  
- All maternity staff must undergo annual multidisciplinary training in maternal collapse management.  
- Prompt, coordinated intervention and adherence to protocols are essential for optimal outcomes.
