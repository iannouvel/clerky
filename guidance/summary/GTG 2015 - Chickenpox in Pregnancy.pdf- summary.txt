This clinical guideline emphasizes the importance of managing varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure in pregnant women. It recommends varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy and advises pregnant women to avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles. Testing for VZV immunity and offering VZIG if needed is recommended for pregnant women exposed to VZV. Treatment with aciclovir is suggested for pregnant women with chickenpox, with hospital referral for severe cases. Delivery timing and mode should be tailored for pregnant women with chickenpox, and fetal risks should be considered. Further research is needed on varicella screening and treatment during pregnancy.
