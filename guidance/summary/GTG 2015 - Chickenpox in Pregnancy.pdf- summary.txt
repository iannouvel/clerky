The clinical guideline emphasizes the importance of varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy. Pregnant women should avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles, and if exposed, should be tested for VZV immunity and offered VZIG if non-immune. Treatment with aciclovir is recommended for pregnant women with chickenpox, and hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox, and fetal risks should be considered. Additional research is needed on varicella screening and treatment in pregnancy, and support groups are available for more information.
