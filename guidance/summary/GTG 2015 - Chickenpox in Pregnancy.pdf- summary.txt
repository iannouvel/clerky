The clinical guideline recommends varicella vaccination for non-immune women before or after pregnancy and advises pregnant women to avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles. Testing for VZV immunity and offering VZIG if non-immune is recommended for pregnant women exposed to the virus. Treatment with aciclovir is advised for pregnant women with chickenpox, with hospital referral for severe cases. Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox, and fetal risks should be considered. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox, and prophylaxis with VZIG is recommended for newborns born to mothers with recent chickenpox. Further research on varicella screening and treatment in pregnancy is needed.
