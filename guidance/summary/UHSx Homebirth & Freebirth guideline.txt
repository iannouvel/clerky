**Clinical Guideline Summary: Homebirth & Freebirth**  

This guideline outlines evidence-based care for homebirths and freebirths, emphasizing safety, professional accountability, and respect for patient autonomy. Midwives must follow NMC The Code, conduct thorough risk assessments, and support informed decision-making. Key recommendations include:  

- **Eligibility & Risk Assessment**: Low-risk pregnancies are suitable for homebirth; high-risk cases (e.g., pre-existing conditions, previous complications) require obstetric unit delivery. Women declining hospital advice should receive consultant midwife input.  
- **Intrapartum Care**: Two midwives attend homebirths, with clear transfer criteria (e.g., prolonged labor, abnormal fetal heart rate, hemorrhage). Emergency transfer plans must be communicated.  
- **Freebirth Considerations**: Health professionals should engage respectfully with women choosing unassisted birth, address misconceptions, and escalate safeguarding concerns.  
- **Staffing & Logistics**: Homebirth services may suspend if staffing falls below safety thresholds (e.g., â‰¤4 midwives). Geographic factors and travel time for midwives must be considered.  
- **Postnatal & Neonatal Care**: Immediate postnatal monitoring, 24-hour newborn checks, and clear emergency contact details are required.  

**Critical Exclusions**:  
- Illegal delegation of clinical roles to birth partners.  
- Lone midwife attendance without backup.  
- Homebirth beyond 42 weeks without obstetric consultation.  

**Safety Protocols**:  
- Mandatory documentation of risk discussions.  
- Thromboprophylaxis management.  
- Structured escalation for complications (e.g., meconium, retained placenta).  

This guideline prioritizes patient-centered care while ensuring clinical and legal safeguards.
