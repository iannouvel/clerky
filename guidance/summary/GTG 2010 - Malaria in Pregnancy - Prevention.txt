Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Malaria in pregnancy can lead to maternal mortality, pregnancy loss, reduced birth weight, and other complications.
- Pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting and dying from malaria compared to non-pregnant individuals.

Treatment and Management:
- Pregnant or breastfeeding women in chloroquine-resistant areas should consider mefloquine for prophylaxis in the second and third trimesters.
- Atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are alternative options for prophylaxis in certain areas.
- Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated in pregnancy.
- Quinine and clindamycin are recommended treatments for pregnant women.
- Standby emergency treatment with quinine, Co-artem, or atovaquone-proguanil should be available for suspected malaria cases in pregnant travelers.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Pregnant women should monitor for symptoms of malaria, such as fever, and seek medical treatment promptly if malaria is suspected.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications include the use of doxycycline and primaquine in pregnancy.
- Risk factors include traveling to malaria-endemic areas without adequate prevention strategies in place.
