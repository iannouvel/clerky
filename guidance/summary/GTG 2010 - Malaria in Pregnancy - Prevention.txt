This clinical guideline focuses on the prevention of malaria in pregnancy for UK-based residents traveling to malaria-endemic areas. Pregnant women should consider postponing travel if possible, and if not, they should be educated on malaria risks and prevention strategies. Chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine is recommended in the second and third trimesters in chloroquine-resistant areas, while atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are options in certain regions. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Standby emergency treatment should be provided to pregnant travelers, and quinine and clindamycin are recommended for treatment. Pregnant women should seek medical care promptly if malaria is suspected. The guideline emphasizes the importance of risk awareness, bite prevention, chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent malaria complications during pregnancy.
