Pregnant women traveling to malaria endemic areas should postpone travel if possible; if unavoidable, they should seek guidance on malaria risks and prevention strategies. Awareness of risk, bite prevention, chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Mefloquine is recommended in the second and third trimesters in chloroquine-resistant areas; atovaquone-proguanil and proguanil plus chloroquine are also options in certain areas. Chloroquine and proguanil are safe but ineffective in chloroquine-resistant areas. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated. Quinine and clindamycin are recommended treatments for pregnant women; standby treatment should be initiated if malaria is suspected. Emergency standby treatment instructions should be given to pregnant travelers without access to medical care. Monitoring for adverse effects of prophylactic drugs and seeking medical care promptly are essential.
