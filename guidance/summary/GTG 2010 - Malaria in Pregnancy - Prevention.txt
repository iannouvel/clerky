Guideline for preventing malaria in pregnancy for UK residents visiting endemic areas emphasizes the risks, complications, and prevention strategies. Pregnant women are at higher risk of malaria complications, including maternal mortality and pregnancy loss. Recommendations include postponing travel if possible, using chemoprophylaxis like mefloquine in certain areas, and seeking prompt diagnosis and treatment. Standby treatment instructions should be given for suspected malaria, with quinine and clindamycin recommended for pregnant women. Individual patient needs should be considered when following these guidelines.
