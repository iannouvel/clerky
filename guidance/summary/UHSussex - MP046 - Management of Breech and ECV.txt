Breech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with buttocks, legs, or feet closest to the cervix; types include frank, complete, footling, and kneeling breech. Suspected cases should be monitored, with confirmed cases offered ECV at 36-37 weeks; contraindications include placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers. Those declining ECV should discuss birth options like planned caesarean or vaginal breech birth; risks to both should be considered. Risk factors for vaginal breech birth include hyperextended neck, estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and fetal compromise; caesarean is recommended if identified. Labor and birth should occur in units with immediate surgical and neonatal support; continuous CTG monitoring is advised in labor. Maternal observations and pain relief options should be available, with interventions for slow progress or poor fetal condition. Delivery maneuvers should be individualized based on experience, with caesarean recommended for preterm or twin breech presentations. Maternal factors like previous LSCS, high BMI, age >40, and obstetric complications may also warrant caesarean section.
