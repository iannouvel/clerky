Breech presentation refers to a fetus positioned with the buttocks, legs, or feet closest to the cervix. Perinatal risks are higher with breech presentation compared to cephalic presentation. Management includes monitoring and offering external cephalic version (ECV) at 36-37 weeks. ECV success rate is around 50%. Contraindications include certain conditions like placenta previa. Options for persistent breech presentation include planned caesarean section or vaginal breech birth. Vaginal breech birth requires thorough risk assessment and a detailed birth plan. Continuous monitoring, pain relief options, and a multidisciplinary team approach are essential. In labor, interventions may be needed if progress is slow. Delivery maneuvers depend on experience and preference. Cord compression is common during delivery. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech or twin pregnancies. Vaginal breech birth requires organizational support and skills training. Individualized risk assessment is crucial, and in some cases, emergency caesarean may be necessary.
