Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Breech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with the buttocks, legs, or feet in the lower uterine segment closest to the cervix.
- Types of breech presentation include frank or extended breech, complete or flexed breech, footling breech, and kneeling breech.
- Pregnant individuals with confirmed breech presentation should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) at 36-37 weeks of gestation.
- Absolute contraindications for ECV include conditions like placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers.
- Risk factors for planned vaginal breech birth include hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise.

Treatment and Management:
- ECV should be performed by trained obstetricians and monitored for complications.
- Pregnant individuals declining ECV or with persistent breech presentation should be informed of birth options such as planned caesarean section or vaginal breech birth.
- Pregnant individuals opting for elective LSCS for breech presentation should be informed about timing and potential risks.
- Pregnant individuals choosing vaginal breech birth should have antenatal assessment and be referred to appropriate clinics for care.
- Multidisciplinary team approach is recommended for planned vaginal breech birth.
- Continuous CTG monitoring is recommended in established labor.
- Maternal observations should be performed regularly throughout labor.
- Intravenous cannula is recommended on admission for individuals with anticipated difficulty with IV access.
- Upright position and mobility in labor should be encouraged.
- Full range of pain relief options should be available.
- Birthing individuals should feel calm, in control, and supported during labor and birth.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Continuous CTG monitoring in established labor.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Absolute contraindications for ECV include placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers.
- Risk factors for planned vaginal breech birth include hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise.
- Factors such as fetal hyperextended neck, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of fetal compromise may require a caesarean section.
- Maternal factors such as previous LSCS, raised BMI, maternal age >40 years, and other obstetric complications may also require a caesarean section.
