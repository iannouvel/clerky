The clinical guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy emphasizes the importance of transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosing different types of ectopic pregnancies, such as tubal, cervical, and caesarean scar pregnancies. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) levels are used to plan management strategies. Various treatment options, including expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, and surgical approaches, are discussed based on the type of ectopic pregnancy and the patient's stability. The guideline also highlights the need for appropriate training for clinicians in surgical, ultrasound, and medical management, as well as the importance of providing support and counseling for women undergoing treatment for ectopic pregnancy.
