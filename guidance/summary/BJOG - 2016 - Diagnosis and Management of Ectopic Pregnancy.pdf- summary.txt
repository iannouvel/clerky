The clinical guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy emphasizes the use of transvaginal ultrasound as the primary diagnostic tool for various types of ectopic pregnancies, including tubal, cervical, caesarean scar, interstitial, cornual, ovarian, abdominal, and heterotopic. It provides recommendations for the management of different types of ectopic pregnancies, such as laparoscopic surgical approaches, expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, and surgical removal. The guideline also highlights the importance of appropriate training for clinicians, the use of virtual reality simulators for training, and the need for anti-D prophylaxis in RhD-negative women. It addresses long-term fertility prospects, psychological impact, and support services for women undergoing treatment for ectopic pregnancy.
