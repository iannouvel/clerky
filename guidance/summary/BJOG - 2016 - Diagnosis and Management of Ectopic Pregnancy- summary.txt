The clinical guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of various types of ectopic pregnancies, including tubal, cervical, caesarean scar, interstitial, cornual, ovarian, abdominal, and heterotopic pregnancies. It emphasizes the use of transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosis and offers options such as laparoscopic surgery, methotrexate treatment, and expectant management depending on the type and stability of the pregnancy. The guideline also addresses the importance of counseling, support, and follow-up care for women undergoing treatment for ectopic pregnancy. Providers are encouraged to offer a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service and ensure appropriate training for clinicians involved in the management of ectopic pregnancies. Further research recommendations are also outlined to address areas of clinical uncertainty.
