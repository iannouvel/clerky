**Summary of UH Sussex Obstetric VTE Risk Assessment Guidelines:**  

Pregnant women must undergo VTE risk assessment at the booking appointment and again at 28 weeks, with additional assessments for any hospital admission or new risk factors. Daily risk evaluation is required using specific criteria. Both antenatal and postnatal VTE risk assessments should be performed.  

Thromboprophylaxis should be considered based on the total risk score and reassessed if new risks emerge. For patients with bleeding risks, consultation with a haematologist is advised. LMWH dosing must be weight-based, with high prophylactic doses for specific weight categories.  

Relative contraindications to enoxaparin require discussion with a consultant obstetrician before administration. The guidelines emphasize timely reassessment and appropriate thromboprophylaxis to mitigate VTE risk in pregnancy and postpartum.
