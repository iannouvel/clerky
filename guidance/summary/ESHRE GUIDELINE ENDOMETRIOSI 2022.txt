The ESHRE clinical guideline for endometriosis offers evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Key points include using NSAIDs or hormone therapies like GnRH agonists for pain management, preferring surgical excision over ablation, and recommending cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma. Referral to specialized centers is advised for complex cases, with tailored treatment plans and long-term monitoring emphasized. Surgical options are effective for pain relief, but risks should be considered, especially in rectal surgery. Medical therapies can complement surgery, with limited evidence supporting preoperative hormone treatment. Shared decision-making is crucial in choosing between medical and surgical interventions. ART can be considered for infertility, with antibiotic prophylaxis recommended during treatment. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and awareness of associated risks are essential. The guideline covers various patient populations, including adolescents and postmenopausal women, and addresses extrapelvic endometriosis, pregnancy effects, and cancer risk. Genetic testing for risk assessment is advised in research settings. Prevention strategies and disclosure of conflicts of interest are highlighted. The guideline development process involves evidence review, consensus meetings, and implementation strategies for dissemination. Monitoring asymptomatic cases is generally not recommended, and routine cancer screening beyond existing guidelines is not advised. The guideline will be revised in 2025, with stakeholder input and copyright restrictions in place.
