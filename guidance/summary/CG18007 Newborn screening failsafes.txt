### **Newborn Screening Failsafes Summary**  

This guideline outlines procedures for newborn screening (NIPE, NBS, NHSP) to ensure timely identification of serious conditions. Eligible babies include those up to 6 weeks old, tracked via NHS numbers or GP registration. Daily checks are required for transfers, discharges, and screenings, with discrepancies reported to the designated lead.  

**Key Failsafe Procedures:**  
- **NIPE Referral Export:** Run preset S4N searches twice weekly for referral conditions and update the follow-up spreadsheet.  
- **Red (Breached) Baby Spreadsheet:** Track NICU babies to ensure timely screening.  
- **S4H NICU Failsafe:** Identify well/community and NICU babies, filter in-process cases, and arrange missed screenings.  
- **NHSP Systmone Report:** Verify unscreened babies and ensure proper tracking.  

**Documentation & Follow-Up:**  
- Record neonatal/child deaths and NICU transfers in relevant databases.  
- Merge duplicate records and complete all birth entries.  
- Confirm screenings at day 1, 5, and 10 visits; follow up on incomplete tests.  
- Forward discharge emails to screening administrators and document home births.  
- Notify Community Team Leads of repeat bloodspot requests.  

**Screening Programs & Consent:**  
- **NIPE:** Examines eyes, heart, hips, and testes.  
- **NBS:** Screens for sickle cell, cystic fibrosis, and hypothyroidism.  
- **NHSP:** Detects permanent hearing loss.  
- **Consent:** Parents must be informed; declining screening is documented. Data is confidential but may be anonymized for evaluation.  

QA checks and key personnel contacts ensure compliance. Updates to guidelines are noted for reference.
