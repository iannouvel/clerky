The Neonatal Hypothermia Guideline aims to assist healthcare providers in detecting and managing neonatal hypothermia. It covers all staff caring for newborns and emphasizes anticipating and preventing hypothermia in at-risk groups. Key responsibilities include maintaining a warm environment, encouraging skin-to-skin contact, and promoting feeding. Immediate actions after birth include drying the baby, skin-to-skin contact, and feeding encouragement. For low temperatures, skin-to-skin contact, monitoring, and the use of a hot cot are recommended. Skin-to-skin contact stabilizes vital signs and promotes feeding. Proper use of the hot cot involves monitoring and gradual temperature reduction. Continuing care includes discontinuing monitoring if the temperature is stable and focusing on feeding. It is essential to inform parents about monitoring and management. The guideline outlines a process for monitoring and auditing in the Maternity Audit Document.
