The clinical guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management, published by NICE, provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and individuals with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. The guideline emphasizes the importance of patient involvement in decision-making, using inclusive language, and tailoring treatment to individual symptoms and preferences. It highlights the need for thorough assessment and diagnosis, including consideration of laparoscopy for suspected cases. Treatment options include pharmacological pain management, non-pharmacological approaches, and surgical interventions based on the extent of the condition and the woman's fertility priorities. The guideline also addresses key research questions related to treatment effectiveness and outcomes for women with endometriosis.
