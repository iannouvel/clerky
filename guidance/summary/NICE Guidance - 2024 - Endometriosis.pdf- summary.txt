The NICE guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and individuals with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. It emphasizes the importance of patient involvement in decision-making, inclusive language, and tailored treatment based on symptoms and preferences rather than the stage of endometriosis. The guideline recommends thorough assessment and diagnosis, including laparoscopy for suspected cases, and offers options for pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management, surgical interventions, and fertility considerations. It also highlights the need for further research on the effectiveness of treatments such as laparoscopic surgery, lifestyle interventions, and hormonal therapies on managing endometriosis-related pain and improving quality of life.
