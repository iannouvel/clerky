The clinical guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management by NICE provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, commissioners, and individuals with suspected or confirmed endometriosis. It emphasizes the importance of inclusive language, patient involvement in decision-making, and tailored treatment based on symptoms and preferences rather than the stage of endometriosis. The guideline highlights the need for thorough assessment, including pelvic MRI scans and laparoscopy, and offers options for pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management, surgical interventions, and fertility considerations. Questions for further research include the effectiveness of laparoscopic treatment, lifestyle interventions, and hormonal treatments on managing endometriosis-related pain and improving quality of life.
