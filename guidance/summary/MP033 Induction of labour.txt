The clinical guideline on induction of labor outlines protocols and recommendations for healthcare professionals when inducing labor in pregnant women. Key points include offering induction between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to prevent prolonged pregnancy, considering specific factors for preterm and term pre-labor rupture of membranes, and not routinely offering induction for maternal request alone. Induction is generally not recommended for breech presentation or severe fetal growth restriction with confirmed compromise. Membrane sweeping is recommended as an adjunct to induction, with vaginal PGE2 as the preferred pharmacological method. Continuous monitoring, informed decision-making, pain relief options, and management of complications like uterine hyperstimulation are essential during induction. Precautions to prevent cord prolapse and considerations for emergency caesarean section in case of suspected uterine rupture are crucial aspects highlighted in the guideline.
