**UH Sussex Maternity Escalation Policy Summary**  

This policy outlines a structured approach for managing maternity service capacity and staffing crises, including unit closure or diversion. Key actions include:  

- **Escalation Levels & Triggers**: Regular safety huddles (twice daily) assess staffing, bed capacity, neonatal unit status, and urgent care demands. Red flags (e.g., critical staff shortages) trigger Level 3 escalation.  
- **Immediate Actions**:  
  - **Staffing/Bed Shortages**: Prioritize discharges, expedite treatment, and redeploy staff.  
  - **Unit Closure**: Divert women to the nearest available unit; high-risk cases (e.g., preterm labor, hemorrhage) take precedence.  
  - **Communication**: Notify callers of diversion, document diverted cases, and coordinate with ambulance services and neighboring units. Never advise self-referral.  
- **Roles**: The Clinical Site Manager oversees safety, liaises with commanders, and monitors staffing/bed capacity.  
- **Reopening**: Resume services once staffing/facilities stabilize, with 1-hourly huddles during diversion.  
- **Documentation**: Record diverted patients, complete mutual aid requests, and ensure handover between units.  

**Training/Awareness**: Policy disseminated to midwives/obstetricians; coordinators trained in escalation protocols. Archived versions replaced on staff platforms.  

*Focus: Safe, standardized diversion during crises, prioritizing high-risk care and clear communication.*
