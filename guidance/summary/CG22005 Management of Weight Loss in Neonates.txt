### **Summary: Management of Weight Loss in Neonates**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing neonatal weight loss, ensuring appropriate feeding support and monitoring. Key aspects include:  

- **Initial Weighing & Monitoring:** Neonates should be weighed at birth and regularly thereafter to track weight loss. Weight loss percentage is calculated as: *(Birth weight – Current weight) ÷ Birth weight × 100*.  
- **Feeding Support:** Breastfeeding should be prioritized, with expressed breast milk (EBM) as the first-line top-up. Infant Feeding Team involvement is recommended for additional support.  
- **Supplementation Guidelines:**  
  - Specific top-up volumes per feed for the first 96 hours.  
  - Daily intake requirements per kg (e.g., 60–80 mL/kg on day 1, increasing incrementally).  
- **Clinical Monitoring:** If concerns arise (e.g., sepsis risk), consider septic screening (SBR, glucose, U&E).  
- **Discharge Criteria:** Weight gain must exceed **20g/day** before discharge, with follow-up by Health Visitors.  
- **Documentation & Audit:** All feeds must be recorded, and maternity notes audited for readmissions related to weight loss or feeding issues.  

Supplementation should be reduced once breastfeeding is established, weight increases, and metabolic profiles normalize. Continuous assessment and community follow-up are essential.
