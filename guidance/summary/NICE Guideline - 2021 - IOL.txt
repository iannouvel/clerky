The NICE guideline on inducing labor covers the circumstances, methods, assessment, monitoring, pain relief, and complications of labor induction to improve care for pregnant women. Recommendations include discussing birth preferences early, offering expectant management for uncomplicated pregnancies, and considering individual circumstances and risks. The guideline addresses specific scenarios such as preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, breech position, and fetal growth restriction. Monitoring fetal wellbeing and managing complications like hyperstimulation are crucial during induction. Research recommendations focus on optimal timing and management of preterm rupture of membranes. The guideline aims to provide information and support for informed decision-making in labor induction.
