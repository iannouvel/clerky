The NICE guideline on inducing labor provides recommendations for healthcare professionals and pregnant women regarding the circumstances, methods, assessment, monitoring, pain relief, and management of complications related to labor induction. Key recommendations include discussing birth preferences early in pregnancy, offering induction for specific circumstances like post-term pregnancy or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, monitoring uterine activity and fetal well-being, providing pain relief options, and managing complications like hyperstimulation or unsuccessful induction. The guideline emphasizes shared decision-making, individualized care, and regular monitoring during the induction process. It also highlights the importance of considering factors such as fetal well-being, maternal preferences, and previous obstetric history when determining the most appropriate method of induction. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to provide information and support to help pregnant women make informed decisions about labor induction.
