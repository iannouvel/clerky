Clinical guidance for inducing labor includes discussing birth preferences early in pregnancy; offering expectant management until 37+0 weeks for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes; considering risks and individual circumstances for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes after 34+0 weeks but before 37+0 weeks; immediate induction for term prelabor rupture of membranes with positive group B streptococcus test; offering expectant management for up to 24 hours for term prelabor rupture of membranes; discussing induction methods with women who had previous cesarean birth; not generally recommending induction for breech position babies; monitoring uterine activity and fetal condition regularly; stopping induction if hyperstimulation occurs; considering Bishop score for induction options; offering amniotomy and oxytocin infusion for Bishop score of more than 6; managing complications like uterine hyperstimulation and cord prolapse; auditing mothers and babies to reduce risks; and providing further research on optimal timing of induction and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Contraindications include fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise and breech position with declined external cephalic version. Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation than pharmacological methods, and hyperstimulation can be treated with tocolysis. Women with intrauterine fetal death should be cared for one-to-one and monitored, especially those with scarred uterus at increased risk of uterine rupture. Mechanical methods may be safe for women with previous cesarean birth. Interventions depend on cervical readiness and include dinoprostone, misoprostol, and mechanical methods to support decision-making and provide guidance on labor induction.
