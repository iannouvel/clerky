### **Clinical Guideline Summary: Division of Tongue Tie (Ankyloglossia)**  

This guideline supports staff managing infants with ankyloglossia (tongue tie) causing breastfeeding or bottle-feeding difficulties. It applies to midwives, neonatal staff, and maternity support workers.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Assessment:** A full breastfeeding assessment must precede tongue tie evaluation, ensuring proper positioning and attachment.  
- **Symptoms:** Poor latch, maternal nipple pain, mastitis, and infant weight gain issues may indicate tongue tie.  
- **Referral:** Only refer to the Tongue Tie Clinic for confirmed feeding-related concerns.  

**Procedure:**  
- **Pre-Division:** Assess using the Tongue Tie Assessment and Division Clinic form and Frenulotomy Safety Checklist. Document breastfeeding history, tongue function, and ensure vitamin K administration.  
- **Contraindications:** Thick frenulum or visible blood vessels require specialist referral.  
- **Consent:** Explain risks, obtain consent, and address parental questions.  

**Division Process:**  
- Performed in a clinical setting with emergency access, lighting, and privacy.  
- No anesthesia needed; apply pressure to control bleeding.

**Post-Procedure Care:**  
- Provide parents with an information leaflet and follow-up plan.  
- Document in the infantâ€™s records.
