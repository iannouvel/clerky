The clinical guideline for antenatal care emphasizes the importance of regular check-ups, information, and support for pregnant women. Healthcare professionals should involve women in decision-making and provide necessary information in a clear and supportive manner. Antenatal care should start early and be tailored to individual needs, with appointments scheduled to involve partners and provide additional support as needed. The guideline addresses inequalities in care, risk factors for complications, and offers recommendations for common pregnancy issues such as nausea, heartburn, and pelvic girdle pain. The guideline also highlights the importance of fetal movement awareness, birth preferences, and peer support during pregnancy.
