### **Summary of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy Guideline**  

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome, pose significant maternal and fetal risks.  

**Key Definitions:**  
- **Chronic hypertension:** Present before 20 weeks.  
- **Gestational hypertension:** New hypertension after 20 weeks without proteinuria.  
- **Pre-eclampsia:** New hypertension after 20 weeks with significant proteinuria.  
- **Severe pre-eclampsia:** Pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension (≥160/110 mmHg) or symptoms.  
- **Eclampsia:** Seizures due to pre-eclampsia.  
- **HELLP syndrome:** Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets.  

**Risk Factors:**  
- **Moderate risk:** Age ≥40, nulliparity, BMI ≥35, family history.  
- **High risk:** Chronic hypertension, prior pre-eclampsia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease.  

**Management:**  
- **High-risk women:** Monitor BP and urinalysis every 2 weeks from 28 weeks; consider uterine artery Dopplers and serial ultrasounds.  
- **Chronic hypertension:** Continue safe antihypertensives (Labetalol, Nifedipine, Methyldopa); target BP ≤135/85 mmHg.  
- **Gestational hypertension:** Monitor BP; treat pharmacologically if persistent. Avoid delivery before 37 weeks unless severe.  
- **Pre-eclampsia:** First-line treatment with Labetalol; admit if severe. Plan delivery based on gestational age and severity.  

**Intrapartum & Postnatal Care:**  
- Monitor BP closely during labor.  
- Continue antihypertensives postpartum; arrange follow-up with GP or obstetrician.  

**Recurrence Risk:**  
- ~20% for any hypertensive disorder in future pregnancies.  
- ~14% for pre-eclampsia recurrence.  

Prompt recognition and management are essential to reduce maternal and fetal complications.
