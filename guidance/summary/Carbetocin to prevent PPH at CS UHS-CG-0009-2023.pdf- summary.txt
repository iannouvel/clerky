This clinical guideline outlines the use of Carbetocin to prevent postpartum hemorrhage in caesarean births. It is recommended for use in specialist obstetric units by experienced staff and should be offered to all patients undergoing caesarean birth unless contraindicated. The document details responsibilities of the medical team and provides instructions on administration, dosage, contraindications, and cautions for use. Carbetocin should only be given after the birth of the baby and as soon as possible after umbilical cord clamping. Monitoring for adverse effects and compliance with guidelines is essential. If uterine tone remains inadequate after administration, a second-line agent should be considered.
