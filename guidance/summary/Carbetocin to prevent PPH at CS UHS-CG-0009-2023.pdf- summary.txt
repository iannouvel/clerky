Carbetocin is recommended for preventing postpartum hemorrhage in caesarean births, to be administered by experienced staff in specialist obstetric units. The drug should be given after the baby is born and as soon as possible after umbilical cord clamping, with a dose of 100 micrograms diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride over 1 minute. Contraindications include certain medical conditions, while cautions are advised for others. If uterine tone remains inadequate after administration, a second line agent should be considered. Carbetocin has a long elimination half-life and should not be used before birth due to its lasting effects. Monitoring for adverse effects and compliance with guidelines is essential.
