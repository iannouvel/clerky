### **Acute Gynaecological Assessment Summary**  

This proforma standardizes the evaluation of acute gynaecological presentations, including bleeding, pain, and suspected pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ectopic pregnancy.  

#### **Key Components:**  
- **History:** Detailed menstrual, obstetric, sexual, and contraceptive history, including bleeding patterns, dyspareunia, and STI risk factors.  
- **Pregnancy Status:** Confirmation via urine hCG, last menstrual period (LMP), and gestational age estimation.  
- **Clinical Exam:** Vital signs, NEWS score, abdominal/pelvic assessment, and McCormack Score for PID severity.  
- **Investigations:**  
  - Bloods (FBC, hCG, CRP, clotting, group & save).  
  - Pelvic/abdominal ultrasound (USS) for ectopic risk assessment.  
  - STI screening (NAAT swabs, HVS).  
  - Urinalysis and additional imaging if indicated.  

#### **Management:**  
- **Ectopic Pregnancy:** Assess risk factors (prior ectopic, tubal surgery, PID), monitor hCG trends, and consider surgical intervention if unstable.  
- **PID Treatment:**  
  - **Outpatient:** Ceftriaxone IM + doxycycline + metronidazole (14 days).  
  - **Inpatient:** IV ceftriaxone + IV/oral doxycycline/metronidazole (switch to oral after 48h if improving).  
  - **Penicillin allergy:** Adjust regimen (clarithromycin if pregnant).  
- **Anti-D Prophylaxis:** Administer if RhD-negative with bleeding in pregnancy.  

#### **Follow-Up:**  
- Document patient counseling, leaflets provided, and consent for treatment.  
- Nursing reviews, drug administration records, and fluid management for admitted patients.  

This structured approach ensures timely diagnosis and management of acute gynaecological conditions.
