The clinical guideline for newborn feeding at Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust emphasizes promoting breastfeeding and safe feeding practices to support optimal health for mothers and newborns. Key recommendations include providing education and support for breastfeeding mothers, promoting exclusive breastfeeding, monitoring newborns for signs of effective feeding and hypoglycemia, and managing excessive weight loss in breastfed newborns. The guideline outlines protocols for assessing feeding difficulties, supplementation, and managing tongue tie through frenulotomy if necessary. It stresses the importance of skin-to-skin contact, responsive feeding, and avoiding artificial milk substitutes unless medically indicated. The guideline aims to increase breastfeeding initiation rates, improve outcomes for children and families, and ensure staff understand their roles in supporting breastfeeding and safe feeding practices.
