The clinical guideline outlines the standard operating procedure for in-patient maternity observations and monitoring at UH Sussex. It involves using the MEOWS chart for monitoring pregnant or newly birthed individuals. Key recommendations include assigning responsibilities to different staff members, ensuring proper training on equipment, and feedback mechanisms for deficiencies. Baseline vital signs must be recorded on admission, and MEOWS scores should be calculated and acted upon as per the escalation table. The frequency of observations should follow a flowchart, with adjustments based on clinical need, MEOWS scores, and obstetric plans. It emphasizes using the carotid artery if the radial pulse is absent, assessing consciousness levels, proper temperature measurement, and criteria for calling emergency teams based on specific criteria.
