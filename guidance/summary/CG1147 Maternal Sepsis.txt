The clinical guideline focuses on preventing and managing sepsis in pregnant individuals to improve outcomes for both the mother and baby. Key recommendations include prompt recognition of sepsis, early administration of antibiotics, involvement of experts, and close monitoring of high-risk groups. Sepsis can be challenging to diagnose, with non-specific symptoms, and may arise from various sources. Management involves urgent transfer to the hospital, oxygen therapy, blood cultures, intravenous antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring. High-risk sepsis requires immediate action, while moderate-risk cases need further evaluation and management. Tools for screening, triage, and antibiotic treatment are provided, along with a neonatal referral pathway for babies with jaundice or feeding concerns. Collaboration with senior colleagues and experts is recommended for clinical guidance, ensuring fairness, respect, equality, dignity, and autonomy in implementation.
