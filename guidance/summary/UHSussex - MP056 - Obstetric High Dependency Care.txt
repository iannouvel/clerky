The Obstetric High Dependency Care clinical guideline outlines the management of women requiring high dependency care during pregnancy. It categorizes care levels into 0 to 3 based on the severity of the condition. The guideline emphasizes the need for clear documentation, one-to-one nursing care, and involvement of specialist clinicians when necessary. It provides guidance on transferring women to High Dependency Units (HDU) or Intensive Care Units (ITU) within maternity services, as well as outside maternity services. Specific equipment requirements, roles and responsibilities of staff, and criteria for discharge from HDU/ITU are detailed. The protocol highlights the importance of professional judgment in applying the recommendations and the need for regular review in line with Trust and National recommendations. Staff are required to access, understand, and follow the guidance, using their professional judgment when necessary.
