Antenatal corticosteroids are crucial in reducing perinatal and neonatal death, as well as respiratory distress syndrome, when given within seven days prior to preterm birth. They should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation with imminent preterm birth anticipated, including those with twins and triplets. For planned caesarean births between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, a discussion about corticosteroids' risks and benefits is advised. Corticosteroids are effective within 48 hours before birth, with benefits even within 24 hours. Late preterm births (35+0 to 36+6 weeks) should consider corticosteroids, but risks like neonatal hypoglycemia must be weighed. Women with diabetes can receive corticosteroids with additional monitoring. Corticosteroids should not delay birth if necessary for the mother or baby's health. Limited evidence supports repeated corticosteroid courses, with a maximum of three courses, and caution is advised in systemic infections. Future research should focus on effectiveness in various conditions and potential off-target effects.
