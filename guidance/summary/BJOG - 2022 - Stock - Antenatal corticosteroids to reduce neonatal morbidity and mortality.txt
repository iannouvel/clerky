Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation anticipating preterm birth, including those with twins or triplets, and in cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. For planned caesarean births between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks, a discussion about corticosteroids is recommended. Consideration for corticosteroids is advised for women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks. In multiple pregnancies, targeted corticosteroids may be considered, with caution in late preterm births. Women with diabetes should not be excluded, but close monitoring and additional insulin are recommended. Repeat courses of corticosteroids may be considered if imminent preterm birth persists after seven days. The recommended dose is 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate intramuscularly. Corticosteroids are most effective within 48 hours prior to birth, with benefits seen within 24 hours. Caution is advised in late preterm births and in the presence of fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage. Antenatal corticosteroids may have risks including neonatal hypoglycemia, maternal blood glucose effects, and long-term consequences. Avoid delays in serious maternal or fetal conditions, and balance their use in systemic infections. Limit corticosteroid courses to three in pregnancy and consider future research on their effectiveness and safety in various conditions.
