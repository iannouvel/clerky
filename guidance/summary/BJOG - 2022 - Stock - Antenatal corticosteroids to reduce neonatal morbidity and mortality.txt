Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation in whom imminent preterm birth is anticipated
- Women with twins and triplets should also be offered corticosteroids
- Corticosteroids reduce neonatal death when given within 48 hours prior to birth
- Women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation may consider corticosteroids
- Corticosteroids in late preterm birth should be carefully evaluated for risks and benefits
- Women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes should be offered corticosteroids
- Corticosteroids may be considered in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, or antepartum hemorrhage
- Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)

Treatment and Management:
- Consider offering antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth between 35+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation
- Administer 24mg dexamethasone phosphate or 24 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/acetate mix intramuscularly
- Repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids may be considered in women at imminent risk of preterm birth seven days after initial administration
- Maximum of three corticosteroid courses in pregnancy
- Use corticosteroids cautiously in the presence of systemic infection

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor maternal blood glucose levels in women with diabetes receiving corticosteroids
- Close monitoring is recommended for women with diabetes receiving corticosteroids
- Monitor for neonatal hypoglycemia in infants exposed to corticosteroids
- Monitor for potential risks to both women and babies, including effects on fetal growth and maternal blood glucose levels

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Birth should not be delayed for corticosteroids if it impacts the health of the woman or baby
- Caution advised in interpreting data due to limitations in subgroup analyses
- Balance the use of corticosteroids carefully in the presence of systemic infection
- Repeat courses of corticosteroids may not reduce serious morbidity but can lead to smaller babies
- Research needed to determine effectiveness and potential off-target effects of corticosteroids
