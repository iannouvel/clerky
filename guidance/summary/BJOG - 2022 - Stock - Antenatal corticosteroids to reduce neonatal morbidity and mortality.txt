Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended for women at risk of preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, and other adverse outcomes. They should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks' gestation, including those with twins and triplets. Corticosteroids should not be delayed if birth is necessary for the health of the woman or baby. Careful consideration is needed for the use of corticosteroids in late preterm births, multiple pregnancies, diabetes, and other special populations. Research is ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of corticosteroids in various conditions, with recommendations for future studies provided.
