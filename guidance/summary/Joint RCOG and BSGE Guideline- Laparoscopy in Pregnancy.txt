The guideline recommends laparoscopic management by experienced laparoscopists for non-obstetric abdominal conditions in pregnancy like acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. Laparoscopy is safe for both mother and fetus, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. Factors influencing surgical approach include expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference. Maternal risks include potential vascular and organ trauma, necessitating careful anaesthetic management and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is typically recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Surgery can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation, with multidisciplinary team management. Intraoperative monitoring may be necessary, and caution is advised in steroid administration for maternal sepsis. Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended, with gas insufflation pressures of 12 mmHg. Laparoscopic appendectomy has a higher risk of spontaneous miscarriage, especially in the first trimester. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cystectomy offer benefits like faster recovery and fewer complications. Adnexal masses can be safely managed laparoscopically by trained professionals, with the choice of approach based on local expertise and circumstances. Adnexal torsion requires cystectomy and ovarian fixation to prevent recurrence. More high-grade evidence is needed, and national databases may aid in research due to challenges in conducting trials for these conditions.
