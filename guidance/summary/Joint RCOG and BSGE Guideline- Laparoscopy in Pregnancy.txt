Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Non-obstetric abdominal conditions in pregnancy include acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors
- Laparoscopic appendectomy in pregnancy associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous miscarriage compared to open appendectomy, especially in the first trimester
- Maternal risks of laparoscopy include potential vascular and organ trauma

Treatment and Management:
- Laparoscopic surgery is a viable option in pregnancy when performed by skilled professionals
- General anesthesia is recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy
- Surgery can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation if necessary
- Antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium may be used if preterm delivery is a risk
- Ports should be placed based on uterine size and location of pathology
- Pneumoperitoneum pressures below 12 mmHg are safe for the fetus
- Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended for gas insufflation in laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy
- Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process
- Timely surgical intervention is preferable in suspected appendicitis in pregnancy

Monitoring Requirements:
- Fetal monitoring may be done before and after surgery
- Routine intraoperative fetal monitoring is not always necessary
- Intraoperative monitoring may be needed in selected cases

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Caution is needed in steroid administration for maternal sepsis
- Delay in surgery for appendicitis can lead to increased complications
- Laparoscopic management of non-obstetric emergencies in pregnancy should be performed by experienced laparoscopists
- Surgeons with experience in laparoscopy have better outcomes
