The clinical guideline focuses on the laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. It highlights the importance of experienced laparoscopists to ensure maternal and fetal safety, as studies have shown that laparoscopy is safe with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. Factors such as expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference should be considered when choosing the type of surgery. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally good for laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy, with skilled surgeons having better outcomes. Urgent surgery should not be delayed, and both laparoscopic and open surgery are acceptable options.
