The clinical guideline focuses on the laparoscopic management of non-obstetric abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and adnexal tumors. It underscores the safety of laparoscopy for both the mother and fetus when performed by experienced professionals. Laparoscopic surgery offers advantages like faster recovery and lower infection rates. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally good, and surgery can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation if necessary. Surgeons should be skilled in laparoscopy to reduce complications, and a multidisciplinary team should manage pregnant women needing surgery. Factors like expertise, gestation, and patient preference should guide the choice between laparoscopic and open surgery. Intraoperative monitoring and careful anesthesia management are crucial. The guideline emphasizes the importance of timely surgical intervention for conditions like appendicitis to prevent complications. More high-quality evidence is needed, and national databases could aid in research due to challenges in conducting randomized trials for these conditions.
