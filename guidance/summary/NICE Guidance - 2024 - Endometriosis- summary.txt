The NICE clinical guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management emphasizes the importance of setting up a managed clinical network for women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis and providing information and support tailored to individual needs. It recommends considering referral to specialist services for diagnosis and treatment, including laparoscopy for diagnosis and excision or ablation for treatment. The guideline also suggests discussing surgical management options with women prioritizing fertility and considering lifestyle interventions, alternative treatment options, and the impact of hormonal treatments on fertility outcomes. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions in improving symptoms and quality of life for women with endometriosis.
