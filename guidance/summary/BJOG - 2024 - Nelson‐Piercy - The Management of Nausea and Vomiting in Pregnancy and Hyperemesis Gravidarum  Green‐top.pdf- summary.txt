The clinical guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). It includes tools like the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and HyperEmesis Level Prediction (HELP) to assess severity. First line antiemetics such as antihistamines, phenothiazines, and doxylamine/pyridoxine are recommended, with ondansetron as a second line option. Metoclopramide can be used alone or in combination with other antiemetics. The guideline emphasizes the importance of trying all therapeutic measures before considering termination of pregnancy. It also addresses the impact of NVP and HG on mental health, quality of life, and provides guidance on nutritional support and psychosocial care.
