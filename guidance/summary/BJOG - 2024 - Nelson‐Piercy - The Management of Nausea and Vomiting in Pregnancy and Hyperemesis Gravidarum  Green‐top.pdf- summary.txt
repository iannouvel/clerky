The clinical guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for managing Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). It emphasizes the use of objective tools like the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and HyperEmesis Level Prediction (HELP) to classify severity. First-line antiemetics such as antihistamines, phenothiazines, and doxylamine/pyridoxine are recommended, with ondansetron as a second-line option. Metoclopramide can be used alone or in combination with other antiemetics. The guideline also addresses hydration, thiamine supplementation, and the importance of trying all therapeutic measures before considering termination of pregnancy. It provides evidence-based information for managing NVP and HG across different care settings.
