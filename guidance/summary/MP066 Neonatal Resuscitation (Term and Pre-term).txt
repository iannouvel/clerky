The clinical guideline outlines protocols for neonatal resuscitation in newborns requiring assistance at birth, especially those born with meconium-stained liquor. Maternity, neonatal, and A&E staff are responsible for following the guidance. Resuscitation is initiated when breathing or circulation is suboptimal. Adequate preparation, equipment, and a warm environment are crucial for successful resuscitation. Midwives at home births should be competent in neonatal resuscitation. Specific steps are outlined for assessing and supporting the baby's breathing and circulation. Continuous reassessment is essential. Transfer non-responsive babies promptly while maintaining a clear airway. Consider therapeutic hypothermia for moderate to severe cases of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Avoid suctioning vigorous babies born in meconium-stained liquor. Preterm babies require careful oxygen management and immediate wrapping for those less than 30 weeks gestation. Regular staff training, updates, and skills drills are emphasized for all involved in deliveries and resuscitation.
