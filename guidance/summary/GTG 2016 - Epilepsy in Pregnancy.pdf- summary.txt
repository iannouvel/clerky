This clinical guideline on epilepsy in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of diagnosis, preconception counseling, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum management, as well as contraception for women with epilepsy (WWE). It highlights the need for collaboration between healthcare providers to ensure optimal care for both the mother and the baby. The guideline recommends folic acid supplementation, careful consideration of antiepileptic drug (AED) choice, and monitoring of neonates for adverse effects of AED exposure. It also addresses the impact of AEDs on breastfeeding and the importance of informing WWE about driving entitlements and disability legislation. Future research recommendations include studying the long-term effects of AED exposure on offspring and optimizing monitoring strategies for pregnant WWE.
