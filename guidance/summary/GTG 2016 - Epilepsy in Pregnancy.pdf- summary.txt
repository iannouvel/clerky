This clinical guideline on epilepsy in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis, preconception counseling, and management throughout pregnancy and postpartum. It highlights the need for specialized care by a neurologist, consideration of different types of epilepsy, and awareness of potential differential diagnoses. Prepregnancy counseling should address antiepileptic drug (AED) choice, folic acid supplementation, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care should involve close monitoring, seizure management, and AED continuation. Contraception counseling, breastfeeding guidance, and information on driving entitlements and disability legislation are also provided. The guideline aims to optimize care and outcomes for pregnant women with epilepsy.
