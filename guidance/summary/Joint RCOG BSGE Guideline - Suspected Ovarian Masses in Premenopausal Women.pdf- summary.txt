This guideline provides guidance on managing suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women, emphasizing the importance of referral to a gynaecological oncologist if malignancy is suspected. Most masses are benign, and conservative management is often possible, with laparoscopic surgery recommended for benign masses. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, and risk of malignancy can be estimated using the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI). Follow-up for simple cysts varies based on size and persistence. Laparoscopic surgery by experienced surgeons is preferred for elective management, with avoidance of cyst spillage. Various diagnostic tools and models are discussed for accurate preoperative diagnosis of ovarian masses.
