This guideline provides guidance on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. Most masses are benign, and laparoscopic surgery is recommended for benign masses. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised if malignancy is suspected. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, and risk of malignancy can be estimated using the Risk of Malignancy Index. Follow-up for simple ovarian cysts varies based on size and persistence. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred for elective management of benign masses, and careful consideration should be given to the decision to perform an oophorectomy. The guideline also covers topics such as tumor vascularity assessment, differential diagnosis, and risk of malignancy indices.
