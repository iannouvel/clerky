This guideline provides guidance on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It emphasizes the importance of referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspected or confirmed borderline ovarian tumours. Ultrasound is the preferred method for evaluating ovarian masses, with CA-125 not reliable for premenopausal women. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended for benign masses, with yearly ultrasound follow-up for simple cysts. The guideline also highlights the importance of experienced surgeons for laparoscopic management and suggests audit topics for monitoring postoperative outcomes. Other studies and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of ovarian masses are referenced for further information.
