### **Summary of PCEA in Labor Guideline**  

This guideline outlines best practices for managing **patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA)** in labor, emphasizing safety, mobility, and patient satisfaction. Key recommendations include:  

- **PCEA Benefits:** Reduces total local anesthetic dose, minimizes motor block, and improves patient satisfaction. A **mandatory hourly epidural bolus** may enhance effectiveness.  
- **Medication:** Preferred agents are **dilute levobupivacaine and fentanyl** for "mobile epidurals."  
- **Monitoring & Care:**  
  - **1:1 midwife care** is required for women receiving epidural analgesia.  
  - Avoid supine positioning (use a wedge even for vaginal exams).  
  - Encourage mobility where possible, with support due to potential sensory/motor impairment.  
  - **Peanut balls** may reduce labor duration and cesarean risk.  
  - Monitor for **pressure area damage** due to reduced sensation.  
- **Second Stage Management:** Delay pushing for **â‰¥1 hour** after full cervical dilation.  
- **Red Flags:** Call an anesthetist for inadequate analgesia, motor weakness, hypotension, severe headache, or itching.  
- **Postpartum Care:** Remove epidural catheter and monitor for complications (e.g., headache, backache, sensory changes).  

**Updates (2024):**  
- **Pre-procedure:** Double chlorhexidine skin prep before epidural insertion.  
- **Documentation:** Yellow band noting last dose and straight leg raise assessment.  
- **Postnatal follow-up:** Enhanced surveillance for epidural-related concerns.  

This guideline ensures safe, effective PCEA use while optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes.
