This clinical guideline focuses on the diagnosis and management of uterine rupture during pregnancy and labor. Uterine rupture is a rare but serious complication with risk factors including previous cesarean birth and high parity. Key clinical points include recognizing warning signs like prolonged, strong contractions, poor labor progress, maternal pain and pyrexia, fetal compromise, and sudden cessation of uterine activity. Immediate surgical intervention is crucial upon suspicion of rupture to reduce morbidity and mortality. Communication, teamwork, and postoperative care are emphasized, including involving theater staff, pediatricians, and monitoring in the Recovery or Critical Care Unit. Women with a past uterine rupture should opt for elective cesarean births in subsequent pregnancies. Monitoring and auditing of uterine rupture cases are vital for quality improvement in patient care.
