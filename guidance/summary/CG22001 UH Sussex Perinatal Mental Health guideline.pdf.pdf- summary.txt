The UH Sussex Perinatal Mental Health Guideline provides detailed guidance for healthcare providers on detecting and managing mental health issues in pregnant individuals and women during the perinatal period. It emphasizes the importance of early identification and management of mental health problems, as they are a leading cause of maternal death during this time. The guideline includes recommendations for referral pathways, medication management, and the involvement of specialist mental health services. It also highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of maternal mental health and provides resources for healthcare professionals to access for further information and support. The guideline aims to improve outcomes for individuals experiencing perinatal mental health issues through evidence-based practice and multidisciplinary collaboration.
