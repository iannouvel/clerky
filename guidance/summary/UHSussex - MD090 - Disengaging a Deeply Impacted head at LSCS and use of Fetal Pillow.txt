The clinical guideline focuses on the disengagement of a deeply impacted fetal head during a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) using a Fetal Pillow. The Fetal Pillow, a soft silicone balloon, is inserted into the vagina before LSCS to elevate the fetal head in cephalic presentation. It is recommended as the first-line action for disengaging a deeply impacted fetal head. If the head remains impacted, a reverse breech extraction technique can be considered. Indications for Fetal Pillow use include failed instrumental delivery, full dilatation cesarean with the fetal head at or below the ischial spines, and severe caput or molding. Proper operator training is essential, and various assessments before and during the procedure are crucial. Documentation of key parameters such as delivery difficulty, Apgar score, injuries, blood loss, and other outcomes is emphasized. The guideline aims to improve clinical practice based on current evidence and best practices.
