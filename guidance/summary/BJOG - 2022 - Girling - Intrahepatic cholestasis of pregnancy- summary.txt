The clinical guideline for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) recommends considering a diagnosis in pregnant women with itching and bile acid concentrations of 19 micromol/L or higher. Additional investigations are not routinely recommended unless specific conditions are present, and severe or atypical cases should be discussed with a hepatologist. Postnatal confirmation of the diagnosis is advised, with the risk of stillbirth increasing with peak bile acid levels. Twin pregnancies with ICP have a higher risk of stillbirth, and ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth. No treatments have been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes, and ursodeoxycholic acid should not be routinely offered for reducing adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP. Monitoring, individualized based on symptoms, bile acid levels, and gestational age, is recommended, with consideration of planned birth based on bile acid levels and other risk factors. Women with ICP should be informed of the potential for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies
