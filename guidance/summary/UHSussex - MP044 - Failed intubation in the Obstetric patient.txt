The clinical guideline addresses failed intubation in obstetric patients undergoing general anesthesia in the peri-partum period. It emphasizes the need for a protocol with measurable standards and the use of professional judgment in its application. The responsibility lies with anaesthetists, midwives, and obstetricians to follow the guidance and utilize their expertise. Key considerations include physiological changes in pregnancy, the importance of maternal and fetal well-being, and human factors affecting practice. An algorithmic approach is recommended for managing difficult airways in pregnant patients, with specific algorithms provided by OAA/DAS for unanticipated difficult airways. The guideline aims to ensure safe and effective management of failed intubation in obstetric patients.
