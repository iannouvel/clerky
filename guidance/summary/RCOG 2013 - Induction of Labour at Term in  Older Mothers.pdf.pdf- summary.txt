The clinical guideline on the induction of labour at term in older mothers highlights the increased risks for both mother and baby associated with advanced maternal age. The guideline suggests offering induction of labour earlier in older mothers to reduce the risk of stillbirth, as stillbirth rates increase with maternal age, especially in women aged 40 years and older. Induction of labour at 39-40 weeks of gestation may help prevent late stillbirths and maternal risks associated with ongoing pregnancy. However, there is a need for further research on the effects of induction of labour in older mothers, particularly on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality.
