Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) Management:
- Initial assessment: thorough history, physical exam, bladder diary, and UTI testing
- Diagnostic criteria: validated symptom scores, exclusion of other conditions
- Management: dietary modifications, stress management, analgesia, intravesical treatments if needed
- Monitoring: symptom scores, response to treatment
- Contraindications: avoid certain medications and procedures in pregnancy
- Quantitative values: symptom scores, medication dosages

Pelvic Pain Investigation:
- Assessment: history of abuse, physical exam ruling out specific conditions
- Diagnostic criteria: exclusion of other causes, baseline investigations
- Management: conservative treatments, pharmacological options, multimodal therapy
- Monitoring: response to treatment, multidisciplinary input
- Contraindications: avoid specific medications and procedures
- Quantitative values: symptom scores, medication dosages

Pregnancy and BPS:
- Treatment options: safe medications like oral amitriptyline, intravesical heparin
- Monitoring: symptom changes during pregnancy, genetic predisposition
- Contraindications: avoid DMSO, consider safety of medications during pregnancy
- Quantitative values: medication dosages, symptom severity assessments
