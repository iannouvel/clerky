Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Initial assessment includes thorough medical history, physical examination, completion of a bladder diary, and testing for urinary tract infections
- Severity of Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) can be classified using validated symptom scores and visual analogue scales for pain
- Differential diagnoses should be considered; BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion
- Pelvic pain investigation includes ruling out bladder distension, hernias, and trigger points
- Baseline investigations include bladder diary, food diary, and urine tests

Treatment and Management:
- Initial management may include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia
- Conservative treatments for BPS include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia
- Pharmacological treatments may include oral amitriptyline or cimetidine
- Intravesical treatments like lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, and dimethyl sulfoxide may be considered if conservative and oral treatments fail
- Multimodal therapy by consultants with special expertise may be considered if single drugs are unsuccessful
- Further treatment options such as cystoscopic fulguration, neuromodulation, oral cyclosporin A, cystoscopy, and major surgery should be considered after referral to a pain clinic and multidisciplinary team meeting
- Treatments not recommended include oral hydroxyzine, oral pentosan polysulfate, long-term antibiotics, intravesical resiniferatoxin, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin, high-pressure long-duration hydrodistension, and long-term oral glucocorticoids

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor response to treatment interventions
- Periodic follow-up in secondary care until symptoms are controlled
- Consider shared care between pain team and urogynaecology

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis
- Avoid DMSO in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects
- Lidocaine crosses the placenta, and corticosteroids may have long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis
- Sacral nerve stimulators should be turned off during pregnancy
