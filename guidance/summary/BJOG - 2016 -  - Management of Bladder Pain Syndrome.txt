The clinical guideline for managing Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) emphasizes a comprehensive initial assessment including medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Conservative treatments like dietary modifications and stress management are recommended initially, followed by pharmacological options if needed. Intravesical treatments can be considered if conservative measures fail. Referral to secondary care and multidisciplinary team discussions are advised for patients not responding to initial treatments. Physiotherapy and psychological support are beneficial for refractory cases. Long-term follow-up may be necessary until symptoms are controlled. Safe treatment options in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin. Avoiding certain treatments during pregnancy is crucial. Multimodal therapy may be considered if single drugs are ineffective, with individualized treatment plans based on clinical expertise. Regular follow-ups and support groups are recommended for ongoing management. Areas for future research include standardized assessment tools and the role of conservative treatments in BPS.
