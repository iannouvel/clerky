The clinical guideline on cervical cerclage recommends offering history-indicated cerclage to women with three or more previous preterm births and ultrasound-indicated cerclage to those with a short cervix of 25mm or less before 24 weeks. It highlights the importance of individualized decision-making, caution in interpreting results due to limited data, and informed consent regarding potential complications. The guideline emphasizes the need for further research on combination therapies and the role of cerclage in women with cervical damage. Recommendations include removal of cerclage before labor, consideration of perioperative interventions, and the choice of suture material and technique at the surgeon's discretion.
