The clinical guideline on assisted vaginal birth provides evidence-based recommendations on the use of forceps and vacuum extraction for both rotational and non-rotational assisted vaginal births. Operators should select the most suitable instrument for a successful first attempt, considering the benefits and risks of each. Factors influencing the success of assisted birth include fetal and maternal factors, contraindications, and instrument selection. Timing considerations in the second stage of labor are crucial.

Key points include ultrasound assessment for fetal head position uncertainty, antibiotic administration post-birth, and monitoring for complications. Postnatal care should address bladder care, thromboprophylaxis, and pain management. Referral to a midwife counselor for support post-assisted birth is recommended. Maternity units should offer a safe and supportive environment for women, families, and staff during adverse events, with adherence to duty of candour and incident reporting. Compliance with auditable standards is essential for quality care.
