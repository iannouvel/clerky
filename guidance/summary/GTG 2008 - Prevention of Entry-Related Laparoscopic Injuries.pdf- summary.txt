RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, which can occur during blind insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae. The guideline highlights strategies to improve safety during laparoscopic entry, aiming to reduce serious complications that occur in about one in 1000 cases. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques, familiar with equipment, and ensure proper training for staff involved in the procedure. Optimizing primary trocar or Veress needle insertion, alternative entry techniques, and appropriate site selection are key recommendations to prevent complications. Overall, proper training, equipment use, and entry techniques are crucial in preventing gynaecological laparoscopic injuries.
