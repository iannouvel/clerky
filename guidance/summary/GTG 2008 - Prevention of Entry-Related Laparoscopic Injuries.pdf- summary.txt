RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, which can occur during the insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae. Complications from laparoscopic surgery can range from 1.0/1000 to 12.5/1000 cases, with major issues including intestinal, urological, and vascular injuries. The guideline emphasizes the importance of safe entry techniques, proper training for surgeons and staff, and the use of appropriate equipment. Alternative entry sites and techniques are also discussed to minimize risks, with recommendations for obese and thin patients. Overall, optimizing entry techniques is crucial in reducing complications during laparoscopic procedures.
