RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, which can occur during blind insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae. Complications from laparoscopic surgery are not uncommon, with major risks including bowel, urological, and vascular injuries. The guideline emphasizes the importance of proper training, equipment use, and informed consent for women undergoing laparoscopic procedures. Techniques for safe entry include closed (Veress needle) and open (Hasson) methods, with recommendations for alternative sites like Palmer's point in specific cases. Overall, optimizing entry techniques and ensuring proper training are crucial in reducing complications during laparoscopic surgery.
