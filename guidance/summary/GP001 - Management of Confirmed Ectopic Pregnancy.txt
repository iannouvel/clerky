**Summary of Ectopic Pregnancy Management Guidelines**  

Ectopic pregnancy, occurring outside the endometrial cavity, presents with pain, bleeding, or dizziness. Risk factors include prior pelvic surgery and smoking. Management depends on stability and hCG levels, with options including expectant, medical, or surgical approaches.  

**Expectant Management:** Suitable for stable women with declining hCG levels, requiring regular hCG monitoring and ultrasound follow-up.  

**Medical Management:** Methotrexate is an option for clinically stable women meeting specific criteria, with strict dosing and monitoring protocols.  

**Surgical Management:** Laparoscopy is preferred, with salpingectomy or salpingotomy based on patient factors.  

**Anti-D Prophylaxis:** Administer to rhesus-negative women post-surgery but not for medical management alone. Avoid Kleihauer testing.  

**Follow-Up & Counseling:** Weekly hCG monitoring until negative, with safety-netting for emergency surgery. Persistent trophoblast may require further medical or surgical intervention. Provide patient debriefing, emergency contacts, and early pregnancy clinic referral advice for future pregnancies. Document follow-up plans clearly. Clinical judgment should prioritize patient well-being over hCG trends.
