**Summary of DNA Appointments (RSCH PRH only) MP017**  

This protocol outlines the management of women and pregnant individuals who miss antenatal or postnatal appointments (DNAâ€”Did Not Attend). Non-attendance increases risks of maternal and fetal complications, requiring proactive follow-up.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Vulnerable Groups:** Identify and refer high-risk individuals to multidisciplinary teams for tailored support.  
- **Individual Care Plans:** Develop flexible plans at booking to improve engagement.  
- **Follow-Up Process:** Staff must actively track missed appointments in community clinics, hospital settings, and scans.  
- **Staff Responsibilities:** Midwives, clinic leads, and managers ensure timely follow-up after each missed appointment.  
- **Three-Missed-Appointment Rule:** After three DNAs, escalate to the team leader for audit and further action.  

**Critical Actions:**  
- Ultrasonographers report missed scans to clinic leads.  
- Document all actions taken in maternal notes.  
- Submit audit copies after three DNAs to monitor compliance.  

The protocol emphasizes structured follow-up to reduce risks associated with missed care, ensuring accountability across maternity services.
