The NICE guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management provides recommendations for healthcare professionals to effectively care for patients with this condition. It emphasizes individualized care based on symptoms, preferences, and priorities rather than solely on the stage of endometriosis. The guideline covers various aspects, including organization of care, information and support, diagnosis, pain management, surgical options, and fertility considerations. Additionally, it highlights the need for further research on alternative treatment options, the effectiveness of laparoscopic treatment for peritoneal endometriosis, lifestyle interventions, information and support interventions, and hormonal treatments' impact on fertility outcomes.
