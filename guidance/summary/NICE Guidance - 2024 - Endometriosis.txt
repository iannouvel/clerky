The NICE guideline on endometriosis diagnosis and management covers various aspects of care. Key recommendations include assessing deep endometriosis extent, interpreting MRI scans by a specialist, considering laparoscopy for diagnosis even with normal ultrasound, offering treatment based on symptoms rather than stage, and discussing surgical options with patients. Management may involve hormonal or surgical treatment, with excision preferred over ablation for endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended for endometriosis, especially in cases involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter. Hormonal treatment alone is not advised for women trying to conceive. Research recommendations include exploring pain management programs, assessing the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions, and determining optimal hormonal treatment doses for fertility outcomes in endometriosis patients prioritizing fertility. The guideline emphasizes the impact of endometriosis on quality of life and the need for tailored information and support interventions for patients and their partners.
