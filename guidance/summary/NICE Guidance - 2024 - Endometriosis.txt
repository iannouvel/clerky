To diagnose endometriosis, assess deep involvement of the bowel, bladder, or ureter; interpret pelvic MRI scans by a gynaecological imaging expert; consider laparoscopy for suspected cases even with normal ultrasounds; and perform systematic inspection and possibly biopsy during laparoscopy. Treat based on symptoms rather than stage; consider outpatient follow-up and hormonal or surgical management. Offer laparoscopic excision, not ablation, for endometriomas; excision or ablation plus adhesiolysis for non-bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis; and laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or drainage and ablation for endometriomas to enhance spontaneous pregnancy chances. Discuss laparoscopic surgery risks and benefits for deep endometriosis in conceiving women; avoid hormonal treatment alone or with surgery for conceiving women. Consider alternative pain management for exhausted options or conception priority. Research is needed on pain management programs, isolated peritoneal disease treatment efficacy, lifestyle interventions, support interventions, and hormonal treatment impact on fertility outcomes in endometriosis.
