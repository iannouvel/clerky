**Clinical Guideline Summary: Surrogacy Management in Perinatal Care**  

This guideline outlines best practices for managing surrogacy arrangements in perinatal care, ensuring sensitive and inclusive support for surrogates and intended parents. Key recommendations include:  

- **Legal Considerations**: The surrogate remains the legal mother until a parental order or adoption is granted. Intended parents must apply for legal parenthood post-birth.  
- **Antenatal & Postnatal Care**: Provide non-judgmental, individualized care for the surrogate, respecting her autonomy in medical decisions. Routine postnatal care should be offered, including mental health support.  
- **Newborn Screening & Handover**: The surrogate must consent to newborn screening. Clear communication is essential during the baby’s handover to intended parents.  
- **Inclusive Language**: Use neutral, respectful terminology (e.g., "surrogate" instead of "surrogate mother," "the baby" when speaking to the surrogate, and "your baby" for intended parents).  
- **Breastfeeding Support**: Commissioning mothers may induce lactation with medication if desired.  
- **Dispute Resolution & Safeguarding**: Address conflicts sensitively, prioritizing the surrogate’s rights. Report welfare concerns as per safeguarding protocols.  
- **Equality & Compliance**: Adhere to the Equality Act (2010), ensuring no discrimination based on pregnancy, maternity, or family structure.  

Annual audits ensure adherence to the pathway, promoting consistent, compassionate care for all involved in surrogacy arrangements.
