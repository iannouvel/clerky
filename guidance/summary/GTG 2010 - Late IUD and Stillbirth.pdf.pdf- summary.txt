The clinical guideline on Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth aims to provide evidence-based options for women experiencing the loss of a singleton fetus. The guideline covers general care before, during, and after birth, as well as care in future pregnancies. It emphasizes the need for real-time ultrasonography for diagnosis and recommends tests to identify the cause of death. Special recommendations are made for women who are rhesus D-negative. The guideline also includes recommendations for labor induction, pain relief, and postpartum care. Psychological support, bereavement services, and follow-up meetings are highlighted to address the emotional impact of late IUFD. Recommendations for future research and training for healthcare professionals are also provided.
