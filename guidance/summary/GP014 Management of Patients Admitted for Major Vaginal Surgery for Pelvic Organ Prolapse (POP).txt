**Summary of GP014: Management of Patients Admitted for Major Vaginal Surgery for Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP)**  

This guideline outlines the standardized management of women undergoing major vaginal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP), including procedures such as vaginal hysterectomy and mesh repair. POP involves the descent of pelvic organs (bladder, rectum, or uterus) due to weakened support structures.  

Key recommendations include:  
- **Pre-operative management:** Ensure thorough assessment and patient counseling.  
- **Post-operative care:** Focus on bladder management to prevent complications such as urinary retention.  
- **Follow-up:** Structured monitoring to assess recovery and surgical outcomes.  

Nursing staff and gynaecologists must adhere to the protocol, applying professional judgment where necessary. Compliance with these standards ensures consistent, high-quality care. The guideline emphasizes measurable, objective criteria while allowing flexibility for clinical discretion. Regular review ensures the protocol remains up-to-date and accessible.
