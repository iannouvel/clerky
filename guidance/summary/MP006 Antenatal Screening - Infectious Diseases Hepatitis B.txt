### **Summary of Antenatal Hepatitis B Screening Guidelines**  

Antenatal Hepatitis B (HBV) screening is essential to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which can lead to chronic infection, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Screening should be offered at the first antenatal visit, ideally before 10 weeks, with informed consent. High-risk women may require repeat testing. Declining screening should prompt further counseling.  

Positive results require confirmatory testing and referral to a Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing (SMRHW) for coordinated care. Infants of HBV-positive mothers must receive a full vaccination course within the first year, with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) given if indicated. Documentation of vaccination and timely communication with pediatric teams are critical.  

Midwives must notify the SMRHW of birth and vaccine administration. Follow-up includes ensuring infants complete vaccination and undergo HBV testing at 1 year. Auditable standards track screening uptake, positive cases, and timely interventions.  

Key management steps:  
- **Screening:** Universal testing at booking, with repeat for high-risk cases.  
- **Positive Results:** Confirmatory testing, specialist referral, and liver unit follow-up.  
- **Neonatal Care:** HBV vaccination within 12 hours, HBIG if needed, and completion of the vaccine schedule.  
- **Documentation & Follow-up:** Record vaccinations, notify relevant teams, and ensure infant testing at 1 year.  

Annual audits and incident reporting maintain compliance. Women receive written information on screening and neonatal immunization. The Antenatal Screening Steering Group oversees policy adherence.
