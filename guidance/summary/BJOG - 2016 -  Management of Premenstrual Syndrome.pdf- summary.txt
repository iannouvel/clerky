The clinical guideline for the management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) recommends recording symptoms over two cycles using a diary and considering gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues for a definitive diagnosis. Referral to a gynaecologist is advised if simple measures fail. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are recommended as first-line treatments for severe PMS. SSRIs are also suggested as an option for pharmaceutical management. Spironolactone can be used for physical symptoms, and hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases. An integrated holistic approach is recommended, with a decision-making algorithm provided for treatment.
