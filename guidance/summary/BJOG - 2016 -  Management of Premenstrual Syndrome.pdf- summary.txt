The clinical guideline for the management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) emphasizes the importance of recording symptoms over two cycles using a symptom diary for diagnosis. Referral to a gynaecologist is recommended if simple measures fail, and severe cases may benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach. First-line pharmaceutical interventions include drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives and percutaneous estradiol with progestogens. Cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs are also recommended for severe cases. Spironolactone can be used for physical symptoms, and surgery may be considered as a last resort. Complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and herbal treatments, may also be effective in managing PMS symptoms.
