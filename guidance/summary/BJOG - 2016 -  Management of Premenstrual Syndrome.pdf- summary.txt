The clinical guideline for the Management of Premenstrual Syndrome emphasizes the importance of recording symptoms over two cycles using a symptom diary for diagnosis. Treatment options include cognitive behavioral therapy, vitamin B6, and combined oral contraceptives as first-line interventions. For severe cases, SSRIs, drospirenone-containing COCs, percutaneous estradiol with progestogens, and GnRH analogues may be considered. Spironolactone can be used for physical symptoms, while hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy are options when medical management fails. Complementary therapies, nutritional supplements, and hormonal treatments like danazol have shown efficacy in managing PMS symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach and individualized treatment plans are recommended.
