Clinical guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome recommend lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, as well as medication like metformin to manage symptoms and reduce long-term health risks. It is also important to monitor cardiovascular health, insulin resistance, and mental health in women with PCOS. Regular follow-up appointments and screenings for endometrial hyperplasia and gynecological cancers are recommended. Psychological interventions for overweight or obesity can have a beneficial effect on fertility in women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome. Further research is needed to improve long-term outcomes for women with PCOS and address areas of clinical uncertainty.
