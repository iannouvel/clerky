The clinical guideline for managing uterine fibroids in reproductive-age females includes various treatment options based on symptoms and patient preferences. Expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection, and medical therapy with contraceptives or intrauterine devices are initial options. Second-tier treatments include GnRH agonists, uterine artery embolization, and tranexamic acid. For patients not desiring fertility, hysterectomy or myomectomy may be considered. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred over open abdominal myomectomy due to less blood loss and lower complication rates. Patients with bulk or pain symptoms can opt for UAE or GnRH analogs. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is recommended for submucosal fibroids in patients desiring fertility. Surgical approach does not affect ovarian reserve. Further randomized trials are needed for comparison. Invasive treatments like UAE and myomectomy are options for patients with fibroids. Patients desiring pregnancy may consider myomectomy or hysteroscopic myomectomy.
