Uterine fibroids in reproductive-age females present with abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure symptoms, fertility issues, and pain. Management includes expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection, and medical therapy with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestin-releasing intrauterine devices. Second-tier options consist of GnRH agonists, uterine artery embolization, and tranexamic acid. Surgical interventions like hysterectomy and myomectomy are available, with laparoscopic myomectomy preferred for specific criteria. UAE and GnRH analogs are recommended for patients with bulk or pain symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors and androgenic compounds are not advised. Monitoring for sustained reduction in menstrual bleeding is crucial, with laparoscopic myomectomy showing less blood loss compared to open abdominal myomectomy. Further randomized trials are needed to compare surgical outcomes. Contraindications include bleeding disorders for endometrial ablation. Patients should be counseled on treatment options based on symptom severity and fertility desires.
