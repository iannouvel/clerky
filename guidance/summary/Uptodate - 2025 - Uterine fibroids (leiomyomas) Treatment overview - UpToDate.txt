Uterine fibroids are common in reproductive-age females and can cause symptoms like abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure, fertility issues, and pain. Treatment options include expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection, medical therapy, GnRH agonists, uterine artery embolization, and various surgical options based on symptom severity and patient preference. Different medications like elagolix, relugolix, and linzagolix have shown efficacy in reducing menstrual bleeding. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred over open abdominal myomectomy due to less blood loss and lower complication rates. Patients desiring fertility can consider myomectomy or hysteroscopic myomectomy. UAE, hysterectomy, and GnRH analogs are options for patients not desiring future fertility or with bulk/pain symptoms.
