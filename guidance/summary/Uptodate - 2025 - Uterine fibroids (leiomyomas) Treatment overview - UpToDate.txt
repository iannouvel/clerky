Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Uterine fibroids in reproductive-age females can present with abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure or bulk symptoms, fertility issues, and pain.

Treatment and Management:
- Treatment options include expectant management, hysteroscopic fibroid resection, medical therapy with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestin-releasing intrauterine devices, GnRH agonists and antagonists, uterine artery embolization, tranexamic acid, focused ultrasound surgery, and traditional surgeries like hysterectomy and myomectomy.
- Elagolix, relugolix, linzagolix, and GnRH agonists are effective in reducing fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding.
- Hysteroscopic myomectomy is recommended for submucosal fibroids in patients desiring fertility, while myomectomy via laparoscopy or open abdominal incision is suggested for other types of fibroids.
- Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred for patients with specific criteria such as smaller uterine size and fewer fibroids.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor sustained reduction of menstrual bleeding for an additional 6 months after treatment.
- Monitor side effects of treatments for fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding.
- Monitor for complications and recurrent myomas post-myomectomy.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Aromatase inhibitors and androgenic compounds are not recommended for fibroid treatment.
- Open abdominal myomectomy is recommended for patients with numerous or larger fibroids.
- Patients with bleeding disorders have a limited role in endometrial ablation.
