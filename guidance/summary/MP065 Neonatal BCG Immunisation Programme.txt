**Neonatal BCG Immunisation Programme Summary**  

This protocol ensures timely BCG vaccination for infants (0–12 months) at high risk of tuberculosis (TB) exposure. Eligible infants include those residing in UK areas with TB incidence ≥40/100,000 or with parents/grandparents born in high-incidence countries (≥40/100,000). The University Hospital Trust identifies eligible infants antenatally and refers them post-delivery.  

Key responsibilities involve midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians, and neonatologists in compliance with the protocol. The Sussex Community Trust administers vaccinations under structured pathways, ensuring timely delivery. Failsafe procedures include database audits to prevent missed referrals, alongside mandatory local/national reporting for documentation.  

High-incidence countries include Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Philippines, and others. The programme aims to reduce severe TB-related morbidity and mortality in vulnerable neonates. Clear antenatal and postnatal pathways streamline identification, referral, and vaccination processes.
