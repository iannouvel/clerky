The clinical guideline for the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying risk factors and monitoring patients. It classifies hyperplasia into two groups, with different management approaches for each. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include histological examination, endometrial sampling, and hysteroscopy. Treatment options range from observation to surgical management, depending on the severity of the condition. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is recommended as a first-line treatment for hyperplasia without atypia. The guideline also addresses management in women wishing to conceive, those on hormone replacement therapy, and those on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Regular endometrial surveillance and individualized management are key components of the guideline. Future research topics and audit recommendations are also outlined in the guideline.
