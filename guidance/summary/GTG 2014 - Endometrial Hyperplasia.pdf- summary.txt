The clinical guideline for the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying risk factors, classifying hyperplasia based on cytological atypia, and utilizing various diagnostic and surveillance methods. Treatment options include observation, progestogens, surgical management, and the use of LNG-IUS. Hysterectomy is recommended for atypical hyperplasia, with fertility preservation options available. Regular endometrial surveillance is crucial, especially for women on adjuvant breast cancer treatment. The guideline also addresses the impact of obesity, HRT use, and tamoxifen on hyperplasia management. Further research is needed to determine optimal management approaches and improve outcomes. The guideline is subject to review by the RCOG Guidelines Committee in 2019.
