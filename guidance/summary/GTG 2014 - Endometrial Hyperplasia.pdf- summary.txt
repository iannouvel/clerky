The clinical guideline on the management of endometrial hyperplasia emphasizes the importance of identifying and monitoring risk factors, as well as classifying hyperplasia based on cytological atypia. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include histological examination, endometrial sampling, and hysteroscopy. Treatment options vary depending on the presence of atypia, with progestogens and surgical management being common approaches. The guideline also addresses specific considerations for women on adjuvant breast cancer treatment, those wishing to conceive, and those on hormone replacement therapy. Regular endometrial surveillance is recommended, and further research is needed to determine optimal management strategies. The guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the management of endometrial hyperplasia, with a focus on individualized care and long-term monitoring.
