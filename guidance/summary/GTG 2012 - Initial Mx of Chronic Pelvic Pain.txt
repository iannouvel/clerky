Chronic pelvic pain is a complex condition that requires a thorough initial assessment to identify contributing factors and develop a comprehensive management plan in partnership with the patient. Diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be followed, with consideration for referral to other healthcare professionals if a non-gynaecological component is suspected. Investigations may include abdominal and pelvic examinations, screening for infections, transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), MRI, and diagnostic laparoscopy if needed. Therapeutic options include hormonal treatments for cyclical pain, antispasmodics for IBS, analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications. Self-management techniques and support from organizations are valuable. Monitoring should include tracking symptoms and functional goals. Red flag symptoms should be noted for further evaluation. Referral to a specialist may be necessary if pain is not controlled adequately. Contraindications and risk factors should be considered, and a multidisciplinary approach may be beneficial for managing chronic pelvic pain effectively.
