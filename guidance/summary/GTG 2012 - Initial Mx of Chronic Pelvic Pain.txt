This guideline focuses on the initial management of chronic pelvic pain in women. Chronic pelvic pain is a symptom with various contributing factors, including physical, psychological, and social aspects. The initial assessment should identify these factors and establish a management plan in partnership with the patient. Referral to specialists may be necessary if pain is not adequately controlled. History-taking should include pain patterns, associated symptoms, and effects of movement. Red flag symptoms should be noted, and screening for infections like STIs should be offered. Diagnostic tools such as TVS, MRI, and laparoscopy can aid in identifying structural abnormalities. Treatment options include hormonal therapy, antispasmodics, analgesia, ovarian suppression, and dietary modifications. Self-management techniques and support from organizations are also beneficial. The guideline emphasizes a comprehensive approach to managing chronic pelvic pain, recognizing its multifactorial nature and tailoring treatment plans to individual needs.
