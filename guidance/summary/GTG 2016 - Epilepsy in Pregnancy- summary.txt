The clinical guideline for Epilepsy in Pregnancy emphasizes the importance of diagnosis by a neurologist, classification of seizure types, and immediate treatment protocols for pregnant women with seizures. Preconception counseling should include discussions on the risks of malformations and the benefits of folic acid supplementation. Regular antenatal care with an epilepsy care team is recommended to monitor seizure risks and fetal abnormalities. Postnatally, women with epilepsy should continue antiepileptic drugs and be offered effective contraception. Healthcare providers should be aware of disability legislation and provide support for pregnant women with epilepsy. Research recommendations include optimal monitoring strategies and the effects of AED exposure on offspring.
