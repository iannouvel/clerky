**Fetal Blood Sampling (FBS) Maternity Protocol Summary**  

FBS is performed to assess fetal well-being in cases of concerning fetal heart rate (FHR) traces. It is indicated when FHR patterns are abnormal but should not be performed if cervical dilation is <3cm, maternal infection is present, fetal bleeding disorders are suspected, or in cases of prematurity.  

Results are categorized as **normal**, **borderline**, or **abnormal**, guiding further management. Documentation must be completed on Badgernet. In cases of neonatal concern, paired cord blood samples should be obtained for additional assessment.  

Key clinical points include ensuring proper technique, recognizing contraindications, and acting promptly based on results. This procedure aids in decision-making for timely intervention when fetal compromise is suspected.
