### **Summary of Infectious Disease Management in Pregnancy**  

This guideline provides standardized care for pregnant women with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, hepatitis B/C, syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea.  

**HIV Management:**  
- Universal screening is offered. Positive cases require multidisciplinary care following BHIVA guidelines.  
- Key steps: rapid notification, care plan initiation, viral load monitoring, and antenatal discussions (12-16 & 34-36 weeks).  
- **Delivery:** Cesarean section (CS) if viral load >400 copies/mL at 36 weeks; IV AZT if viral load >1,000 copies/mL in labor.  
- **Postpartum:** Infant post-exposure prophylaxis, feeding counseling, and lactation suppression if needed.  

**Hepatitis B:**  
- Screening is routine; chronic cases require monitoring and possible antiviral therapy.  
- Infants need vaccination and immunoglobulin if indicated. Breastfeeding is permitted unless contraindicated.  

**Hepatitis C & Syphilis:**  
- High-risk women (IV drug use, infected partners) should be retested in the third trimester.  
- **Syphilis:** Early treatment is critical to prevent congenital infection. Screening at booking and re-offer by 20 weeks.  

**Chlamydia & Gonorrhoea:**  
- Testing recommended for women under 25; symptomatic cases require prompt treatment.  

**General Principles:**  
- Document care plans, encourage partner disclosure, and ensure multidisciplinary coordination.  
- Intrapartum and neonatal management should align with maternal infection status to minimize transmission risk.
