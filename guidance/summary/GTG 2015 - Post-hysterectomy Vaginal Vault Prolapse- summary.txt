This clinical guideline covers the management of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse (PHVP) and provides recommendations for assessment, preventive techniques, treatment options, surgical procedures, complications, and follow-up care. It emphasizes the importance of patient-reported outcomes, individualized treatment plans, and documentation of surgical outcomes. The guideline recommends pelvic floor muscle training for stage I-II prolapse, vaginal pessaries for stage II-IV prolapse, and surgery for symptomatic patients. Mesh kits should only be considered after full informed consent, and colpocleisis is an option for specific cases. Concomitant surgery for stress urinary incontinence may be considered, and recurrent vault prolapse should be managed by a specialist team. National databases should document outcomes and complications.
