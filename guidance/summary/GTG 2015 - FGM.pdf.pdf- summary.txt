The clinical guideline on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) emphasizes the importance of healthcare professionals being aware of the complications of FGM and their legal responsibilities. Specialized services should be available for women with FGM, offering information, assessments, and de-infibulation. Psychological and sexual complications can occur with all types of FGM, and referral pathways should be clear. De-infibulation should be considered before pregnancy, and clitoral reconstruction is not recommended. Pregnant women with FGM should receive appropriate care, including antenatal screening and de-infibulation if necessary. Intrapartum and postnatal care should be managed sensitively, with all legal and regulatory processes followed. Training on FGM is mandatory for healthcare professionals.
