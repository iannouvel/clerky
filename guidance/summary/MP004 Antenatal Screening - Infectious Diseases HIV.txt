### **Summary of Antenatal HIV Screening Guidelines**  

Antenatal HIV screening aims to identify HIV-positive pregnant women early to prevent mother-to-child transmission and ensure appropriate care. Screening should be offered to all women by 10 weeks, including late bookers and those previously tested. Known HIV-positive women should be retested and referred to specialists.  

Women may decline screening, but this must be documented, and they should be informed they can opt in later. If unscreened by 28 weeks, screening is re-offered, with follow-up at 32 weeks.  

Samples must be correctly labeled, and unacceptable samples require a repeat within 10 working days. Results are available within 5 days, with failsafes to ensure follow-up within 10 days, including for women who miscarry or terminate.  

A negative result does not guarantee protection; repeat testing can be requested. Positive results trigger confirmatory testing, with immediate notification to the Specialist Midwife and Health Advisors. Confidentiality is maintained, and consent is required before sharing results with other healthcare providers.  

Ongoing care follows BSUH protocols. Audit standards include tracking screening uptake, declines, and new diagnoses, ensuring specialist assessment within 10 days of a positive result. Midwives must complete mandatory training, and incidents must be reported. The care pathway ensures screening is offered at booking, with results followed up promptly.
