The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics outlines recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion in pregnant women. It emphasizes optimizing haemoglobin levels through oral iron supplementation, active management of the third stage of labor, and delivery in a hospital for high-risk women. Consent for transfusion should be obtained whenever possible, with group and screen samples checked regularly. Cell salvage is recommended for significant blood loss, with specific blood components used based on antibody status. Mechanical strategies and tranexamic acid can reduce postpartum blood loss, with careful assessment of transfusion triggers based on clinical and haematological grounds. Iron therapy may reduce the need for transfusion in the postpartum period, and advance directives should be completed for women declining blood products.
