The Gynaecology Operational & Escalation Protocol GP016 at Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals outlines admission criteria and processes for women to Gynaecology and Maternity wards. Key aspects include ward organization, expected admissions, criteria for medical patients, and escalation processes for clinically ill patients. The protocol also covers the use of maternity wards for non-obstetric patients and cancellation of operations procedures. Responsibilities involve professional judgment, guideline adherence, and ensuring measurable standards are met. The cancellation process involves contacting the Gynaecology Service Manager, obtaining consultant approval, informing the patient, updating relevant staff, completing necessary documentation, and contacting specific personnel for coordination and rescheduling. Contact information for key personnel is provided for efficient communication and coordination.
