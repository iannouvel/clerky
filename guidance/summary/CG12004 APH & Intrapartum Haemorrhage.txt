### **Summary of Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing antepartum (APH) and intrapartum haemorrhage, including placenta praevia and placenta accreta. APH affects 3-5% of pregnancies, with major causes being placenta praevia, placental abruption, and vasa praevia. Complications include maternal anaemia, shock, and fetal death.  

**Placenta Praevia:** Diagnosed via transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), it presents with painless bleeding. Asymptomatic cases with low-lying placenta should be rescanned at 32 weeks. Management depends on bleeding severity, gestational age, and fetal status. Corticosteroids are advised if preterm delivery is likely.  

**Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS):** Risk factors include prior caesarean section (CS) and placenta praevia. Suspected cases require multidisciplinary planning, often involving consultant-led care and potential interventional radiology (IR).  

**Placental Abruption:** Presents with painful bleeding and uterine tenderness. Minor cases may allow conservative management; major cases require urgent delivery, often by CS.  

**Vasa Praevia:** Diagnosed via ultrasound, confirmed cases require timely delivery to prevent fetal exsanguination.  

**General Management:**  
- Recurrent bleeding warrants senior obstetric review.  
- Speculum exam excludes cervical pathology (e.g., cancer).  
- Major haemorrhage requires early anaesthetic involvement, resuscitation, and close monitoring for postpartum complications.  
- Audit standards include consultant presence at CS for placenta praevia and documented management plans for high-risk cases.  

This guideline ensures structured, multidisciplinary care to optimise maternal and fetal outcomes.
