Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) clinical guidelines recommend considering ICP in pregnant women with itching and raised bile acid concentrations of 19 micromol/L or higher. Additional investigations are not routinely recommended unless itch is severe or associated with other conditions. Severe or atypical cases should be discussed with a hepatologist. Confirming ICP postnatally is crucial, with a focus on symptom resolution and normal liver function tests. The risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acid concentrations, warranting planned birth timing. Ultrasound and cardiotocography do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP. No treatments have been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes or reduce bile acid concentrations significantly. Ursodeoxycholic acid is not routinely recommended for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP. Active management with planned early birth is suggested to reduce adverse outcomes, and close monitoring with regular tests and measurements is essential. Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies. Follow-up postpartum is advised to confirm resolution. In subsequent pregnancies, baseline tests should be performed, and repeat testing should be based on clinical indications. Future research should focus on prognostic tools, testing for gestational diabetes, and effective treatments for itching and adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.
