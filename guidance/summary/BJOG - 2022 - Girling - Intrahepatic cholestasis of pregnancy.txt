ICP: Consider ICP in pregnant women with itching, bile acid >19 micromol/L. Active management with early birth reduces adverse outcomes. No routine treatments improve outcomes or reduce bile acid levels. Postnatal resolution confirmed with normal liver tests. Risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acids >100 micromol/L. Close monitoring, no routine additional tests. Ursodeoxycholic acid not recommended for perinatal outcomes.
