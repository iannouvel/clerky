Recommendations for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) management include considering ICP in pregnant women with itching and bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or higher, discussing severe cases with a hepatologist, and confirming postnatal resolution. Stillbirth risk increases with peak bile acid concentrations, especially in twin pregnancies. Ultrasound and CTG do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP. Ursodeoxycholic acid is not routinely recommended for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP. Continuous fetal monitoring is advised for women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more. Follow-up postpartum is essential to confirm resolution. Future research should focus on prognostic tools, testing for gestational diabetes, and effective treatments for itching and adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.
