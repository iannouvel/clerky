Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) may be considered in pregnant women with itching and a bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or higher.
- Severe or atypical cases of ICP should be discussed with a hepatologist.
- Confirmation of ICP postnatally is based on symptom resolution and normal liver function tests.
- Risk of stillbirth increases with peak bile acid concentrations, especially at 100 micromol/L or higher.
- Women with ICP have a higher risk of preterm birth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and neonatal care requirements.
- Women with ICP may develop pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and hepatobiliary/immune-mediated diseases.

Treatment and Management:
- Active management with planned early birth is recommended for women with ICP to reduce adverse outcomes.
- Monitoring should include regular liver function tests and bile acid measurements.
- Drug treatments like topical emollients and antihistamines can alleviate symptoms but do not improve pregnancy outcomes significantly.
- Ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce maternal itch but does not significantly impact perinatal outcomes.
- Maternal vitamin K treatment may be necessary in cases of reduced fat absorption or abnormal coagulation studies.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Regular monitoring for liver function tests, bile acid concentrations, fetal movements, and fetal monitoring for women with ICP.
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be offered to women with peak bile acids of 100 micromol/L or more.
- Follow-up at least 4 weeks postpartum to confirm resolution of ICP.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Do not routinely offer ursodeoxycholic acid for adverse perinatal outcomes in ICP.
- Standard analgesia and anesthesia options should be offered for women with uncomplicated ICP during birth.
- Routine use of vitamin K treatment is not recommended unless symptoms like steatorrhea are present.
- ICP does not impact the choice of contraception or hormone replacement therapy.
