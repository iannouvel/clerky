In pregnant women, consider intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) with itching and bile acid concentration ≥19 micromol/L; no routine additional investigations unless severe itch or comorbidities; consult hepatologist for severe/atypical cases; confirm postnatally with symptom resolution and normal liver function tests; higher stillbirth risk with peak bile acids ≥100 micromol/L, especially in twin pregnancies; no predictive/preventive value of ultrasound/CTG for stillbirth in ICP; monitor for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and potential long-term hepatobiliary/immune diseases; active management with planned early birth recommended; monitor liver function tests and bile acids; consider topical emollients, antihistamines for symptom relief; ursodeoxycholic acid not routinely recommended for adverse perinatal outcomes; vitamin K may be needed for fat absorption/coagulation issues; plan birth based on peak bile acids/risk factors; offer continuous fetal monitoring with peak bile acids ≥100 micromol/L; standard analgesia/anesthesia during birth; follow-up at least 4 weeks postpartum for resolution confirmation; consider baseline liver function tests/bile acids in subsequent pregnancies; research needed on prognostic tools, gestational diabetes testing, and effective treatments for itching/prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes.
