The UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline provides evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and management of ICP in pregnant women. It covers the aim, scope, responsibilities, diagnosis, management, and monitoring of ICP, as well as the risks associated with the condition. The guideline recommends regular monitoring of bile acid and liver function tests, consultant-led care, and careful planning of the timing of birth based on the severity of ICP. It also emphasizes the importance of postnatal care and monitoring for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. The guideline includes audit questions to ensure quality care for pregnant women with ICP.
