The UH Sussex Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Guideline provides evidence-based guidance for diagnosing and managing ICP in pregnant women. It covers diagnosis, history, investigations, maternal and perinatal risks, management (including antenatal care, drug treatment, timing of birth, intrapartum care, postnatal care, and subsequent pregnancies), and audit recommendations. ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, with a high recurrence rate in future pregnancies. Diagnosis is confirmed by itching and raised bile acid levels, with resolution postnatally. Management includes consultant-led care, monitoring, drug treatment, and timing of birth based on severity. Postnatal care involves monitoring for resolution of symptoms. Pregnant women should be advised about the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.
