This clinical guideline provides evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). Obstetricians and midwives are responsible for following this guidance, which includes diagnosing ICP based on elevated maternal bile acid concentrations and excluding other causes of itching and liver dysfunction. Management of ICP involves antenatal care, drug treatment, and timing of birth, with pregnant women receiving patient information leaflets, consultant-led care, and regular monitoring of bile acids and liver function tests. The guideline also addresses the impact of co-morbidities on stillbirth risk and decision-making around planned birth, as well as postnatal care and monitoring for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.
