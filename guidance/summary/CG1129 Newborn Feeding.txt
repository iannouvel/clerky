The newborn feeding guideline emphasizes the importance of breastfeeding and supporting mothers' feeding choices. Key recommendations include promoting skin-to-skin contact for breastfeeding initiation, providing breastfeeding support and assessments in the first week after birth, encouraging exclusive breastfeeding for optimal outcomes, and utilizing alternative feeding methods like finger feeding and cup feeding when necessary. Formula feeding guidance includes preparing infant formula and responsive feeding practices. Inpatient formula milk provision guidelines and safe sleeping practices are outlined. Health professionals are advised to discuss safe sleeping practices, encourage skin-to-skin contact, and provide information on local parenting support. Rooming in, weighing newborns, addressing feeding problems, and promoting breastfeeding training for staff are essential components of the guideline. Breastfed babies should feed 8-12 times in 24 hours, with a focus on optimal positioning and attachment. Formula supplementation should be limited, and medical reasons may necessitate it, with steps to minimize nipple confusion and maintain breastmilk supply. Staff will support mothers in continuing breastfeeding while supplementing with formula.
