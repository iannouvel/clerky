Cervical cerclage is a procedure used to prevent preterm birth and second-trimester fetal loss in high-risk women. The guidelines recommend cerclage for women with a history of three or more preterm births or a short cervix of 25mm or less. Cerclage should not be performed for incidental short cervix findings on ultrasound or multiple pregnancies. The guidelines also discuss the use of transabdominal cerclage in cases of unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage and emergency cerclage to delay birth and reduce preterm birth risk. Women should be informed of potential complications, and individualized care should be considered based on each patient's circumstances.
