**Clinical Guideline Summary: Assisted Vaginal Birth**  

This protocol outlines standards for assisted vaginal birth (ventouse or forceps) to ensure safe, effective delivery while minimizing morbidity. Key recommendations include:  

- **Indications:** Fetal compromise, malposition, or inadequate progressâ€”each case assessed individually.  
- **Contraindications:** Ventouse avoided in face presentation or preterm (<34 weeks); forceps preferred. Absolute contraindications include maternal bony fractures or certain medical conditions.  
- **Prerequisites:** Experienced operator, confirmed fetal position, adequate analgesia, and informed consent (verbal for delivery room, written for theatre).  
- **Procedure Choice:** Non-rotational deliveries may use ventouse (lower maternal trauma) or forceps (higher success); rotational deliveries require senior clinicians.  
- **Preparation:** Bladder emptying, aseptic technique, neonatal resuscitation team on standby. Higher-risk cases should occur in theatre for rapid cesarean access.  
- **Analgesia:** Epidural, spinal, or pudendal block with local anesthetic.  
- **Episiotomy:** Mediolateral if indicated, with post-delivery inspection for trauma.  
- **Aftercare:** Antibiotics, perineal repair documentation, bladder monitoring (record first void), and analgesia.  
- **Documentation:** Consent, indication, instruments used, time-to-birth interval, and complications.  
- **Debriefing:** Discuss indications, complications, and future birth planning. Offer trauma support and pelvic floor care.  

Emphasis is placed on shared decision-making, procedural safety, and postnatal follow-up.
