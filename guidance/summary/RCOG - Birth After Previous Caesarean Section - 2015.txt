- Antenatal counselling should be individualized and documented
- Consideration should be given to attempting VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor for placenta praevia and placenta accreta in subsequent pregnancies
- Antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is important

Contraindications and Cautions:
