The clinical guideline on Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth recommends offering planned vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) to most women with a single lower segment cesarean delivery, with contraindications being previous uterine rupture or classical cesarean scar. VBAC success rates are around 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery predicting success. Induction or augmentation of labor increases uterine rupture risk. Elective repeat cesarean sections (ERCS) should be done after 39 weeks with appropriate care. VBAC may not be suitable for certain complications. Antenatal care should be structured, with counseling by the maternity team. ERCS has a higher neonatal respiratory morbidity risk compared to VBAC. Consideration should be given to VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies. Decision aids, personalized tools, and risk-benefit discussions are crucial for choosing the delivery mode. Various studies have explored outcomes and risks associated with different delivery methods post-cesarean. Factors like uterine rupture, placenta previa, and maternal morbidity have been studied in relation to VBAC and ERCS.
