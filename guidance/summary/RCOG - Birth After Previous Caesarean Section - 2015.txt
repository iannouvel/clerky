Antenatal care for women with a previous cesarean birth should include a checklist for VBAC or ERCS, with planned VBAC offered to most women with a single prior lower segment cesarean. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical cesarean scar, with a success rate of 72-75% and previous vaginal delivery predicting success. Induction or augmentation of labor increases uterine rupture risk, and ERCS should be performed after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis. VBAC may not be suitable for certain complications, and counselling by the maternity team is essential. Multiple prior cesareans increase risks of placenta praevia and accreta, with VBAC offered after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Factors increasing uterine rupture risk during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, post-date pregnancy, maternal age over 40, obesity, and decreased myometrial thickness. Antenatal counseling should be individualized, with consideration of outcomes and future reproductive preferences. ERCS has more complications than VBAC, with risks of stillbirth and neonatal respiratory morbidity. The NICHD study showed increased adverse perinatal outcomes with planned VBAC compared to ERCS, and successful VBAC predictors include previous vaginal delivery. Induction and augmentation of VBAC labor increase risks, and ERCS should follow guidelines for perioperative care. Delaying ERCS to 39+0 weeks reduces respiratory morbidity risk, with corticosteroids considered if needed before 39 weeks. Preincision antibiotics reduce maternal infection risk, and thromboprophylaxis should follow RCOG guidance. Special circumstances require cautious VBAC consideration, with induction from 41+0 weeks recommended to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates in twin pregnancies are similar to singletons, and antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is crucial. Further research is needed on identifying VBAC success predictors and risks in women with prior cesareans. Patient decision aids and personalized tools assist in mode of delivery choices, considering maternal and neonatal outcomes.
