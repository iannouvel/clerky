The clinical guideline on Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth recommends antenatal care, offering planned VBAC to most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. The success rate of VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being a predictor of success. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis given. VBAC may not be suitable for pregnancies with certain complications. Consideration should be given to attempting VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized antenatal care and documented counseling by a member of the maternity team.
