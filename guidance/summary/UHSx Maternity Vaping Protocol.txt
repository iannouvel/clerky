### **Maternity Vaping Protocol Summary**  

This protocol supports pregnant smokers in quitting tobacco by offering regulated nicotine vape starter kits alongside behavioral support. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to smoking, as it eliminates exposure to toxic tobacco byproducts. It is not recommended for non-smokers or individuals under 18.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- Pregnant smokers may opt for a vape starter kit, behavioral support, or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).  
- Partners can also access behavioral support and vaping vouchers if quitting smoking.  
- Practitioners should guide clients on device use, nicotine strength selection, and gradual reduction over 12 weeks.  
- Highly dependent smokers may combine vaping with NRT patches.  

**Management Steps:**  
1. **Initial Assessment:** Clients choose between behavioral support, NRT, or vaping.  
2. **Voucher System:** Pregnant clients receive vouchers for e-liquids and atomizer heads.  
3. **Follow-Up:** Progress is monitored; relapsed clients discontinue vaping.  
4. **Ordering & Redemption:** Midwives order vouchers via a council-managed system; clients redeem them online.  

**Cautions:**  
- Avoid vaping during oxygen therapy.  
- Store and dispose of devices safely.  
- Training for midwives is advised.  

**Monitoring & Review:** Compliance is tracked, and reports are submitted regularly. The protocol is approved for use across specified hospital sites and will be reviewed in May 2027.
