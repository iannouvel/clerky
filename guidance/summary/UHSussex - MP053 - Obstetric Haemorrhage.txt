The Obstetric Haemorrhage Protocol at University Sussex Hospital's NHS Trust East covers antepartum hemorrhage, placental abruption, placenta praevia, postpartum hemorrhage, and management for women declining blood products. Key principles emphasize the use of measurable standards with room for professional judgment. Responsibilities are outlined for midwives, anaesthetists, and obstetricians to follow the protocol and exercise professional judgment. Definitions of obstetric hemorrhage are provided, including minor and major categories. Management involves clinical review, assessment, referral, risk assessment, care planning, communication, and clear responsibilities. Communication among staff is crucial, with specific protocols for different hemorrhage types. Postnatal care, monitoring, and follow-up are essential. Women declining blood products should have individual plans, and debriefing and follow-up appointments are recommended. Thromboprophylaxis and accurate documentation are emphasized throughout the management process.
