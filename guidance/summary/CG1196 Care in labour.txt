**Summary of Care in Labour Guideline**  

This guideline outlines evidence-based practices for managing low-risk labor, emphasizing shared decision-making and minimizing unnecessary interventions. Initial assessment includes reviewing records, fetal movements, and risk stratification, with timely referrals for high-risk cases.  

**First Stage of Labor:** Monitor maternal and fetal status, fluid balance, and labor progress. Suspected delay requires evaluation of cervical dilation, contractions, fetal position, and emotional state. Amniotomy may be considered; if declined, reassess in 2 hours. Refer to obstetric team if delay is confirmed.  

**Second Stage:** Support active pushing, encourage varied positions, and monitor maternal/fetal condition. Delay management includes amniotomy, bladder emptying, and fetal monitoring.  

**Third Stage:** Offer active (uterotonic administration, cord clamping) or physiological (delayed cord clamping, no uterotonic) management. Active management reduces hemorrhage risk. Inspect placenta, estimate blood loss, and refer if retained beyond one hour.  

**General Care:** Avoid starving laboring womenâ€”light diet is permitted. Pain relief options include non-pharmacological (hydrotherapy, breathing techniques) and pharmacological (Entonox, epidural, Remifentanil PCA).  

**Postpartum:** Promote skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and newborn examination. Placental histology is required in specific cases (e.g., fetal distress).  

The guideline is reviewed periodically, with the next update due in 2027.
