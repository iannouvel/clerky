The clinical guideline focuses on preventing and managing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the postnatal period. Key recommendations include conducting pre-pregnancy risk assessments for individuals with a history of VTE, offering thromboprophylaxis with LMWH for high-risk pregnant individuals, starting antenatal thromboprophylaxis early in pregnancy, initiating postnatal thromboprophylaxis 6 hours after birth, and using LMWH as the preferred agent for both antenatal and postnatal thromboprophylaxis. Contraindications to LMWH use are outlined, and alternative agents like danaparoid and fondaparinux may be considered with hematologist consultation. The guideline discourages the use of aspirin for thromboprophylaxis in obstetric patients and restricts warfarin use in pregnancy to specific situations. Prompt investigation and management of DVT and PE symptoms are emphasized due to VTE being a leading cause of maternal death in the UK. Follow-up care should involve a multidisciplinary team, and pre-pregnancy advice is crucial for medication review and pregnancy care planning.
