The clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) provides key principles for healthcare professionals, emphasizing the importance of discussions with senior colleagues and evidence drawn from national guidelines. GTD, a group of pregnancy-related tumors, presents with clinical features such as irregular uterine bleeding and hyperemesis. Ultrasound examination is helpful in making a pre-evacuation diagnosis, and histological assessment is recommended to exclude trophoblastic disease. Evacuation of molar pregnancy is typically done through suction curettage, with anti-D prophylaxis advised for Rh-negative individuals. Follow-up testing, contraceptive advice, and monitoring for recurrence are essential components of managing GTD. In cases of combined molar pregnancy with a viable twin pregnancy, seeking advice from a regional Fetal Medicine Centre is recommended.
