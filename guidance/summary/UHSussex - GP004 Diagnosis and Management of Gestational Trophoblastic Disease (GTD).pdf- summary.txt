The clinical guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) emphasizes the importance of utilizing guidelines in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues. GTD is a rare group of pregnancy-related tumors with high cure rates, characterized by trophoblastic tissue proliferation. Clinical features include irregular uterine bleeding, hyperemesis, and early pregnancy failure. Ultrasound examination is helpful for pre-evacuation diagnosis, and histological assessment of failed pregnancies is recommended. Evacuation of molar pregnancies is typically done through suction curettage, with anti-D prophylaxis advised for Rh-negative patients. Follow-up testing, contraceptive advice, and monitoring for recurrence are important aspects of managing GTD. Persistent elevation of Î²hCG indicates Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN), and in cases of combined molar pregnancy with a viable twin pregnancy, seeking advice from a regional Fetal Medicine Centre is recommended.
