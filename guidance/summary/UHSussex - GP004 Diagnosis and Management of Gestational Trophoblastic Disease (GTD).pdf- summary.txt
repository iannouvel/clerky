The clinical guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) provides key principles for healthcare professionals, including the importance of discussions with senior colleagues and using evidence from national guidelines. GTD is a rare group of pregnancy-related tumors characterized by trophoblastic tissue proliferation, with clinical features such as irregular bleeding and hyperemesis. Ultrasound is helpful in diagnosis, and evacuation methods vary for complete and partial moles. Follow-up testing and contraceptive advice are recommended, with a low risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Persistent elevation of Î²hCG indicates Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN), and consultation is advised in cases of combined molar pregnancy with a viable twin.
