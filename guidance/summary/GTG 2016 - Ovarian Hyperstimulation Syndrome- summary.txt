The clinical guideline focuses on the management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in women undergoing fertility treatment. Clinicians are advised to be vigilant for symptoms of OHSS, diagnose based on clinical criteria, and monitor closely for worsening symptoms. Treatment includes fluid management, pain relief, and thromboprophylaxis, with surgery only indicated for specific complications. Pregnancies complicated by OHSS may be at increased risk for pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. Further research is needed to improve management strategies for severe cases of OHSS. The guideline emphasizes the importance of early detection, appropriate treatment, and close monitoring to prevent life-threatening complications.
