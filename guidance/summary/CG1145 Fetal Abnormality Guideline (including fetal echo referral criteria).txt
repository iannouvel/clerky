The Fetal Abnormality Guideline focuses on effective communication and referral for fetal abnormalities to provide optimal care for both babies and mothers. It applies to all staff involved in the care of antenatal women when a fetal abnormality is detected. Key recommendations include accessing and following the guidance, ensuring designated midwife care throughout the antenatal period, informing pediatric and obstetric teams upon admission for birth, recording and discussing confirmed fetal anomalies, and sharing information with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service. Referral for fetal echo is recommended in specific cases, while pregnant individuals with diabetes do not require a fetal echo but should have a routine anomaly scan at 20 weeks. The guideline emphasizes the importance of early anomaly scans for cases of major structural abnormalities in previous pregnancies or parents. Monitoring of the guideline is done through annual data submissions to Public Health England.
