The British Menopause Society provides guidelines for assessing and managing unscheduled bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Recommendations include assessing cancer risk factors, adjusting HRT regimens, and offering examinations and investigations as needed. The document emphasizes the importance of inclusive care for individuals whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex at birth. It details assessment criteria, endometrial cancer risk factors, different HRT regimens, and progestogen types for endometrial protection. The guidelines also outline conservative management strategies, referral criteria, and endometrial assessment protocols for women with unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Recommendations are based on evidence and aim to provide safe and effective care for menopausal women.
