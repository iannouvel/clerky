The British Menopause Society provides guidelines for assessing and managing unscheduled bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Recommendations include assessing cancer risk factors, adjusting HRT regimens, and offering examinations and investigations as needed. The document emphasizes the importance of inclusive and sensitive care for individuals whose gender identity does not align with their assigned sex. Detailed assessments and examinations are recommended for women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT, with considerations for endometrial cancer risk factors and different HRT regimens. Conservative management strategies and referral criteria are outlined for managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT, with a focus on individual risk factors and endometrial assessment.
