The NICE guidelines for hypertension in pregnancy, published in 2019, focus on improving care for pregnant women with high blood pressure, including pre-eclampsia. Recommendations include immediate medical attention for symptoms like severe headache and vision problems, advising on aspirin for high-risk women, and managing chronic hypertension during pregnancy. The guidelines cover medication risks, lifestyle advice, and monitoring blood pressure levels. Treatment recommendations include labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa, with guidelines for postnatal care and long-term cardiovascular risk. The guidelines aim to standardize care, improve outcomes, and provide comprehensive management for pregnant women with hypertension.
