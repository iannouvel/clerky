The NICE guideline on preterm labor and birth, last updated in June 2022, offers recommendations for managing women at risk of preterm birth. It covers various interventions such as vaginal progesterone, diagnosing preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, antenatal antibiotics, emergency cervical cerclage, tocolysis, corticosteroids, and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. The guideline advises against certain practices like nitrazine use for P-PROM diagnosis and offers guidance on when to consider repeat courses of corticosteroids. It emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making, monitoring for magnesium toxicity, and planning for removal of interventions like cervical cerclage. The guideline aims to reduce risks associated with preterm birth and improve outcomes for both mothers and babies.
