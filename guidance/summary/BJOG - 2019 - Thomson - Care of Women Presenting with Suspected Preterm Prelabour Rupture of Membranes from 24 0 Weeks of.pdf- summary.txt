The clinical guideline focuses on the diagnosis, assessment, and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in pregnant women between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation. Key recommendations include using maternal history and sterile speculum examination for diagnosis, offering antibiotics and corticosteroids, and considering magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks is advised, with delivery considered after 24+0 weeks. The guideline also emphasizes emotional support for women with PPROM and the need for further research in this area. The document provides links to relevant support groups and acknowledges the contributions of various healthcare professionals in its development.
