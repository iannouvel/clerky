The clinical guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in pregnant women between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation. Key recommendations include using maternal history and sterile speculum examination for diagnosis, offering antibiotics and corticosteroids, and considering magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks is advised, with delivery considered after 24+0 weeks. The guideline emphasizes the importance of emotional support, discussions with a neonatologist, and birthing in a suitable facility. Further research is needed in various aspects of PPROM management. Useful links and support groups are provided for additional information and assistance.
