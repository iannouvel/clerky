The clinical guideline addresses the diagnosis, assessment, and management of preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (PPROM) in pregnant women between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation. Key recommendations include using maternal history and sterile speculum examination for diagnosis, offering antibiotics (preferably erythromycin) until labor is established, and providing corticosteroids to women between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks' gestation. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection are also recommended. The guideline emphasizes the importance of emotional support and involving neonatologists when delivery is anticipated. Further research is needed to improve PPROM management. Gynaecologists and support groups are recommended resources for additional information and assistance.
