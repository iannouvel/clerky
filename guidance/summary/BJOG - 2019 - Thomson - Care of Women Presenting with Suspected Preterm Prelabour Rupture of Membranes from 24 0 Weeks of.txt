Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of membranes made by maternal history followed by sterile speculum examination
- Consider IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test if no amniotic fluid observed on speculum examination
- Antibiotic (preferably erythromycin) given for 10 days or until established labor in Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM)
- Offer corticosteroids to women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestation
- Use clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis
- Median latency after PPROM is 7 days and shortens with advancing gestational age

Treatment and Management:
- Erythromycin given for 10 days following PPROM diagnosis
- Offer antenatal corticosteroids from 24+0 to 35+6 weeks gestation
- Consider individual basis for corticosteroid administration due to potential side effects
- Offer intravenous magnesium sulfate to women with PPROM in established labor between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks gestation
- Expectant management until 37+0 weeks in women with no contraindications to continuing pregnancy

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis
- Women advised and observed for symptoms of chorioamnionitis
- Monitor white cell count and C-reactive protein to identify infection
- Record vital signs for inpatients; regular monitoring for outpatients

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Tocolysis not recommended for patients with PPROM
- Outpatient care for women with PPROM should be considered on an individual basis
