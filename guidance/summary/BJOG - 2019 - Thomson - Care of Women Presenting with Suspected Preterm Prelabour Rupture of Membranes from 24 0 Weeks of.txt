The clinical guideline provides key recommendations for the diagnosis and management of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). It emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis through maternal history and speculum examination, as well as the use of IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 tests when necessary. Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and magnesium sulfate are recommended for appropriate cases, with neonatologist involvement and expectant management until 37 weeks gestation. The guideline also highlights the need for emotional support and further research in PPROM management. Gynaecologists are encouraged to refer to relevant resources and support groups for additional information. The guideline was developed by a team of healthcare professionals and will be reviewed periodically for updates.
