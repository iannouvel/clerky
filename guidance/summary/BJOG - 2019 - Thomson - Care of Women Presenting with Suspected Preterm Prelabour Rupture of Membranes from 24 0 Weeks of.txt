The clinical guideline on preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) provides recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, involvement of neonatologists, and management. Key recommendations include diagnosing PPROM through maternal history and speculum examination, offering antibiotics and corticosteroids, diagnosing chorioamnionitis using clinical assessment and tests, and considering expectant management until 37 weeks. Neonatologists should be involved in cases of PPROM, and magnesium sulfate can be offered in established labor. Tocolysis is not recommended, and outpatient care should be individualized. Emotional support and discussions with a neonatologist are important. Corticosteroids should be considered from 24 weeks, and magnesium sulfate offered from 24 to 29+6 weeks. Amnioinfusion is not routine, and expectant management until 37 weeks can be offered. Further research is needed in PPROM management. Links to support groups are provided.
