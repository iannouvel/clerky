The clinical guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for managing Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). It includes tools like the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and HyperEmesis Level Prediction (HELP) to assess severity. First-line antiemetics such as antihistamines and doxylamine/pyridoxine are recommended, with ondansetron as a second-line option. The guideline emphasizes the importance of assessing electrolytes, using combinations of antiemetics, and providing thiamine supplementation. It also addresses mental health impacts, quality of life, and the potential risk of postnatal depression. The guideline aims to guide healthcare providers in diagnosing and managing NVP and HG across various care settings.
