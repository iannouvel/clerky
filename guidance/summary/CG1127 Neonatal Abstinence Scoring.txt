The Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) guideline provides guidance for the assessment and management of NAS in newborns of drug-dependent birth parents. Key recommendations include antenatal care for drug-dependent parents, administration of Hepatitis B vaccine, monitoring for withdrawal symptoms in newborns, starting pharmacological treatment if needed, and discharge planning. It is important to observe newborns for withdrawal symptoms, score their severity, and consider breastfeeding based on the parent's medication. Management includes supportive measures, pharmacological treatment for high NAS scores, and gradual weaning of medication. Discharge is considered when stable NAS scores are achieved, normal sleeping and feeding patterns are observed, and a thorough discharge plan is in place. Providing patient information and auditing tasks are also highlighted in the guideline for comprehensive care of newborns with NAS.
