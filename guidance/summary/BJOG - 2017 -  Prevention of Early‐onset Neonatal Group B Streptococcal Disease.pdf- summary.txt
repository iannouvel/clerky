The clinical guideline for the prevention of early-onset neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of providing pregnant women with information about GBS colonization and neonatal infection risk. While universal screening is not recommended, clinicians should be aware of risk factors and offer antibiotic prophylaxis to women with GBS bacteriuria or previous affected babies. Immediate treatment with penicillin and gentamicin is advised for infected newborns, and breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status. Close monitoring of babies and prompt medical attention for abnormal symptoms are essential. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk term babies. The guideline also provides recommendations for specific scenarios such as preterm labor and planned caesarean sections.
