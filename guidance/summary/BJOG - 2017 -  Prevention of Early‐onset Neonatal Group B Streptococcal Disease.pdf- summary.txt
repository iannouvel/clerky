The clinical guideline for the Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of providing pregnant women with information about GBS colonization and neonatal infection risks. While universal screening for GBS is not recommended, clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for specific cases, such as GBS bacteriuria and known carriers. Immediate treatment with penicillin and gentamicin is advised for infected babies. Breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status. Close monitoring of babies is recommended for high-risk cases, while routine postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not advised. The guideline provides detailed recommendations for different scenarios to prevent EOGBS disease effectively.
