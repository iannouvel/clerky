The clinical guideline for the prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of providing pregnant women with information about GBS colonization and neonatal infection risks. It highlights that universal bacteriological screening for GBS is not recommended, but clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for certain scenarios, such as GBS bacteriuria and known GBS carriers. Immediate treatment with penicillin and gentamicin is advised for babies showing signs of infection. Breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status, and close monitoring is recommended for babies at risk of EOGBS disease. The guideline also provides recommendations on antibiotic use, monitoring, and management of GBS in pregnancy and labor.
