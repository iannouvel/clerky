The clinical guideline for assisted vaginal birth emphasizes the importance of careful assessment, clear communication, and expertise in the chosen procedure. Continuous support during labor, upright or lateral positions in the second stage of labor, and delayed pushing for nulliparous women with epidural analgesia can reduce the need for assisted vaginal birth. Operators should have the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience, and complex assisted births should be performed by experienced operators or under supervision. Aftercare should include prophylactic antibiotics, pain relief, monitoring for urinary retention, and psychological support. Documentation should be detailed, and adverse outcomes should trigger incident reports for risk management. The guideline aims to provide safe care for a range of clinical scenarios involving forceps and vacuum extraction for both rotational and non-rotational assisted vaginal births.
