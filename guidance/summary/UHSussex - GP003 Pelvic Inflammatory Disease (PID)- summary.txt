Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a clinical syndrome caused by ascending infection from the endocervix, with potential complications. Diagnosis can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, but testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia is recommended. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial to prevent long-term sequelae, with inpatient management for severe cases. Patients should rest, abstain from sex, and comply with treatment. Antibiotic regimens vary based on patient characteristics, with a switch from IV to oral antibiotics recommended in certain cases. Removal of IUCD may improve short-term outcomes, but expert opinions on this vary. Close monitoring and referral for all suspected PID cases are essential.
