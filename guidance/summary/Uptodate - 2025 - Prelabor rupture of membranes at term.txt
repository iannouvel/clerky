Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term is the rupture of fetal membranes before regular contractions. Management involves deciding on labor induction or expectant management; induction with oxytocin is preferred for those eligible, while hospitalization is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used when indicated, but avoid prophylactic antibiotics unless specific criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not always require antibiotics. Induction reduces neonatal infection rates, and antibiotic prophylaxis for PROM at term lacks significant benefits. Positive GBS culture warrants antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management includes infection and fetal well-being monitoring, with delivery for specific indications. Antibiotics are not needed for negative GBS culture; manage unknown GBS status based on risk assessment. Maternal and fetal monitoring is crucial in expectant management of term PROM.
