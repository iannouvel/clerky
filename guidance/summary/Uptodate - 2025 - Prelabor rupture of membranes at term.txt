The clinical guideline for term premature rupture of membranes (PROM) focuses on the management of this condition, emphasizing the decision between inducing labor or waiting for spontaneous labor. Inducing labor is recommended to reduce the risk of infection for both the mother and newborn. Oxytocin induction is preferred for patients without contraindications. Expectant management can be considered for uncomplicated pregnancies where patients prefer to wait for labor to start. Hospitalization is advised for PROM cases to decrease complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used when necessary, but it is generally avoided unless specific criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not always require immediate intervention. The guideline highlights the importance of monitoring for signs of infection and fetal well-being during expectant management. It also stresses that antibiotic prophylaxis is not needed for patients with negative GBS cultures and that management for those with unknown GBS status should be based on standard risk assessment.
