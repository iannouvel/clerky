Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Diagnosis of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term is confirmed by the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of regular contractions.
- Clinical presentation includes the absence of contractions following membrane rupture at term gestation.

Treatment and Management:
- The key decision is whether to induce labor or wait for spontaneous labor to begin.
- Inducing labor with oxytocin is preferred for patients without contraindications to labor and vaginal birth.
- Expectant management may be considered for patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who prefer to wait for labor to begin.
- Hospitalization is recommended to reduce the risk of complications.
- Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used when indicated, but prophylactic antibiotics for term PROM should be avoided unless specific criteria are met.
- In cases of ruptured membranes and positive Group B streptococcus (GBS) culture, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitoring for signs of infection and fetal well-being is essential during expectant management.
- Maternal and fetal monitoring should be performed in expectantly managed term PROM.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications to labor induction include specific clinical scenarios that warrant careful consideration.
- Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for patients with negative GBS culture.
- Patients with unknown GBS status should be managed based on standard risk assessment.
