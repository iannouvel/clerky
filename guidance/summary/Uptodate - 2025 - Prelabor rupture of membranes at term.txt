Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term involves the early rupture of fetal membranes before contractions. Management decisions include inducing labor to reduce infection risk or waiting for spontaneous labor. Oxytocin induction is preferred for uncomplicated cases, while expectant management is an option for low-risk patients. Hospitalization is recommended to monitor for complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively. Induction with oxytocin reduces neonatal infections. GBS status influences antibiotic use. Expectant management includes infection and fetal monitoring. Monitoring and decisions should be based on individual risk assessment.
