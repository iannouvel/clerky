The clinical guideline for the Management of Premenstrual Syndrome recommends recording symptoms over two cycles using a diary, considering referral to a gynaecologist for severe cases, and utilizing a multidisciplinary team approach. Treatment options include drospirenone-containing COCs, percutaneous estradiol with progestogens, cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs, and spironolactone. GnRH analogues are effective but reserved for severe cases, with surgery as a last resort. Complementary therapies, such as CBT and phytomedicine, may also be beneficial. The guideline provides a decision-making algorithm for PMS treatment, emphasizing individualized care and a holistic approach to managing symptoms.
