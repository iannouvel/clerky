This guideline focuses on screening for Down's, Edward's, and Patau's Syndromes, involving antenatal screening coordinators, obstetric consultants, and senior midwifery staff. It recommends offering NIPT screening for T21, T18, and T13 after a higher chance result from combined or quadruple tests, with options for no further testing, NIPT screening, or prenatal diagnosis. Results are reported as lower or higher chance, with testing available up to 21+6 weeks and results expected in 2 weeks. Women with IVF or donor egg pregnancies are eligible for screening. Referral and follow-up procedures are outlined for abnormal results, with emphasis on education and training for midwives. The guideline also includes monitoring and audit processes to ensure optimal care for patients with confirmed diagnoses.
