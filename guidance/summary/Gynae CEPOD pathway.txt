This clinical guideline outlines the assessment and management of patients presenting with various gynecological conditions such as Bartholin's cyst/abscess, vulva abscess/haematoma, retained products of conception, and possible ectopic pregnancy. The guideline includes criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) assessment to determine the need for admission to level 11. Planned procedures may include marsupialization, incision & drainage, evacuation of retained products of conception, diagnostic laparoscopy, or other specified interventions. The checklist emphasizes completing necessary forms, contacting the CEPOD coordinator, and ensuring patient information and admission arrangements. Fast-track CEPOD days are highlighted for expedited care. The guideline also addresses nurse-led discharge post-operation and the gynecology CEPOD pathway for efficient management of these conditions.
