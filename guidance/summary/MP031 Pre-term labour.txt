**Summary of Preterm Labour Clinical Guideline**  

Preterm labour, defined as regular, painful contractions with cervical changes before 37 weeks, requires urgent obstetric assessment. Fetal fibronectin testing is recommended between 22+0 and 34+6 weeks for symptomatic women. Key investigations include fetal growth ultrasound, MSU/HVS, and monitoring of blood tests and sensitivities.  

Antenatal corticosteroids (23-34+6 weeks) reduce neonatal respiratory distress. Tocolytics may delay delivery in preterm rupture of membranes, while magnesium sulfate offers fetal neuroprotection in early preterm birth. Mode of delivery should be consultant-led, with cesarean section not routinely advised for breech presentation. Neonatal support is essential at delivery, avoiding opiates in labour.  

Additional considerations include preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, Group B Strep prophylaxis, and extreme preterm birth management (<27 weeks). Parental guidance for very premature infants is provided in appendices. Management aligns with NICE guidelines on antenatal/intrapartum care and diabetes in pregnancy.
