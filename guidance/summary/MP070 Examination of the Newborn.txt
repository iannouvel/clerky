**Summary of Newborn Examination Guideline (RSCH PRH MP070)**  

The newborn examination must be performed within 72 hours of birth to detect congenital abnormalities, provide early health education, and ensure timely referrals. Key components include clinical history review, observation, and a full physical examination.  

Qualified practitioners (Consultant Neonatologists, Neonatal medical staff, or trained Midwives) may conduct the exam. Midwives can assess infants ≥37 weeks with uncomplicated deliveries (vaginal, instrumental, or LSCS), low-risk meconium observations, and no concerning maternal history. Exclusions include preterm (<37 weeks), traumatic/complicated deliveries, antenatal abnormalities, or lack of parental consent—these cases require referral.  

Documentation must include informed consent, examination findings, and any deviations from normal. Clear communication with parents is essential, discussing procedures and outcomes. Abnormal findings warrant prompt referral for further investigation. All referrals must be recorded in postnatal notes.
