The clinical guideline outlines the Baby Abduction Policy at Brighton and Sussex NHS Trust, focusing on ensuring a safe environment and preventing baby abductions. Key principles include commitment to safety, responsibilities of staff, and immediate actions in case of abduction. Maternity, portering, security, and switchboard staff must adhere to the guidance and act swiftly. Immediate actions involve informing security and the police. Ongoing actions include moving parents to a private area, checking identification, and cooperating with authorities. Training for staff on abduction risks is essential, and audits will be conducted after each incident. The policy emphasizes fairness, respect, and dignity in line with Human Rights FREDA principles.
