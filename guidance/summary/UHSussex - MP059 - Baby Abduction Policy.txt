Clinical guidance for Baby Abduction Policy at Brighton and Sussex NHS Trust (RSCH PRH only) includes a commitment to staff, service-user, and visitor safety with a focus on baby and infant safety. The protocol aims to prevent and address suspected or actual baby abductions, applicable to maternity, portering, security, and switchboard staff. Responsibilities involve adherence to guidance, swift action in case of abduction, and regular review by management. Immediate actions for suspected or actual abductions include informing security, contacting the police, and coordinating response. Ongoing actions include moving parents to a private area, checking identification bands, reassuring mothers, and cooperating with the police. Media inquiries are managed by the Trust's Communications Manager and senior management. Training for maternity and neonatal staff covers abduction risks and actions. Monitoring includes audits after reported abduction incidents. The policy upholds fairness, respect, equality, dignity, and autonomy in line with Human Rights FREDA principles.
