### **Bladder Care and Management in Labour & Postnatal Period – Clinical Summary**  

This guideline outlines evidence-based bladder care for women and birthing people during labour and postnatally, focusing on preventing overdistension, infection, and bladder/urethral damage. Key recommendations include:  

- **Monitoring & Prevention:** Encourage regular voiding, monitor fluid intake, and assess risk factors for voiding dysfunction.  
- **Catheterization:** Use in-dwelling catheters (IDC) for high-risk cases (e.g., spinal/epidural analgesia, operative birth, PPH, 3rd/4th-degree tears, or extensive perineal trauma).  
- **Bladder Scan Management:**  
  - **<200 mL:** Hydration advice, trial without catheter (TWOC).  
  - **200–500 mL:** In-out catheter, restart TWOC.  
  - **500–1000 mL:** IDC for 24h, urine dip/CSU, then repeat TWOC.  
  - **>1000 mL or failed TWOC:** IDC for 7 days, obstetric review, and continence nurse referral.  
- **Post-TWOC Assessment:**  
  - If voided volume >200 mL and post-void residual <150 mL, discharge.  
  - If dysfunction persists, reinsert IDC for 7 days.  
- **Documentation & Follow-Up:** Record voiding volumes, ensure timely catheter removal, and refer for physiotherapy or continence support if needed.  

The guideline emphasizes proactive management to restore bladder function and prevent complications.
