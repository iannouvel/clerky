The 2014 UK National Guideline on the Management of Vulval Conditions provides recommendations for managing various vulval disorders. General advice for all conditions includes avoiding irritants, informing the GP, considering STI screening, and assessing for sexual dysfunction. Specific conditions like vulval lichen sclerosus and vulval lichen planus have distinct symptoms, signs, complications, and treatment with ultra-potent topical steroids. Referral to a vulval clinic is recommended for certain cases. Vulval eczema, lichen simplex, and vulval psoriasis have their management strategies involving topical corticosteroids and lifestyle modifications. Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia requires referral for colposcopy and specific treatment options. Vulvodynia management involves a multidisciplinary approach, with treatment options like topical local anesthetics, physical therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and surgery. Follow-up is essential for monitoring progress and providing psychological support. Unprovoked vulvodynia is managed similarly as a chronic pain syndrome. Various treatment modalities like tricyclic antidepressants and referral to a pain clinic may be necessary.
