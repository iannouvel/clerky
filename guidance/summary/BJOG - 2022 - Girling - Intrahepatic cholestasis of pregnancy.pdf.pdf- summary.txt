The clinical guideline for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) emphasizes the importance of considering the diagnosis in pregnant women with itching and elevated bile acid levels. Additional investigations are not routinely recommended but may be considered based on individual factors. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe or atypical cases. The risk of stillbirth increases with higher bile acid concentrations, with recommendations for planned birth timing based on severity. Monitoring should be individualized, and fetal monitoring does not predict stillbirth. Treatment for itching may have limited benefit, and follow-up after birth is essential. Future research should focus on predicting adverse outcomes and effective treatments.
