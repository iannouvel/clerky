This clinical guideline focuses on the management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women, emphasizing the importance of accurate assessment and differentiation between benign and malignant masses. It highlights the preference for conservative management, with laparoscopic surgery recommended for benign masses and referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspected malignancies. The guideline also discusses the use of ultrasound and additional tests for complex masses, as well as the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) for estimating the risk of malignancy. It provides recommendations for follow-up and surgical intervention based on the size and characteristics of the ovarian cysts.
