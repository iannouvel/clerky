The clinical guideline for Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) emphasizes the importance of thorough assessment and individualized management for women with a positive pregnancy test but no visible pregnancy on ultrasound. Key principles include collaboration with senior colleagues, adherence to national guidelines, and responsibility of all healthcare professionals involved in early pregnancy care. The objective is to identify the location of the pregnancy and ensure resolution without complications, considering the possibility of ectopic pregnancy. Further management is tailored to clinical signs and symptoms, with a focus on providing written information and access to emergency care for women with PUL. It is advised to seek medical attention for severe pain or feeling unwell and to avoid travel to areas without immediate medical care.
