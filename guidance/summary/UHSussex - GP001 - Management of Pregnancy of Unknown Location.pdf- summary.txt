The clinical guideline for Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluation and individualized management for women with a positive pregnancy test but no visible pregnancy on ultrasound. Key principles include collaboration with senior colleagues, adherence to national guidelines, and accessibility of the protocol to relevant staff. Responsibilities are outlined for nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, and obstetricians to ensure proper care for women with PUL. The guideline highlights the need to consider ectopic pregnancy, conduct necessary tests, and provide written information to women for emergency care access. Further management is based on clinical signs and symptoms, with a reminder to advise women to seek immediate medical care for severe symptoms.
