The clinical guideline for the Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) emphasizes the importance of collaboration with senior colleagues and adherence to national/RCOG guidelines. Nurses, Midwives, Gynaecologists, and Obstetricians are responsible for following and understanding the guidance, with the Management Team ensuring regular review and accessibility. PUL refers to a positive pregnancy test without a visible pregnancy on ultrasound, requiring careful management to determine the location of the pregnancy and prevent complications. Ectopic pregnancy should be considered until location is confirmed, with individualized further management based on symptoms and hCG levels. Women with PUL should be provided with written information for emergency care access and advised to seek medical attention for severe symptoms.
