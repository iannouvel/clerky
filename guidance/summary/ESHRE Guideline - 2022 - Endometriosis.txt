ESHRE guideline for endometriosis highlights delayed diagnosis, treatment with hormone therapy and surgery, pain management, surgical options, fertility treatments, and psychological support. Surgical excision is preferred over ablation, continuous OCP use for pain relief, and various effective treatments including GnRH agonists, progestogens, and aromatase inhibitors. Research is needed for treatment decisions. Surgical management improves symptoms and quality of life, with considerations for type of surgery, recurrence rates, and post-surgery hormone treatment. Non-medical strategies like acupuncture may offer relief. ART outcomes are uncertain, and ovarian cystectomy can prevent symptom recurrence. Diagnosis includes imaging techniques, with surgical removal for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis. Endometriosis is not significantly linked to overall cancer risk but may slightly increase ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer risk. Hormone treatments can impact cancer risk. Vigilance is advised during pregnancy for endometriosis management.
