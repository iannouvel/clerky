Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory condition in women of reproductive age, presents with pain and infertility. Diagnosis involves imaging and laparoscopy. Management includes hormone therapy and surgery, guided by symptoms and fertility desires. Infertility treatments like IUI and ART can be considered. Hormone therapy post-surgery aids in pain management. Avoid unnecessary treatments in asymptomatic cases. Monitoring involves follow-up and psychological support. Risks include cancer and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment improve outcomes. Surgical and medical interventions are essential, with shared decision-making. Adjunct therapies like acupuncture may be considered. Ovarian suppression is ineffective for fertility. Hormone therapy prevents recurrence. Aromatase inhibitors may benefit postmenopausal women. Monitoring parameters include symptom improvement and fertility outcomes. Tibolone is a safe alternative for hormone therapy in menopause. Diagnosis and management of abdominal and thoracic endometriosis differ. Genetic testing is for research. Endometriosis does not significantly increase cancer risk. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy may not be beneficial. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is not recommended without additional risk factors. Shared decision-making is crucial for pain management.
