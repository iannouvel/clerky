**Summary of Maternity Protocol MP026: Triage of Maternity Patients**  

This protocol standardizes the non-elective admission and assessment of maternity patients to ensure timely, appropriate care. Key recommendations include:  

- **Initial Assessment:** Midwives must conduct triage within **15-30 minutes** of arrival using the **Birmingham Symptom-specific Obstetric Triage System (BSOTS)** for prioritization.  
- **Roles & Responsibilities:**  
  - Midwives perform initial assessments.  
  - Obstetric staff respond promptly and escalate if capacity is exceeded.  
  - Maternity Care Assistants (MCAs) support but do not conduct triage observations.  
- **Patient Assessment:** Includes **gestation, obstetric history, MEOWS, CTG, and lab results**, with immediate care guided by BSOTS algorithms.  
- **Referral & Escalation:** Clear criteria for urgent obstetric assessment; delays must be escalated and documented.  
- **Ongoing Management:** Timely treatment based on BSOTS category, effective handover, and prompt action on pending results.  
- **Discharge & Follow-up:** Patients may be admitted, transferred, or discharged with follow-up arranged as needed.  
- **Communication:** Clear explanations, reassurance, and use of translation services for non-English speakers.  

The protocol ensures standardized, efficient triage while maintaining patient safety and appropriate resource allocation.
