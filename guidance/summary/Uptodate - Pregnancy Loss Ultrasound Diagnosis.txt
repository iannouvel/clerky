Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Pregnancy loss, or miscarriage, is defined as a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 20 weeks of gestation.
- Early pregnancy loss occurs in the first trimester and is the most common type.
- Diagnosis is confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound evaluation.
- Ultrasound criteria for diagnosis include:
  - Gestational sac 25 mm in mean diameter without a yolk sac or embryo.
  - Embryo with a CRL 27 mm without cardiac activity.
  - Absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 22 weeks from a prior ultrasound showing a gestational sac without a yolk sac.
  - After a pelvic ultrasound showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac, absence of an embryo with a heartbeat in 21 days.
  - Initial criteria for nonviable early pregnancy include CRL of 5 mm without cardiac activity and an empty gestational sac measuring 16 mm in mean diameter.
- Challenging scenarios in early pregnancy assessment include gestational duration discrepancy, multiple gestations, and pregnancy of unknown location.
- Additional ultrasound findings suggestive of non-viable pregnancy include expanded or empty amnion.
- Findings suggestive of poor outcome include irregularly shaped gestational sac, moderate or large subchorionic hematoma, and chorionic bump.
- Findings consistent with live pregnancy include a gestational sac with a yolk sac only and a normal pregnancy with amnion.

Treatment and Management:
- Guidelines recommend transvaginal ultrasonographic diagnosis of pregnancy failure in a woman with an intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability.
- Diagnosis of early pregnancy loss is made using transvaginal ultrasound.
- Various ultrasound criteria are used to diagnose pregnancy loss.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitoring of gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity may be needed.
- Frequency of monitoring may vary based on clinical context.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- No specific contraindications mentioned.
- Risk factors include varying levels of stringency in ultrasound techniques and the consideration of false-positive rates in diagnosis.
