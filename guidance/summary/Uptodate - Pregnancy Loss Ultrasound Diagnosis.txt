Pregnancy loss, or miscarriage, is a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 20 weeks gestation, commonly occurring in the first trimester. Diagnosis involves transvaginal ultrasound confirming intrauterine gestation and excluding ectopic pregnancy, with criteria based on gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity. Ultrasound at seven weeks gestation is recommended to identify embryonic cardiac activity. Criteria include a gestational sac ≥25 mm without a yolk sac or embryo, embryo with crown-rump length (CRL) ≥7 mm without cardiac activity, and absence of embryo with heartbeat within 21 days. Challenges include gestational duration discrepancy, multiple gestations, and pregnancy of unknown location. Additional findings suggesting nonviable pregnancy include expanded or empty amnion, irregular gestational sac, subchorionic hematoma, and chorionic bump. Live pregnancy indicators include gestational sac with yolk sac only and normal amnion. Stringency varies among studies, with false-positive rate (FPR) consideration important in diagnosis, dependent on sonographer expertise and equipment quality.
