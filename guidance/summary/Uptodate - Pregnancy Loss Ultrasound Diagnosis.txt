The clinical guideline provides recommendations for diagnosing pregnancy loss through transvaginal ultrasound evaluation in cases of nonviable intrauterine pregnancies up to 20 weeks of gestation. Key points include confirming intrauterine gestation and excluding ectopic pregnancy through ultrasound, with specific criteria for diagnosing pregnancy loss based on gestational sac diameter and cardiac activity. Various ultrasound criteria are outlined for different levels of diagnostic certainty, considering patient preferences and clinical context. Challenges in assessment, such as gestational duration discrepancies and multiple gestations, are discussed. Additional ultrasound findings suggestive of non-viable or poor outcomes are highlighted. The guideline emphasizes the importance of expertise in sonography and equipment quality in making accurate diagnoses. The document also mentions the need for further research to compare ultrasound techniques and consider the false-positive rate in diagnosis.
