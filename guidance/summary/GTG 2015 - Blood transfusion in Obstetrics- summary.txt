The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics provides recommendations for optimizing haemoglobin levels in pregnant women, diagnosing and treating anaemia, and managing obstetric haemorrhage. It emphasizes the importance of obtaining valid consent for blood transfusions, regular blood group and antibody screening, and using compatible blood components. Strategies to minimize the use of banked blood, such as active management of the third stage of labor and mechanical strategies to reduce postpartum blood loss, are highlighted. Recommendations for transfusion of red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets during major obstetric hemorrhage are also outlined. The guideline advocates for evidence-based practices and multidisciplinary input in managing obstetric blood transfusions.
