The clinical guideline for the Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of providing pregnant women with information about GBS colonization and neonatal infection risk. Universal bacteriological screening is not recommended, but clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease.
