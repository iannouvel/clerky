Diagnostic criteria for genital herpes in pregnancy include suspected or confirmed infection with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2. Clinical presentations vary, with risk factors including maternal infection type, duration of rupture of membranes, and mode of delivery. Management involves treating first episode genital herpes with aciclovir, considering symptomatic relief with paracetamol and lidocaine gel, and offering vaginal delivery with suppressive aciclovir from 36 weeks gestation to reduce lesions and shedding. Caesarean section is advised for third trimester acquisitions to prevent neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can differentiate primary from recurrent infections, influencing management decisions. Recurrent genital herpes management is based on clinical assessment, with caesarean section recommended for primary episode lesions at delivery and vaginal delivery for recurrent lesions. Daily suppressive aciclovir is recommended for women with HIV and HSV co-infection. Neonatal management involves informing the neonatal team, appropriate testing, and efforts to prevent postnatal transmission. Monitoring includes lumbar puncture for HSV PCR if necessary, and starting aciclovir 20 mg/kg tds for 10 days while awaiting results. Contraindications include high-risk obstetric indications for caesarean section within 6 weeks of delivery.
