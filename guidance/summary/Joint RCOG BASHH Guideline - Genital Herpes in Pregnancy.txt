The clinical guideline for the Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy provides recommendations for healthcare professionals on the care of pregnant women with genital herpes simplex virus infection. It covers antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, including the use of aciclovir for treatment and prevention of neonatal herpes transmission. The guideline recommends vaginal delivery for most cases, with caesarean section advised for women with third trimester acquisition of herpes. It also addresses the management of recurrent herpes and the importance of preventing postnatal transmission. Stakeholder involvement and a comprehensive literature search informed the development of this guideline to ensure evidence-based recommendations for the management of genital herpes in pregnancy.
