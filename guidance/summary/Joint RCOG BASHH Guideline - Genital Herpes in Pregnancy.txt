The clinical guideline on the management of genital herpes in pregnancy provides recommendations for healthcare professionals caring for pregnant women with genital herpes infections. Key points include treating first episodes with aciclovir, considering symptomatic relief options, and offering vaginal delivery with suppressive aciclovir therapy from 36 weeks gestation. Caesarean section is advised for third trimester acquisitions to prevent neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can guide management decisions. Recurrent genital herpes in pregnant women generally has a low risk of neonatal transmission, allowing for vaginal delivery in most cases. Daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered for recurrent infections. For HIV-positive women with HSV, daily suppressive aciclovir is recommended. Neonates born to mothers with HSV should be monitored and treated appropriately to prevent postnatal transmission. The guideline emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary team discussions and appropriate testing and treatment strategies.
