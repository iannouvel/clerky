Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended for women at risk of preterm birth to reduce perinatal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, and other complications. It is essential to offer corticosteroids to women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation when imminent preterm birth is anticipated, as well as to those with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Timely administration within 48 hours prior to birth is crucial for maximum effectiveness, with benefits also seen within 24 hours. However, caution is advised in diabetic women and when birth is delayed more than 7 days after treatment. Repeat courses may be considered in specific cases, with potential risks and benefits to be carefully weighed.
