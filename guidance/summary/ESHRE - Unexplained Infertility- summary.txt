The Unexplained Infertility Guideline 2023 offers evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of couples with unexplained infertility. It emphasizes outcomes such as live birth rates, safety, and individualization of care. Key recommendations include avoiding routine tests like midluteal serum progesterone measurement and post-coital testing. Tests for confirmation of ovulation, ovarian reserve, and tubal patency are discussed, while genetic or genomic tests are not recommended. Treatment options include expectant management, IUI with ovarian stimulation, and avoiding unnecessary procedures like hysteroscopy. Lifestyle interventions, psychological support, and healthy diet are recommended. Research gaps and future directions for improving outcomes in couples with unexplained infertility are highlighted.
