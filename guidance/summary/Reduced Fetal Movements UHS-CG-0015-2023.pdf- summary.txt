The Reduced Fetal Movements Guideline aims to reduce stillbirths by ensuring pregnant individuals report reduced fetal movements promptly. Developed by obstetric leads and midwives, the guideline outlines assessment and management recommendations based on gestational age. It emphasizes the importance of timely referrals, risk factor assessment, and monitoring fetal viability through CTG and ultrasound scans. For recurrent episodes, serial growth scans are recommended, with induction of labor or cesarean birth considered if necessary. Continuous monitoring in labor is advised for induced cases. Process and outcome indicators track guideline adherence and outcomes. Clear communication and follow-up are essential for ensuring the safety and well-being of both the pregnant individual and the fetus.
