The Reduced Fetal Movements Guideline aims to reduce stillbirths by ensuring pregnant women and people are aware of reporting reduced fetal movements and that healthcare providers follow appropriate referral pathways. Risk factors for RFM include SGA fetus, placental insufficiency, and maternal conditions like hypertension. Management varies based on gestational age, with assessments and interventions tailored to each stage of pregnancy. Induction of labor may be considered in cases of recurrent RFM. Process and outcome indicators track adherence to guidelines and outcomes. Continuous monitoring during labor induction is recommended. The guideline emphasizes prompt action and thorough assessment to ensure the safety of both the mother and baby.
