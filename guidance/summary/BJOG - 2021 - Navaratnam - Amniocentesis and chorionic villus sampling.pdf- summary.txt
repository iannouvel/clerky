Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests that come with a risk of miscarriage and should be performed by trained operators after careful consideration. It is important to inform women about the risks and provide support throughout the process. Screening for blood-borne viruses is crucial before undergoing these procedures, especially for HIV-infected pregnant women. Amniocentesis may increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B if viral load is high, but there is no evidence of risk for Hepatitis C. Healthcare providers should maintain competency, follow guidelines for timing and technique, and consider individualized risks for each patient.
