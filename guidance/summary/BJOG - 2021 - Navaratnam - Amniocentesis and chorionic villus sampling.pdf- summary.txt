Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests that come with a risk of miscarriage, especially for women with multiple pregnancies. It is important to provide proper support and information to women and their partners throughout the screening process. These procedures should be performed by trained operators and results should be carefully interpreted. Blood-borne viruses should be screened for before undergoing invasive testing, and antiretroviral treatment should be optimized for HIV-positive pregnant women. Amniocentesis has shown an increased risk of Hepatitis B transmission, but no evidence of risk for Hepatitis C. Research on amniocentesis in HIV-infected pregnant women has been conducted to assess the risk of mother-to-child transmission.
