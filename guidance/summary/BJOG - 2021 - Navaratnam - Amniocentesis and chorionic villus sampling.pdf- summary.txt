Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests that come with a risk of miscarriage, especially for women with multiple pregnancies. These procedures should be performed by trained operators after the recommended gestational weeks to minimize risks. It is important to review screening results for blood-borne viruses before undergoing these tests, especially for HIV-infected pregnant women. There is evidence of increased mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B with high viral loads, but no risk of transmission for Hepatitis C. Care should be taken to provide appropriate support and counseling for women and their partners throughout the prenatal screening process.
