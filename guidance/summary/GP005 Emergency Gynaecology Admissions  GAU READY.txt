### **Emergency Gynaecology Admissions & GAU Protocol Summary**  

This guideline outlines the management of women presenting with acute gynaecological conditions, ensuring timely assessment and appropriate care. Key principles include prompt evaluation, structured referral pathways, and multidisciplinary collaboration.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Initial Assessment:** All women require baseline observations and a comprehensive history. Conditions include hyperemesis, pelvic pain, and abnormal bleeding.  
- **Early Pregnancy Problems (<14 weeks):** Urgent assessment for ectopic pregnancy and other complications, with clear referral pathways.  
- **Ovarian Torsion:** Requires emergency surgery within 6 hours.  
- **Stable Patients:** Refer to the Gynaecology Assessment Unit (GAU) for further evaluation.  
- **Unstable Patients or Emergency Surgery:** Direct to CEPOD (emergency theatre) or transfer to a tertiary center if needed.  

**Clinical Management:**  
- **GAU Access:** Available 24/7 for stable, non-pregnant women with gynaecological conditions. Unstable patients or those requiring immediate surgery should bypass GAU.  
- **Transfer Protocols:** Defined processes for inter-hospital transfers, ensuring stabilization before movement.  
- **Admissions to Other Departments:** Gynaecology patients admitted elsewhere must be reviewed daily and documented on the gynaecology whiteboard.  

**Operational Details:**  
- GAU is co-located with the gynaecology ward, equipped with ultrasound and examination facilities.  
- Clear referral pathways exist for ED, GP, and pregnancy-related cases.  
- Obstetric & gynaecology consultants and on-call teams (SHO/SPR) are available via switchboard.  

Discharge planning, patient communication, and bed management are emphasized to optimize care. Professional judgment should guide decisions alongside these guidelines.
