The clinical guideline for managing women with obesity in pregnancy focuses on optimizing care throughout pregnancy. Key recommendations include pre-conception weight optimization, providing information on risks associated with obesity in pregnancy, offering folic acid supplementation, and ensuring appropriate antenatal care. Maternity units should have protocols for risk assessments, monitoring for gestational diabetes, mental health screening, and fetal surveillance. Labor and birth planning should include discussions on birth options, active labor management, and considerations for cesarean sections. Postpartum care should address weight management, contraception advice, and breastfeeding support. Specialized care is needed for women with prior bariatric surgery. The guideline underscores the need for further research to understand the impact of obesity on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Additionally, the guideline highlights the importance of intrapartum management, mode of delivery, and prevention of complications in obese pregnant women.
