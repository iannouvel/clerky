The clinical guideline on the care of women with obesity in pregnancy, released in November 2018, emphasizes the importance of pre-pregnancy care, antenatal care, information giving during pregnancy, risk assessment, and special considerations for screening, diagnosis, and management of maternal disease in women with obesity. Recommendations include providing information on risks associated with obesity, monitoring weight and height, screening for gestational diabetes, and offering mental health screening. The guideline also addresses fetal surveillance, planning for labor and birth, anesthetic and obstetric outcomes, and postnatal care. It highlights the need for multidisciplinary care and tailored support for women with obesity before, during, and after pregnancy.
