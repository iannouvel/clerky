Primary care should provide weight optimization for women of childbearing age; those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 require information on pregnancy risks and weight loss support, with folic acid 5 mg daily for those planning pregnancy. Antenatal care for obese women should be clinic-integrated, accommodating BMI ≥30 kg/m2, with additional assessments for BMI ≥40 kg/m2; weight, height, and BMI should be measured at booking, and dietetic advice initiated early in pregnancy. Weight loss drugs are contraindicated; mental health and gestational diabetes screening are crucial, with consideration for aspirin and referral to an obstetric anaesthetist for BMI ≥40 kg/m2. Fetal surveillance includes SFH measurements and ultrasound for BMI >35 kg/m2; multidisciplinary labor planning is recommended, with elective induction at term, tailored postnatal contraception advice, and post-bariatric surgery care after 12-18 months. Anesthetic considerations are vital for obese parturients, with postoperative wound care emphasizing prophylactic antibiotics and suturing; postpartum weight loss support and breastfeeding assistance are essential. Planned cesarean delivery may be considered for class III obesity, and induction of labor for large-for-date fetuses should be compared with expectant management. Maternal obesity impacts VBAC success, with trial of labor or repeat cesarean options for morbid obesity and prior cesarean. Obesity increases postpartum hemorrhage and morbidity risk, with antibiotic prophylaxis and wound drainage recommended post-cesarean. Maternal weight, diet, and supplements affect breastfeeding, with interventions to support healthy practices and address postpartum weight retention. Maternal obesity is linked to pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, slower labor, cesarean, wound infection, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, NICU admissions, stillbirth, and neonatal death, with a median obesity prevalence of 33.0% in women.
