The clinical guideline recommends laparoscopic hysterectomy as a safe and effective treatment option for endometrial cancer, requiring patient selection and advanced skills. The procedure aims to reduce hospital stay and recovery time compared to open surgery, with high overall and disease-free survival rates. Safety outcomes indicate lower rates of postoperative complications with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Healthcare professionals are urged to consider this guidance when making clinical decisions, with local commissioners and providers responsible for implementation. More information is available on the NICE website, and the guidance has been endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland. Copyright restrictions apply, contact NICE for further details.
