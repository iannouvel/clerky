The clinical guideline for the management of Bladder Pain Syndrome emphasizes the importance of initial assessment through medical history, physical examination, and symptom classification. Conservative treatments such as dietary modifications, stress management, and pharmacological options like oral amitriptyline are recommended. Intravesical treatments may be considered if initial measures fail. Referral to secondary care and multidisciplinary team meetings are advised for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Pregnancy considerations, treatment safety, and potential risks are outlined. The guideline also discusses the use of complementary therapies, the impact of comorbidities, and the need for further research to enhance treatment options for BPS.
