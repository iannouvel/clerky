The clinical guideline for the management of Bladder Pain Syndrome provides recommendations for the initial assessment, diagnosis, and management of this chronic pain condition. Key points include the importance of a thorough medical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations such as bladder and food diaries. Conservative treatments, including dietary modifications and stress management, are recommended initially, with pharmacological options such as oral amitriptyline considered if needed. Intravesical treatments may be used in refractory cases, and further options should be considered after referral to a pain clinic. The guideline also highlights treatments that are not recommended and emphasizes the importance of follow-up care and support for patients with BPS.
