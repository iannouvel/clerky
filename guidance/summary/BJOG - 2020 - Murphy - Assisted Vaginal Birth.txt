Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Diagnostic criteria: Clinical judgment required for all situations; Relative contraindications include fetal bleeding disorders or predisposition to fracture
- Clinical presentations: Indications for assisted vaginal birth include suspected fetal compromise, lack of progress in labor, maternal exhaustion or distress

Treatment and Management:
- Interventions: Encourage continuous support during labor; Inform about effects of epidural analgesia on need for assisted vaginal birth; Recommend delayed pushing in certain situations; Consider episiotomy to prevent maternal pelvic floor morbidity; Offer prophylactic antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis; Provide analgesia and educate about bladder care after birth
- Protocols: Obtain verbal and written consent before attempting assisted vaginal birth; Use standard classification system; Perform by experienced operators; Discontinue vacuum or forceps birth in certain situations; Choose appropriate instrument based on clinical circumstances and skill level; Monitor for complications during and after birth

Monitoring Requirements:
- Parameters to monitor: Assess, complete, and manage complications during assisted vaginal birth; Reassess for venous thromboembolism risk post-birth; Monitor voiding and offer physiotherapy strategies for urinary incontinence

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications: Blood borne viral infections in the mother are not an absolute contraindication; Vacuum extraction not contraindicated following fetal blood sampling or scalp electrode application
- Risk factors: Maternal morbidity increases significantly after prolonged second stage of labor; Maternal and neonatal complications possible with vacuum and forceps deliveries; Failed forceps birth linked to increased risk of neonatal traumatic injury; Sequential use of instruments associated with increased neonatal morbidity; Consider risks associated with vacuum extraction compared to forceps
