The Assisted Vaginal Birth Green-top Guideline No. 26 from April 2020 provides recommendations for preparing, defining, recommending, and managing assisted vaginal births. Key points include encouraging continuous labor support, informing about epidural effects, promoting different labor positions, and recommending delayed pushing. Clinical judgment is crucial, with relative contraindications like fetal bleeding disorders. Safe assisted births require assessment, communication, and expertise, with ultrasound assessment recommended. Consent must be obtained and documented. Experienced operators should perform assisted births, choosing instruments based on skill level. Post-birth care includes prophylactic antibiotics, analgesia, and psychological support. Documentation should be detailed, and adverse outcomes trigger incident reports. Training in vacuum and forceps birth is essential, with shared decision-making to reduce psychological morbidity. Future plans and follow-up care are vital, emphasizing honesty, adverse event reporting, and a safe maternity unit framework.
