The clinical guideline on Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management focuses on improving the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with early pregnancy complications. Recommendations include providing support and information with dignity, offering early pregnancy assessment services 7 days a week, and recognizing symptoms of ectopic pregnancy for prompt referral. The guideline emphasizes the importance of offering systemic methotrexate or surgery for tubal ectopic pregnancy based on specific criteria. Further research is needed to assess the psychological impact of different interventions on women's emotional recovery. Standardizing practices based on evidence will improve diagnosis and reduce risks, ultimately improving the quality of care for women experiencing early pregnancy loss.
