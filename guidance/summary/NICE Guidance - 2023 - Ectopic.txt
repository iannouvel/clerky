The clinical guideline on Ectopic Pregnancy and Miscarriage focuses on diagnosing and managing early pregnancy complications, including ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Key recommendations include offering pregnancy tests to women of reproductive age with non-specific symptoms, prompt referral for suspected ectopic pregnancy, and utilizing ultrasound scans for diagnosis. For cases of increasing serum hCG levels, a transvaginal ultrasound scan is recommended, with subsequent management based on the findings. Methotrexate or surgical options are advised for unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancies, with specific criteria for each treatment modality. Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis is recommended for Rh-negative women undergoing surgery. The guideline emphasizes the need for further research into the psychological impact of different management approaches and suggests standardizing practices based on evidence to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to minimize psychological distress and prevent adverse outcomes associated with early pregnancy complications.
