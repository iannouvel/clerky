For diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with early pregnancy complications, consider offering a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age with non-specific symptoms; refer women with positive tests and specific symptoms for further assessment; exclude ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors; use ultrasound to diagnose intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies; provide written information for monitoring pregnancies of unknown location. For a woman with >63% increase in serum hCG levels after ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, offer transvaginal ultrasound; confirm intrauterine pregnancy for routine care; if not confirmed, refer for gynaecologist review. For >50% decrease in hCG after 48 hours, provide support, counselling information, and repeat pregnancy test in 14 days; for other hCG changes, refer to early pregnancy assessment within 24 hours. Offer systemic methotrexate for unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancies meeting specific criteria; offer surgery if methotrexate not acceptable or for certain conditions; offer anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis for Rh-negative women undergoing surgery. Conduct research on psychological impact of different treatments for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Standardize practices based on evidence to improve diagnosis and reduce risks. Implement medical and expectant management for miscarriage to reduce surgical interventions and costs. Opt for expectant management for clinically stable women with tubal ectopic pregnancy when appropriate. Early pregnancy loss affects many women's quality of life, with high rates of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies; improvement in diagnosis and management is crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths.
