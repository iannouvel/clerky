Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Consider offering a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age with non-specific symptoms
- Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment
- Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors
- Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies
- Provide written information to women with pregnancies of unknown location for monitoring symptoms

Treatment and Management:
- Offer systemic methotrexate to women with specific criteria for unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy
- Consider surgery if methotrexate is not acceptable or if certain criteria are met
- Offer laparoscopic surgery when surgical treatment is needed
- Offer salpingectomy unless there are other risk factors for infertility
- Offer anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis to all Rh-negative women undergoing surgery for ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor serum hCG levels in women with specific changes after ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage diagnosis
- Monitor symptoms and access to emergency care in women with pregnancies of unknown location
- Perform transvaginal ultrasound scan between 7 and 14 days later for certain cases

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Do not use serum progesterone measurements when diagnosing viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy
- Do not offer anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis to women receiving solely medical management or with certain pregnancy conditions

Risk Factors:
- Women who do not access medical help readily are particularly vulnerable
- About two-thirds of ectopic pregnancy-associated deaths are due to substandard care
