Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity in pregnant women should be assessed through history or serology
- Pregnant women with chickenpox may present with a rash and should contact their doctor immediately
- Chickenpox is infectious before and during the rash, ceasing when lesions crust over
- Susceptibility to varicella infection can be determined through history or serology
- Fetal varicella syndrome (FVS) risk is associated with infection at < 28 weeks of gestation

Treatment and Management:
- Consider varicella vaccination for non-immune pregnant women before or after pregnancy
- Avoid contact with chickenpox and shingles; VZIG recommended if non-immune and exposed
- Pregnant women with chickenpox may be prescribed aciclovir; hospital referral for severe cases
- Delivery timing and mode should be individualized for pregnant women with chickenpox
- Amniocentesis may be considered to detect varicella DNA in the fetus
- Prophylaxis with VZIG is vital for newborns exposed to chickenpox around delivery
- Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox

Monitoring Requirements:
- Assess VZV immunity through history or serology
- Monitor for rash development in pregnant women with chickenpox
- Monitor fetal development for signs of FVS
- Consider amniocentesis for detecting varicella DNA in the fetus

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindicated to give VZIG if more than 10 days since contact or appearance of rash in the index case
- Risks of varicella infection to the fetus include FVS, especially with infection at < 28 weeks of gestation
- Avoid contact with potentially susceptible individuals like neonates and other pregnant women
- Severe infection may require intravenous aciclovir
- Inform women that infection at < 28 weeks of gestation is associated with a small (~1%) risk of FVS
