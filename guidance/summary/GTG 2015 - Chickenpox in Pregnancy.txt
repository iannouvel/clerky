Varicella-zoster contact should be clarified for pregnant women, with initial contact managed by the GP. For those with uncertain chickenpox history or from tropical regions, VZV IgG should be checked; no action is needed if present, while VZIG is recommended if absent. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their GP immediately, avoid contact until lesions crust over, and may be prescribed aciclovir; hospital referral is necessary for severe cases. Delivery should be individualized, and risks to the fetus include FVS, warranting fetal medicine specialist referral. Amniocentesis may detect varicella DNA in the fetus. Neonatal risks can be reduced by delaying delivery after maternal rash onset, and VZIG prophylaxis is crucial for exposed newborns. Breastfeeding is safe. Monitoring includes VZV IgG testing and ultrasound for FVS; prophylaxis with VZIG is essential for susceptible pregnant women. Contraindications include severe infection and fetal varicella before 28 weeks. Symptomatic treatment and hygiene are advised, with aciclovir considered based on gestational age and timing of rash onset. Delivery should be delayed if rash appears within 7 days. Further research is recommended for screening and treatment strategies, with referrals to specialists and neonatologists for affected cases.
