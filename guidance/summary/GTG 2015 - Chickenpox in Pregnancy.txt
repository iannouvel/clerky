This clinical guideline on Chickenpox in Pregnancy focuses on prevention and management strategies for pregnant women. It recommends varicella vaccination for non-immune women, avoiding contact with chickenpox, and testing for VZV immunity if exposed. Treatment with VZIG and aciclovir is advised for non-immune pregnant women with chickenpox. Risks to the fetus and newborn are discussed, with individualized delivery plans for pregnant women with chickenpox. Screening for VZV immunity is not routinely recommended in the UK. Early notification to healthcare providers, isolation, and careful monitoring are essential for pregnant women with chickenpox. Prophylaxis with VZIG is crucial for newborns exposed to chickenpox. Further research and support resources are available for managing chickenpox in pregnancy.
