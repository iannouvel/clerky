This clinical guideline focuses on varicella prevention and management in pregnant women. Key recommendations include considering varicella vaccination for non-immune women, avoiding contact with chickenpox and shingles, and administering VZIG if exposed. Pregnant women with chickenpox should contact their doctor immediately, potentially be prescribed aciclovir, and may require hospital referral for severe cases. Risks to the fetus and newborn are discussed, with individualized delivery plans recommended for pregnant women with chickenpox. Varicella vaccination is deemed cost-effective for susceptible women. Screening for VZV immunity is not routinely recommended. VZIG may be offered to non-immune pregnant women with significant exposure to chickenpox. Awareness of infection risks and prevention strategies is crucial. Prophylaxis with VZIG is vital for newborns exposed to chickenpox around delivery. Breastfeeding is safe for women with chickenpox. Recommendations for further research and audit topics are provided.
