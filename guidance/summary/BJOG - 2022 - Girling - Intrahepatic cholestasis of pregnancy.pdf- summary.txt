The clinical guideline for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) recommends considering ICP in pregnant women with itching and elevated bile acid levels. Additional investigations are not needed for all cases, but may be warranted based on individual factors. Specialist hepatology advice should be sought for severe or atypical cases. The risk of stillbirth increases with higher bile acid concentrations, with different recommendations for planned birth based on severity of ICP. Monitoring should be individualized, and fetal monitoring does not predict stillbirth. Treatment options for itching are limited, and vitamin K may be considered in cases of reduced fat absorption. Follow-up after birth is crucial, and recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is possible. Future research should focus on predicting adverse outcomes and effective treatments for ICP.
