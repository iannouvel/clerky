The clinical guideline for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) recommends considering the diagnosis in pregnant women with itching and elevated bile acid levels. Additional investigations are not needed for every woman with suspected ICP unless there are atypical symptoms or comorbidities. The guideline advises confirming ICP postnatally, with resolution of symptoms and liver function tests. Recommendations for planned birth timing vary based on bile acid levels. ICP may increase the risk of preterm birth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and neonatal unit admission. Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended for severe cases. Further research is needed on predicting adverse outcomes and effective treatments for ICP. Support resources are available for healthcare professionals and families.
