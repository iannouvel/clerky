The clinical guidelines for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) recommend considering the diagnosis in pregnant women with itching and elevated bile acid levels. Additional investigations are only necessary in specific cases, and postnatal confirmation of resolution is advised. The risk of stillbirth increases with higher bile acid levels, with recommendations for planned birth based on severity. Fetal monitoring does not predict stillbirth, and drug treatments for itching have limited benefits. Women with ICP may have a higher chance of preterm birth and other complications. Follow-up care, monitoring, and individualized management are crucial in the care of women with ICP.
