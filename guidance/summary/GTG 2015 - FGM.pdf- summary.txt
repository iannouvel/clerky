This clinical guideline focuses on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and its management, emphasizing the importance of healthcare professionals being aware of the complications, legal responsibilities, and UK laws regarding FGM. Specialized services should be available for women with FGM, offering information, assessments, and de-infibulation. Psychological and sexual function issues can arise with all types of FGM, and referral pathways should be clear. De-infibulation should be considered before pregnancy, and clitoral reconstruction is not recommended. Care during pregnancy, intrapartum, and postnatal periods should be sensitive and comprehensive, with mandatory reporting and documentation procedures in place. Training on FGM is essential for all healthcare professionals, and future research is needed on various aspects of FGM management.
