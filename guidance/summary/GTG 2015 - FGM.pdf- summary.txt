Healthcare professionals must be aware of the complications of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and the legal responsibilities surrounding its reporting and management. Re-infibulation is illegal, and specialized services should be available for women with FGM, offering information, assessments, and de-infibulation. Psychological and sexual complications can arise from FGM, and women should receive appropriate care during pregnancy, including antenatal screening. De-infibulation should be considered before pregnancy, and clitoral reconstruction is not recommended. Reporting of FGM cases must follow legal guidelines, and healthcare professionals should receive mandatory training on FGM. Referral pathways should be clear, and postnatal care should include follow-up for de-infibulation if necessary.
