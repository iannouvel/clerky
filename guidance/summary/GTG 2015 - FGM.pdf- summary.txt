This clinical guideline on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) emphasizes the importance of healthcare professionals being aware of the complications of FGM and their legal responsibilities. It highlights the need for specialized services for women with FGM, offering information, assessments, and de-infibulation. Psychological and sexual function complications can occur with all types of FGM, and referral pathways should be clear. De-infibulation should be considered before pregnancy, and clitoral reconstruction is not recommended. Pregnant women with FGM should receive appropriate care, including antenatal screening and de-infibulation if necessary. Postnatal care should include follow-up for de-infibulation. Mandatory training on FGM for healthcare professionals is recommended, along with the importance of patient confidentiality and adherence to legal and regulatory processes.
