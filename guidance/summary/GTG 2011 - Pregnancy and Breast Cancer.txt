Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females
- Pregnancy-associated breast cancer occurs in younger women and may have an inferior prognosis
- Diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy may be challenging
- Treatment should be based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage

Treatment and Management:
- Optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy should be based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage
- Non-hormonal contraceptive methods are recommended for women with a history of breast cancer
- Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer
- Women planning pregnancy after breast cancer treatment should consult their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon, and obstetrician
- Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception
- Women with estrogen receptor-positive diseases should be advised on the recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment
- Echocardiography should be performed during pregnancy in women at risk to detect cardiomyopathy
- Breastfeeding from the unaffected breast is safe and does not increase the risk of recurrence
- Fertility preservation options should be discussed before treatment, including the use of GnRH analogues and cryopreservation
- Prompt referral to a fertility specialist for assisted conception should be available

Monitoring Requirements:
- Echocardiography during pregnancy in women at risk for cardiomyopathy

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer
- Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy
- Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea with complete loss of germ cells
- Assisted reproduction after breast cancer treatment may be limited due to loss of ovarian reserve

Risk Factors:
- Pregnancy may slightly increase the risk of delivery complications and caesarean section in breast cancer survivors
- Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea can impact fertility
- Age is a major determinant of fertility
