Clinical guidance for women of childbearing age with breast cancer includes multidisciplinary team treatment based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage; non-hormonal contraceptives post-treatment; individualized advice on pregnancy planning considering treatment needs and prognosis; echocardiography for cardiomyopathy risk during pregnancy; joint supervision by obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon during pregnancy; consideration of fertility preservation options pre-treatment, including GnRH analogues and cryopreservation; and prompt referral to a fertility specialist for assisted conception. Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer. Women should generally wait at least 2 years post-treatment before conception, with monitoring for chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity and potential need for hormone replacement therapy for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause. Live birth post-treatment is common, and breastfeeding from the unaffected breast is safe. Consideration of donated eggs and surrogacy for assisted reproduction post-treatment is advised due to potential loss of ovarian reserve. Reproductive concerns, including fertility preservation options like GnRH agonist cotreatment and cryopreservation, should be discussed with patients before initiating treatment to protect ovarian function and address chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.
