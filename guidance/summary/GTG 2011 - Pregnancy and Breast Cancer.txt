The clinical guideline provides guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with breast cancer. It emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach for optimal management. Women diagnosed during pregnancy have a similar prognosis to non-pregnant women, but treatment should consider tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage. Non-hormonal contraception is recommended after treatment, and women planning pregnancy should consult with their healthcare providers. Pregnancy after breast cancer does not adversely affect long-term survival, and women can be reassured about the risk of malformations in children conceived after treatment. Fertility preservation options should be discussed before treatment, and assisted reproduction may be considered if needed.
