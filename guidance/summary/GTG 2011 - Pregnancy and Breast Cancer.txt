The clinical guideline focuses on managing breast cancer in women of childbearing age. Key recommendations include multidisciplinary team treatment, tailored therapy based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage, and non-hormonal contraception post-treatment. Women planning pregnancy post-breast cancer should consult with specialists, with most advised to wait at least 2 years after treatment. Fertility preservation options, like GnRH analogues and cryopreservation, should be discussed before treatment. Pregnancy after breast cancer should be jointly supervised, with considerations for cardiomyopathy risk, delivery complications, and breastfeeding. Assisted reproduction post-treatment may be limited, and hormone replacement therapy may be needed for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause. Addressing reproductive concerns and fertility preservation options is crucial for young women with breast cancer.
