The clinical guideline for the management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) emphasizes the importance of early detection and appropriate treatment for women undergoing fertility treatment. Clinicians must be vigilant for symptoms of OHSS and grade its severity using a standardized classification scheme. Women with severe symptoms may require hospital admission for close monitoring and management. Fluid replacement, LMWH prophylaxis, and paracentesis may be necessary for severe cases. Outpatient management is suitable for mild to moderate cases, with regular monitoring. Pregnancy complicated by OHSS may have increased risks. Further research is needed to improve understanding and management of OHSS.
