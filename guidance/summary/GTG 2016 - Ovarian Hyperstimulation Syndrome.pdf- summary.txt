The clinical guideline for the management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) emphasizes the importance of early recognition and appropriate management of this condition in women undergoing fertility treatment. Clinicians are advised to be vigilant for symptoms of OHSS and to classify its severity according to a standardized scheme. Treatment options include outpatient monitoring, fluid replacement, and LMWH prophylaxis for severe cases. Hospital admission may be necessary for women with critical OHSS or worsening symptoms. Management should be multidisciplinary, with regular assessment and monitoring. Further research is needed to improve understanding and treatment of OHSS, especially in pregnant women.
