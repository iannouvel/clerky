The clinical guideline on the management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) emphasizes the importance of early recognition and appropriate management of this condition in women undergoing fertility treatment. Clinicians are advised to be vigilant for symptoms and signs of OHSS, grade its severity, and report severe cases to regulatory authorities. Management strategies include outpatient monitoring, fluid replacement, LMWH prophylaxis, and multidisciplinary care for critical cases. Pregnancy complicated by OHSS may have increased risks. Further research is needed to enhance understanding and treatment of OHSS. The guideline also provides recommendations for examination, investigation, and treatment of women with suspected OHSS.
