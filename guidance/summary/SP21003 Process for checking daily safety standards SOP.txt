The clinical guideline outlines a standard operating procedure (SOP) for maternity staff at UH Sussex West to ensure daily safety standards are met in maternity units. The document emphasizes the importance of maintaining safety for mothers, babies, and staff. Responsibilities are outlined for midwives and management, including the need for staff to follow the SOP and for management to review and ensure accessibility of the guideline. Safety standards, such as equipment, fire safety, cleaning, and drug room checks, must be documented daily as compliant. If any lapses are found, they should be rectified promptly and escalated to the matron if necessary. Concerns should be raised to the midwife in charge for appropriate actions.
