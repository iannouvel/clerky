This clinical guideline outlines the diagnosis and management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a common condition in late pregnancy characterized by itching and elevated bile acid levels. Perinatal risks include preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and stillbirth. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended for itching, and planned early delivery based on bile acid levels may reduce the risk of stillbirth. Recurrence in future pregnancies is common, and monitoring and counseling on risks and treatment options are crucial. Delivery timing should be based on bile acid levels, and continuous fetal monitoring during labor is recommended. Postpartum resolution of symptoms should be confirmed, with further evaluation if symptoms persist. Patients and family members are at higher risk in future pregnancies.
