This guideline outlines the legal and clinical framework for midwives administering and supplying medications. Midwives can provide specified medicines without a prescription if properly trained, adhering to approved lists and ensuring patient safety. Key requirements include verifying patient identity, assessing for allergies and contraindications, confirming appropriate dosing, and obtaining informed consent. Documentation must comply with trust policies.  

Midwives are accountable for their practice and must only administer medications within their competency. Student midwives require supervision. In inpatient or home birth settings, certain Prescription Only Medicines (POM) may be given without a prescription. If concerns arise, an authorized prescriber must be consulted immediately. Training obligations include policy familiarity, completing required education, and adhering to trust protocols. The guideline applies across all care settings, emphasizing safe, evidence-based medication management.
