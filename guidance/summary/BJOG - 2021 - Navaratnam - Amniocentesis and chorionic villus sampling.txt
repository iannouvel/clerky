Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests with a low risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis should be done after 15 weeks, and CVS after 10 weeks of gestation. Women with multiple pregnancies have a slightly higher miscarriage risk. Screening for blood-borne viruses is crucial before these tests. Care should follow specific guidelines, including providing information on aftercare and pregnancy options based on results. Risks include infection, procedure failure, and fetal injury. Operators must maintain competency and seek help if needed. Severe maternal sepsis is rare. Testing for viruses like HIV and Hepatitis B is important, with low transmission risks if well controlled. Amniocentesis may increase HBV transmission risk with high viral loads. No evidence suggests Hepatitis C transmission risk. Third-trimester amniocentesis may be considered for specific fetal conditions.
