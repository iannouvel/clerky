Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests with a low risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis should be performed after 15 weeks of gestation, while CVS should be done after 10 weeks. Multiple pregnancies slightly increase the risk of miscarriage. Screening for blood-borne viruses is important before invasive tests. Proper training and good practice are crucial to reduce risks. Severe maternal sepsis is rare, and infection can occur from various sources. Third-trimester amniocentesis may be offered for specific fetal conditions. Antiretroviral treatment should be optimized for HIV-positive women. The risk of mother-to-child transmission of HBV increases with higher viral loads. There is no evidence of transmission risk for HCV following amniocentesis.
