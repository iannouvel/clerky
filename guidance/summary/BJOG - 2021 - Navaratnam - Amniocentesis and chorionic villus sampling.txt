Prenatal diagnostic tests amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling have a low risk of miscarriage (<0.5%), with amniocentesis not before 15 weeks and CVS not before 10 weeks gestation. Multiple pregnancies slightly increase miscarriage risk. Review blood-borne virus screening before tests; provide organized care and post-procedure information. Risks include infection, failed procedures, and fetal injury. Maintain competency with Maternal Fetal Medicine training; seek help for difficulties; review operators with >3% normal baby loss rates. Perform amniocentesis after 15+0 weeks and CVS from 11+0 weeks to reduce challenges. Offer third-trimester amniocentesis for specific fetal conditions. Optimize antiretroviral therapy for undetectable viral loads before procedures. Risk of HIV transmission is low with undetectable viral loads; HBV transmission risk increases with viral load >6.99 log copies/ml. No evidence of HCV transmission risk. HBV DNA >500 copies/ml increases HBV transmission risk. No evidence of HCV transmission risk. Studies on amniocentesis in HIV, HBV, and HCV-infected pregnant women show low transmission rates.
