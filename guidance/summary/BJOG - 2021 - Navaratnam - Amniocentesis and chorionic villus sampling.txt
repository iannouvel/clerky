Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Amniocentesis should not be performed before 15 weeks of gestation; CVS should not be performed before 10 weeks of gestation
- Women with multiple pregnancies have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage
- Screening for blood-borne viruses should be reviewed before an invasive test
- Additional risks associated with these tests include infection, failed procedures, and fetal injury

Treatment and Management:
- Maintain competency with Maternal Fetal Medicine subspecialty training, fetal medicine Advanced Skills Training Modules, or equivalent international qualification
- Seek support from a more experienced operator if anticipated/encountered difficulties
- Perform amniocentesis after 15+0 weeks’ gestation; CVS should be performed from 11+0 weeks’ gestation to reduce the risk of technical challenges
- Women considering amniocentesis or CVS in multiple pregnancies should receive detailed counseling and pregnancy mapping
- Optimize antiretroviral treatment to aim for an undetectable viral load prior to amniocentesis or CVS

Monitoring Requirements:
- Review practice where an operator’s annual loss rate of normal babies exceeds 3% for either amniocentesis or CVS
- Monitor viral loads for Hepatitis B to ensure levels are below 6.99 log copies/ml
- Monitor for technical challenges during CVS procedures

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Severe maternal sepsis is a very rare complication
- Infection may arise from organisms present on the skin, ultrasound probe, gel, or via needle puncture of the bowel
- Avoid amniocentesis before 15 weeks of gestation and CVS before 10 weeks of gestation
- Risk of mother-to-child transmission of HBV increases when HBV DNA is over 500 copies/ml
