The clinical guideline for the Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) provides key principles for decision-making, emphasizing the need for professional judgment rather than strict guidelines. It outlines the responsibilities of healthcare professionals in early pregnancy care and highlights the importance of finding the location of the pregnancy to prevent complications. The guideline recommends considering ectopic pregnancy until location is determined, performing specific tests, and providing written information for emergency care access. Further management is individualized based on symptoms, with laparoscopy potentially indicated for symptomatic women. Women with PUL are advised to seek emergency care for severe symptoms and avoid travel to areas without medical care.
