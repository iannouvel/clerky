**Summary of Low Platelet Referral in Pregnancy Protocol**  

This protocol establishes a structured referral pathway for managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, affecting 8-10% of pregnancies, typically mild but potentially serious. Key recommendations include urgent referral to the **Joint Haematology and Obstetric Clinic** for platelet counts **below 50**, with immediate contact to ANC or labor ward if critical. Midwives and obstetricians must ensure prompt action based on platelet levels, providing relevant medical history and prior investigations. For less severe cases (platelets 50-100), standard referral applies, still requiring hematology input. Clear communication between obstetric and hematology teams is essential for timely management. The protocol emphasizes accessibility, compliance, and multidisciplinary coordination to mitigate risks.
