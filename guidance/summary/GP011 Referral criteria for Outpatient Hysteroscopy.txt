**Summary of Referral Criteria for Outpatient Hysteroscopy (OPH) GP011**  

This guideline outlines the referral criteria and management for outpatient hysteroscopy (OPH). OPH is suitable for women with abnormal uterine bleeding (including postmenopausal bleeding), endometrial pathology, irregular/heavy bleeding, Tamoxifen-related bleeding, fertility concerns, or recurrent pregnancy loss.  

Patients must be able to tolerate a speculum and pelvic exam; those with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pregnancy, or significant pelvic pathology are unsuitable. Direct referrals from GPs or GPwSI are accepted after triage, while hospital referrals require consultant approval.  

Pre-procedure, patients receive written information and consent. Ultrasound (USS) results guide further investigation. Adequate analgesia is provided during the procedure. Post-procedure, a clear management plan is given, and results are communicated promptly to the referring clinician and GP. Histology reports are sent to the GP once available.  

The service is delivered by trained consultants and nurses, ensuring efficient triage and follow-up. Professional judgment applies where protocol criteria are not strictly met.
