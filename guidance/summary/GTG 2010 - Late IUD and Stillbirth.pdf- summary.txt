The clinical guideline on Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth aims to provide evidence-based options for women experiencing the loss of a singleton fetus. Recommendations include general care before, during, and after birth, as well as guidance for future pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of diagnosing the cause of stillbirth through tests directed at identifying scientifically proven causes. It also provides recommendations for maternal care, labor induction, pain relief, and psychological support for parents. The guideline highlights the increased risks in subsequent pregnancies after stillbirth and offers recommendations for obstetric care and monitoring. Ultimately, the guideline serves as a framework for maternity clinicians to provide comprehensive care to women experiencing late intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth.
