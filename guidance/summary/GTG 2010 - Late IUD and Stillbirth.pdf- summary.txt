The clinical guideline on Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth aims to provide evidence-based options for women experiencing the loss of a singleton fetus. It covers general care before, during, and after birth, as well as care in future pregnancies. Recommendations include diagnosis using real-time ultrasonography, investigations to determine the cause of death, and special considerations for women who are rhesus D-negative. The guideline also addresses labor and birth recommendations, pain relief options, and postpartum care. Psychological support for parents, bereavement services, and follow-up care are emphasized. The guideline highlights the importance of individualized patient care based on clinical data and available resources.
