The clinical guideline on Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth aims to provide evidence-based options for women experiencing the loss of a singleton fetus. It covers general care before, during, and after birth, as well as care in future pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of maternal choice in diagnosis and care, with recommendations for investigating the cause of late IUFD. Special considerations are outlined for women who are rhesus D-negative. Recommendations also address labor and birth, pain relief, and postpartum care. Psychological support for parents, bereavement services, and follow-up care are highlighted. The guideline stresses the importance of individualized care based on clinical data and resources available.
