The SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 451 addresses the management of asymptomatic endometrial thickening in postmenopausal women. It emphasizes that routine pelvic ultrasound is not recommended for screening for endometrial cancer and that most patients with endometrial cancer present with postmenopausal bleeding. The guideline provides recommendations for further investigations based on individual risk factors and ultrasound findings, with endometrial thickness <11 mm associated with a low risk of malignancy. It also discusses the impact of hormone therapy on endometrial health and provides recommendations for preoperative ripening of the cervix before hysteroscopy. The guideline highlights the importance of individualized care and appropriate management based on specific patient factors.
