The SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 451 on Asymptomatic Endometrial Thickening in Postmenopausal Women provides recommendations for managing postmenopausal women with endometrial thickening. Key points include: not routinely screening with pelvic ultrasound for endometrial cancer, most cases present with postmenopausal bleeding, low malignancy risk with endometrial thickness <11 mm, individualized further investigations based on ultrasound findings and risk factors, and no need for routine screening ultrasounds in asymptomatic women on hormone therapy. Recommendations include endometrial tissue sampling for women with thickness >11 mm or positive ultrasound findings, consideration of individual risk factors for further investigations, and the use of hysteroscopy or dilation and curettage for monitoring or assessment. The guideline also discusses the impact of hormone therapy on endometrial health, management of cervical stenosis, and preoperative considerations for hysteroscopy.
