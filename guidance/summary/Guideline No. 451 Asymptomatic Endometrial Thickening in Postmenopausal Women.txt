Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do not need investigations if endometrial thickness is <11 mm on ultrasound; further investigations should be individualized based on ultrasound findings and personal risk for endometrial cancer. Most endometrial cancer patients present with postmenopausal bleeding; endometrial thickness <11 mm has low malignancy risk. Patients with thickening and risk factors may need assessments; hormone therapies in continuous combined formulation do not increase cancer risk. Routine ultrasound is not recommended for endometrial cancer screening; tamoxifen patients without symptoms do not need routine ultrasound. Endometrial biopsy is accurate for global thickening; invasive procedures have low but significant risk. Endometrial sampling should not be extrapolated to asymptomatic women; those with thickness >11 mm and positive findings need sampling or further investigations based on risk factors. Postmenopausal women with <11 mm thickening and no bleeding or risk factors do not need invasive investigations; transvaginal ultrasound is not for screening. Women with >11 mm thickening should have hysterosonogram, hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, or monitoring; management for cervical stenosis should be individualized. Risk factors for hyperplasia include menopausal status, polycystic ovary syndrome, long menstrual history, infertility, and Lynch syndrome; estrogen-progesterone therapy post-menopause may increase hyperplasia risk. Endometrial cancer is common in postmenopausal women with postmenopausal bleeding; >11 mm thickness or increased vascularity may warrant biopsy. Hormone therapies affect endometrial thickness; levonorgestrel intrauterine system with estrogen, tibolone, and tissue selective estrogen complex are options. Tamoxifen is associated with thicker endometrium; aromatase inhibitors reduce thickness. Cervical stenosis can complicate biopsy; misoprostol is recommended for preoperative ripening.
