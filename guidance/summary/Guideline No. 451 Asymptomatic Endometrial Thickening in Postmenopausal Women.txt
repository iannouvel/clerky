Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do not require investigations if endometrial thickness is <11 mm on ultrasound.
- Most patients with endometrial cancer present with postmenopausal bleeding.
- Endometrial thickness >11 mm is associated with a higher risk of malignancy.
- Clinical characteristics such as menopausal status, polycystic ovary syndrome, a long menstrual history, and infertility may increase the risk of hyperplasia.
- Lynch syndrome is an inherited risk factor for hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.
- Exposure to estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy post-menopause increases the risk of hyperplasia in some studies.

Treatment and Management:
- Endometrial tissue sampling should not be done routinely in asymptomatic women.
- Women with endometrial thickness >11 mm and positive ultrasound findings should have endometrial sampling or further investigations.
- Hormone therapies in a continuous combined formulation do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
- Levonorgestrel intrauterine system combined with estrogen therapy is effective in managing menopausal symptoms.
- Tibolone and tissue selective estrogen complex tablet are options for hormone therapy.
- Aromatase inhibitors can reduce endometrial thickness in postmenopausal patients.
- Routine screening for asymptomatic women on tamoxifen is not recommended.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Endometrial thickness should be monitored on ultrasound.
- Watchful monitoring with repeat ultrasound over 4 months is an option for assessing individual endometrial cancer risk.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Endometrial biopsy should be considered in women with suspected pathology or at high risk for cancer.
- Cervical stenosis can complicate endometrial biopsy.
- Women with cervical stenosis and no bleeding should be managed based on individual factors.
- Routine screening for asymptomatic women on tamoxifen is not recommended.
