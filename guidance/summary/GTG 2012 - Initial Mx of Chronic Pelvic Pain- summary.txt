This clinical guideline aims to provide generalists with evidence-based recommendations for the investigation and management of women presenting with chronic pelvic pain for the first time. Chronic pelvic pain can have a significant impact on a woman's daily life, and accurate diagnosis and effective management are crucial from the first presentation. The guideline covers various contributory factors such as nervous system changes, endometriosis, adhesions, IBS, and psychological issues. It emphasizes the importance of a thorough initial assessment, collaboration between the clinician and the woman, and the consideration of non-pharmacological modalities for pain management. Referral to specialists may be necessary in cases where the pain is inadequately controlled or unexplained.
