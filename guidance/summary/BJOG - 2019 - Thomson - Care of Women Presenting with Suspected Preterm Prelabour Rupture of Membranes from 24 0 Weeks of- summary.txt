The clinical guideline NG25 provides recommendations for the management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). Key recommendations include the use of maternal history and sterile speculum examination for diagnosis, offering antibiotics and corticosteroids, and assessing chorioamnionitis through clinical evaluation. Expectant management until 37 weeks is suggested for women with PPROM after 24 weeks, and magnesium sulfate is recommended for neuroprotection between 24 and 29 weeks. Emotional support, care by obstetricians with preterm birth expertise, and further research for optimal treatments are also highlighted.
