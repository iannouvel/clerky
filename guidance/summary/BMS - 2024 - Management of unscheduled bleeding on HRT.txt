Clinical guidance for managing unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves assessing women for endometrial cancer risk factors and bleeding patterns, offering examinations and investigations as needed, adjusting HRT regimens, and optimizing HRT to reduce bleeding episodes. Recommendations include assessing compliance, considering low-dose preparations, offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options, and adjusting progestogen dose or type based on individual factors. Endometrial assessment should be considered if bleeding persists, with options such as the levonorgestrel 52 mg intra-uterine device for endometrial protection. Referral for ultrasound is recommended based on certain criteria, and adjustments in HRT should be made if bleeding continues. Monitoring parameters include history details, examination findings, and ultrasound results, with recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options provided based on findings. Surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered in certain cases, with hysterectomy as a last resort. Women with endometrial cancer risk factors should be counseled about progestogenic component use, and contraceptive needs should be assessed to reduce unplanned pregnancies. Weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments may help reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes. Regular monitoring and adjustments in HRT regimens are crucial for managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT effectively.
