The British Menopause Society guideline on managing unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) emphasizes assessing women with unscheduled bleeding, identifying endometrial cancer risk factors, and determining when to investigate. Recommendations include adjusting HRT to reduce bleeding episodes, assessing cancer risk factors and bleeding patterns, offering examinations and investigations, and adjusting HRT regimens based on risk factors. The guideline discusses risk factors for endometrial cancer, optimizing HRT with endometrial assessment, and adjusting HRT based on ultrasound findings. It highlights the importance of individualized management strategies, including progestogen adjustments, non-hormonal alternatives, lifestyle modifications, and considering surgical options if needed. The document also addresses the impact of different progestogens and HRT regimens on endometrial protection, emphasizing the use of continuous combined HRT for endometrial safety. Regular monitoring, counseling on contraceptive needs, and timely referrals are crucial components of managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT.
