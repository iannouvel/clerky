Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Assess women with unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) based on bleeding patterns, HRT details, and cancer risk factors
- Offer examinations including abdominal and pelvic assessments, along with investigations like cervical screening and body-mass index (BMI)
- Obtain detailed history covering menstrual history, HRT use, endometrial cancer risk factors, and other relevant factors

Treatment and Management:
- Adjust HRT regimen to reduce unscheduled bleeding episodes
- Consider endometrial assessment if bleeding persists after 6 months
- Offer urgent referral if necessary
- Adjust progestogen or HRT preparation if unscheduled bleeding continues
- Consider different HRT regimens based on individual risk factors for endometrial cancer

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor compliance with HRT
- Consider weight management strategies and lifestyle adjustments to reduce unscheduled bleeding
- Assess endometrial histology to guide adjustments in HRT

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Avoid tricycling progestogen use and shortened progestogen regimens as they may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer
- Caution against unopposed estrogen use in individuals with a uterus due to increased risk of endometrial cancer
- Consider non-hormonal alternatives and reducing estrogen dose if unscheduled bleeding persists
