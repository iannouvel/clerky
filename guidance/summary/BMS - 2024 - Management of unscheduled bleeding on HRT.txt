A guideline for managing unscheduled bleeding on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) emphasizes assessing women for endometrial cancer risk factors, investigating bleeding patterns, and adjusting HRT to reduce episodes. Recommendations include assessing compliance, considering low-dose preparations, and offering alternative progestogens or non-hormonal options based on individual factors. Endometrial assessment and management options are provided, with recommendations for adjusting HRT based on ultrasound findings and endometrial histology. Referral for ultrasound is advised in certain cases, and surgical options like hysteroscopic myomectomy or endometrial ablation may be considered. The document highlights the importance of individualized care and efficient resource utilization in managing unscheduled bleeding on HRT.
