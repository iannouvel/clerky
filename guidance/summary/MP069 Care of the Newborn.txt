The Care of the Newborn guideline offers comprehensive guidance for healthcare professionals involved in newborn care. Immediate care post-birth includes maintaining warmth, preventing heat loss, and promoting skin-to-skin contact. Routine postnatal care involves monitoring general wellbeing, feeding, development, conducting examinations, and screenings. Parents should be educated on various aspects of newborn care, including bathing, feeding, recognizing illness, safe sleeping practices, and immunizations. Key recommendations include seeking medical advice if the baby appears unwell, managing meconium-stained liquor appropriately, monitoring and treating jaundice, and addressing hypoglycemia promptly. The guideline also covers the management of neonatal infections, including the use of antibiotics based on infection type, and guidance for babies born to parents with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization. Monitoring, documentation, and appropriate interventions are crucial for ensuring the well-being of newborns, including late preterm babies who are at increased risk of readmission if discharged prematurely. Risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis are outlined to aid in prompt identification and management.
