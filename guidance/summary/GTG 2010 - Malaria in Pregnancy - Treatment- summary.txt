The clinical guideline emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnant women to prevent adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Prompt treatment with IV artesunate or IV quinine is recommended for severe falciparum malaria, while chloroquine is preferred for other species. Clindamycin should not be used alone. Artemisinin-based combination therapy is preferred over quinine and clindamycin in the second and third trimesters. Radical cure with primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy. Monitoring for complications such as hypoglycemia, pulmonary edema, and anemia is essential. Placental histology and blood films should be evaluated for congenital malaria. Early obstetric management is crucial, with fetal distress monitoring and prevention of preterm labor. Regular screening and appropriate treatment can reduce adverse effects on the fetus.
