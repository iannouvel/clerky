The UH Sussex Perinatal Mental Health Guideline provides guidance for maternity staff in detecting and caring for perinatal mental health risks. Pregnant individuals are encouraged to discuss mental health history at booking and can access NHS Talking Therapy for mild to moderate issues. The Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service is available for severe cases, with referrals made online. Skin-to-skin contact, pain assessment, and good diet/rest are important for emotional wellbeing. High-risk individuals should be referred early to specialist services, with plans in place. In cases of psychiatric emergencies, contact Hospital Mental Health Liaison Team or follow Urgent Review Pathway. Medication risks and benefits should be discussed and documented. Additional support services and contacts are provided for mental health concerns during pregnancy.
