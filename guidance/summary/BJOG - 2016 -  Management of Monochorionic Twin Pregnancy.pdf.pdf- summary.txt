The clinical guideline for the management of monochorionic twin pregnancies emphasizes the importance of early ultrasound examinations to determine chorionicity and monitor fetal viability and growth. Regular fetal ultrasound assessments are recommended every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards, with screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural issues. Specific complications like twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome should be monitored, and treatment should be provided in specialized fetal medicine centers. Delivery of monochorionic twins should be discussed and elective delivery offered from 36 weeks. Various screening methods and criteria for diagnosing growth abnormalities in monochorionic twins are outlined, with a focus on multidisciplinary management and specialized care in fetal medicine centers.
