Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby.
- Important causes of APH: placenta praevia and placental abruption.
- Complicates 3â€“5% of pregnancies; leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality.
- Clinical presentations: spotting, minor haemorrhage, major haemorrhage, massive haemorrhage.
- Recurrent APH: episodes on more than one occasion.
- Assess for signs of clinical shock; blood loss often underestimated.
- Associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
- Unexplained APH increases risk of adverse outcomes.
- Women with repeated APH should be asked about domestic violence.

Treatment and Management:
- Clinical assessment: history-taking, vaginal bleeding assessment, maternal cardiovascular condition, fetal wellbeing.
- Immediate maternal stabilization if major haemorrhage persists or history not available.
- Identify potential causes of APH: placental abruption, placenta praevia.
- Maternal investigations: blood tests, ultrasound scans.
- Fetal investigations: fetal heart rate assessment, ultrasound scans.
- Hospitalization recommended for APH heavier than spotting or ongoing bleeding.
- Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women at risk of preterm birth.
- Tocolytic therapy not recommended for major APH or placental abruption.
- Increased fetal surveillance post-APH for high-risk pregnancies.
- Delivery based on maternal and fetal condition; immediate delivery for compromised cases.
- Management of APH due to placenta praevia: maternal resuscitation, delivery of fetus.
- Caesarean section for maternal or fetal compromise.
- Elective premature delivery not recommended before 37 weeks without compromise.
- Induction of labor may be considered after 37 weeks.
- Continuous fetal monitoring during labor for active bleeding or placental insufficiency.
- Regional anesthesia recommended for operative delivery in APH cases.
- Anti-D Ig for RhD-negative women post-APH.
- Massive APH management: multidisciplinary protocols, blood products as needed.
- Coagulopathy: appropriate transfusions.
- Neonatal assessment by senior pediatrician/neonatologist for major APH cases.
- Postnatal issues: thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, clinical incident reporting.
- Obstetric skill drills for major APH management.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor maternal cardiovascular condition.
- Monitor fetal wellbeing: fetal heart rate, ultrasound scans.
- Monitor hemoglobin, platelets, prothrombin time, activated partial prothromboplastin time, and fibrinogen levels.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Tocolytic therapy contraindicated for major APH or placental abruption.
- Regional anesthesia contraindicated if specific conditions present.
- Women with coagulopathy at risk for appropriate transfusions.
