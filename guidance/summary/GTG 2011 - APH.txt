Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is a significant complication of pregnancy, with placenta praevia and placental abruption being the main causes. It is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and prompt clinical assessment and management are crucial. Triage, maternal stabilization, and investigations are important steps in the management of APH. Delivery may be necessary in cases of maternal or fetal compromise, with caesarean section typically used for placenta praevia. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated, and appropriate blood products should be available for massive APH cases. Continuous fetal monitoring and neonatal assessment are essential for optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on interventions to prevent placental abruption and optimal timing of delivery in cases of unexplained APH.
