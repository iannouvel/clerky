Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy; main causes are placenta praevia and placental abruption. Clinical presentations range from spotting to massive haemorrhage; underestimated blood loss is common. Assess for signs of shock and manage in hospital with resuscitation and emergency operative delivery facilities. Triage includes history, bleeding assessment, maternal cardiovascular status, and fetal wellbeing; maternal stabilization is priority in major haemorrhage. Investigate with blood tests and ultrasound; monitor fetal wellbeing with heart rate assessment and ultrasound. Hospitalize for heavier bleeding; consider corticosteroids for preterm birth risk. Avoid tocolytics in major APH or abruption. Alter antenatal care post-APH with increased surveillance. Delivery timing based on maternal/fetal condition; caesarean for praevia with compromise. RhD-negative women should receive Anti-D Ig. Massive APH requires multidisciplinary management and blood products as needed. Neonates need senior assessment. Postpartum, anticipate hemorrhage and manage actively; obstetric skill drills recommended for APH scenarios. Audit topics include corticosteroid use, Anti-D Ig administration, growth scans referral, third stage labor management, and team training. Future research areas include prevention of abruption, timing of delivery post-unexplained APH, and outcomes of blood product use in APH management. Massive APH management involves designated personnel, ABCD pathway, communication, resuscitation, monitoring, and delivery to control bleeding. Fluid therapy and blood product administration aim to maintain specific hemoglobin, platelets, coagulation parameters, and fibrinogen levels.
