Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of pregnancy and before delivery, commonly caused by placenta praevia and placental abruption. It affects 3-5% of pregnancies and is a significant cause of maternal and perinatal mortality. Clinical assessment is crucial to determine the need for urgent intervention. Maternal stabilization and fetal monitoring are priorities, with investigations such as blood tests and ultrasounds to assess the extent of bleeding. Hospitalization is recommended for moderate to severe bleeding. Delivery timing depends on maternal and fetal conditions, with cesarean section for significant compromise. Management includes resuscitation, monitoring, and potential corticosteroids for preterm birth risk. Anti-D Ig is given to RhD-negative women. Massive APH requires multidisciplinary protocols and blood product transfusions. Postpartum issues like thromboprophylaxis and neonatal assessment are important. Future research areas include prevention of placental abruption and optimal timing of delivery in unexplained APH cases. Management of massive APH involves a systematic approach focusing on communication, resuscitation, monitoring, and controlling bleeding through prompt delivery. Fluid therapy and blood product transfusion aim to maintain specific blood parameters.
