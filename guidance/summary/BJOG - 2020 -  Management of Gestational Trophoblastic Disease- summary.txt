The clinical guideline for the Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease covers the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of molar pregnancies. It emphasizes the importance of histological examination for definitive diagnosis and recommends suction curettage for removal. Anti-D prophylaxis post-removal is advised, and careful management during removal to avoid complications is highlighted. Referral to specialized centers is recommended for certain cases, and follow-up and treatment for Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) are based on specific scoring systems. Long-term outcomes for women treated for GTN are generally positive, with individualized support available through GTD centers. The guideline also addresses specific scenarios and considerations for management, diagnosis, and follow-up.
