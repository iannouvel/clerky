The clinical guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for managing obesity in pregnancy, labor, and postnatal care to reduce associated risks. Key points include categorizing care pathways based on BMI, close monitoring for complications, thromboprophylaxis, and appropriate equipment use for pregnant individuals with obesity. Specific recommendations include induction of labor for BMI ≥30, active management of the third stage of labor, avoiding birthing pools for BMI ≥35, and informing senior obstetricians and anesthetic teams for BMI ≥40. Clinical steps such as fetal monitoring, suturing techniques, and wound dressings are highlighted. Postnatally, offering necessary equipment, encouraging attendance at postnatal services, and referral to weight management programs are emphasized. Additional resources are available for further guidance. The guideline aims to optimize care and outcomes for pregnant individuals with obesity.
