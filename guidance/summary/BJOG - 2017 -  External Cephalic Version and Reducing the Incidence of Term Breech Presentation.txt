External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position, reducing the need for a caesarean section. ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation and can be supported by tocolysis with betamimetics. Regional analgesia may be used for pain relief during ECV. Trained practitioners should perform ECV, and women should be informed of its risks and benefits. In specific cases, ECV can be considered from 36 weeks of gestation or even intrapartum. ECV after a prior caesarean delivery is not associated with increased risk. Postural management alone is not effective for spontaneous version. Further research is needed to enhance ECV success rates. Complications of ECV are rare. It is crucial to detect breech presentation antenatally. Studies on ECV outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction are ongoing, emphasizing the need for continuous evaluation and improvement in ECV practices.
