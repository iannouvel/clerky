External Cephalic Version (ECV) is recommended at term from 37 weeks of gestation for breech presentation, with a success rate of approximately 50% and potential reduction in the need for caesarean section. Tocolysis with betamimetics can enhance success rates, and regional analgesia may be considered for women needing pain relief during the procedure. Trained practitioners should perform ECV, and women should be informed of the risks and benefits. ECV can be considered from 36 weeks in nulliparous women with a low chance of spontaneous version, with caution for intrapartum attempts and no increased risk after one caesarean delivery. Postural management alone does not aid spontaneous version. Antenatal detection of breech presentation is crucial, and further research is needed to enhance ECV outcomes and uptake. ECV has a low complication rate, does not increase the risk of intrauterine death, and has been associated with favorable obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Contraindications for ECV at term should be carefully considered. Studies on ECV success, safety, complications, delivery mode post-ECV, timing of delivery, adverse outcomes, patient satisfaction, pain experience, and factors influencing perinatal outcomes are recommended for further investigation.
