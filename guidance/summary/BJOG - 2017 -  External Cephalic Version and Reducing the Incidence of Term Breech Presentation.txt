Diagnosis and Presentation:
- External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position
- ECV should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation
- Tocolysis with betamimetics can improve ECV success rates
- Regional analgesia may be considered for women unable to tolerate ECV without pain relief
- ECV can be a painful procedure
- ECV has a very low complication rate

Treatment and Management:
- ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners
- In nulliparous women with a low chance of spontaneous version, ECV from 36 weeks of gestation seems pragmatic
- ECV may be considered intrapartum with caution
- ECV after one caesarean delivery appears to have no greater risk
- Methods to improve ECV uptake and success rates are needed

Monitoring Requirements:
- No specific monitoring parameters mentioned

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Contraindications for ECV in breech position at term exist
- ECV-related risks should be considered
- Further research is needed on improving ECV outcomes

Risk Factors:
- Factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome in ECV exist
