External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to turn a breech baby to a head-down position, reducing the chances of a caesarean section. It should be offered at term from 37 weeks of gestation, with tocolysis potentially improving success rates. Regional analgesia may be considered for pain relief during the procedure. ECV should only be performed by trained practitioners, and women should be informed of the risks and benefits. Further research is needed to improve ECV outcomes and methods to increase uptake and success rates. ECV has a low complication rate and does not increase the risk of intrauterine death.
