The clinical guideline on Maternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium emphasizes the importance of identifying women at risk of impending collapse and taking a systematic approach to identify the cause. Physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy must be considered during resuscitation. The guideline outlines standard resuscitation protocols with modifications for maternal physiology, including manual displacement of the uterus and left lateral tilt to relieve aortocaval compression. Various causes of collapse are discussed, such as haemorrhage, thromboembolism, and cardiac disease, with specific interventions outlined. The guideline also highlights the importance of training, documentation, and incident reporting for clinical governance to improve outcomes in cases of maternal collapse.
