The Breech Management v6.0 guideline focuses on external cephalic version (ECV) and vaginal breech birth for obstetric management. It defines different types of breech presentations and emphasizes the importance of timely assessment for suspected breech presentation after 36 weeks gestation. Pregnant women with confirmed breech presentation should be offered ECV unless contraindicated, with risks and benefits explained thoroughly. ECV should be performed by a trained obstetrician in a labor ward with the necessary facilities. The guideline also covers factors influencing successful ECV, alternatives to ECV, counseling pregnant women on birth options, intrapartum care during vaginal breech birth, and managing complications like cord prolapse effectively. It provides detailed instructions for assisting with breech birth, monitoring fetal well-being, and managing rare complications during delivery. The guideline aims to ensure safe and effective management of breech presentations at term.
