Induction of labor at term in older mothers may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes such as stillbirth, obstetric complications, and neonatal mortality. Studies suggest that women aged 40 and older have a similar stillbirth risk at 39 weeks as 25-29 year olds at 41 weeks. While older mothers have higher rates of caesarean section and instrumental delivery, induction of labor may improve outcomes without increasing these rates. However, there is insufficient data on the overall effect of induction of labor in older mothers, and further research is needed to determine the best course of action for this population. A multicenter RCT is currently recruiting to investigate the impact of induction of labor in nulliparous women aged over 35 years.
