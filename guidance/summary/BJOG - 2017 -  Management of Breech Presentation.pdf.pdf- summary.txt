Clinical guidelines for the management of breech presentation at term recommend offering external cephalic version (ECV) to women unless there is an absolute contraindication. Women should be informed about the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery. Planned caesarean section is associated with a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared to planned vaginal breech delivery. Skilled intrapartum care and proper selection of pregnancies may make planned vaginal breech birth nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. Clinicians should provide unbiased counseling to ensure women understand the risks of their options. Adequate assessment, management, and skilled personnel are crucial for the safety of vaginal breech delivery. Simulation equipment should be used to practice skills needed for vaginal breech birth, and guidelines for case selection and management should be developed.
