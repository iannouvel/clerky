**Water Birth Clinical Guideline Summary**  

Water birth is an option for low-risk pregnancies (singleton, spontaneous labor) offering benefits like pain relief and shorter labor. Key criteria include maintaining pool temperature (37Â°C) and regular maternal/fetal monitoring. Delivery should be hands-off, avoiding cord palpation. Post-birth, monitor maternal and neonatal temperature and assess the perineum.  

**Exclusion Criteria:** Exit the pool for maternal fever, hypertension, meconium, maternal request, significant bleeding, abnormal fetal heart rate, opioid/epidural use, prolonged labor stages, or excessive contamination. In emergencies, follow structured evacuation protocols.  

**Audit Points:** Document antenatal water birth discussions, track pool temperature, and delay perineal suturing if needed. Ensure staff competency in water birth management and emergency procedures.
