Assisted Vaginal Birth at RSCH PRH is indicated for women in labor needing assistance, with a goal to mimic spontaneous birth with minimal morbidity. Rates are stable at 10-15%, with interventions to reduce operative vaginal birth needs. Risks of Ventouse and forceps delivery should be compared, and clear communication is vital for preparation. Verbal consent is required for delivery room procedures, while written consent is needed for theatre. Analgesia options include epidural/spinal analgesia and pudendal block; bladder care should include recommending an in-out catheter if needed. Aseptic techniques, neonatal resuscitation, and proper instrumentation application are crucial. Post-delivery, thorough inspection of trauma, antibiotics, and analgesia are recommended, along with bladder care monitoring. Documentation of benefits, risks, indications, analgesia, and instrument use is essential, with debriefing to discuss future birth plans and individualized care for tears or pelvic floor issues. Support and debriefing services should be offered postnatally.
