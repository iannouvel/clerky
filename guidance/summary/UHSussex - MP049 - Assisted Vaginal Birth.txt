The clinical guideline for Assisted Vaginal Birth at RSCH PRH outlines protocols for midwives and obstetricians when assisting women in labor. The goal is to achieve a vaginal birth with minimal morbidity. The guideline covers indications and contraindications for operative vaginal birth, risks of instrumental delivery, informed consent procedures, location options for the procedure, analgesia choices, hygiene practices, neonatal resuscitation requirements, and specific techniques for ventouse, forceps, and rotational forceps deliveries. Post-operative care includes perineal and vaginal trauma inspection, antibiotic administration, and pain management. Documentation requirements post-delivery are detailed, along with the importance of debriefing sessions for patients. The guideline emphasizes individualized care and support for women undergoing assisted vaginal births.
