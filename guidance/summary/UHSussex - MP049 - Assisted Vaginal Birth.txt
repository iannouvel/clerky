Key principles include professional judgment alongside protocol adherence. Indications and contraindications for operative vaginal birth are outlined, with a focus on reducing the need for such interventions. Risks of Ventouse and forceps deliveries are compared, and clear communication is emphasized for preparation. Informed consent, analgesia options, bladder care, hygiene, neonatal resuscitation, and perineal care protocols are detailed. Post-delivery documentation requirements and debriefing recommendations are provided. Monitoring parameters include timing and volume of first void, risk of urinary retention, and strategies for reducing urinary incontinence. Professional training in neonatal resuscitation and adherence to aseptic techniques are essential. Specific documentation requirements post-delivery and debriefing opportunities are emphasized for comprehensive care.
