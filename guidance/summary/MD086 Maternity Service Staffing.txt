### **Maternity Services Staffing Summary**  

This guideline outlines staffing requirements for midwifery, nursing, and support staff across maternity services at Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) and Princess Royal Hospital (PRH), including community and homebirth provisions.  

**Key Staffing Structures:**  
- **Supervisors of Midwives** maintain a 1:15 ratio to midwives, with 24/7 on-call availability.  
- **Managerial Coverage** includes a 24/7 on-call rota supported by three managers and the Deputy Head of Midwifery, with the Head of Midwifery available for escalation.  

**Staffing Levels & Skill Mix:**  
- Staffing is determined by **Birthrate Plus** and **Safer Childbirth** recommendations, accounting for care setting demands, case mix, and service design.  
- **Community staff** receive travel time allowances, while hospital-based care includes dedicated hours for antenatal/postnatal support.  
- **Midwifery Care Assistants (MCAs)** supplement but do not replace midwives in clinical roles.  

**Additional Roles:**  
- Specialist midwives, governance leads, and practice development staff support service delivery beyond direct clinical care.  

**Leave & Contingency Management:**  
- Short-term absences are managed by the Labour Ward coordinator, who may adjust shifts or request bank staff.  
- Unplanned workload increases require internal staff reallocation before external solutions.  

**Ongoing Monitoring:**  
- Annual reviews ensure compliance with recommended staffing ratios.  
- Persistent shortages require a formal business case for additional funding.  
- Regular audits assess adherence to standards and contingency plans.  

This framework ensures safe, effective maternity care through structured staffing, skill mix optimization, and robust contingency planning.
