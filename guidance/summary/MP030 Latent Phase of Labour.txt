**Summary of Latent Phase of Labour Protocol MP030**  

This guideline applies to women in the latent phase of labour across all care settings, with midwives and obstetricians responsible for adherence. Key principles emphasize respecting maternal autonomy and shared decision-making. Management includes early assessment, telephone advice, and encouraging normal activities to promote physiological labour. Monitoring fetal movements and providing appropriate analgesia, such as morphine sulfate (10mg/5mL Oramorph), are essential.  

Fetal heart monitoring is critical, particularly for women requiring pain relief. Morphine sulfate is the preferred analgesic but is contraindicated in cases of opiate/morphine allergy, sensitivity, or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Side effects and risks of opiates must be carefully evaluated. Prolonged latent phase may necessitate obstetric review and further interventions. The guideline underscores timely consultation with an obstetrician when needed.
