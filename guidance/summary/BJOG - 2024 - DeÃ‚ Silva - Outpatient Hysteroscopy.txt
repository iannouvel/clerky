The clinical guideline emphasizes the importance of providing dedicated outpatient hysteroscopy services for women with abnormal uterine bleeding and reproductive issues. Key recommendations include offering written information to patients before the procedure, using vaginoscopy as the standard technique, and preferring mechanical hysteroscopic tissue removal systems over miniature bipolar electrodes. Conscious sedation should not be routinely used, and NSAIDs are recommended for pain management. Safety checklists, informed consent, and proper documentation are crucial. Cervical preparation with prostaglandins and smaller diameter hysteroscopes can reduce pain. Saline should be used as the distension medium. Avoiding routine cervical dilatation and local anesthesia for vaginoscopic approaches are advised. The guideline also discusses the importance of patient monitoring, quality assurance tools, and the need for further research on pain management strategies and hysteroscopy techniques.
