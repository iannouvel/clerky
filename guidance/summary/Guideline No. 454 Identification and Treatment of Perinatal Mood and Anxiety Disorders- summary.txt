The SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 454 focuses on the identification and treatment of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during and after pregnancy. Perinatal mental illness, including mood and anxiety disorders, can have adverse effects on maternal, partner, fetal, and infant health if left untreated. The guideline highlights the need for health care providers to screen, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum patients with PMI, utilizing patient-centered and trauma-informed care approaches. Facilitators to identification, treatment, and referral are discussed, along with screening tools and interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety. Prioritizing maternal mental health and addressing barriers to care are essential for improving outcomes for women during the perinatal period.
