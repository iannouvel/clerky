### **Newborn Hearing Screening Programme Protocol Summary**  

This protocol applies to all newborns delivered within BSUH maternity departments or supported home births. The screening aims to identify hearing impairment early, ensuring timely referral to audiology.  

**Key Steps:**  
1. **Initial Screening (OAE1):** Conducted before hospital discharge.  
2. **Second Screening (OAE2):** Performed at least 5 hours after OAE1 if initial results are unclear.  
3. **Automated ABR (AABR):** Required in clinic if OAE results remain unclear. Must be completed by Day 28.  
4. **Clear Bilateral Responses:** No further action needed; results documented in the Personal Child Health Record (PCHR) or insert form.  
5. **Referral to Audiology:** If screening fails, immediate referral for diagnostic audiology.  
6. **Follow-Up:** Parents contacted within 3 months if screening is incomplete. Paediatric audiology, GP, and health visitor notified upon completion.  

**Additional Considerations:**  
- East Sussex babies are transferred to ESHT NHSP services.  
- Failsafe procedures ensure follow-up for missed screenings.  
- Performance indicators monitor screening effectiveness.  

The protocol ensures systematic, timely identification and management of hearing impairment in newborns.
