The clinical guideline focuses on fetal heart monitoring in antenatal and intrapartum care. Recommendations include considering pregnant women's preferences, using Dawes Redman Criteria for antenatal traces, and conducting fetal blood sampling based on specific criteria. It emphasizes the importance of individualized care and clinical judgment. Equipment such as Pinard's stethoscope and CTG monitors are essential. Intelligent intermittent auscultation is recommended for low-risk pregnancies, while continuous monitoring is indicated for high-risk situations. Documentation of CTG monitoring is crucial, and human factors influencing interpretation should be considered. Management of CTG abnormalities involves categorization and timely interventions. Poor CTG quality can be addressed by troubleshooting equipment issues. Fetal blood sampling is appropriate in cases of pathological CTG, with considerations for contraindications. Paired cord blood sampling is not routine but can be done when there are concerns about the baby's condition. The guideline also provides detailed procedures for cord blood sampling and interpretation of results.
