Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Anaemia in pregnancy: first trimester Hb < 110 g/l; second/third trimester Hb < 105 g/l; postpartum Hb < 100 g/l
- Normocytic or microcytic anaemia: consider oral iron trial; further tests if no Hb rise at 2 weeks
- Screening for anaemia: at booking and 28 weeks; additional full blood count for multiple pregnancies at 20â€“24 weeks
- Treatment: oral iron preferred first-line; parenteral iron if oral iron not tolerated or absorbed; rHuEPO use in controlled trials or on hematologist advice
- Active management of third stage of labor recommended to minimize blood loss

Treatment and Management:
- Consent for blood transfusion required; document reason and consent discussion
- Group and screen samples at booking and 28 weeks; < 3 days old for blood provision
- ABO-, RhD-, Kell-compatible red cell units transfused
- CMV-seronegative red cell and platelet components for elective transfusions in pregnancy
- Cell salvage recommended for significant blood loss; minimum anti-D immunoglobulin for RhD-negative women during caesarean section
- Full blood counts and coagulation screens during bleeding episode
- FFP given during major obstetric hemorrhage; subsequent transfusion guided by fibrinogen levels
- Platelet count maintained above 50 x 10^9/l in acutely bleeding patients
- Tranexamic acid may be considered during major obstetric hemorrhage
- Iron deficiency should be recognized and treated promptly to reduce need for blood transfusions

Monitoring Requirements:
- Regular monitoring of full blood counts and coagulation screens during bleeding episode
- Maintain platelet count above 50 x 10^9/l in acutely bleeding patients

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Predelivery autologous blood deposit not recommended
- Cell salvage should be performed by experienced multidisciplinary teams
- Close monitoring of clotting tests necessary for subsequent FFP transfusion
- No anti-D prophylaxis required if RhD-negative woman receives RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate
