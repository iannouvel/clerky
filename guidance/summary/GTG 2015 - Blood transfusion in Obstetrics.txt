The clinical guideline on blood transfusion in obstetrics provides recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion in pregnant women. It emphasizes optimizing hemoglobin levels through antenatal care, screening for anemia, and offering oral iron supplementation as the first-line treatment for iron deficiency. Active management of the third stage of labor and delivery in a hospital setting for high-risk women are recommended to minimize blood loss. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained whenever possible, and regular blood group and antibody status checks are essential during pregnancy. Cell salvage is recommended for patients with significant blood loss during delivery. Management of obstetric hemorrhage should include appropriate use of blood components based on clinical and hematological assessments. The guideline also highlights strategies to minimize the use of banked blood and emphasizes the importance of monitoring and auditing practices related to obstetric hemorrhage.
