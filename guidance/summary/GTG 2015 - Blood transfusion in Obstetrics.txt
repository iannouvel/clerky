Diagnosis of anaemia in pregnancy includes Hb <110 g/l in the first trimester, <105 g/l in the second/third trimester, and <100 g/l postpartum. Oral iron is first-line for iron deficiency; consider parenteral iron if oral iron is not tolerated or effective. Active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Consent for blood transfusion should be obtained when possible; group and screen samples should be <3 days old. ABO-, RhD-, and K- compatible red cell units are recommended. Cell salvage is advised for significant blood loss; anti-D immunoglobulin should be given for RhD-negative women. FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets should be administered based on clinical and hematological criteria. Tranexamic acid may be considered for major obstetric hemorrhage. Blood transfusions should be based on clinical assessment and Hb levels. Iron deficiency should be promptly treated to reduce transfusion need. PBM strategies aim to optimize Hb preoperatively, avoid overtransfusion, use cell salvage, and employ evidence-based transfusion triggers. Future research should focus on coagulation abnormalities in obstetric hemorrhage and point of care testing.
