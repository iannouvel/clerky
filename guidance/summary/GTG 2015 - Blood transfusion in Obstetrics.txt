The clinical guideline on Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics provides recommendations for reducing the risk of transfusion in pregnant women. It includes guidelines for optimizing hemoglobin levels, diagnosing anemia, and managing obstetric hemorrhage with blood components. Strategies to minimize the use of banked blood, such as preoperative autologous blood deposit and intraoperative cell salvage, are discussed. The guideline emphasizes obtaining consent for blood transfusion, regular monitoring of blood group and antibody status, and using appropriate blood products during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The importance of managing obstetric hemorrhage with mechanical strategies and close monitoring of clotting tests is highlighted.
