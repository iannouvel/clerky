**Summary of Clinical Guideline for Pregnant Women with Previous Bariatric Surgery**  

Pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery require specialized care to mitigate risks such as nutritional deficiencies, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth concerns. Key recommendations include delaying pregnancy until weight stabilizes post-surgery and ensuring comprehensive antenatal care with early nutritional screening (FBC, ferritin, and additional tests as needed). Pregnancy-specific multivitamins (e.g., Pregnacare OD, Seven Seas Pregnancy OD, Forceval Capsule OD) are advised, avoiding retinol (Vitamin A) due to teratogenicity. Women with BMI >30 or type 2 diabetes should take 5mg folate daily.  

Regular growth scans from 32 weeks and gestational diabetes screening (via GTT) are essential. Anaesthetic assessment in the third trimester is recommended due to potential surgical complications (e.g., internal hernia). Weight gain should follow BMI-based guidelines, and hyperemesis requires careful management. Labor, birth, and postnatal care should account for prior bariatric surgery, with audit points ensuring adherence to antenatal protocols.
