The NICE clinical guideline for twin and triplet pregnancies provides recommendations for healthcare professionals, pregnant individuals, and their families to reduce complications and improve outcomes. Key points include determining gestational age and chorionicity, providing general care, and delivering antenatal and intrapartum care. Important recommendations include offering emotional support, monitoring for conditions like anemia, and involving a multidisciplinary team in care. Specific guidance is provided for monitoring fetal growth, preventing preterm birth, managing maternal complications, and planning birth. Referral to a tertiary level fetal medicine center is recommended for complex cases. Continuous fetal monitoring during labor, tailored birth plans, and individualized mode of birth decisions are emphasized. The guideline underscores the importance of specialized care, frequent monitoring, and effective communication throughout the pregnancy to optimize outcomes for both the mother and babies.
