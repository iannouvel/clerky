The clinical guideline focuses on the management and diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL). Key recommendations include performing a pregnancy test in all women of reproductive age, utilizing ultrasound for diagnosis, and offering various management options such as expectant, medical with methotrexate, or surgical treatment. Patients with ectopic pregnancies should be informed about treatment options and monitored for complications. Surgical management via laparoscopy is preferred when feasible, with considerations for salpingectomy versus salpingotomy. In cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy with collapse, immediate assessment and surgical intervention are crucial. Anti-D rhesus prophylaxis should be considered for rhesus-negative individuals. PUL should be managed based on clinical symptoms and serial hCG measurements. Follow-up care, patient support, and auditing guidelines are emphasized. Clinical history, physical examination, and appropriate referrals are recommended for pregnant women with early pregnancy problems.
