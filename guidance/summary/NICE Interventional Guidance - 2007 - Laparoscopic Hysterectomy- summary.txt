This clinical guideline emphasizes the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic hysterectomy, highlighting the need for advanced skills and special training for clinicians. While laparoscopic techniques offer benefits such as shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery, they also come with higher risks of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Special precautions are necessary to prevent adverse events like vascular injury and hemorrhage. Healthcare professionals are advised to consider this guidance when deciding on treatment options for patients, ensuring compliance with anti-discrimination laws. Local providers are responsible for implementing these recommendations while respecting copyright restrictions. Contact NICE for further information.
