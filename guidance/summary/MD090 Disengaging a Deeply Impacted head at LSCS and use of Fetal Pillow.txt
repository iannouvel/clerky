This guideline focuses on managing deeply impacted fetal heads during lower segment Caesarean sections (LSCS) in pregnant women with a cephalic presentation. The key recommendations include using the Fetal Pillow as the first-line action to disengage the head, followed by reverse breech extraction if needed. For first stage LSCS, reverse breech extraction is recommended as the first-line action. The guideline provides a decision flowchart for managing impacted fetal heads and instructions for inserting the Fetal Pillow. It emphasizes the risks associated with second-stage LSCS and the importance of systematic management to reduce maternal and neonatal complications. The guideline also includes an audit proforma to assess the use of the Fetal Pillow and document delivery outcomes.
