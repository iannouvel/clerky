This clinical guideline focuses on the induction and augmentation of labor, as well as the use of oxytocin to ensure optimal outcomes for mothers and babies. Key recommendations include offering membrane sweeping from 39 weeks for those aiming for a vaginal birth, discussing induction of labor for individuals with a BMI of 30 or more at 36-38 weeks, and considering induction between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to prevent complications. Monitoring fetal wellbeing, assessing contractions and fetal heart rate, and managing potential side effects of interventions are crucial. Special circumstances for induction are outlined, and options for birth at term are discussed. In case of complications like uterine hyperstimulation or suspected uterine rupture, prompt assessment and appropriate management are essential. Clear documentation, monitoring, and communication with the woman/person throughout the process are emphasized.
