### **Summary of Maternal/Birthing Parent Death Protocol (v1.0)**  

**Immediate Actions:**  
- Notify key personnel and document events clearly.  
- Avoid speculating on cause of death; refer to the coroner/procurator fiscal.  
- Inform and support the family sensitively, verifying next of kin.  
- Remove medical lines unless relevant to the death investigation.  
- Notify the Maternal & Newborn Safety Investigations (MNSI) team.  

**Within 24 Hours:**  
- Assign a family liaison contact.  
- Engage with the coroner and report to national maternal death audits (e.g., MBRRACE-UK).  

**Within First Week:**  
- Conduct a case review and submit reports to relevant authorities.  

**Special Considerations:**  
- If death occurs outside maternity/gynecology, consult the Head of Midwifery.  
- For anticipated deaths, plan communication, legal guardianship for the baby, and review care pathways.  

**Postmortem & Certification:**  
- Discuss postmortem options with the family; ensure specialist pathology involvement if required.  
- Register the death formally for certification.  

**Additional Key Steps:**  
- If a baby survives, involve neonatal teams and clarify parental responsibility.  
- Offer bereavement support to family and staff, including counseling.  
- Consider organ donation and manage media inquiries via hospital communications.  
- Facilitate staff debriefing and shared learning for quality improvement.  

All maternal deaths undergo local and national review to enhance future care. Follow-up with the family should be arranged at their pace, with ongoing support and information updates.
