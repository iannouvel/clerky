### **Clinical Guideline Summary: Management of Late Preterm Infants (35–36+6 weeks)**  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Immediate Post-Birth Care:** Skin-to-skin contact is essential for thermoregulation and breastfeeding initiation. Monitor vital signs every 30 minutes for 2 hours until stable.  
- **Feeding Support:** Breastfeed within the first hour. If ineffective, hand-express colostrum and supplement via syringe. Feed every 3 hours, assessing latch, suck, and swallow.  
- **Hypoglycemia Management:**  
  - **BG ≥ 2.6 mmol/L:** Continue 3-hourly feeds.  
  - **BG 1.4–2.6 mmol/L:** Increase to 2-hourly feeds with breastfeeding support.  
  - **BG < 1.4 mmol/L or symptomatic:** Urgent pediatric review, possible NNU admission.  
- **Weight & Output Monitoring:**  
  - Weigh at 72 hours, Day 5, and discharge.  
  - ≥7% weight loss or reduced output requires urgent evaluation.  
- **Jaundice & Readmission Criteria:**  
  - Jaundice within 24 hours → immediate NNU referral.  
  - Readmission to transitional care (TANGMERE/BRAMBER) if feeding/weight concerns persist.  

**Discharge Criteria:**  
- Stable feeding (effective latch, adequate intake).  
- Temperature control, weight gain, and normal output.  
- Parent education on preterm care, safer sleep, and signs of illness.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Community midwifery support with feeding assessment.  
- Neonatal outreach referral if high-risk (e.g., persistent hypoglycemia, poor weight gain).  

**Special Considerations:**  
- **"Red Hat" identification** for NTC babies to ensure targeted monitoring.  
- Avoid discharge before 72 hours to reduce readmission risk.  
- Paced bottle feeding if supplementation is needed.  

**Emergency Actions:**  
- Floppy/unresponsive infants → Call 999, notify pediatrician.  
- Symptomatic hypoglycemia → Buccal dextrose, neonatal team alert.  

This guideline emphasizes close monitoring, proactive feeding support, and structured discharge planning to optimize outcomes for late preterm infants.
