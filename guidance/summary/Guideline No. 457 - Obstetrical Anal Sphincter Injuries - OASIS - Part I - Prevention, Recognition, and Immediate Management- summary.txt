Clinical Guideline No. 457 focuses on the prevention, recognition, and immediate management of Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIS) during vaginal delivery. Key recommendations include systematic rectal examination post-delivery, consideration of mediolateral episiotomy for primiparous patients, and delayed repair of injuries if necessary. The guideline emphasizes the importance of postpartum voiding function monitoring and Sultan's classification for grading injuries. Preventive strategies, repair techniques, and post-operative care are detailed, highlighting the impact of OASIS on anal continence and pelvic floor disorders. Risk factors, long-term outcomes, and interventions to decrease OASIS rates are also discussed, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention to improve maternal health outcomes.
