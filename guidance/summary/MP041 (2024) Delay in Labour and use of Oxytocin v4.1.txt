**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Delay in Labour and Use of Oxytocin**  

This protocol outlines the management of delayed labor, including oxytocin administration. Delay in the first stage is diagnosed based on cervical dilation and fetal head position, requiring transfer to obstetric-led care. Oxytocin should only be initiated after obstetric review, assessing maternal and fetal well-being.  

Women on oxytocin require continuous one-to-one midwifery care. The infusion starts at a low dose, titrated every 30 minutes to achieve adequate contractions, with strict documentation of dosages and maternal/fetal monitoring. Oxytocin should not exceed six hours without progress unless consultant-approved. High doses require vigilance for water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance.  

In the second stage, oxytocin use follows clinical examination, with augmentation targeting specific contraction patterns. Instrumental delivery may be needed if fetal compromise or prolonged labor occurs. Oxytocin must be discontinued post-delivery, with active third-stage management recommended. Contraindications must be carefully evaluated before administration. Continuous CTG monitoring is mandatory throughout.
