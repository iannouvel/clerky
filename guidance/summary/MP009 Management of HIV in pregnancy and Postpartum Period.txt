### **Summary of HIV Management in Pregnancy and Neonatal Period**  

All pregnant women with HIV should receive lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load, minimizing vertical transmission. Preconception counseling should optimize viral suppression before pregnancy.  

**Pregnancy Management:**  
- Screen for STIs, mental health, and bacterial vaginosis.  
- Monitor viral load, CD4 count, and resistance testing before ART initiation.  
- Avoid zidovudine monotherapy and short-term ART. Adjust regimens if needed, avoiding teratogenic drugs.  

**Delivery Planning:**  
- Mode of delivery depends on viral load: elective cesarean if detectable, vaginal delivery if undetectable.  
- For term pre-labor rupture of membranes (SROM), aim for delivery within 24 hours if viral load is undetectable.  
- Avoid routine antibiotics post-SROM but administer for intrapartum fever.  

**Neonatal Care:**  
- Start post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within 4 hours of birth, tailored to maternal viral load and ART duration.  
- Formula feeding is recommended in high-income settings; breastfeeding is permitted only if viral load is undetectable with strict monitoring.  
- Test infants for HIV at birth, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (or longer if high risk).  

**Postpartum & Follow-Up:**  
- Continue maternal ART and monitor for depression.  
- Offer contraception planning and annual cervical screening.  
- Test partners and other children if newly diagnosed in pregnancy.  
- Avoid HCV treatment during pregnancy; manage HBV co-infection with neonatal prophylaxis.  

Optimal viral suppression remains critical to reducing transmission risks.
