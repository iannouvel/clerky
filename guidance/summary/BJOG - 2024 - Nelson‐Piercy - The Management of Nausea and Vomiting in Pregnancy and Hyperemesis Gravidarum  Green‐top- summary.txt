Green-top Guideline No. 69 provides comprehensive recommendations for the management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). The guideline emphasizes the importance of using objective tools like PUQE and HELP to classify the severity of NVP and HG. First-line antiemetics like anti (H1) histamines and phenothiazines should be prescribed initially, with ondansetron considered as a second-line option. Thiamine supplementation is recommended for all women admitted with vomiting, and corticosteroids can be used in refractory cases. The guideline also addresses the impact of NVP and HG on mental health, recommending support for affected women. Overall, the guideline aims to improve the diagnosis and management of NVP and HG for healthcare professionals caring for pregnant women.
