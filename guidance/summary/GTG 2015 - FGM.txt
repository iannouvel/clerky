The clinical guideline on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) emphasizes the importance of healthcare professionals being aware of the complications and legal aspects of FGM. It highlights the need for mandatory reporting of FGM in girls under 18, clear referral pathways, and training for gynaecologists and midwives. De-infibulation should be offered before pregnancy, and postnatal care should include follow-up if not performed during delivery. The guideline also addresses the importance of a safe and private environment, psychological assessment, and vigilance for clinical signs of recent FGM. Data collection on FGM in the UK is essential for tracking care for affected women.
