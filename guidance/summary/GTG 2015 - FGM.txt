Female genital mutilation (FGM) management involves awareness of short- and long-term complications such as haemorrhage, urinary retention, infection, scarring, dyspareunia, and obstetric complications; understanding legal responsibilities including mandatory reporting for girls under 18; and familiarity with the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset. Assessment during pregnancy, referral to specialists, and de-infibulation pre-pregnancy are key. Postnatal care should include follow-up for de-infibulation. Referral to designated consultants or midwives, individual risk assessment using an FGM safeguarding tool, hepatitis C screening, high obstetric risk management, and documentation of FGM history are essential. Notify child protection midwife for baby girls and offer postnatal follow-up post-de-infibulation. Vigilance for clinical signs, accurate recording, clear referral pathways, psychological assessment, and adherence to legal processes are crucial. Training on FGM management, safe environments, and global epidemiology awareness are recommended. Contraindications include clitoral reconstruction and re-infibulation, while de-infibulation is advised before pregnancy. Postnatal debrief, research on stillbirth rates, and audit on healthcare worker training and referrals are suggested for comprehensive care.
