Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) guidelines emphasize the importance of clinicians understanding the complications associated with FGM and being aware of legal obligations. Health professionals should provide information on UK laws to women with FGM and ensure a safe and private environment for care. Mandatory reporting to police for girls under 18 with FGM is required. Training on FGM management is recommended for gynaecologists and midwives. Referral pathways should be clear, and psychological assessment and treatment should be offered to affected women. De-infibulation should be considered before pregnancy. Screening for hepatitis C is advised during antenatal care. Intrapartum and postnatal care for women with FGM should be carefully managed. Legal and regulatory processes must be followed and documented. Global epidemiology and data collection on FGM are crucial for tracking care for affected women. Specialized multidisciplinary FGM services should be accessible, and healthcare professionals should offer sensitive and appropriate care to women with FGM.
