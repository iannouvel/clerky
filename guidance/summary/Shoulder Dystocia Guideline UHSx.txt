**Summary of Shoulder Dystocia Clinical Guideline**  

Shoulder dystocia (SD) occurs when additional maneuvers are needed to deliver the babyâ€™s shoulders after failed gentle traction during vaginal birth, affecting ~0.6% of deliveries. It carries significant risks, including neonatal hypoxia, brachial plexus injury, and maternal complications like postpartum hemorrhage.  

Key risk factors include fetal macrosomia, maternal diabetes, and obesity. Antenatal assessment should evaluate recurrence risk in women with prior SD. Intrapartum management requires immediate recognition and a structured approach (e.g., McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure, or rotational techniques) to minimize neonatal hypoxia and trauma.  

Emergency care should involve an experienced obstetric team, with systematic maneuvers and neonatal monitoring post-delivery. Suspected brachial plexus injuries warrant pediatric assessment. Postpartum follow-up includes maternal monitoring for hemorrhage/perineal trauma and counseling for future pregnancy planning.  

Training in SD management is essential for birth attendants, alongside thorough documentation for audit and quality improvement. Appendices provide detailed protocols (e.g., PROMPT algorithm) and tools for implementation.
