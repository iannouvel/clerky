This clinical guideline focuses on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women, emphasizing the importance of differentiating between benign and malignant masses. It recommends conservative management and laparoscopic surgery for benign masses, with referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspected malignancies. The guideline highlights the use of ultrasound as the preferred imaging modality, along with additional tests like CA-125, LDH, and hCG for complex masses. It also discusses the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) for estimating the risk of malignancy and provides recommendations for follow-up and surgical intervention based on the size and characteristics of the ovarian cysts.
