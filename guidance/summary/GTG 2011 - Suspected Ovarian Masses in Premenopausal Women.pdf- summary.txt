This clinical guideline focuses on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It emphasizes the importance of differentiating between benign and malignant masses through ultrasound imaging and additional tests such as CA-125. Conservative management is preferred for benign masses, with laparoscopic surgery recommended. Referral to a gynaecological oncologist is advised for suspected malignancies. The guideline also provides recommendations for the intervention of simple ovarian cysts based on their size, highlighting the preference for laparoscopic surgery for elective cases. The importance of preoperative discussions regarding the possibility of oophorectomy and the use of the umbilical port for better outcomes are also emphasized.
