This clinical guideline focuses on the management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women, emphasizing the importance of initial assessment and conservative management. It highlights the challenges in differentiating between benign and malignant masses and recommends referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspected malignancies. The guideline also discusses the use of ultrasound and additional tests for complex masses, as well as the Risk of Malignancy Index for estimating the risk of malignancy. Surgical intervention is recommended for persistent or increasing cysts, with a preference for laparoscopic surgery for benign masses. The guideline also addresses the need for preoperative discussions on the possibility of oophorectomy and the importance of avoiding spillage of cyst contents during surgery for better outcomes.
