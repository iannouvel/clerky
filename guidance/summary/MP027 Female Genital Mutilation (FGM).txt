**Summary of FGM Maternity Protocol (MP027)**  

This protocol provides guidelines for managing women with Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) during pregnancy, birth, and postnatal care. FGM is illegal in the UK and a safeguarding concern.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Antenatal Care:** Identify and document FGM status early. Mandatory reporting for under-18s. Offer antenatal defibulation where indicated.  
- **Intrapartum Care:** Hospital birth is recommended. Individualized birth plans should include preferences (e.g., female attendants). Epidural should be discussed to facilitate defibulation if needed. Perform defibulation under epidural anesthesia using aseptic technique.  
- **Postnatal Care:** Inspect the perineum, encourage mobilization, and safeguard female infants. Document FGM in discharge summaries for community midwives. Ensure health visitors are informed.  

**Critical Management Steps:**  
- Obtain informed consent for all procedures.  
- Plan vaginal births with clear documentation.  
- Provide sensitive, dignified care while addressing complications.  
- Follow safeguarding procedures for at-risk infants.  

This protocol ensures standardized, safe, and respectful care for women affected by FGM.
