The clinical guideline for Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage focuses on improving early pregnancy loss diagnosis and management to provide dignified and respectful care for women with complications. Healthcare professionals are advised to offer sensitive support, ensure evidence-based information is provided in various formats, and recognize symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Recommendations include offering pregnancy tests to women with non-specific symptoms, using ultrasound scans to diagnose viable pregnancies, and considering expectant management for stable women with small ectopic pregnancies. The guideline also emphasizes the importance of research to evaluate different management strategies and their impact on women's emotional recovery. Improving early pregnancy loss diagnosis and management is crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths associated with ectopic pregnancies.
