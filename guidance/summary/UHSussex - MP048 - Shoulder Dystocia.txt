Shoulder dystocia is defined as the need for additional obstetric interventions during delivery after gentle downward traction fails. Risk factors include previous shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal obesity, induction of labor, prolonged labor, and assisted vaginal delivery. Prevention strategies include cautious management of suspected macrosomia, with early induction in gestational diabetes and consideration of cesarean section in pregnancies with maternal diabetes. Diagnosis involves gentle traction, and management includes the McRoberts' maneuver and suprapubic pressure, avoiding lateral and downward traction. Post-delivery, there is an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal tears. It is crucial to maintain skills in managing shoulder dystocia to minimize complications. Complete documentation in maternal notes is essential, including the use of a shoulder dystocia proforma.
