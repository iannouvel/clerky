The clinical guideline for Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) emphasizes the importance of a collaborative approach in early pregnancy care. Key principles include using guidelines in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues and ensuring accessibility to relevant staff and service users. Responsibilities are outlined for nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, and obstetricians to follow and understand the guidance. The objective of managing PUL is to find the location of the pregnancy and ensure resolution without complications. Principles of management include considering ectopic pregnancy, conducting necessary tests, and providing written information for emergency care access. Further management is individualized based on clinical signs and symptoms, with a reminder for all PUL women to seek emergency care for severe pain or feeling unwell.
