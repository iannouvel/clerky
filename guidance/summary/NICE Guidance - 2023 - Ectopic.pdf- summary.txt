The clinical guideline on ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage focuses on improving early pregnancy loss diagnosis and support for women with complications. It emphasizes dignified and respectful care, providing information and support sensitively, and ensuring evidence-based information is available in various formats. Healthcare professionals should recognize symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy, refer unstable patients to A&E, and offer seven-day early pregnancy assessment services. The guideline also covers management strategies such as offering methotrexate or surgery for ectopic pregnancy, and providing anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis. Research recommendations include evaluating different management strategies and assessing the psychological impact on women. Improving diagnosis and management is crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths.
