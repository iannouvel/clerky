The clinical guideline for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage focuses on improving early pregnancy loss diagnosis and supporting women with complications. It emphasizes providing dignified and respectful care, offering information and support sensitively, and ensuring evidence-based information is given in various formats. Healthcare professionals should recognize symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy, refer unstable patients to A&E, and offer early pregnancy assessment services seven days a week. Management includes systemic methotrexate, surgery, and anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis. The guideline also highlights the need for research into the psychological impact of different management strategies and the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with early pregnancy loss.
