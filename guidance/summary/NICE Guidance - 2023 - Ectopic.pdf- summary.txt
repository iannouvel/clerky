The clinical guideline on ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage focuses on improving early pregnancy loss diagnosis and management to provide dignified care and support for women. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy, offering timely assessments, and ensuring access to seven-day early pregnancy assessment services. The guideline recommends using ultrasound scans to diagnose ectopic pregnancies, offering systemic methotrexate or surgical treatment based on specific criteria, and providing anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis for rhesus-negative women. Research recommendations include evaluating different management strategies and the psychological impact on women. Improving the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy loss is crucial to reduce psychological morbidity and prevent unnecessary deaths.
