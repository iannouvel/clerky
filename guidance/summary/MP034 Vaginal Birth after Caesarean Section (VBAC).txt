### **Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC) Clinical Summary**  

This protocol outlines the management of women considering VBAC after a prior caesarean section (LSCS). VBAC is encouraged for eligible candidates, with shared decision-making and individualized care.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Eligibility:** VBAC is contraindicated in women with a previous classical uterine incision, uterine rupture, or â‰¥3 prior LSCS. May be considered after two uncomplicated LSCS.  
- **Antenatal Care:** Consultant-led Birth Options clinic for counseling, including risks/benefits of VBAC vs. elective repeat caesarean (ERCS).  
- **Intrapartum Care:** Continuous fetal monitoring recommended; birthing pool use permitted with monitoring.  
- **Induction of Labour:** Options discussed at 40 weeks; continuous monitoring advised.  

**Risks & Benefits:**  
- **VBAC:**  
  - 72-75% success rate; shorter recovery.  
  - 0.5% uterine rupture risk; 5% anal sphincter injury risk.  
  - 8/10,000 risk of neonatal HIE.  
- **ERCS:**  
  - Avoids uterine rupture but increases future placental risks.  
  - Higher maternal mortality (13/100,000 vs. 4/100,000 with VBAC).  
  - Lower neonatal HIE risk (<1/10,000).  

**Documentation & Compliance:**  
- Birth preferences, eligibility, and counseling must be recorded in Badgernet.  
- Continuous fetal monitoring is mandatory during VBAC labor.  

This protocol prioritizes informed choice while ensuring safety for mother and baby.
