### **Summary of the Midwifery Preceptorship Clinical Guideline**  

The preceptorship program supports newly registered midwives (preceptees) through structured learning, mentorship, and professional development. Key responsibilities include:  

- **Preceptors** guide preceptees, acting as role models, providing feedback, and documenting progress through scheduled meetings at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  
- **Professional Midwifery Advocates (PMAs)** offer restorative supervision using the A-EQUIP model to enhance resilience, wellbeing, and professional growth.  
- **Line managers** ensure policy compliance, supernumerary periods, and progression to Band 6.  
- **Preceptees** must complete induction, mandatory training, study days, and engage in reflective practice.  

The program includes:  
- **Four weeks of supernumerary status** with a named midwife (no caseload allocation).  
- **Protected time** for progress meetings, study days, and infant feeding training.  
- **Structured documentation** (ePortfolio, skills passport, NMC reflective accounts).  
- **Escalation pathways** for concerns regarding professionalism, safety, or wellbeing.  

Completion requires meeting competencies, with a final sign-off meeting for Band 6 progression. If standards are unmet, capability procedures may apply. Annual program evaluation gathers feedback from preceptees, preceptors, and managers.
