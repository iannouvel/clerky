This clinical guideline on epilepsy in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis, preconception counseling, antepartum and intrapartum management, and postpartum care for women with epilepsy (WWE). It highlights the need for collaboration between healthcare providers to ensure optimal care and minimize risks to both the mother and baby. The guideline also addresses the impact of antiepileptic drugs on fetal development, the importance of breastfeeding, and the need for effective contraception in WWE. Recommendations on seizure management, monitoring neonates for adverse effects of AED exposure, and informing WWE about driving entitlements and disability legislation are also provided. Future research recommendations include studying the long-term effects of AED exposure on offspring and optimizing monitoring strategies for pregnant women with epilepsy.
