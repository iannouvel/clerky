The guideline focuses on managing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). NVP affects most pregnant individuals and can be managed in General Practice, while HG, a severe form, may require specialist care. Key recommendations include using antiemetic medications like pyridoxine/doxylamine or cyclizine, assessing severity with the PUQE scoring system, monitoring renal function and vitamin levels, and considering thiamine for severe cases. General Practitioners should consider alternative causes if symptoms start after 16 weeks, monitor various parameters, assess mental health, offer counseling, and prescribe antiemetics. In secondary care, management involves reviewing risks, using antiemetics, ensuring nutrition and hydration, and offering support groups. Referral for specialist care should be considered if needed. Resources for support and further information are provided, including contact details for specialist centers and patient information leaflets.
