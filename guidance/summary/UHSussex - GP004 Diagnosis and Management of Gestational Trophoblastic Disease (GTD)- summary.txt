The clinical guideline from Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals outlines the diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD), a group of pregnancy-related tumors. Key principles include the importance of discussions with senior colleagues. GTD includes complete and partial molar pregnancies, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). Clinical features include irregular bleeding, hyperemesis, and uterine enlargement. Ultrasound is helpful for diagnosis, but histological examination is definitive. Evacuation of molar pregnancies is done through suction curettage. Follow-up testing is recommended, and women are advised not to conceive until hCG levels normalize. The guideline also covers Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) and twin pregnancies.
