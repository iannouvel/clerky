The clinical guideline for Diabetes in Pregnancy aims to optimize outcomes for pregnant individuals with diabetes. It covers antenatal care, pre-pregnancy counseling for those with pre-existing diabetes, and screening for gestational diabetes (GDM). Recommendations include offering diet and exercise changes for pregnant individuals with GDM and adjusting insulin doses for those on corticosteroids. Monitoring blood glucose levels is crucial, and hospital admission may be necessary in certain situations. Insulin should be continued during labor, and doses adjusted post-birth. Regular audits are advised to ensure proper care. Ultrasound scans and fetal heart examinations at 20 weeks are recommended. Pregnant individuals with diabetes should self-monitor blood glucose levels, discuss corticosteroid risks, and consider COVID-19 vaccination. Patients with GDM are at increased risk and should be vaccinated promptly.
