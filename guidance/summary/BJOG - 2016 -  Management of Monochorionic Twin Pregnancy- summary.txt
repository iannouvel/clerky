The clinical guideline for the management of monochorionic twin pregnancies emphasizes the importance of early ultrasound examinations to assess gestational age, fetal viability, and chorionicity. Regular fetal ultrasound assessments every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards are recommended, with screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities. Monochorionic twin pregnancies have higher fetal loss rates and may be complicated by conditions such as TTTS, TAPS, and sGR. Delivery should be discussed and offered from 36 weeks, aiming for vaginal birth unless specific clinical indications require a caesarean section. Specialized fetal medicine centers and experienced operators are essential for optimal outcomes in managing monochorionic twin pregnancies.
