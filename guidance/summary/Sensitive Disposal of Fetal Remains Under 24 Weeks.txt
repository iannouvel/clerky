**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Remains Under 24 Weeks**  

This guideline provides a structured approach for healthcare staff managing pregnancy loss under 24 weeks, ensuring respectful and sensitive handling of fetal remains. Key stakeholders include midwives, doctors, mortuary staff, and histopathology personnel.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Options for Disposal:** Families may choose hospital-arranged cremation, private burial/cremation, or home burial (where legally permitted).  
- **Non-Recognizable Fetus:** Staff must provide clear information, obtain consent for sensitive disposal, and ensure proper transfer to the mortuary (wrapped in a waterproof pad and boxed with accompanying documentation).  
- **Recognizable Fetus:** Offer funeral arrangement options, obtain consent, and follow mortuary transfer protocols.  
- **Post-Mortem & Cytogenetics:** Secure consent for post-mortem if required and ensure proper handling of specimens for genetic testing.  
- **Documentation & Compliance:** Complete necessary forms, provide patient information leaflets, and conduct annual audits to ensure adherence.  

The guideline emphasizes compassionate care, legal compliance, and clear communication with bereaved families.
