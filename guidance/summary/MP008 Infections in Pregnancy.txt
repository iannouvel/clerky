**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Infections in Pregnancy (MP008)**  

This protocol outlines the management of infections in pregnancy, focusing on **Group B Streptococcus (GBS)** and **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**.  

**GBS Management:**  
- Routine antenatal screening is not recommended, but women should receive information.  
- **Intrapartum IV antibiotics** are offered for:  
  - Previous GBS-affected baby  
  - GBS bacteriuria in current pregnancy  
  - Incidental GBS detection in current pregnancy  
- Antibiotics are **not indicated** for GBS colonization without risk factors.  

**HSV Management:**  
- **Primary HSV infection near delivery (<6 weeks):**  
  - Recommend **cesarean section** to reduce neonatal transmission.  
  - Avoid invasive procedures if vaginal delivery occurs.  
  - Administer **IV acyclovir** during labor; neonatal team must be informed.  
- **Recurrent HSV at delivery:**  
  - Vaginal delivery is acceptable if no active lesions.  
  - Avoid invasive procedures if lesions are present.  
- **PPROM with primary HSV:**  
  - Cesarean section is preferred; IV acyclovir given during conservative management.  
- **Postnatal care:**  
  - Hand hygiene is critical; avoid kissing if oral lesions are present.  
  - Breastfeeding is safe unless nipple lesions exist.  

Key principles emphasize **individualized care** while adhering to evidence-based recommendations.
