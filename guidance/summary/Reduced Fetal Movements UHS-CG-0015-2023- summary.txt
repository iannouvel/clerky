The Reduced Fetal Movements Guideline aims to reduce avoidable stillbirths by providing guidance on managing pregnant individuals with reduced fetal movements. It is intended for obstetricians and midwives who should follow and review the guideline as needed. The guideline defines fetal movements, lists factors influencing perception of reduced fetal movements, and advises immediate contact with the maternity unit if concerned. It outlines hospital assessment procedures, management based on gestational age, and offers guidance for a single episode of presenting with reduced fetal movements before viability gestation. The guideline emphasizes the importance of confirming fetal viability, assessing for risk factors, and considering expediting birth if necessary, with continuous monitoring recommended during labor induction.
