The FIGO consensus guidelines on intrapartum fetal monitoring recommend that cardiotocography (CTG) should not replace clinical judgment but be used in high-risk situations for fetal hypoxia. Continuous CTG is advised when abnormalities are detected during intermittent auscultation. Maternal positioning during monitoring is crucial, avoiding prolonged supine recumbent positions. Initial monitoring should be external fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, with simultaneous maternal heart rate monitoring in specific cases. Analysis of CTG tracings involves assessing baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions. Management of fetal hypoxia/acidosis requires prompt intervention and addressing underlying causes. Continuous CTG may not significantly improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary interventions. Regular staff training is essential for safe monitoring. Clinical guidelines should be straightforward and objective for effective technology use.
