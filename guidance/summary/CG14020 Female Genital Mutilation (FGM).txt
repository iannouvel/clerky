**Clinical Guideline Summary: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)**  

FGM involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons, causing significant harm with no health benefits. Types include clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation, and other harmful procedures. UK healthcare professionals must legally report cases in girls under 18 to the police and safeguard at-risk individuals.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Mandatory Reporting:** Immediate police notification required for confirmed or suspected FGM in under-18s.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Use indicators (e.g., family history, travel to high-prevalence countries) to identify risk. Refer to safeguarding leads if concerns arise.  
- **Documentation:** Record all assessments, decisions, and referrals in patient records. Share information with GPs and safeguarding teams.  
- **Immediate Risk:** If harm is imminent, escalate to Social Services, Police, or Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH).  
- **Patient Support:** Provide FGM information leaflets, discuss health complications, and explain UK legal consequences.  

**Clinical Management:**  
- **Maternity Care:** Screen for FGM at 20 and 30 weeks gestation if initially declined.  
- **Data Collection:** Mandate FGM dataset recording while respecting patient objections.  
- **Multi-Agency Collaboration:** Engage safeguarding leads, social services, and specialist teams for high-risk cases.  

**Audit & Compliance:** Ensure adherence to reporting protocols and use FGM datasets for monitoring. Professionals should access support resources and follow structured pathways for at-risk individuals.
