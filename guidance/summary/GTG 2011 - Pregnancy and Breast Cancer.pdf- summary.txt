Greenâ€“top Guideline No. 12, issued in March 2011, provides clinical guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer. The guideline emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary treatment for breast cancer in young women, considering factors such as prognosis, diagnosis, treatment during pregnancy, and contraceptive choices after treatment. Women planning pregnancy after breast cancer should consult with oncologists, surgeons, and obstetricians, with most advised to wait at least 2 years post-treatment. Fertility preservation options should be discussed before treatment, and women can be reassured about the safety of pregnancy and breastfeeding after breast cancer.
