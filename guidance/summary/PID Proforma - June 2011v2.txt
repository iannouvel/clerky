### **Suspected Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Clinical Summary**  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Suspect PID in sexually active women with lower abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, vaginal discharge, or dyspareunia.  
- **Sexual History:** Essential to assess risk factors (multiple partners, unprotected sex, prior STIs).  
- **Examination:** Look for cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or fever.  
- **Investigations:**  
  - High vaginal/endocervical swabs for *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.  
  - Pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy.  
  - Consider CRP/ESR if systemic infection suspected.  

**Management:**  
- **Empirical Treatment:** Start antibiotics promptly (e.g., ceftriaxone + doxycycline + metronidazole).  
- **Follow-Up:** Review in 2 weeks to assess response and confirm STI results.  
- **Partner Notification:** Offer health advisor referral for contact tracing.  

**Discharge Counselling:**  
- Advise abstinence until treatment completion and partner treatment.  
- Discuss long-term risks (infertility, chronic pain, ectopic pregnancy).  

**Documentation:**  
- Complete proforma, obtain consent, and fax to Claude Nicol Clinic.  
- Ensure follow-up arrangements are in place.
