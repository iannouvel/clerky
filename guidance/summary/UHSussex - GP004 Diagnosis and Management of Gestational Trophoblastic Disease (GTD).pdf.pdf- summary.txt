The clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) emphasizes the importance of using guidelines in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues. GTD is a rare condition characterized by trophoblastic tissue proliferation, with clinical features including irregular uterine bleeding and early pregnancy failure. Ultrasound examination is helpful in making a pre-evacuation diagnosis. Evacuation of molar pregnancy is typically done through suction curettage, with anti-D prophylaxis advised for Rh-negative patients. Follow-up testing and contraceptive advice are important, with a low risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Persistent elevation of Î²hCG indicates Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN). In cases of combined molar pregnancy with a viable twin pregnancy, seek advice from a regional Fetal Medicine Centre.
