RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 focuses on preventing entry-related gynaecological laparoscopic injuries, which can occur during blind insertion of needles, trocars, and cannulae. The guideline emphasizes the importance of safe entry techniques to reduce complications, such as bowel, urinary tract, and vascular injuries. Surgeons should be trained in both closed (Veress needle) and open (Hasson) entry techniques, with consideration of alternative sites for insertion in certain cases. Documentation of counseling, reporting adverse events, and following safe surgical protocols are essential. The guideline is based on evidence from expert committee reports and clinical experiences, aiming to improve patient safety during laparoscopic surgery.
