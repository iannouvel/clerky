The clinical guideline on hypertension in pregnancy by NICE provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders in pregnant women. Key recommendations include urgent assessment for symptoms of pre-eclampsia, caution against certain medications and supplements, lifestyle advice, and tailored antihypertensive treatment. The guideline emphasizes individualized care, offering aspirin for high-risk women, and monitoring blood pressure postnatally. Recommendations for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia include timing of birth decisions, antenatal corticosteroids, and magnesium sulfate use. Long-term cardiovascular risks are highlighted, with advice on future pregnancies and follow-up care. The guideline aims to standardize care and improve outcomes for pregnant women with hypertensive disorders.
