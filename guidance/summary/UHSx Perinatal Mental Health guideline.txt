It emphasizes the importance of routine screening, early intervention, and appropriate referrals for those at risk of mental health issues. Key recommendations include using professional judgment, following care pathways, and involving specialist perinatal mental health services for severe cases. The guideline covers various aspects such as prediction and detection of mental illness, referral pathways for different levels of severity, management of medication in pregnancy, and urgent review pathways for individuals in crisis. It also highlights the importance of support services, such as NHS Talking Therapy and the Healthy Futures Team, for additional assistance. Overall, the guideline aims to ensure the emotional well-being of pregnant women and birthing individuals by providing comprehensive care and support throughout the perinatal period.
