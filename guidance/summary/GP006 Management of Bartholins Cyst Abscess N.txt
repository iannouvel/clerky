Bartholin's cyst is the accumulation of mucous in the Bartholin's gland, while Bartholin's abscess is an infected cyst causing pain and inflammation. Management involves surgical intervention for abscesses. Women under 40 may benefit from a Word catheter, while those over 40 require marsupialisation under general anaesthesia. Cellulitis may necessitate IV antibiotics. Vulval abscesses can be managed conservatively with analgesia or surgically for larger abscesses. Antibiotics are not routinely needed. Recurrent abscesses may need diabetes screening and consultant consultation. Excision should be done by a consultant. Word catheter and marsupialisation have different pros and cons. Catheter falls out in 97% success rate at 6 months, while marsupialisation has a 5-15% recurrence rate.
