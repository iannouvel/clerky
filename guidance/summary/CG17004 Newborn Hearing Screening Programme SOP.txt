The Newborn Hearing Screening Standard Operating Procedure outlines the process for offering, conducting, and communicating results for newborn hearing screening within the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. Key points include identifying eligible populations, conducting screening pathways for well babies and NICU babies, obtaining consent for screening, providing immediate results to parents, making referrals based on screening outcomes, and ensuring governance, reporting, and incident management. The document emphasizes training requirements, quality assurance tests, and equipment maintenance. It aims to identify permanent hearing loss early to support infants in developing language, speech, and communication skills. Various appendices cover specific scenarios such as babies in foster care, child death notifications, declined screenings, and ensuring data accuracy in the screening system.
