This clinical guideline focuses on managing diabetes in women planning pregnancy or already pregnant. It emphasizes the importance of good blood glucose control before and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications. Preconception care includes individualized dietary advice, folic acid supplementation, and monitoring HbA1c levels. During pregnancy, monitoring blood glucose levels, offering self-monitoring tools, and setting individualized targets are essential. Intrapartum care involves discussing timing and mode of birth, with elective births recommended for women with diabetes. Neonatal care includes routine blood glucose testing and advanced neonatal resuscitation skills. Postnatal care involves adjusting insulin doses, monitoring blood glucose levels, and providing lifestyle advice.
