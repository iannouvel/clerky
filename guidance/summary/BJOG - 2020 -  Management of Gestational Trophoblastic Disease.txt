The clinical guideline on the management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease emphasizes the importance of recognizing the symptoms and signs of molar pregnancies, such as irregular vaginal bleeding and positive pregnancy tests. The definitive diagnosis is made through histological examination, and suction curettage is the preferred method for removal. Women with persistently elevated hCG levels should be referred to a GTD center, and those with suspected GTN should be investigated promptly. Follow-up care is crucial, and women are advised to wait before conceiving again. Support and resources are available for those affected by GTD. Research is ongoing to improve outcomes and management strategies.
