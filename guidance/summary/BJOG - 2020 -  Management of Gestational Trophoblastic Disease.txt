Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) management involves recognizing symptoms like irregular bleeding and positive pregnancy tests. Diagnosis is confirmed through histological examination. Complete molar pregnancies are best removed via suction curettage. Cervical preparation before surgery is safe, and oxytocic infusions should be used cautiously. Repeat surgery may be needed for persistent bleeding. Histological assessment is recommended for all miscarriages to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia. Elevated hCG levels post-pregnancy may indicate GTN and should prompt referral to a GTD center. Women with suspected ectopic molar pregnancies are managed like typical ectopic pregnancies. Combined molar and viable twin pregnancies require specialized care. Follow-up for GTD is crucial, involving hCG monitoring and potential chemotherapy. Women treated for GTN should delay pregnancy. Long-term outcomes are generally positive, with high cure rates and successful pregnancies. Additional research is needed to improve outcomes and manage relapsed disease. Local adaptations to guidelines should be documented.
