Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) presents with irregular vaginal bleeding, positive pregnancy test, and ultrasonographic evidence; histological examination confirms diagnosis. Suction curettage is preferred for complete molar pregnancies; cervix preparation is safe, and oxytocic infusion is not recommended. Repeat surgical removal may be necessary for acute hemorrhage; histological assessment of miscarriage material is recommended. Referral to a GTD center is advised for persistently elevated hCG; investigation for GTN is warranted with persistent vaginal bleeding. Ectopic molar pregnancies are managed like other ectopic cases; combined molar pregnancy with viable twin requires specialized care. Follow-up for GTD includes hCG monitoring and chemotherapy if needed; surgery may be considered for certain types. Pregnancy timing after GTD treatment varies, and contraception guidance is essential. Support is available for affected individuals, and treatment centers are recommended. Further research is needed for refining outcomes and managing relapsed disease.
