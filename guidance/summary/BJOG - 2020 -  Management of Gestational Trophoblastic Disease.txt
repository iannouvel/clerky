Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Molar pregnancies typically present with irregular vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and ultrasonographic evidence.
- Less common presentations include hyperemesis, excessive uterine enlargement, hyperthyroidism, early-onset pre-eclampsia, and abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts.
- Rare presentations may include haemoptysis or seizures due to metastatic disease affecting the lungs or brain.
- Definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination.

Treatment and Management:
- Suction curettage is the preferred method for complete molar pregnancies.
- Ultrasound guidance during removal is recommended to minimize risks.
- Anti-D prophylaxis is advised post-removal.
- Cervical preparation before surgical removal is safe.
- Oxytocic infusion should be used cautiously due to the risk of excessive bleeding.
- Repeat surgical removal may be necessary for persistent heavy bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise.
- Histological examination of all miscarriage tissues is recommended to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia.
- Referral to a GTD center is advised for persistently elevated hCG levels post-pregnancy.

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor hCG levels for persistent elevation post-pregnancy.
- Follow-up based on hCG levels and may include chemotherapy.

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Avoid oxytocic infusion before complete removal due to the risk of excessive bleeding.
- Biopsy of secondary vaginal deposits is not recommended due to the risk of major hemorrhage.
- Caution is advised in managing suspected ectopic molar pregnancies.
- Women with combined molar pregnancies and viable twins should be referred to specialized centers for care.
