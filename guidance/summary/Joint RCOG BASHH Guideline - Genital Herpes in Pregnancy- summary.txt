Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy involves safe and effective treatment with aciclovir for expectant mothers. Daily suppressive therapy from 36 weeks can reduce HSV lesions at term. Caesarean section is recommended for women with first episode genital herpes in the third trimester to reduce perinatal morbidity. Conservative management is advised for neonates born to mothers with recurrent genital herpes. Efforts to prevent postnatal transmission of HSV are crucial. It is important to follow expert guidelines and consider type-specific HSV antibody testing for accurate diagnosis and management. Vaginal delivery can be considered with appropriate treatment and monitoring.
