Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding during pregnancy from 24 weeks onwards, with placenta praevia and placental abruption as common causes. It complicates 3-5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality. Clinical assessment is crucial, including history-taking, maternal and fetal monitoring, and investigations. Management involves stabilizing the mother, continuous fetal monitoring, and timely delivery. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated, and neonates should be assessed by a pediatrician. Audit topics include corticosteroid administration and anti-D Ig use, while future research areas include interventions to prevent placental abruption. Initial management should follow the ABCD pathway, with prompt resuscitation, monitoring, and delivery of the fetus.
