Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of pregnancy, affecting 3-5% of pregnancies and leading to significant perinatal and maternal mortality. Placenta praevia and placental abruption are common causes, with risk factors including previous abruption and advanced maternal age. Management involves hospitalization, resuscitation, and emergency delivery capabilities, with assessment of maternal and fetal wellbeing crucial. In cases of major APH, immediate resuscitation and delivery are prioritized, while minor cases may consider induction of labor. Intracare should be altered based on the cause of APH, with delivery based on maternal and fetal condition. Postpartum hemorrhage, anti-D Ig administration, and neonatal assessment are also important considerations. Audit topics include corticosteroid administration, anti-D Ig administration, referral for growth scans, third stage labor management, and team training. Massive APH management involves maintaining specific hemoglobin levels
