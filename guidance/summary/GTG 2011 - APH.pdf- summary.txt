Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract during pregnancy, occurring after 24 weeks and before birth. Placenta praevia and placental abruption are important causes of APH, complicating 3-5% of pregnancies. Recurrent APH can occur, with fetal compromise being a key indicator. Clinical assessment and management are crucial, including history-taking, monitoring, resuscitation, and investigations. Timing and mode of delivery are important, with continuous fetal monitoring recommended. Postpartum issues, such as hemorrhage and neonatal assessment, should be addressed. Audit topics and areas for future research are suggested to improve care. Initial management should follow the ABCD pathway, with communication and teamwork being essential in emergency situations. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be based on individual patient needs and available resources.
