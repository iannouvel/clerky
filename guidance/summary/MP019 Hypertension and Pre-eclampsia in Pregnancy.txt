### **Summary of Hypertension & Pre-eclampsia in Pregnancy Guidelines**  

**Definitions:**  
- **Hypertension:** Systolic ≥140 mmHg or diastolic ≥90 mmHg on two occasions.  
- **Chronic hypertension:** Present at booking or before 20 weeks.  
- **Gestational hypertension:** New onset after 20 weeks.  
- **Pre-eclampsia:** Hypertension + proteinuria/end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks.  
- **Eclampsia:** Pre-eclampsia with seizures.  
- **HELLP syndrome:** Severe pre-eclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets.  

**Management Principles:**  
- **Chronic hypertension:** Avoid planned birth before 37 weeks unless BP ≥160/110 mmHg, fetal growth restriction, or other complications. Postnatal BP monitoring for 2-5 days, with GP/specialist follow-up at 2 weeks and 6-8 weeks.  
- **Gestational hypertension:** Secondary care assessment; consider labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa. Avoid early birth before 37 weeks unless complications arise.  
- **Pre-eclampsia:** Target BP ≤135/85 mmHg. Severe cases require high-dependency care, IV magnesium sulfate for seizures, and urgent BP control.  

**Acute Severe Hypertension (BP ≥160/110 mmHg):**  
- **First-line:** IV labetalol (20-80 mg bolus, then infusion up to 160 mg/hr, max 300 mg total).  
- **Second-line:** Oral nifedipine (caution with magnesium sulfate due to hypotension risk).  
- **Third-line:** IV hydralazine (5-10 mg bolus, max 30 mg total).  

**Fetal Monitoring:**  
- **Chronic hypertension:** Cardiotocography (CTG) only if clinically indicated.  
- **Gestational hypertension:** Serial growth scans + Doppler if needed.  
- **Pre-eclampsia:** CTG at diagnosis and as required.  

**Postnatal Care:**  
- Continue antihypertensives if needed (safe for breastfeeding).  
- Advise on long-term cardiovascular risk reduction (healthy BMI, lifestyle changes).  
- Avoid routine thrombophilia screening.  

**Community Midwife Protocol:**  
- **BP ≤140/90:** Routine care.  
- **BP >140/90 or proteinuria:** Refer for obstetric review.  
- **Pre-eclampsia symptoms (e.g., headache, visual disturbances):** Urgent referral.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- Aspirin (150 mg) for high-risk women.  
- Magnesium sulfate for eclampsia/severe pre-eclampsia (avoid alternatives like diazepam).  
- Avoid early delivery before 37 weeks unless medically indicated.  
- Postnatal BP monitoring and follow-up essential.
