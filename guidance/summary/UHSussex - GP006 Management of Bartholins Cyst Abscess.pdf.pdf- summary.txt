Bartholin's cyst is a buildup of sterile mucous in the Bartholin's gland, while an abscess is an infection that leads to inflammation and abscess formation. Management involves monitoring cysts for potential abscess development and surgical intervention for abscesses. Word catheter insertion is an outpatient option for those under 40, while marsupialisation is recommended for those over 40 due to cancer risk. Excision should only be done by a consultant. Vulval abscesses can be managed conservatively or with incision and drainage. Monitoring compliance with the protocol is crucial. Word catheter and marsupialisation have different benefits and success rates.
