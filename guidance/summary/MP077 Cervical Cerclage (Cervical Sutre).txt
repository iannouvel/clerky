**Cervical Cerclage (Cervical Suture) Clinical Summary**  

Cervical cerclage is indicated for women at high risk of mid-trimester loss or preterm labor. Types include history-indicated, ultrasound-indicated, and rescue cerclage. Pre-referral assessment and counseling are required.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Indications:** Consider for cervical funneling without a short cervix (<25mm). Not routinely recommended for multiple pregnancies or uterine anomalies. Individualize for post-trachelectomy cases.  
- **Rescue Cerclage:** Only between 16+0–27+6 weeks with exposed membranes, excluding infection, bleeding, or contractions. Immediate insertion is advised, though delayed placement (after 48 hours) may improve outcomes.  
- **Outcomes:** Typically prolongs pregnancy by 4–5 weeks, with delivery often around 24 weeks.  

**Management:**  
- **Pre-op:** Hospital antenatal referral for evaluation.  
- **Post-op:** Monitor for complications (infection, contractions).  
- **Removal:** Scheduled unless PPROM occurs, requiring individualized management.  

**Contraindications:** Active infection, labor, or bleeding. Clear documentation and informed consent are essential.
