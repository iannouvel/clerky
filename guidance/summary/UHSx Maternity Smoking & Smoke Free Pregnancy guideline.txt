### **Clinical Guideline Summary: Maternity Smoking & Smoke-Free Pregnancy**  

This guideline supports optimal maternal and fetal outcomes by addressing smoking during pregnancy. Smoking increases risks of stillbirth, miscarriage, and sudden infant death, while cessation significantly improves outcomes. Management includes behavioral support and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Consistent Messaging:** Emphasize complete cessation, as reducing smoking still poses risks.  
- **CO Monitoring:** Conduct at every antenatal visit to assess exposure, regardless of smoking status.  
- **Referrals:** Use an "opt-out" approach for current smokers, ex-smokers, and those with elevated CO levels.  
- **NRT & E-Cigarettes:** NRT is safe in pregnancy; e-cigarettes are a harm-reduction option (though long-term effects remain uncertain).  
- **Household Smoking:** Encourage partners and family members to quit to reduce secondhand exposure.  
- **Inpatient Care:** Offer NRT during hospital stays to support abstinence.  

**Staff Training Requirements:**  
- Annual Level 2 training on smoking cessation.  
- Completion of specialist modules (smoke-free pregnancy, vaping).  
- Competency assessments and participation in national webinars.  
- Training in motivational interviewing and behavior change techniques.  

**Critical Actions:**  
- Document smoking status and CO results clearly.  
- Provide tailored counseling and referrals to cessation services.  
- Ensure multidisciplinary support for sustained quitting.
