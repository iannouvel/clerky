### **Summary of Neonatal Jaundice Management Guideline**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for recognizing and managing neonatal jaundice in infants from birth to 28 days. Key priorities include antenatal/postnatal care, risk factor assessment, visual inspection, and bilirubin measurement.  

**Risk Factors & Assessment:**  
- Gestational age, family history, and early jaundice (<24 hours) increase risk.  
- Visual inspection is essential, especially in darker-skinned infants.  
- Serum or gas bilirubin measurement is first-line for infants <35 weeks, jaundiced within 24 hours, or above treatment thresholds. Avoid icterometers.  

**Management:**  
- **Phototherapy:** Initiate if bilirubin exceeds treatment thresholds; discontinue once levels fall below.  
- **Exchange Transfusion:** Required for severe hyperbilirubinemia or acute bilirubin encephalopathy; must be performed in a tertiary unit.  
- **IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG):** Adjunct therapy for specific cases.  

**Prolonged Jaundice (≥14 days term, ≥21 days preterm):**  
- Assess for pale stools/dark urine.  
- Measure conjugated bilirubin, perform FBC, blood group/DAT, urine culture, and metabolic screening.  
- Refer if conjugated bilirubin >25 µmol/L.  

Parental education on jaundice risks, phototherapy, and follow-up is critical. Continuous monitoring ensures timely intervention and prevents complications.
