This NICE guideline covers the management of diabetes from preconception to the postnatal period for women with pre-existing diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and gestational diabetes. Key recommendations include preconception planning with folic acid supplementation (5 mg daily), achieving HbA1c below 48 mmol/mol before pregnancy, and regular blood glucose monitoring during pregnancy. For gestational diabetes, screening is recommended at 24-28 weeks for women with risk factors (BMI ≥30, previous macrosomia, family history, high-risk ethnicity), using a 75g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis requires fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/litre or 2-hour glucose ≥7.8 mmol/litre. Treatment involves dietary and exercise changes, with metformin or insulin if targets are not met. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring is recommended for all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Blood glucose targets during pregnancy are: fasting <5.3 mmol/litre and 1-hour post-meal <7.8 mmol/litre. Women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should deliver between 37-38+6 weeks, while those with uncomplicated gestational diabetes should deliver by 40+6 weeks. Neonatal care includes early feeding (within 30 minutes), blood glucose monitoring at 2-4 hours, and testing for complications. Postnatally, women with gestational diabetes require lifestyle advice, fasting plasma glucose testing at 6-13 weeks, and annual HbA1c monitoring thereafter.
