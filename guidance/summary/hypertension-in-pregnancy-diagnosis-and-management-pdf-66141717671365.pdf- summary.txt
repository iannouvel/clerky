The clinical guideline on hypertension in pregnancy by NICE provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Key recommendations include immediate healthcare professional consultation for symptoms of pre-eclampsia, caution against certain medications and supplements, and lifestyle advice for pregnant women with chronic hypertension. The guideline covers pre-pregnancy advice, antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy, and postnatal care. Recommendations also address gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, including timing of birth, monitoring, and treatment options. Long-term follow-up studies suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women with a history of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. The guideline aims to standardize care and improve outcomes for pregnant women with hypertension.
