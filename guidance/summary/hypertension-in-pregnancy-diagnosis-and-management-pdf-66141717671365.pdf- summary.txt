The clinical guideline on hypertension in pregnancy by NICE provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of this condition. It advises pregnant women to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Recommendations cover the use of aspirin for high-risk women, caution against certain medications and supplements, and provide lifestyle advice. Management of chronic hypertension includes pre-pregnancy counseling and alternative treatments for certain medications. The guideline also includes recommendations for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, with guidance on monitoring, treatment, and timing of birth. Long-term follow-up for cardiovascular risks is also emphasized. The aim is to standardize care and improve outcomes for pregnant women with hypertension.
