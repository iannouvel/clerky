The NICE guideline on hypertension in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and management, particularly for women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. Recommendations include prompt healthcare professional consultation for symptoms such as severe headache or sudden swelling, caution against certain medications and supplements, and lifestyle advice. Specific guidance is provided for managing chronic hypertension during pregnancy, including pre-pregnancy counseling, alternative antihypertensive treatments, and offering aspirin from 12 weeks. The guideline also covers monitoring and treatment of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, with recommendations for timing of birth, antenatal corticosteroids, and postnatal care. Long-term follow-up and counseling on cardiovascular risks are also highlighted.
