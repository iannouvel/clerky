Guideline emphasizes prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy to prevent mortality. Symptoms include flu-like illness. Non-falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine; severe falciparum cases require hospitalization and IV artesunate or quinine. Regular monitoring is crucial. IV artesunate is recommended for severe cases, seek expert consultation if needed. Clindamycin is not recommended in pregnancy. WHO suggests artemisinin-based therapy in later trimesters. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are not recommended due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is not advised in pregnancy. Plasmodium falciparum can persist in the placenta post-treatment, necessitating careful monitoring.
