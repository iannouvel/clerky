Diagnosis and Presentation:
- Symptoms of malaria in pregnancy include flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise
- Diagnostic tests include thick and thin blood films, malaria rapid antigen tests, and other investigations
- Prompt treatment with appropriate antimalarials is crucial
- Severe falciparum malaria may present with severe symptoms and complications, requiring urgent intervention
- Delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with death from severe malaria

Treatment and Management:
- Non-falciparum malaria in pregnancy: chloroquine is recommended
- Falciparum malaria in pregnancy:
  - Admit pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria to the hospital
  - Use IV artesunate for severe cases, otherwise IV quinine
  - Avoid quinine monotherapy for uncomplicated cases, use quinine with clindamycin
  - Seek expert consultation for IV artesunate if needed
  - Consider IV artesunate from specialist centers if not available locally
- Regular monitoring and management of malaria in pregnancy is essential
- Avoid clindamycin use in pregnancy
- Upgrade management if patient deteriorates under treatment
- Artemisinin-based combination therapy is recommended in the second and third trimesters
- Atovaquone-proguanil and atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate are safe and effective for uncomplicated P. falciprum in the second and third trimesters
- Avoid chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance
- Primaquine radical cure is not recommended in pregnancy
- Weekly chloroquine can be given to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale before delivery
- Treat chloroquine-resistant P. vivax similarly to chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum

Monitoring Requirements:
- Monitor blood films every 24 hours
- Monitor for hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema in severe malaria cases
- Monitor for preterm labor, fetal growth restriction, fetal distress, and maternal or fetal distress
- Monitor blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs, especially in late pregnancy

Contraindications and Cautions:
- Clindamycin should not be used in pregnancy
- Quinine monotherapy is not recommended for uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy
- Delay in treatment can lead to adverse outcomes
- Avoid chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for P. falciparum treatment due to resistance
- Primaquine radical cure is contraindicated in pregnancy
