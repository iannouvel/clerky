The clinical guideline focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management to prevent adverse outcomes. Symptoms include flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. For severe falciparum malaria, prompt treatment with IV artesunate is recommended. Pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria should be hospitalized, while those with severe cases should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Regular monitoring and management are crucial, with blood films checked every 24 hours. Quinine with clindamycin is used for uncomplicated malaria, and IV artesunate or quinine for severe cases. Clindamycin should not be used in pregnancy. Artemisinin-based therapies are preferred in the second and third trimesters. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended due to resistance. Radical cure with primaquine is not advised during pregnancy. Monitoring for fetal distress, obstetric management, and prevention of vertical transmission are essential in managing malaria in pregnancy.
