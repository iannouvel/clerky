In obstetric ultrasound examinations, fetal sex determination is crucial, respecting parental wishes regarding disclosure; efforts should be made to determine fetal sex, with re-examination or referral if undetermined. Reports should include a visible alert for fetal sex information. Fetal genitalia assessment is vital in routine second-trimester ultrasounds, and direct communication of fetal sex to patients is recommended.
