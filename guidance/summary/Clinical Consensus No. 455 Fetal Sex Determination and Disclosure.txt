Clinical Consensus No. 455 emphasizes the importance of fetal sex determination in obstetric ultrasound examinations and the respect for parental wishes regarding disclosure. Health care providers should make efforts to determine fetal sex during ultrasound exams and include a visible alert in reports if this information is present. The guideline highlights the significance of prenatal diagnosis of fetal genital anomalies and stresses the need for re-examination or referral if fetal sex cannot be determined. Ultimately, the guideline aims to ensure that fetal sex information is accurately communicated to patients and that their preferences are respected throughout the process.
