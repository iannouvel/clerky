Clinical Consensus No. 455 focuses on fetal sex determination and disclosure during obstetric ultrasound examinations. Key recommendations include respecting parental wishes regarding disclosure, making efforts to determine fetal sex during ultrasounds, and providing direct access to ultrasound reports for patients/parents. The guideline emphasizes the importance of detecting fetal genital anomalies and communicating fetal sex information clearly. It suggests re-examination or referral if fetal sex cannot be determined and highlights the need for reports to include a visible alert about the presence of fetal sex details. Overall, the guideline underscores the significance of fetal genitalia assessment in routine second-trimester ultrasounds and stresses the importance of communicating fetal sex information to patients while upholding their preferences.
