The clinical guideline on Placenta Praevia and Placenta Accreta provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of these conditions during pregnancy and delivery. Risk factors, antenatal care, delivery planning, and treatment options are discussed in detail. The guideline emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and tailored management based on individual needs. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy, tocolysis, and planned delivery timing are recommended for optimal outcomes. Uterus-preserving surgical techniques and interventional radiology may be considered in certain cases. The guideline also highlights the need for further research and ongoing monitoring to improve outcomes for women with placenta praevia and accreta.
