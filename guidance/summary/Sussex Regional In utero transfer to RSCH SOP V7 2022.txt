### **Summary of Preterm In-Utero Transfer (IUT) Clinical Guideline**  

This guideline outlines the standardized process for preterm in-utero transfer (IUT) within Sussex maternity units to ensure timely and safe transfer to the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) for high-risk preterm deliveries.  

**Key Indications for IUT:**  
- Threatened preterm delivery <27 weeks for Local Neonatal Units (LNUs), <28 weeks for multiples, or <32 weeks for Special Care Units (SCUs).  
- Required when local expertise or neonatal intensive care (NICU) is unavailable.  

**Management Prior to Transfer:**  
- Rapid triage and stabilization at the local unit.  
- Consider antenatal steroids, antibiotics, and tocolysis as appropriate.  
- Document a clear transfer plan in maternal notes.  

**Transfer Process:**  
- Emergency transfer classification unless otherwise indicated.  
- Full multidisciplinary team (MDT) communication, including obstetric and NICU consultants.  
- Refusal of transfer must be escalated and alternatives explored.  

**Post-Transfer & Learning:**  
- Exception reporting required if IUT fails (<27 weeks or <28 weeks for multiples delivered outside NICU).  
- Incident reviews and shared learning via the LMS Quality & Safety Forum and ODN Governance Meetings.  

**Appendices Include:**  
- SBAR communication tool.  
- SECAmb transfer guidance.  
- Exception reporting form for preterm births outside appropriate units.  

This SOP ensures structured, timely care for high-risk preterm pregnancies, optimizing neonatal outcomes.
