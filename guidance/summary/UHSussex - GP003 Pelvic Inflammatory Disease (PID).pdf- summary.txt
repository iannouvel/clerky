The clinical guideline on Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications. Testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia is recommended, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential for treatment. NICE guidance on drug choice during very early pregnancy is provided, with NSAIDs like ibuprofen considered safe before 30 weeks. Antibiotics like ceftriaxone are low risk during pregnancy, while doxycycline is contraindicated after the 15th week. Follow-up for PID patients includes treatment compliance, clinical progress monitoring, and safer sex messages. Expert opinions differ on whether to remove IUCD in PID cases. Training and monitoring compliance details are also included in the guideline.
