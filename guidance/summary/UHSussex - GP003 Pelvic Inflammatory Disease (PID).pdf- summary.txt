The clinical guideline for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications. Testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia is recommended, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential for coverage of common bacteria. Patients should receive adequate pain relief and anti-emetics. Antibiotic regimens vary for outpatient and inpatient management, with considerations for penicillin allergy. NICE guidance on drug choice during very early pregnancy is provided, with NSAIDs and certain antibiotics deemed safe. Removal of IUCD in PID should be considered, and follow-up care includes monitoring treatment compliance and providing education on safer sex practices.
