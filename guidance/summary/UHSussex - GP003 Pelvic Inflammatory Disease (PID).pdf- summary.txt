Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a serious condition caused by ascending infection from the endocervix, leading to complications. The incidence of PID is rising due to factors like early sexual activity. Diagnosis can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, with testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia recommended. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial for treatment, along with pain relief and anti-emetics. Antibiotic regimens differ for outpatient and inpatient care, with consideration for penicillin allergies. Transitioning from IV to oral antibiotics is advised. NICE guidance on drug choice in early pregnancy is provided. NSAIDs like ibuprofen are deemed safe before 30 weeks of pregnancy. Antibiotics like ceftriaxone are considered low risk during pregnancy, while doxycycline is contraindicated after the 15th week. Follow-up for PID patients includes treatment compliance, progress monitoring, and education on safe sex practices.
