This clinical guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the management of twin and higher order multiple pregnancies. Key points include the increased risks associated with multiple pregnancies, such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and cord entanglement in monochorionic twins. It emphasizes the importance of offering consultant-led care, individualized birth planning discussions, and monitoring for complications like TTTS. Recommendations cover antenatal care, birth planning, monitoring fetal growth, and referral to tertiary care when necessary. Specific management steps include offering corticosteroids for planned birth, monitoring for preterm labor, aspirin prophylaxis for hypertension, and active management of the third stage of labor to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. The guideline outlines considerations for different types of multiple pregnancies, including when to offer vaginal birth or caesarean section. It also provides detailed documentation requirements for labor and delivery, as well as postnatal care and bereavement support if needed.
