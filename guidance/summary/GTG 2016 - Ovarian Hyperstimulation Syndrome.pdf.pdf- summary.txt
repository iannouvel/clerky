The clinical guideline for the management of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) emphasizes the importance of early recognition and appropriate management of this condition in women undergoing fertility treatment. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms and signs of OHSS, grade its severity, and report severe cases to regulatory authorities. Treatment options range from outpatient monitoring to hospitalization, with multidisciplinary care for critical cases. Monitoring for complications such as ascites and renal dysfunction is crucial, and LMWH prophylaxis is recommended for severe cases. Further research is needed to improve understanding and management of OHSS, including its impact on pregnancy outcomes.
