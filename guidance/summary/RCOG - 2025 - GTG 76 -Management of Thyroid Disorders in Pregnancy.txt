The clinical guideline for the management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy emphasizes the importance of using trimester- and manufacturer-specific pregnancy reference ranges for thyroid function tests. Recommendations include iodine supplementation, targeted testing for high-risk populations, and levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism. Women on levothyroxine should increase their dose upon pregnancy confirmation and undergo regular monitoring. Testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies is not recommended unless there is thyroid dysfunction. Antithyroid drugs should be used cautiously in hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, with propylthiouracil preferred. Postpartum thyroiditis management involves monitoring and possible levothyroxine replacement. The guideline also addresses the impact of iodine deficiency on fetal development and the importance of maintaining optimal thyroid function for maternal and fetal health. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction can have lasting consequences like hypothyroidism. Monitoring thyroid function in pregnant women with thyroid antibodies is crucial to prevent postpartum depression. Selenium supplementation may impact postpartum thyroid status in women with thyroid antibodies. Safety of iodine supplementation in these women needs further investigation. These guidelines are meant as general recommendations, not prescriptive directions. Deviations from local protocols should be documented in the patient's case notes.
