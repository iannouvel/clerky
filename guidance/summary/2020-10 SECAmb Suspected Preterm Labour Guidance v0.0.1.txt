The clinical guideline for suspected preterm labor emphasizes the importance of timely and appropriate care to improve outcomes for very premature babies. It highlights the re-organization of services into networks to ensure expert care is available when needed. In case of an emergency, it is recommended to go to the nearest hospital with a labor ward. Different neonatal units provide care based on gestational age, and transfers should be made to the nearest facility with the appropriate level of care if preterm labor is suspected. Assessment of clinical status is crucial in determining the management and transfer of the patient.
