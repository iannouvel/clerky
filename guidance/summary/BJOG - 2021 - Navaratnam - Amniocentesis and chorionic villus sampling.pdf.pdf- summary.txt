Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are prenatal diagnostic tests that come with a risk of miscarriage, especially for women with multiple pregnancies. These procedures should be performed by trained operators after careful consideration of the risks and benefits. It is important to provide support and counseling for women and their partners throughout the screening process. Screening for blood-borne viruses is crucial before undergoing invasive tests, and antiretroviral treatment should be optimized for HIV-infected women. Results from these tests should be interpreted carefully, and decisions about continuing or terminating the pregnancy should be made in consultation with healthcare providers. Studies have shown an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B with high viral loads during amniocentesis.
