The clinical guideline for hypertension and preeclampsia in pregnancy focuses on the management of hypertensive disorders in pregnant individuals. Key recommendations include assessing proteinuria in hypertensive disorders, immediate referrals for high-risk individuals, and considering antihypertensive drugs like labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa. For chronic hypertension, pre-pregnancy advice on weight management and antihypertensive drug considerations are crucial. Planned early birth before 37 weeks is not recommended unless medically necessary. Labetalol infusion is the first-line treatment for hypertension in pregnancy, with monitoring of blood pressure and fetal well-being essential. Fetal monitoring recommendations vary based on the type of hypertension. Intrapartum care should align with NICE guidelines, with close blood pressure monitoring and fluid balance control.
