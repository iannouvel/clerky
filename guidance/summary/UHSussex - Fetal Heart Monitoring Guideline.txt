The Fetal Heart Monitoring clinical guideline provides recommendations for antenatal and intrapartum fetal monitoring. Antenatally, intermittent auscultation is recommended over routine listening, with electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) reserved for high-risk pregnancies. Computerised CTG (cCTG) with DR analysis is advised at 26/40 for severe pre-term pregnancies. During labor, intermittent auscultation is recommended for low-risk pregnancies, while continuous monitoring is suggested for increased-risk pregnancies. Actions include hourly reviews, systematic assessments, and documentation. Interpretation of intrapartum CTG involves assessing contractions, baseline fetal heart rate, variability, decelerations, and accelerations. Classifications include normal, suspicious, and pathological, with corresponding actions for each. Conservative measures may be initiated based on underlying causes. Continuous CTG reviews and fresh eyes assessments are crucial. The guideline emphasizes a holistic approach to fetal monitoring and individualized care based on clinical findings and preferences.
