Guideline No. 450 focuses on the care of pregnant women living with HIV and interventions to reduce perinatal transmission. Key recommendations include offering pre-exposure prophylaxis, continuing antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy, and evaluating pregnancy-relevant co-infections. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy, avoidance of breastfeeding, and newborn prophylaxis can reduce HIV transmission to <1%. Multidisciplinary input is crucial for managing HIV in pregnancy, and real-time assessment of new treatments is necessary. Antiretroviral therapy is essential for pregnant women with HIV, with individualized regimens maximizing adherence. Close monitoring, consultation with experts, and coordination of care are vital for reducing perinatal transmission risk.
