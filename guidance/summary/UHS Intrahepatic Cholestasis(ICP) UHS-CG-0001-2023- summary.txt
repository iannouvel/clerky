The clinical guideline for Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy aims to provide evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and management of ICP for obstetricians and midwives. It emphasizes the importance of considering ICP in pregnant individuals with itching and elevated bile acid concentrations, confirming the diagnosis postnatally, and discussing maternal and perinatal risks. Management includes antenatal care, drug treatment, and timing of birth, with options such as topical treatments, antihistamines, and ursodeoxycholic acid for severe cases. Continuous fetal monitoring during birth is recommended for cases with high bile acid levels, and postnatal care involves monitoring liver function tests and bile acids. Audit recommendations focus on timely birth, additional investigations, and continuous fetal monitoring for severe cases.
