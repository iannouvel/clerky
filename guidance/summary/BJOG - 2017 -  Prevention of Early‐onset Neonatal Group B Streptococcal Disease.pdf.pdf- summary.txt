The clinical guideline for the prevention of early-onset neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease emphasizes the importance of providing pregnant women with information about GBS colonization and the risk of neonatal infection. While universal bacteriological screening is not recommended, clinicians should be aware of clinical risk factors for GBS disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for certain high-risk cases, such as women with GBS bacteriuria or previous affected babies. Immediate treatment with penicillin and gentamicin is advised for babies showing signs of infection. Breastfeeding is encouraged regardless of GBS status, and close monitoring is recommended for babies at risk of EOGBS disease. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended.
