The clinical guideline on Management of Unscheduled Bleeding on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) by the British Menopause Society emphasizes the importance of assessing bleeding patterns, HRT preparations, and cancer risk factors in women presenting with unscheduled bleeding on HRT. Recommendations include adjusting progestogen or HRT preparation if bleeding persists, considering endometrial assessment after 6 months of continued bleeding, and offering reassurance based on endometrial assessment. The guideline also addresses endometrial cancer risk factors, conservative management strategies, and recommendations for endometrial assessment and management options. Research priorities include assessing endometrial cancer risk, evaluating endometrial protection with LNG IUD, and determining optimal intervals for endometrial reassessment in women with recurrent unscheduled bleeding on HRT.
