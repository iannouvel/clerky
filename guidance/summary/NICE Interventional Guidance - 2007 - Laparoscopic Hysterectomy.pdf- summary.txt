This clinical guideline discusses the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy, highlighting the higher risk of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Special training and advanced skills are necessary for performing laparoscopic hysterectomies, which are used for various benign conditions and cancers of the uterus and ovaries. Different laparoscopic procedures are outlined, with benefits including reduced hospital stay and faster return to normal activities. However, there is a higher incidence of major operative hemorrhage and urinary tract injuries with laparoscopic techniques. Healthcare professionals should consider this guidance when making decisions for patients, with local commissioners and providers responsible for implementation.
