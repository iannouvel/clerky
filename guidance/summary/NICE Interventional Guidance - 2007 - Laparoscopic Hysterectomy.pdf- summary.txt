This clinical guideline recommends that healthcare professionals consider laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy as safe and effective, but with a higher risk of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Advanced laparoscopic skills and special training are necessary for these procedures, which are performed for various benign conditions and cancers of the uterus and ovaries. Different laparoscopic procedures are outlined, with benefits including reduced hospital stay and quicker return to normal activities. However, there is a higher incidence of major operative hemorrhage and urinary tract injuries with laparoscopic techniques. It is important for local commissioners and providers to implement this guidance in their local context.
