The clinical guideline outlines the protocol for first-trimester ultrasound screening, including dating scans, combined tests, and declined combined tests. It provides guidance for sonographers on conducting these scans safely. Key recommendations include offering the combined test as the preferred screening option for twin pregnancies, measuring the CRL and NT for each fetus in multiple pregnancies, and offering the quadruple test in the second trimester for Down's syndrome screening if first-trimester screening is missed in twin pregnancies. The guideline also addresses the management of vanished twins, defining it as a non-viable fetus in a twin pregnancy that may be reabsorbed, and provides criteria for interpreting ultrasound findings in such cases. Sonographers are advised to follow specific measurement techniques and criteria outlined in the guideline to ensure accurate screening and assessment in multiple pregnancies.
