Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a safe and effective option for endometrial cancer, with patient selection by a gynaecological oncology team and advanced laparoscopic skills required. The procedure offers a less invasive approach with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery, and similar overall survival rates to abdominal hysterectomy. Hospital stays are significantly shorter with laparoscopic hysterectomy, but rates of conversion to laparotomy and postoperative complications are reported. Potential adverse events include bladder dysfunction and intra-abdominal abscess. Special training is recommended for clinicians performing laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer to ensure optimal outcomes.
