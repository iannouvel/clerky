Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a safe and effective option for treating endometrial cancer, with patient selection by a gynaecological oncology team being crucial. Clinicians must have advanced laparoscopic skills and undergo special training for this procedure. It offers a less invasive approach with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery, and similar overall survival rates to abdominal hysterectomy. Hospital stays after laparoscopic hysterectomy are significantly shorter, but there are risks of conversion to laparotomy and postoperative complications such as bladder dysfunction and intra-abdominal abscess. Overall, laparoscopic hysterectomy is a viable option for endometrial cancer treatment with careful patient selection and skilled clinicians.
