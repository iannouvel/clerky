The clinical guideline supports laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer due to its safety and efficacy. Patient selection should involve a multidisciplinary team and require advanced laparoscopic skills. The procedure offers a less invasive option with a shorter recovery time compared to open surgery. Survival rates are similar between laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy, but laparoscopic hysterectomy results in shorter hospital stays and fewer postoperative complications. Safety data shows low rates of conversion to open surgery and fewer complications with laparoscopic hysterectomy, although adverse events such as damage to structures and respiratory difficulties can occur. More information is available on the NICE website.
