The FSRH Guideline on Contraception After Pregnancy, last updated in October 2020, provides comprehensive information on contraceptive options post-pregnancy. It emphasizes the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) for better effectiveness and highlights the importance of person-centered contraceptive counseling. The guideline covers contraception after childbirth, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, and gestational trophoblastic disease. Recommendations are based on evidence, expert opinion, and considerations of health benefits, side effects, and risks. Consensus among the guideline development group is crucial, and guidelines are updated every 5 years. Auditable outcomes and CPD questions are provided for healthcare practitioners to improve patient care. Feedback on the guideline can be submitted to the FSRH Clinical Effectiveness Unit.
