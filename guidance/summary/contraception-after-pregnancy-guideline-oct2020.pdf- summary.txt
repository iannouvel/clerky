The FSRH Guideline on Contraception After Pregnancy provides comprehensive information on contraceptive methods post-pregnancy, emphasizing the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) for better effectiveness. Clinicians are advised to refer to the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (UKMEC) for safe and appropriate methods. The guideline covers contraception after childbirth, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and gestational trophoblastic disease, with specific recommendations for each scenario. Valid consent, timely initiation of contraception, and comprehensive counseling are highlighted. The guideline also addresses issues such as fertility awareness methods, emergency contraception, and the importance of follow-up care. Feedback on the guideline can be provided for continuous improvement.
