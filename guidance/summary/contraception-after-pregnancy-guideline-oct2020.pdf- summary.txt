The FSRH guideline on Contraception After Pregnancy provides comprehensive recommendations for safe and effective contraceptive care for women after pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or gestational trophoblastic disease. Key points include the importance of offering a full range of contraceptive methods immediately after pregnancy, facilitating private discussions, obtaining valid consent, and providing timely and accurate information. The guideline emphasizes the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and the need for additional contraceptive precautions depending on the timing of contraception initiation. Clinicians should be knowledgeable about gender-based violence and establish pathways to specialist care for complex needs. Valid consent and documentation are essential for all contraceptive decisions after pregnancy.
