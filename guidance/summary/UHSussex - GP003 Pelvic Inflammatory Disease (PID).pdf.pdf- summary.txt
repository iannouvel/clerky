The clinical guideline on Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications. It highlights the increasing incidence of PID, especially among younger individuals. Testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia is recommended, with treatment involving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pain management and anti-emetics should be offered to patients. The guideline provides antibiotic regimens for both outpatient and inpatient settings, with considerations for penicillin allergy. NICE guidance on drug choice during early pregnancy is included, with NSAIDs and certain antibiotics deemed safe. Follow-up care for PID patients includes monitoring treatment compliance, clinical progress, and providing safer sex messages.
