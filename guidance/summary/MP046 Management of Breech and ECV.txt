**Summary of Breech Presentation & ECV Management (RSCH PRH MP046)**  

Breech presentation occurs in 3-4% of term pregnancies and increases perinatal risks. Types include frank, complete, footling, and kneeling breech. Before 36 weeks, most fetuses turn spontaneously; after 36 weeks, referral to the Day Assessment Unit is required.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **External Cephalic Version (ECV):** Offered at term unless contraindicated (50% success rate), performed by trained obstetricians with informed consent.  
- **Delivery Options:**  
  - **Elective Cesarean (LSCS):** Booked at ~39 weeks if chosen.  
  - **Planned Vaginal Breech Birth:** Requires thorough risk assessment (e.g., hyperextended neck, abnormal fetal weight, footling presentation). Higher-risk cases should be advised toward cesarean.  
  - **Contraindications:** Induction not recommended unless specific criteria met.  

**Intrapartum Care:**  
- **Vaginal breech birth** should occur in a unit with immediate cesarean and neonatal support.  
- **First stage:** Monitor closely; lower tolerance for delay.  
- **Second stage:** Passive descent first, then active pushing. Use "hands-poised" approach; avoid traction. Assisted maneuvers (e.g., Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit) for delays (extended arms/head).  
- **Emergency cesarean** if complications arise (e.g., fetal distress, arrested progress).  

**Special Cases:**  
- **Preterm breech:** Cesarean recommended.  
- **Twins:** Cesarean advised for breech-presenting twin.  

**Governance:** Regular training, audits, and clear communication with patients. Emergency protocols and PROMPT card available for unplanned breech labor.
