**Summary of Maternity Triage Guideline**  

This guideline standardizes urgent obstetric assessment using the **BSOTS (Bedside Standard Obstetric Triage System)** to prioritize care based on clinical urgency.  

**Key Responsibilities:**  
- Staff must apply BSOTS protocols and escalate concerns appropriately.  
- Initial triage assessment must occur within **15 minutes** of arrival.  

**Triage Process:**  
- **Telephone Triage:** Women are advised to attend based on symptom severity using BSOTS criteria.  
- **Antenatal Triage:** Initial assessment includes maternal/fetal observations, symptom-specific algorithms (red/orange/yellow/green), and immediate care planning.  
- **Triage Assessment Card (TAC):** Documents patient details, symptoms, observations, and urgency category.  

**Clinical Prioritization:**  
- Algorithms guide urgency classification; clinical judgment can only **increase** priority, not lower it.  
- **Red flags** (e.g., Oâ‚‚ sats <93%, chest pain, severe breathlessness) require immediate review.  

**Communication & Escalation:**  
- Handover follows **SBAR** (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation).  
- Delays must be escalated to the **Labour Ward Coordinator**.  

**Additional Considerations:**  
- **COVID-19 management:** Thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized patients, hydration, and mobility advised.  
- **Neonatal referrals:** Follow community pathways.  
- **Audit:** Monitor timeliness and red-flag delays.  

This ensures timely, standardized care for maternity patients.
