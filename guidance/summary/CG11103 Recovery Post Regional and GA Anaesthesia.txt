**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Recovery Following Regional and General Anaesthesia (Maternity)**  

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for post-anaesthetic recovery care following caesarean section and other obstetric procedures. It applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and recovery staff.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Monitoring:** Continuous observation of vital signs (BP, SpO₂, temperature) until the woman is stable and conscious. Specific protocols differ for regional vs. general anaesthesia.  
- **Equipment:** Essential recovery equipment includes BP and SpO₂ monitors, oxygen, suction, and infusion devices.  
- **Recovery Care:** Ensure IV patency, administer prescribed medications, and never leave the woman unattended.  
- **Discharge Criteria:** Must meet stability benchmarks—consciousness, clear airway, stable cardiovascular status, adequate analgesia, and removal of pressure dressings.  
- **Postnatal Care:** Monitor vital signs, support breastfeeding, and provide neonatal care. Refer anaesthetic complications to an obstetric anaesthetist.  

**Additional Points:**  
- Pressure area care must be maintained.  
- Staff must complete recovery training as per Maternity Training Needs Analysis.  
- Audits should assess vital sign documentation and MEOWS chart completion.  

Care continues until full handover to the midwife, ensuring safe transition to the postnatal ward.
