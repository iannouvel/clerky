The clinical guideline GP002 for Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum provides recommendations for healthcare professionals in managing symptoms of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. It emphasizes the importance of assessing symptom severity, using the PUQE scoring system, and providing safe anti-emetics for primary care management. In cases of severe hyperemesis gravidarum, the guideline outlines steps for inpatient management, including fluid administration, monitoring, and potential use of oral steroids. The guideline also includes a management algorithm, training recommendations, and a discharge plan with specific medications and follow-up appointments. In severe cases requiring TPN or prolonged hospitalization, consultation with specialists is recommended.
