The clinical guideline GP002 addresses the management of vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to use professional judgment when following the guidelines, which apply to early pregnancy nausea and vomiting. Baseline assessment should include severity scoring, and primary care management involves safe anti-emetics. Inpatient management may be necessary for severe cases, with close monitoring and fluid support. A management algorithm is provided, including steps for baseline assessment and acute treatment. Discharge recommendations include medication, follow-up appointments, and patient information. Severe cases may require TPN or oral steroids, with consultation with consultants as needed.
