Clinical Guideline GP002 provides guidance on the management of vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Healthcare professionals are advised to assess the severity of symptoms using the PUQE scoring system and consider primary care management with safe anti-emetics. In cases of severe symptoms, acute treatment and potential admission may be necessary. Inpatient management involves providing fluids, anti-emetics, and close monitoring of progress. The guideline also includes a management algorithm for hyperemesis gravidarum. Discharge instructions include medications, follow-up appointments, and patient information. More severe cases may require TPN or oral steroids. Close communication with consultants is recommended for complex cases.
