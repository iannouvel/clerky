**Clinical Guideline Summary: Prevention and Management of Baby Abduction in Hospital Settings**  

This guideline outlines measures to prevent infant abduction in hospitals, emphasizing maternal-infant bonding and rapid response protocols. Key recommendations include strict identification protocols (matching ID bands for mother and baby), staff vigilance, and CCTV surveillance. Immediate actions during suspected abduction involve activating alarms, securing ward exits, and notifying security, maternity staff, and police. Ongoing steps include supporting the affected mother, informing other families, and preserving evidence (e.g., avoiding disturbance of the empty cot or clothing).  

Designated leads (Head of Midwifery, On-call Midwife Manager, Communications Manager) coordinate the response, while staff must defer media inquiries to communications teams. Post-incident, a Datix report is required, and normal operations resume only after clearance. Regular staff training and audits ensure preparedness. The policy applies to maternity, security, portering, and switchboard teams to maintain a unified response.
