Older mothers face increased risks for both mother and baby, including higher rates of obstetric complications and stillbirth. Induction of labour at 39-40 weeks in women aged 40 and older may reduce the risk of stillbirth and improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the caesarean section rate. However, there is insufficient data on the effect of this policy on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Research is needed to further understand the impact of induction of labour in advanced maternal age, especially in nulliparous women over 35 years old. Recommendations for recruitment in a National Institute for Health Research-funded study are provided.
