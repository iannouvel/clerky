The clinical guideline on induction of labour in older mothers highlights the increased risks for both mother and baby associated with advanced maternal age. Stillbirth rates are higher in women aged 40 and older, making earlier induction of labour a justifiable option to reduce this risk. Induction has been shown to improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the rate of caesarean sections. However, there is a lack of data on the impact of induction on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Further research is needed to better understand the effects and benefits of induction of labour in advanced maternal age.
