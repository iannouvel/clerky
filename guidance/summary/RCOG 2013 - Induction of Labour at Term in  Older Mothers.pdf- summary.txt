The clinical guideline on induction of labour at term in older mothers emphasizes the increased risks faced by women aged 40 and older, including higher rates of obstetric complications and stillbirth. Inducing labour at 39-40 weeks may reduce the risk of stillbirth and improve perinatal outcomes without increasing the caesarean section rate. However, there is limited data on the impact of this policy on surgical deliveries and perinatal mortality in older mothers. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of induction of labour in advanced maternal age, with a specific focus on nulliparous women over 35 years old.
