The clinical guideline for Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth emphasizes the importance of individualized antenatal care, counselling, and decision-making for women considering planned VBAC. Factors influencing the success of VBAC, risks of uterine rupture, and benefits of VBAC versus ERCS are outlined in detail. Intrapartum management, induction of labor, and planning for ERCS are also addressed. Special considerations for women with multiple previous caesareans or specific circumstances are highlighted. The guideline is based on evidence from observational studies and trials, with a focus on reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality while supporting informed decision-making for women with previous cesarean deliveries.
