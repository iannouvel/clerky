### **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Clinical Summary**  

**Definition & Pathogenesis:**  
PID is an ascending infection from the endocervix, leading to endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, or pelvic peritonitis. Most cases are sexually transmitted, primarily involving *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, though anaerobes and *Mycoplasma* may also contribute.  

**Clinical Features:**  
Key symptoms include lower abdominal pain, deep dyspareunia, abnormal vaginal bleeding/discharge, and fever. Signs include cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, and possible fever.  

**Diagnosis & Investigations:**  
Diagnosis is clinical but supported by testing for gonorrhoea/chlamydia, urinalysis, blood tests (CRP/WBC), and pelvic ultrasound if abscess is suspected.  

**Management:**  
- **Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum coverage is essential. Outpatient regimens include ceftriaxone + doxycycline Â± metronidazole. Inpatient IV therapy (e.g., cefoxitin + doxycycline) may be required for severe cases.  
- **Pregnancy Considerations:** Avoid doxycycline; azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole are safer options.  
- **Analgesia:** Paracetamol is preferred in early pregnancy; NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are acceptable before 30 weeks.  
- **Follow-Up:** Ensure treatment compliance, test for STIs, and notify/treat sexual partners.  

**General Advice:**  
- Rest for severe cases.  
- Abstain from intercourse until treatment completion.  
- Avoid alcohol with metronidazole.  
- Discuss long-term risks (e.g., infertility, ectopic pregnancy).  

**Complications & Referral:**  
Monitor for treatment failure, abscess formation, or persistent symptoms requiring specialist review. Early intervention reduces chronic sequelae.
