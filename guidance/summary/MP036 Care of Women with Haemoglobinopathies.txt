**Summary of Clinical Guideline: Care of Women with Haemoglobinopathies**  

This protocol outlines the management of pregnant women with haemoglobinopathies, emphasizing standardized care while allowing for clinical judgement. Midwives and obstetricians must follow these guidelines, ensuring timely screening, partner testing, and specialist involvement when needed.  

**Key Recommendations:**  
- **Thalassaemia:** Trait carriers pose no maternal/fetal risks, but major/intermedia cases require haematologist input due to higher complications.  
- **Sickle Cell Disease (SCD):** Increased risk of crisis (especially third trimester), pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Prevent dehydration with IV fluids if needed.  
- **Antenatal Sickle Cell Crisis:** Admit to delivery suite, involve obstetric/anesthetic teams, and ensure adequate analgesia.  
- **Labour Management:** No contraindication to normal obstetric practice; continuous fetal monitoring advised.  
- **Postnatal Care:** High VTE riskâ€”consider thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.  

Critical steps include early specialist referral, vigilant monitoring, and tailored interventions to mitigate risks.
