The prevention of malaria in pregnancy
Green–top Guideline No. 54a
April 2010RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54a 2o f  1 4 © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThe prevention of malaria in pregnancy
This is the first edition of this guideline.
1. Purpose and scope
The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidenced based, up-to-date information about the
prevention of malaria in pregnancy in situations that are likely to be encountered in UK medical facilities (thatis, UK-based residents visiting malaria endemic areas). These guidelines are not necessarily appropriate forthose residing in endemic areas.
1This guideline covers malaria prevention travel recommendations in:
●women planning a pregnancy
●those already pregnant or breast feeding.
Drug recommendations for malaria prophylaxis can change, owing to resistance, and up-to-date informationon drugs can be obtained using online resources as described in this guideline.
2. Background
Malaria can be life-threatening but it is preventable. Malaria is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles
mosquito, which results in infection of the red blood cell. The species determines the pattern of the disease.The species of the 1370 imported infections reported in the UK in 2008 were: 79.3% (1087) 
P . falciparum ,
12.9% (170) P. v i v a x , 5.5% (76) P. o v a l e , 2.1% (20) P .  malariae , one unspecified infection and, of all these, nine
were mixed infections.2In 2006, there was one case report of primate malaria ( P . knowlesi ) in a UK traveller
returning from Brunei.2In 2008, there were six deaths reported in the UK from malaria.2By far the heaviest
burden of malaria in travellers from the UK is P .  falciparum from Africa (mainly West Africa, particularly
Nigeria and Ghana).3P . falciparum is the most dangerous species of malaria and causes the vast majority of
deaths worldwide. In UK travellers to Asia, particularly to the Indian subcontinent, infection with P. v i v a x is
more likely and this can cause a relapsing type of malaria. P .  ovale can also cause relapsing malaria and P.
malariae is unique, owing to late recrudescence after many years. Other places where UK travellers have
acquired malaria include South and Central America (including Great Exuma in the Bahamas), Hispaniola,Oceania and the Middle East.
2In the UK, the majority of travellers with imported malaria report visiting
friends and relatives in their families’ country of origin, especially in West Africa.4–7The uptake of chemopro-
phylaxis among people residing in the UK who present with malaria in the UK is low.8Special effort to tailor
malaria prevention messages to migrant groups could reduce the risk of travel-associated malaria significantly.8
Pregnant women are not specifically identified in the UK surveillance data.2A report published by the Health
Protection Agency does not mention pregnancy.8Most of the literature on imported malaria worldwide is
based on a few reports of isolated cases9–11with the most comprehensive series of 14 pregnant women
reported by French investigators in Marseille.12Perhaps the message contained in this limited literature is
found in surveillance from the USA: pregnant women comprised 1.6% of malaria cases (24/1505) during 2008and none had adhered to a complete preventive drug regimen.

3. Identification and assessment of the evidence
A literature search was performed using Medline (1983 to November 2009). The keywords used were‘malaria’, ‘prevention’, ‘travellers’, ‘UK’, ‘imported malaria’, ‘pregnancy’ and ‘breast feeding’. Reference lists ofthe articles identified were hand searched for additional articles. Other sources included malaria-related pagesfrom the websites of the Health Protection Agency [www.hpa.org.uk/HPA], the National Travel HealthNetwork and Centre [www.nathnac.org], European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance[www.tropnet.net], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [www.cdc.gov/Malaria] and TOXBASE, theprimary clinical toxicology database of the National Poisons Information Service [www.toxbase.org].© Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 3o f  1 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54a4. What are the medical complications of malaria in pregnancy?
Malaria infection in pregnancy carries significant risks to mother and baby.
UK-based residents have low premunition and high susceptibility to malaria infection.Malaria infection in pregnancy may result in reduced birth weight in the fetus and this may have health
consequences in later life.
Malaria in pregnancy adversely affects the mother and fetus (Table 1).14,15Maternal mortality or
pregnancy loss from miscarriage, stillbirth and premature labour are the main complications ofmalaria in women with low premunition and complications are likely to be equivalent or worse inwomen who are not immune.
16–18The principal effect of malaria in pregnancy in women from
endemic countries is low birth weight and this could have consequences on health in adulthood.19
The extent of this effect in returned travellers has not been well documented.12In endemic areas,
pregnant women are twice as likely to be bitten by anopheline mosquitoes20,21and to contract and
die from malaria22,23than their non-pregnant counterparts. The clinical manifestations in pregnancy
depend on premunition; that is, the degree of naturally acquired host immunity to malaria (Table1).
14,18,24,25Premunition depends on repeated exposure to infectious anopheline bites, so UK-based
residents will have low or no premunition.
5. Prevention of malaria infection in pregnancy
5.1 What advice should pregnant women be given if they are considering travel to a malaria endemic area?
Pregnant women should consider the risks of travel to malaria endemic countries and consider
postponing their trip, unless travel is unavoidable.
A health professional advising a prospective UK resident who is pregnant or thinking about becoming
pregnant and who is intending to go to a malaria endemic area should suggest that the woman considers notgoing or postponing their trip until they are no longer pregnant (Table 1).

Advise the woman to seek guidance from a centre with expertise on malaria risks and avoidance
strategies.
Advise women that a fever or flu-like illness while travelling or upon returning home, up to 1 year or
more, may indicate malaria and requires medical attention.
Advise the woman on the risk of being exposed to malaria at her intended area of travel.
There are no measures specific to pregnancy that can be taken to prevent malaria beyond those that non-
pregnant travellers can apply.27,28
The ‘ABCD’ of malaria prevention is a useful formula to remember the components of malaria prevention:
●Awareness of risk (see Section 5.2.1)
●Bite prevention (see Section 5.3)
●Chemoprophylaxis (see Section 5.4)
●Diagnosis and treatment which must be prompt (see 5.5).
Women need to be educated about possible measures and, where possible, provided with written information
in their own language.1
The Department of Health produces Think Malaria leaflets (order code MAL/1) which are available in 11
different languages and can be obtained from DH Publications by writing to: DH Publications Orderline, POBox 777, London SE1 6XH, or by telephoning 03001231002, or by email to dh@prolog.uk.com or for furtherinformation see the Department of Health website [www.orderline.dh.gov.uk].
5.2.1 What needs to be done to raise pregnant traveller’s awareness of the risk of malaria?
The risk of malaria is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of transmission in the area(s) oftravel and the time of year (rainy or dry season), the presence of drug resistant strains of 
P . falciparum or P.
vivax , whether rural or urban sleepovers are planned, length of travel and the availability and the likelihood
of uptake of malaria prevention interventions.29For example, if a woman proposes to go to urban tourist areas
of Southeast Asia, such as Bangkok and Phuket, and stay in air-conditioned hotels, the risks are consideredminimal for malaria, whereas urban travel in sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea (Papua New Guinea andPapua) constitutes a significant risk of infection. For UK residents, the risk remains disproportionately high inthe African Diaspora of travellers visiting friends and relatives in West Africa, particularly Nigeria, Ghana andUganda.
8The risk of contracting malaria during a 1 month stay without chemoprophylaxis (regardless of
country of residence of the traveller) has been estimated from retrospective studies of large numbers oftravellers (Table 2).

chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum and P. v i v a x malaria and the trimester of pregnancy. There are malaria
prevention guidelines produced for travellers who are UK residents and these are detailed: by country andpopular destination and updated regularly.
1It is not the aim of this guideline to reproduce these guidelines
here. They can be directly accessed on the Health Protection Agency website [www.hpa.org.uk/HPA/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ] and clicking on malaria. Updates to guidelines, such as change in resistanceor transmission, can be found at the same place.
Chemoprophylaxis for malaria can be causal or suppressive. Causal prophylaxis is directed against
liver schizont stage, which takes approximately 7 days to develop so these drugs (for example,atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®) need to be continued for 7 days after leaving a malarious area.
80
Suppressive prophylaxis (such as mefloquine) is directed against the red blood cell stages of themalaria parasite and so should be continued for 4 weeks after leaving a malarious area.
81The full
listings of drug actions, dosages, adverse effects, interactions and contraindications is contained inthe British National Formulary [www.bnf.org] and will not be repeated here. Women should bewarned that drugs purchased in endemic countries or over the internet may be cheaper but theymay be fake.
82–84
5.4.1 Chemoprophylaxis for women planning a pregnancyWomen planning pregnancy and travelling to a destination where there is a risk of contracting malaria shouldbe advised there may be harmful consequences for the pregnancy. Prophylaxis is not 100% effective andmalaria is associated with increased risk of miscarriage. Women should be advised not to travel or to choosean alternative destination. If it not possible to delay either the pregnancy or the travel plan, advice from aspecialist with current experience of malaria should be sought (Box 2). Chloroquine and proguanil are notefficacious in chloroquine-resistant areas and cannot be recommended because of this.
85There are very few
chloroquine-sensitive areas remaining.
To avoid completely any potential adverse drug effects from preconceptual and first-trimester exposure, it is
advisable to wait for complete excretion of the drug, if it was taken for prophylaxis, before becomingpregnant (Table 3). Nevertheless, unplanned conception while taking malaria prophylaxis is not considered areason to recommend termination of pregnancy, owing to the low risk of teratogenicity.
5.4.2 Chemoprophylaxis for pregnant or breastfeeding women
Mefloquine (5mg/kg once a week) is the recommended drug of choice for prophylaxis in the second and thirdtrimesters for chloroquine-resistant areas. With very few areas in the world free from chloroquine resistance,mefloquine is essentially the only drug considered safe for prophylaxis in pregnant travellers (Table 4).
7
The majority of observational and clinical data, mostly second and third trimesters, suggest that thedrug does not result in an increased risk of stillbirth or congenital malformation at prophylacticdoses.
104,108,109One study found an association with increased risk of still birth at treatment doses (25
mg/kg) for chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum malaria110but other studies where the drug has beenEvidence

areas of high risk of acquiring falciparum malaria. In the UK, this can be discussed with a specialistwith current experience of managing malaria (Box 2). There are strict contraindications tomefloquine, including current or previous history of depression, neuropsychiatric disorders,epilepsy or hypersensitivity to quinine or mefloquine.

93RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54a 9o f  1 4 © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsAtovaquone and proguanil (Malarone®) is potentially a good candidate for prophylaxis in the
second and third trimesters but it is not recommended, owing to insufficient data on its safety inpregnancy.
115To date, only treatment data on pregnant women have been published; the drug was
effective and well tolerated with no adverse effects detected.93,116–119If travel to a chloroquine-
resistant area is essential in pregnancy and mefloquine cannot be tolerated or is contraindicated,atovaquone and proguanil use can be considered in consultation with a specialist with currentexperience of managing malaria (Box 2).
7
Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated as chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women.Doxycyline has been reported to disturb bone growth of the fetus
120and to cause irreversible teeth
coloration when given in the third trimester121and congenital cataract has been reported.122
Primaquine can cause haemolysis, particularly in G6PD deficiency. Fetal red blood cells are moresensitive to haemolysis and the G6PD status of the fetus cannot be determined.
123,124
While chloroquine and proguanil are safe, they are no longer efficacious in areas of chloroquineresistance and provide women with suboptimal prophylaxis if recommended.
1
Recommendations for breastfeeding mothers are the same as for pregnancy. There are few data onthe use mefloquine during breastfeeding
125and, while it is excreted into breast milk in small
amounts, there are not enough data to draw conclusions regarding harm.126
Atovaquone and proguanil may also be considered in consultation with an infectious diseases physician for apregnant woman travelling to a mefloquine-resistant area.

5.5 Emergency standby treatment in pregnancy?
Written instructions should be given to a pregnant traveller regarding emergency standby malaria
treatment in the event of suspected malaria without access to medical care.
Suspected malaria is a medical emergency and women should seek diagnosis and treatment at a
health facility at the earliest opportunity.1,28Early diagnosis and stand-by emergency treatment have
been promoted in the event of remote travel without access to medical care within 24 hours ofsymptoms. In theory, this should be an extremely rare situation in pregnant women, as this type oftravel could be hazardous in pregnancy. Owing to reports of the misuse of standby treatment
127,128
and the importance that it is given correctly, written instructions should be issued. An exampletemplate is available from the Health Protection Agency Malaria Guideline, on page 54 of the 2007edition [www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1203496943315?p=1249920576136].
1
Standby treatment should be started if malaria is suspected (flu-like illness) and temperature is 38°C or above.Medical treatment for a full medical evaluation and, in the event that the fever has another cause, must be soughtat the earliest possibility.  Antipyretics should be used for fever.  The only recommended treatment in the UK forpregnant women is quinine (300 mg tablets, two tablets three times a day for 7 days) and clinda-mycin (150 mgcapsules, three capsules three times a day for 5–7 days). If a dose is vomited within 30 minutes, the full doseshould be repeated and if the dose is vomited after 30–60 minutes, half the dose should be repeated. Thetreatment should be finished and mefloquine should be commenced 1 week after the last treatment dose.
Drugs that are highly efficacious and well tolerated are likely to be the best candidate drugs for stand-byemergency treatment. Quinine may be efficacious in most parts of the world but it is not well tolerated. Co-artem (Riamet®) or atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®) (if not used as prophylaxis) could be used as stand-by emergency treatment and evidence to support the use of these drugs in uncomplicated malaria inpregnancy is detailed in Part B of this guideline.

DBAAPPENDIX  
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in
making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematicallydeveloped using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in ClinicalGovernance Advice No. 1: Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website
at 
www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/development-rcog-green-top-guidelines-
policies-and-processes ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of
management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resourcesand limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process oflocal ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areasof clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated within the appropriate health services.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme. Once adapted for local use, theseguidelines are no longer representative of the RCOG.128. Swales CA, Chiodini PL, Bannister BA. New guidelines on

Gynaecologists by: Dr R McGready PhD Dip RANZCOG, Mae Sot, Thailand; Dr EA Ashley PhD, London; Professor FNosten MD PhD, Mae Sot, Thailand; Dr M Rijken MD PhD, Mae Sot, Thailand.

The Guidelines Committee lead peer reviewers were: Dr ALM David MRCOG, London, and Professor F McAuliffe
FRCOG, Dublin.
The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG.
The guideline review process will commence in 2013
unless otherwise indicated
DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical
practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, forconsideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgementregarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the lightof clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available within the appropriatehealth services.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. Onceadapted for local use, these guidelines no longer represent the views of the RCOG.
