This guideline provides advice on the investigation and care of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and growth-restricted fetuses. Key recommendations include assessing women for risk factors for fetal growth restriction, reducing smoking in pregnancy, and monitoring fetal growth with Doppler scans and ultrasound. Differentiating between SGA and FGR is crucial, with specific definitions and monitoring protocols outlined. Early and late onset FGR have distinct characteristics and management approaches, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention for optimal outcomes. Maternal factors and underlying etiologies play a significant role in the development of fetal growth disorders, highlighting the need for comprehensive surveillance and management strategies.

Low sensitivity for detecting SGA/FGR fetuses. Suspicion of a fetal growth disorder relies on ultrasound measurement of fetal AC or estimation of fetal weight. Care of the SGA/FGR fetus focuses on timely birth. Surveillance tests include cardiotocography (CTG), Doppler, and USS. NHS England SBLCB recommends birth at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks for SGA. The SpiRE evaluation of SBLCB demonstrated an increase in USS and inductions of labor at early term. Different management strategies for SGA and FGR aim to reduce unnecessary intervention in SGA babies not at risk of adverse outcomes. The guideline focuses on detecting FGR and targeting intervention for those at increased risk of perinatal death.

Risk assessment for FGR in pregnancy considers previous medical, obstetric, and current pregnancy history. Risk factors include previous FGR/SGA newborn, stillbirth, preterm birth, pregnancy loss, and placenta-mediated complications. Maternal characteristics and medical history associated with increased risk of FGR include diabetes, renal impairment, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Maternal congenital heart disease, asthma, anaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and depression have weaker associations with SGA. Recommendations include assessing risk factors at booking and altering plans based on specific risk factors. Women with previous FGR pregnancies may benefit from low-dose aspirin. Maternal conditions such as diabetes, renal impairment, and cardiac disease may require fetal monitoring by ultrasound.

Advanced maternal age of 40 years or more is associated with increased risk of SGA and FGR. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain are also risk factors for SGA. Bariatric surgery and ethnicity, specifically Southeast Asian, African, and Black African Caribbean, are associated with an increased risk of SGA. Maternal exposures to alcohol, drug misuse, smoking, e-cigarettes, and caffeine consumption can also affect fetal growth. Paternal factors and IVF/ICSI techniques have been linked to SGA. Low PAPP-A levels and raised alpha-fetoprotein levels are risk factors for SGA and FGR. Additional surveillance is recommended for women with abnormal levels of these biochemical markers.

Low PAPP-A, raised AFP, and/or inhibin A should initiate uterine artery Doppler screening and serial growth scans with frequency dependent upon the result. Although low PAPP-A or raised AFP and/or inhibin A are associated with SGA and FGR, their use as a screening tool in isolation is not recommended. Uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out between 18+0 and 23+6 weeks for women at high risk of fetal growth disorders. Findings at the midtrimester anomaly scan should be incorporated into the fetal growth risk assessment. Fetal echogenic bowel and single umbilical artery on midtrimester anomaly scan should prompt uterine artery Dopplers to assess the risk of early onset FGR. Maternal COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of FGR. Prediction models for SGA have moderate predictive ability but should not be the sole method for determining ultrasound surveillance. Smoking cessation and balanced energy/protein supplementation can reduce the risk of SGA. Women should continue to take vitamin D and folic acid as recommended.

High protein supplementation is not recommended due to low-quality evidence. Structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction in high-risk pregnancies showed no significant benefit. Omega-3 fatty acids and multiple micronutrient supplementation may reduce the risk of SGA. Folic acid, calcium, and magnesium supplementation did not show a significant effect on SGA. Vitamin D supplementation remains uncertain. Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of SGA. Aspirin is recommended for women at risk of pre-eclampsia to reduce the chance of SGA and FGR. LMWH, progesterone, hydroxychloroquine, and antihypertensive use do not show significant benefits in reducing SGA or FGR. Serial assessment of fetal growth using SFH measurements is recommended for low-risk women. Abdominal palpation is not accurate for predicting SGA, and abnormal SFH measurements should prompt ultrasound measurement. Women with factors affecting SFH accuracy should undergo ultrasound assessment for fetal size. Staff should be trained in using appropriate charts for SFH measurements.

Maternal obesity, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios, and fetal head engagement contribute to the limited predictive accuracy of SFH measurement. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular chart for recording SFH. Abdominal palpation has limited accuracy in detecting SGA newborns, with SFH measurement showing improved sensitivity. SFH measurement should commence at 24 weeks, with routine assessment starting at 26-28 weeks. Maternal BMI, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios, and fetal head engagement affect the predictive accuracy of SFH measurement. SFH should be measured from the fundus to the symphysis pubis. Referral for further investigation with ultrasound is recommended if SFH plots below the 10th centile. Customised SFH charts may improve detection of SGA. Universal late pregnancy ultrasound does not reduce the incidence of SGA newborns or improve perinatal outcomes. Maternity providers should ensure standard planes of acquisition and calliper placement for ultrasound biometry. Serial ultrasound assessment for fetal growth should start at 32 weeks for moderate-risk women. The interval between scans should be no more frequent than every 14 days. Ultrasound is a core component of fetal growth surveillance and management.

False positive rates for diagnosing FGR can be minimized by ensuring that two measurements are at least 3 weeks apart. AC is comparable to EFW in predicting SGA, and the Hadlock equation is recommended for estimating fetal weight. Maternity providers should follow standard planes of acquisition and calliper placement for measurements and ensure quality control. Customized growth charts may be beneficial for predicting adverse outcomes, but concerns exist about normalizing pathology. Uterine artery Doppler can be used in high-risk populations to determine when ultrasound surveillance of fetal growth should begin. Reduced trophoblast invasion can lead to FGR, and uterine artery Doppler can help predict adverse outcomes related to SGA births. In low-risk women, uterine artery Doppler may not provide significant benefits.

Uterine artery Doppler can be used in the second trimester to assess the risk of placental dysfunction and hypertensive disorders. Serial scans are recommended for high-risk women. Fetal growth velocity and biomarkers can aid in identifying fetuses at risk of growth disorders. Placental morphology and biometry may have limited predictive value. PlGF/s-flt1 testing can help diagnose pre-eclampsia but its use in predicting FGR in non-hypertensive women is uncertain. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for assessing fetal growth and placental function.

Recommendation: Referral to fetal medicine should be offered for severe SGA fetuses with structural anomalies and invasive diagnostic testing should be considered in non-anomalous fetuses detected before 23 weeks of gestation, especially if uterine artery Doppler is normal. Testing for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasmosis infection should be offered in severe SGA cases. Testing for malaria and Zika should be considered in high-risk populations. Invasive testing should include a microarray to detect microdeletions and microinsertions. Follow-up scans should be arranged for the subsequent birth of an SGA infant, and fetal infections should be monitored. Interventions for fetal growth disorders should not include LMWH or phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Surveillance for SGA fetuses should include ultrasound biometry every 2 weeks and umbilical artery Doppler at the point of diagnosis and during follow-up. Timing of birth for SGA fetuses should be optimized to ensure a balance of risks, with consideration for maternal and fetal well-being. Amniotic fluid assessment can be used for monitoring fetal well-being but should not be used in isolation for management decisions.

For SGA fetuses, birth recommendations are based on the findings of the DIGITAT study. Induction before 38 weeks may increase neonatal unit admissions. Severe FGR is associated with adverse childhood outcomes. Induction at 38 weeks may lead to lower costs. Early term birth is linked to an increased risk of subsequent special educational needs. IOL between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks should only be considered for fetuses at significantly increased risk of perinatal mortality. Birth should be considered at 39+0 weeks for all fetuses with EFW or AC less than the 10th centile. For FGR fetuses, differentiating between early and late FGR is important for surveillance. Maternity providers should ensure consistency in Doppler charts used. In early FGR, monitoring should involve input from tertiary level units and multidisciplinary care. Assessment of fetal wellbeing should include cCTG and ductus venosus. Birth decisions should be based on fetal wellbeing assessment or maternal indication. The optimum management of early FGR is largely defined by the TRUFFLE study. Umbilical artery Doppler changes play a role in management after 32 weeks. The frequency of monitoring in early FGR has not been studied prospectively, but sudden deterioration can occur.

95th centile (borderline), absent end diastolic flow (EDF) (pre-critical), reversed EDF (critical). Ductus venosus Doppler changes are defined as: raised PIV above the 95th centile (borderline), absent ‘a’ wave to baseline (pre-critical), or reversed ‘a’ wave (critical). Repeat ultrasound and monitoring is recommended based on severity of FGR. Birth should be planned based on specific Doppler changes and abnormalities. In late FGR, birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessments or maternal indication. Cerebral Doppler abnormalities can inform monitoring strategy but should not solely determine birth decisions. Antenatal corticosteroids, intrauterine transfer, magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection, and mode of birth recommendations are provided for optimal care.

Histopathological examination of the placenta may be useful where FGR is diagnosed prenatally or at birth to understand the underlying causes and guide management in a subsequent pregnancy. Women who have given birth to a growth-restricted infant should be offered an appointment for postnatal counseling, review of placental histology, and consideration of investigations of underlying causes as appropriate. It is important to confirm pathology and optimize future pregnancy management and modify the woman's health to improve future pregnancy outcomes. A plan for future pregnancies and preventative strategies should be recorded in the notes and discussed with the woman. Modifiable risk factors should be addressed, such as lifestyle factors and medical conditions optimized. Plans for prevention and monitoring in future pregnancies should be discussed. The postnatal period offers an opportunity to address modifiable risk factors, with reducing exposure to second-hand smoke being crucial. Investigations should be offered following the birth of a baby with FGR to determine the underlying cause and discuss risk of recurrence and possible interventions at a prepregnancy appointment. It is important to address lifestyle factors and medical conditions and discuss plans for prevention and monitoring in future pregnancies.

Analysis of pregnancy outcomes after previous adverse events such as stillbirth, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction. Various factors, including maternal conditions like preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriage, can impact subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, issues like maternal anemia, advanced maternal age, and maternal obesity can also affect pregnancy outcomes. It is essential to consider these factors to provide appropriate care and support during pregnancy.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on various interventions for improving maternal and infant health outcomes during pregnancy have been conducted. These include studies on vitamin D supplementation, psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation, antiplatelet therapy for preventing preeclampsia, and the use of aspirin in pregnancy. Other interventions studied include LMWH for preventing preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, progesterone for preventing pre-eclampsia, and hydroxychloroquine for lupus pregnancy. Additionally, antihypertensive drug therapy and beta-blockers in pregnancy have been evaluated. Screening methods for detecting abnormal fetal growth, such as symphysis-fundal height measurement, have also been studied in the context of antenatal care.

Clinical guidelines recommend routine third-trimester ultrasound for fetal growth to predict adverse outcomes. Studies have shown that routine ultrasound in late pregnancy can detect small-for-gestational-age fetuses and improve perinatal outcomes. It is important to use standardized fetal ultrasound biometry measurements to ensure accuracy in estimating fetal weight and predicting neonatal morbidity and mortality. Customized growth charts may be more effective than population-based charts in identifying neonates at risk of adverse outcomes.

Good Practice Points
Clinical guidelines are ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised methodology. These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
