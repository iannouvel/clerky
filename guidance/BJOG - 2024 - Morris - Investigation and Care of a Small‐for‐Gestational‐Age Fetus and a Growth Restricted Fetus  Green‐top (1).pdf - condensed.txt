The guideline provides advice on the investigation and care of the small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetus and growth restricted fetus. Key recommendations include:

- All women should be assessed at booking (by 14 weeks) for risk factors for fetal growth restriction (FGR) to identify those requiring increased surveillance [Grade GPP].
- Reduce smoking in pregnancy by identifying women who smoke with carbon monoxide (CO) testing and offering in-house treatment [Grade GPP].
- Women at risk of pre-eclampsia and/or placental dysfunction should take aspirin 150 mg once daily at night from 12+0–36+0 weeks of pregnancy [Grade A].
- Uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out between 18+0 and 23+6 weeks for women at high risk of fetal growth disorders [Grade B].
- Women at low risk of FGR should have serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) at each antenatal appointment after 24+0 weeks of pregnancy [Grade C].
- Women in the moderate risk category require serial ultrasound scan assessment of fetal growth commencing at 32+0 weeks [Grade B].
- Maternity providers should clearly identify the reference charts to plot SFH, individual biometry and estimated fetal weight (EFW) measurements [Grade GPP].
- Ultrasound biometry should be carried out every 2 weeks in fetuses identified to be SGA [Grade C].
- In pregnancies with early FGR (prior to 32+0 weeks), care should be multidisciplinary by neonatology and obstetricians with fetal medicine expertise [Grade GPP].
- In pregnancies with late FGR, birth should be initiated from 37+0 weeks to be completed by 37+6 weeks [Grade A]. 

This guideline is for healthcare professionals who care for women, non-binary and trans people with a SGA fetus or with fetal growth restriction (FGR). It does not address multiple pregnancies or pregnancies with fetal anomalies.

Fetal growth is assessed using individual measurements (head circumference [HC], abdominal circumference [AC], and femur length [FL]) or estimated fetal weight (EFW). Fetal growth is a dynamic process requiring multiple assessments. Growth charts are used to interpret these measurements. An appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetus is within the 10th and 90th centiles. A fetus is considered small for gestational age (SGA) when measurements fall below set parameters. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) implies a pathological restriction of genetic growth potential. FGR can be subdivided into early and late depending on gestational age. 

FGR in a previous pregnancy is defined as birthweight below 3rd centile, early onset pre-eclampsia or FGR necessitating birth before 34+0 weeks, or birthweight below 10th centile with evidence of placental dysfunction. FGR in a current pregnancy is defined as EFW or AC below the 3rd centile or EFW or AC below the 10th centile with evidence of placental dysfunction. 

Suboptimal fetal growth may be indicative of FGR and can be diagnosed when a previously well-grown fetus fails to maintain adequate fetal growth. Low birthweight (LBW) refers to an infant with a birthweight less than 2500 g. 

Small fetuses are divided into normal (constitutionally small), non-placenta mediated growth restriction, and placenta mediated growth restriction. Maternal factors and medical conditions can affect placental transfer of nutrients and implantation. The underlying aetiology and timing of onset is important when considering the risk of adverse outcome in pregnancy. Early onset FGR is associated with significant and abnormal placentation that results in increased hypoxia and cardiovascular adaptions. Late onset FGR is more common, and it is more difficult to identify fetuses that may be at risk.

Detection of fetal growth disorders typically relies on ultrasound measurement of fetal AC or estimation of fetal weight. Care is directed at timely birth, with several surveillance tests available, including cardiotocography, Doppler and ultrasound. There is controversy regarding which test or combination of tests should be used to time birth in late onset FGR and SGA. The NHS England SBLCB focused on detection and management of SGA and recommended birth at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks for SGA. It demonstrated a difference in antenatal detection of SGA babies and an increase in ultrasound and inductions of labour at early term. This guideline focuses on detecting FGR and targeting intervention for those at increased risk of perinatal death. 

Risk assessment is a fundamental part of care in the maternity pathway and should be a dynamic process with continual assessment throughout the pregnancy. All pregnant women should have a risk assessment for FGR carried out by 14 weeks of gestation using an agreed pathway. Many analyses of risk factors for fetal growth disorders identify newborns with a birthweight less than the 10th centile as a proxy for FGR, which makes evidence assimilation difficult. Tools used to assess risk should provide a structured, consistent approach that can adapt throughout the pregnancy and support the pregnant woman and her clinician in making decisions about her care. 

Risk factors for FGR and relevant evidence are discussed in this guideline. It is recognised that maternity providers may wish to use technology platforms and validated prediction models for pre-eclampsia and placental dysfunction prediction. Providers must ensure that risk assessment for other FGR risks not related to pre-eclampsia can be facilitated. Women must also be assessed at booking for conditions where SFH measurements are not appropriate. All women should be assessed at booking (by 14 weeks) for risk factors for FGR to identify those who require increased surveillance using an agreed pathway.

The clinical guideline suggests that the birthweight, gestation, and birthweight centiles of all previous pregnancies should be recorded at the booking appointment for accurate risk assessment. The proposed plan of assessment should be altered based on the specific combination of risk factors. 

For women who had evidence of placental dysfunction in a previous pregnancy, there is a risk of recurrence and subsequent FGR affected pregnancy. A careful risk assessment must be carried out to identify women who need increased surveillance for early onset FGR. 

Previous stillbirth is associated with an increased risk of SGA in a subsequent pregnancy, particularly when there was evidence of FGR in association with the stillbirth. 

Women with a previous preterm birth have an increased risk of SGA/FGR, especially after extreme preterm birth. 

The evidence regarding recurrent miscarriage is conflicting and further research is needed. 

Women who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a placenta-mediated complication are at greater risk of recurrence of these complications in subsequent pregnancies. 

Maternal medical conditions associated with an increased risk of a fetal growth disorder include diabetes with vascular disease, moderate and severe renal impairment, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 

Maternal congenital heart disease has a varying association with SGA. Women with complex CHD and/or ventricular dysfunction should be offered fetal monitoring by ultrasound. 

Medication use should also be considered when assessing the need for growth scans. The associations with asthma, anaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and depression are less strong.

Advanced maternal age of 40 years or more, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, bariatric surgery, and certain ethnicities are associated with increased risk of SGA and FGR. Women with a low BMI at booking, those with eating disorders, or medical disorders affecting nutrition should be considered at increased risk and serial USS undertaken. Women who have undergone gastric bypass surgery should be considered at moderate risk of fetal growth disorders regardless of their BMI. Maternity services and healthcare providers should provide a risk assessment at booking for fetal growth disorders. Nulliparity, social deprivation, unmarried status, maternal SGA, a short or long inter-pregnancy interval have minor associations with SGA. Moderate to vigorous physical activity and congenital uterine anomalies do not show a significant association with the risk of SGA. Maternal exposures such as alcohol consumption and drug misuse are associated with fetal growth disorders. Smoking increases the risk of SGA and the effects are dose dependent and greater in older women.

Women who stop smoking by 15 weeks of gestation can reduce their risk of small for gestational age (SGA). The impact of secondhand smoke on SGA rates is less clear. The relationship between e-cigarettes and fetal growth disorders is complex. In women who used e-cigarettes prior to pregnancy and stop during pregnancy, the risk of SGA returns towards background risk. However, continued use of e-cigarettes in pregnancy is associated with increased SGA risk. Women who switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes may lower their risk of fetal growth disorders. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) carries less risk than smoking, but there is not enough evidence to say there are no harmful effects from NRT for the fetus. E-cigarettes were more effective than NRT for smoking cessation in one study. Women who use e-cigarettes or NRT and have a carbon monoxide test > 4 ppm should be offered a scan assessment. More research is needed on the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and NRT. Maternal caffeine consumption of 300 mg/day or more in the third trimester is associated with SGA. IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are associated with SGA. Changing paternity has been associated with increased risk of an SGA infant. When low pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels or raised alpha fetoprotein levels are detected, it is recommended women should be offered additional ultrasound surveillance for SGA.

Low PAPP-A, raised AFP and/or inhibin A should initiate uterine artery Doppler screening and serial growth scans. However, their use in isolation as primary detection tools for fetal growth restriction (FGR) is not recommended due to low sensitivity. A study assessed the predictive performance of a model using maternal characteristics and PAPP-A measurements, suggesting a personalised approach. Low dose aspirin is recommended for women with an isolated low PAPP-A or raised beta-hCG. Midtrimester anomaly scan findings should be incorporated into the fetal growth risk assessment. Uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out for women at high risk of FGR. Fetal echogenic bowel, single umbilical artery, and fetal biometry if EFW < 10th centile should be identified on midtrimester anomaly scan to assess the risk of early onset FGR. Women should be reassessed for their risk of a fetal growth disorder throughout pregnancy and after any antenatal admission. Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy need to be assessed to determine if growth scans and pathways need to be applied. Women seriously or critically unwell from COVID-19 should be offered an ultrasound scan to assess the fetal biometry.

First trimester bleeding is associated with threatened miscarriage and growth restriction. Bleeding in the second half of pregnancy and its association with fetal growth disorders is less clear. Current RCOG guidance recommends serial scans for fetal growth after antepartum haemorrhage (APH). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase the risk of an SGA newborn. NICE guideline [NG133] recommends ultrasound assessment for fetal growth in women with chronic hypertension, severe gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. Maternal COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of FGR. RCOG COVID-19 guidance recommends ultrasound scan to assess fetal biometry for women who have been seriously or critically unwell from COVID-19. 

Prediction models should not be the only method for determining ultrasound surveillance. Multiparameter competing risk models for pre-eclampsia can help reduce the risk of preterm SGA. 

Smoking increases the risk of SGA, thus smoking cessation should be encouraged. All women should take the recommended 10 micrograms/day of vitamin D (throughout pregnancy) and 400 micrograms/day of folic acid (preconception and for the first 3 months of pregnancy). Balanced energy/protein supplementation can reduce the risk of SGA.

The evidence was of low quality, therefore high protein supplementation is not recommended. A Spanish RCT investigated interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction in high-risk pregnancies. However, there were significant limitations and confounders within this study and so neither intervention should be recommended routinely. 

Supplementation with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has not been shown to reduce SGA or intrauterine growth restriction. Multiple micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy has been addressed in a Cochrane review and appeared to reduce the risk of SGA. However, all but one of these studies was conducted in low or middle income countries and the only UK study failed to demonstrate any significant effect. 

High dose folic acid supplementation has been previously suggested to reduce the risk of SGA, but the FACT study did not demonstrate any reduction in SGA or FGR rates over the standard preconceptual dose. Calcium supplementation has been suggested to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia although a Cochrane review reported a modest 8% reduction at best and a high quality RCT did not demonstrate an effect. Magnesium supplementation to reduce the incidence of SGA has been extensively investigated, but a Cochrane review concluded there was no effect.

The benefit of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, SGA or FGR in pregnancy remains uncertain. Several systematic reviews have not found evidence of a reduced pre-eclampsia or stillbirth risk, but have found some evidence of a reduced risk of LBW and/or SGA. Another systematic review suggested that vitamin D supplementation may be useful in preventing pre-eclampsia. At present therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend high dose supplementation for pregnant women at risk of FGR and women should continue to take the 10 microgram/day recommended for all UK pregnant women.

Smoking increases the risk of SGA and women who can stop smoking can reduce their risk of SGA. If able to quit by 15 weeks of gestation, they can return to the pregnancy risk status of similar non-smoking women of preterm and term SGA. The NICE guideline has detailed recommendations for treating tobacco dependence in pregnant women including behavioural support and nicotine replacement therapy. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of e-cigarettes to help stop smoking in pregnancy or whether they have potential harm for the fetus or child after birth.

Women at risk of fetal growth disorders should take folic acid and vitamin D doses above the recommended dose as it does not appear to provide any additional benefit to women at risk of FGR. Women at risk of pre-eclampsia and/or placental dysfunction should take aspirin 150 mg once daily at night from 12+0–36+6 weeks of pregnancy to reduce their chance of SGA and FGR. LMWH should not be prescribed to reduce the risk of SGA or FGR in at-risk women.

A Cochrane review did not find evidence of improved outcomes or enhanced fetal growth with maternal micronutrients. Antiplatelet agents have been extensively investigated in women at varying levels of risk for pre-eclampsia, with SGA and/or FGR as outcomes. These studies have suggested a reduction in SGA and FGR birth with the use of aspirin in women at risk of pre-eclampsia, driven by a reduction in the incidence of pre-eclampsia in treated women. Prevention of pre-eclampsia with aspirin is most effective when aspirin is initiated between 11+0 weeks and 16+6 weeks of gestation. A meta-analysis demonstrated administration before 16 weeks was associated with a reduction in SGA, where after 16 weeks there was no significant effect. Meta-analysis supported the concept of a dose–response relationship for SGA prevention favouring a dose of 100–150 mg/day. There is good evidence of aspirin safety and efficacy at 150 mg.

Doses below 100 mg of aspirin should only be considered in the presence of other relative contraindications. Two RCTs have demonstrated that administration of aspirin in the evening or night is more effective at lowering ambulatory blood pressure and reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia, than in the morning or day. NICE guideline Hypertension in Pregnancy [NG133] recommends that aspirin is continued until birth for prevention of hypertensive disorders, while other international guidelines recommend stopping at 36 weeks. Aspirin may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage and thus the suggestion that aspirin should be stopped at 36 weeks. However, it is not clear whether stopping aspirin earlier at 36 weeks reduces the risk of bleeding. In the context of this guideline, aspirin should be ideally commenced at 12–16 weeks and continued until at least 36 weeks.

Antithrombotic therapy using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been trialled repeatedly in women at risk of FGR, usually in association with pre-eclampsia, with or without coexistent thrombophilias. However, evidence does not support the use of LMWH as an effective treatment to prevent SGA or FGR, even in the presence of heritable thrombophilia.

Secondary outcome analyses of studies on progesterone to prevent PTB have shown no effect on the risk of pre-eclampsia or FGR. Studies examining the effects of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of FGR are small and of low quality and failed to show significant benefit. Hydroxychloroquine is not recommended outside a research setting.

Antihypertensive drug therapy for hypertension in pregnancy does not seem to increase the risk of having an SGA newborn. The evidence regarding the association of SGA and beta-blockers in women who are hypertensive is inconclusive.

Women who are assessed as being at a low risk for FGR should have serial assessment of fetal growth using antenatal SFH measurements performed by healthcare professionals trained in their use and plotted on appropriate charts. All staff performing these measurements should be competent in measuring, plotting, interpreting appropriately and referring when indicated, and measurements should be performed as per NICE guidelines.

Maternal obesity, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios, and the extent of fetal head engagement contribute to the limited predictive accuracy of symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific chart for recording SFH. Studies have shown abdominal palpation to be of limited accuracy in detecting small for gestational age (SGA) newborns. SFH measurement appears superior to palpation in detecting fetuses at risk, although both methods have significant limitations. 

SFH measurements should start between 26+0–28+6 weeks to coincide with the routine 28-week appointment. Maternal BMI greater than 35 kg/m2, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios, and fetal head engagement can limit the predictive accuracy of SFH measurements. SFH should be measured from the fundus to the symphysis pubis with the measurement hidden from the examiner. Women with a single SFH below the 10th centile should be referred for further investigation with ultrasound assessment. 

Standard, population, and customised charts to plot SFH are available, but no trials have compared different types of SFH charts. Providers should determine which charts they are going to use antenatally to record SFH and staff should be trained in their use. 

Routine measurement of fetal abdominal circumference or estimated fetal weight in the third trimester does not reduce the incidence of an SGA newborn nor does it improve perinatal outcome. Universal late pregnancy ultrasonography in low risk or unselected women demonstrated no beneficial effect and should not be offered routinely in the third trimester.

A systematic review concluded that for a fixed 10% false positive rate, sensitivity was higher for abdominal circumference (AC) than estimated fetal weight (EFW) and better performance when the scan was carried out near term and to detect fetal growth restriction (FGR) rather than small for gestational age (SGA). The NICE committee noted that the evidence in their review was overall moderate to low quality. They also noted a lack of evidence for the impact on maternal anxiety. 

There is a potential to cause harm for women who are screen false positive on ultrasound and then have an unwarranted intervention such as induction of labour (IOL), causing iatrogenic prematurity. A health technology assessment concluded that the primary literature on the diagnostic effectiveness of ultrasound in late pregnancy is weak and does not support universal ultrasonic screening for fetal growth disorders.

The recommendation for moderate risk women is that they require serial assessment of fetal growth commencing at 32 weeks, with a scan interval of 4 weeks. If two EFW measurements are to be used to estimate velocity, they should ideally be a minimum of 3–4 weeks apart to minimise false positive rates for diagnosing FGR. Assessment of the fetal AC may help in determining the fetus that is FGR. When assessing fetal size, the Hadlock formula should be used with head circumference (HC), AC and femur length (FL). Changing EFW formula during growth monitoring can lead to an artefactual change in growth trajectory and should be avoided. 

When determining which charts are to be used to plot EFW, fetal growth charts must be based on sonographic EFW not newborn birthweight standards. Maternity providers should ensure that they monitor the number of fetuses considered < 3rd centile to ensure that their growth pathway and growth chart is appropriate. 

Serial scanning is recommended for women at increased risk of fetal growth disorders. Women at moderate risk of FGR do not require uterine artery Doppler assessment as they do not have risk factors for early onset FGR but are still at risk of later onset FGR so require serial ultrasound assessment of fetal growth from 32 weeks. The interval between scans should be no more frequent than every 14 days, with optimum assessment for growth velocity being 21–28 days.

False positive rates for diagnosing Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) were higher when the first scan was carried out at 36 weeks of gestation. If two measurements are used to estimate velocity, they should be a minimum of 3 weeks apart to minimise false positive rates. An interval of 4 weeks is appropriate for many pregnancies and reducing the scan interval has not shown to improve pregnancy outcome. 

Three systematic reviews have assessed the accuracy of ultrasound biometric measures. AC is comparable to EFW in predicting SGA. The addition of AC growth velocity was the only biometric measure that identified babies at increased risk of neonatal morbidity. 

The Hadlock equation incorporating HC, FL and AC is recommended for the estimation of fetal weight. The addition of BPD to the Hadlock equation was not shown to increase accuracy and there is considerable variation in BPD ranges across different populations. 

Those performing Ultrasound Scans (USS) for biometry should be aware of the need for appropriate training in fetal biometry assessment, time for the examination, quality assurance and audit. All measurements should be taken following the same methodology as that used in the studies which produced the reference curves being used. 

Maternity providers should ensure that they have guidance that promotes the use of standard planes of acquisition and calliper placement as this has been shown to improve reproducibility of measurements. Quality control of images and measurements should form part of the assessment. 

Imprecision of EFW is recognised when interpreting results. Imprecision can be caused by the accuracy of the equation used to calculate EFW, most fall within +/-10% with the error greater at extremes of fetal weight and gestation. There is also a significant association between the quality of the biometric ultrasound images and EFW accuracy. 

Fetal growth charts are integral to the assessment of fetal size, determined by EFW. There are several types of charts available with reference ranges being either descriptive or prescriptive. Prescriptive charts assume that under optimal conditions all fetuses will have the same growth potential and the only difference observed in growth across populations will be due to environmental factors. Customised charts have been proposed as an alternative to universal charts and are based on the premise that fetal growth varies across countries and ethnicities and that adjustment should occur at a population level for these factors. 

Individual trajectories for the fetus can be developed. A number of studies have investigated the association of individual customised charts with adverse outcome and different charts and rates of SGA and FGR in populations. Several studies have found that customised charts perform better at predicting stillbirth and adverse neonatal outcomes. Other studies have demonstrated no benefit.

The DESiGN trial assessed the effectiveness of the GAP programme for antenatal detection of SGA. The trial didn't find any significant effect of GAP, but there were concerns about the trial's methodology and execution. The trial found a reduction in stillbirth and neonatal mortality, but these were secondary outcomes and it's difficult to attribute this to any single intervention. 

The WHO recommends understanding local population characteristics, as there is variation in fetal growth even under optimal conditions. The INTERGROWTH-21st chart identified only 4.4% of babies as SGA and 20.6% as large for gestational age, suggesting that universal charts should not be used without considering local population variation. Maternity providers need to understand and monitor their local data for metrics such as the number of fetuses considered <3rd centile. 

Maternity providers should ensure they have clear guidance and processes for fetal biometry measurements, assessing fetal size and calculating EFW, quality control of images and measurements, identifying the reference charts to be used, and monitoring the number of fetuses considered <3rd centile. 

There is some evidence that EFW can be improved by 3D ultrasound volumetry and that EFW using MRI may be more accurate than ultrasound in predicting SGA and LGA newborns. 

In high-risk populations, uterine artery Doppler should be carried out at the time of the routine anomaly scan to determine when ultrasound surveillance of fetal growth should commence. Repeating uterine artery Doppler is of limited value in this situation. FGR is often characterised by lack of adequate trophoblast invasion of the myometrial uterine spiral arteries and reduced uteroplacental blood flow.

Pler has limited predictive ability as a test in either the first or second trimester. Using uterine artery Doppler with maternal factors and fetal biometry at a midtrimester scan can detect 89% of very preterm SGA below the 5th centile. It can be used in the second trimester to determine the risk of placental dysfunction and hypertensive disorders or early onset FGR in high-risk women. Abnormal uterine artery Doppler may normalize later in the second trimester, but there is still an increased risk in women who normalize. The mean uterine artery PI is recommended as the index of measurement. Third trimester uterine artery Doppler is not an effective risk assessment tool in unselected pregnancies, but can help identify FGR due to placental dysfunction. For high-risk women with a normal uterine artery Doppler, serial scans should start at 32 weeks. For women with an abnormal uterine artery Doppler, scans can commence at 24+0–28+6 weeks.

Fetal size alone is not enough to identify FGR, unless AC or EFW is below the 3rd centile. Fetal growth disorders are suspected when there is suboptimal, reduced growth velocity and static growth. Doppler velocimetry of uteroplacental circulation can help distinguish between SGA and FGR in the third trimester. When a fetal growth disorder is diagnosed, an assessment of fetal wellbeing should be made. The optimal approach to interpret the information from serial measurements of the same fetus remains unclear due to non-linear growth across pregnancy. When assessing fetal growth, a pattern of slowing growth velocity indicates an increased risk of morbidity and stillbirth.

This review should include assessment of all fetal biometry measurements since the anomaly scan to identify potentially erroneous single measurements and also the presence or absence of other risk factors for FGR. Particular attention should be paid to a downward trend in AC growth velocity. When a fetal growth disorder is suspected or diagnosed an assessment of fetal wellbeing should be made to include a discussion regarding fetal movements and a cCTG where there are concerns. A maternal assessment should be made to include a blood pressure and proteinuria assessment. For fetal growth disorders diagnosed in the third trimester, uterine artery Dopplers can be used to assess for placental dysfunction and are moderately useful in predicting adverse outcome in pregnancies with suspected SGA in the third trimester but not as a standalone test. 

Clinical tests that measure placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (s- flt1) or the ratio between the two are now clinically available and recommended for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Although SGA/FGR are strongly associated with pre-eclampsia and placental dysfunction, the use of PlGF/s- flt1 testing for the prediction and diagnosis in non-hypertensive women is not routinely recommended. 

FGR that results from placental dysfunction is known to be associated with placentas that have smaller diameters and increased depth, lower volumes and irregular shapes. However, concerns have been raised around the reliability and reproducibility of 2D ultrasound techniques, and it remains unclear what role the measurement of 2D placental biometry should have in current clinical models used to predict FGR. 

Biomarkers including human placental lactogen (hPL), oestriol, Placental growth factor (PIGF), urinary oestriol and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (s- flt1) have been proposed as adjuncts to serial ultrasound measurements to identify women at high risk of SGA and stillbirth. However, biomarkers show promise in the ability to improve diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasound for SGA and stillbirth.

Assessment by maternal risk factors and biophysical markers needs confirmation with prospective RCTs and cost-effectiveness evaluations. Pregnancies complicated by fetal growth disorders should be further investigated. Offer referral to fetal medicine if EFW is below the 3rd centile or below the 10th centile with abnormal uterine artery Doppler at the midtrimester anomaly scan. Invasive diagnostic testing should be offered in severely SGA fetuses with structural anomalies and considered in non-anomalous fetuses detected before 23 weeks of gestation, especially if uterine artery Doppler is normal. Serological screening for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasmosis infection should be offered in severe SGA. Testing for malaria and Zika should be considered in high-risk populations. In fetuses undergoing invasive testing for FGR with no other structural anomalies there was a 4% incremental yield of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) over karyotyping and a 10% incremental yield in FGR with associated fetal malformations. Prenatal exome sequencing has limited incremental yield over standard karyotyping and microarray in fetuses with isolated FGR. LMWH should not be prescribed to women in whom fetal growth disorders have been diagnosed. Women should not be prescribed phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors to treat FGR outside of RCTs. There are no proven interventions in SGA and FGR other than birth of the baby. Experimental treatments under investigation include maternal VEGF gene therapy, melatonin and for pre-eclampsia with the potential to impact on fetal growth; statins, nitric oxide donors, proton pump inhibitors and N-acetylcysteine.

A small RCT of sildenafil in women with early onset pre-eclampsia reported a prolongation of pregnancy by 4 days, but there was no effect on birthweight. However, RCTs focusing on FGR have failed to show any benefit. The STRIDER study did not show any prolongation in pregnancy or improvement in outcome from sildenafil treatment. Tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, has also been tested with reported improved neonatal outcome and no adverse effects, but no RCT evidence is currently available. LMWH is not an effective treatment to prevent SGA or FGR, and should only be used in women at risk of thromboembolic disease.

For SGA fetuses, ultrasound biometry should be carried out every 2 weeks. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool and should be undertaken at the point of diagnosis of SGA and during follow-up. In fetuses with an EFW between the 3rd and 10th centile, other features must be present for birth to be recommended prior to 39 weeks. For fetuses with an EFW or AC less than the 10th centile where FGR has been excluded, birth or the initiation of IOL should be considered at 39+0 weeks. After 37+0 weeks, an abnormal middle cerebral artery (MCA), cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) or umbilico-cerebral ratio (UCR) can be used to guide timing of birth. IOL is not contraindicated in the SGA fetus. 

SGA fetuses are those whose AC or EFW is below the 10th centile but with normal growth velocity and do not exhibit Doppler changes, where there are normal fetal movements and normal amniotic fluid. For these pregnancies, ultrasound surveillance every 2 weeks is appropriate. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool. Its use in high risk pregnancy has been shown to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, reduce antenatal admissions and inductions of labour. Amniotic fluid can be assessed by the single deepest vertical pocket (SDVP) or amniotic fluid index (AFI) methods, but both correlate poorly with actual amniotic fluid volume.

For Small for Gestational Age (SGA) fetuses, the Disproportionate Growth Intervention Trial at Term Study (DIGITAT) and data on morbidity related to early term birth (37-38 weeks) inform birth recommendations. DIGITAT found no difference in severe neonatal morbidity or caesarean birth between induction or expectant management, but there was an increase in neonatal unit admission with induction before 38 weeks. A Cochrane review found no difference in perinatal or long-term outcome with early birth versus expectant management. Induction of labor (IOL) between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks should only be considered for fetuses at significantly increased risk of perinatal mortality. For all fetuses with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference (AC) less than the 10th centile where fetal growth restriction (FGR) has been excluded, birth or the initiation of IOL should be considered at 39+0 weeks. Birth should occur by 39+6 weeks. 

FGR fetuses, defined as those with an AC or EFW below the 10th centile with Doppler changes or AC/EFW less than the 3rd centile, or growth crossing 50 centiles, are a higher risk category. For these fetuses, it's important to differentiate between early and late FGR with respect to surveillance for fetal wellbeing. Maternity providers should ensure consistency of Doppler charts used across different departments. Early FGR pregnancies should be monitored and managed with input from tertiary level units with the highest level neonatal care. Biometry in FGR should be repeated every 2 weeks. The frequency of assessment of fetal wellbeing will be based on the severity of FGR and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler assessment.

Fetal Doppler assessment using the Dawes-Redman CTG system is recommended, with short-term variation (STV) being a key parameter. High variability in Doppler reference ranges and indices has a major clinical impact on prenatal diagnosis, monitoring, decision making around timing of birth and reproducibility. The most significant changes prior to birth were raised ductus venosus pulsatility index for veins (PIV) and low cCTG STV. MCA CPR/UCR can inform monitoring strategy and frequency but should not be used to determine birth decisions prior to 37+0 weeks. 

Birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessment or maternal indication. From 26+0 weeks, birth if any of the following is present: Spontaneous repeated persistent unprovoked fetal heart rate decelerations; 26+0 to 28+6 weeks: birth if ductus venosus a- wave is at or below baseline or STV is below 2.6 ms; 29+0 to 31+6 weeks: birth if ductus venosus a- wave is at or below baseline or STV is below 3.0 ms; 32+0 to 33+6 weeks: birth if UA- EDF is reversed or STV is below 3.5 ms; From 34+0 weeks: birth if UA- EDF is absent or STV is below 4.5 ms.

In early FGR, reduced fetal movements or reduced or absent movements on ultrasound should prompt an assessment with cCTG. Assessment of fetal heart rate variability is an important parameter in assessment of fetal wellbeing. The optimum management of early FGR has largely been defined by the TRUFFLE study. The frequency of monitoring in early FGR has not been subjected to any prospective randomised studies. Umbilical artery Doppler changes are defined as: PI above the.

Ductus venosus Doppler changes are defined as: raised PIV above the 95th centile (borderline), absent ‘a’ wave to baseline (pre-critical), or reversed ‘a’ wave (critical). Depending on the severity of FGR, repeat USS (umbilical and ductus venosus Doppler) and CTG monitoring is undertaken every week to alternate daily. Birth should be planned when the Ductus venosus ‘a’ wave is at (absent) or below baseline (reversed) or there are CTG abnormalities. In late and term FGR, assessing the ductus venosus waveform is unlikely to be informative as it is very unlikely to show severe abnormalities. In pregnancies with late FGR, birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessments or maternal indication. In pregnancies with FGR, birth should be initiated from 37+0 weeks to be completed by 37+6 weeks. Cerebral Doppler: abnormal MCA CPR/UCR can inform monitoring strategy and frequency but should not be used to determine birth decisions prior to 37 weeks. In late FGR a woman's subjective assessment of reduced fetal movements or absent movements on ultrasound should prompt an assessment with cCTG. The birth of a preterm, or early term newborn, based on concerns regarding fetal growth should be optimised. Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered.

Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks of gestation at high risk of preterm birth (PTB). The optimal timing of steroids is key to their effectiveness, reducing perinatal and neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome. Women undergoing a PTB should be offered transfer to a unit with appropriate neonatal cot facilities when safe to do so. Babies less than 27 weeks or with estimated fetal weight below 800 g should be born in a unit with a neonatal intensive care unit. Magnesium sulphate should be offered for neuroprotection between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks and considered up to 33+6 weeks. In the fetal growth restriction (FGR) fetus with abnormal parameters, caesarean birth is recommended after administration of steroids and magnesium sulphate. In the small for gestational age (SGA) fetus or late FGR fetus with normal umbilical artery Doppler, induction of labor can be offered but rates of unplanned caesarean birth are increased. Mechanical methods should be considered for induction of labor. Early admission is recommended in women in spontaneous labor with a SGA/FGR fetus to instigate continuous fetal heart rate monitoring.

Histopathological examination of the placenta is recommended when Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is diagnosed prenatally or at birth to understand the causes and guide management in future pregnancies. Postnatal counselling and a review of placental histology should be offered to women who have given birth to a growth-restricted infant. Testing for acquired thrombophilias can be considered. Future pregnancy plans and preventative strategies, such as smoking cessation and aspirin treatment, should be recorded and discussed with the woman. The birth of a baby with FGR is a major risk factor for FGR in a subsequent pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors, such as smoking and BMI, should be addressed, and plans for prevention and monitoring in future pregnancies should be discussed. Future research should focus on the interaction of multiple maternal risk factors, the use of biomarkers, the impact of different Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) reference charts, and interventions for FGR.

Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not gestational length. Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy may also increase the risk of fetal growth restriction. IVF/ICSI can impact obstetric and perinatal outcomes in singleton pregnancies. Paternal factors can influence low birthweight, preterm, and small for gestational age births. Paternal age is associated with perinatal outcomes. Change in paternity can affect select perinatal outcomes. Maternal serum PAPP-A levels, nuchal translucency and crown-rump length in first trimester are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. First-trimester placentation can predict the risk of antepartum stillbirth. Low maternal serum PAPP-A in first trimester is associated with small for gestational age and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Serum screening with Down's syndrome markers can predict pre-eclampsia and small for gestational age. Low first trimester maternal serum PAPP-A can be predictive in patients with low uterine artery Doppler at 18 and 22 weeks. Maternal serum Inhibin-A is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A placental profile can be useful in high-risk pregnancies. Low maternal serum PAPP-A in first trimester can be a screening method for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Obstetrical complications can be associated with abnormal maternal serum markers analytes. Serum screening in first trimester can predict pre-eclampsia, small for gestational age and preterm delivery. Maternal characteristics, serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and placental growth factor at 11-13 weeks' gestation can predict small-for-gestational-age neonate.

The text discusses the use of uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography in predicting pregnancy outcomes. The studies cited indicate that Doppler indices can be used to predict conditions such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and small-for-gestational-age neonates. The text also suggests that knowledge of uterine artery resistance in the second trimester and targeted surveillance can improve maternal and perinatal outcomes. The studies also discuss the use of Doppler ultrasonography in high-risk pregnancies and its value in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes and selecting cases for more intense surveillance. Additionally, the text mentions that uterine artery pulsatility index at certain gestational weeks can predict adverse perinatal outcomes.

The clinical guideline references numerous studies on fetal growth and placental health. Key points include:

- Comparisons of fetal growth and Doppler ultrasound for predicting perinatal morbidity in small fetuses at term (Chang TC, et al. 1994).
- Standards for ultrasound fetal growth velocity (Owen P, et al. 1996).
- Normal fetal growth evaluated by longitudinal ultrasound examinations (Larsen T, et al. 1990).
- Calculation of unconditional and conditional reference intervals for fetal size and growth (Royston P, 1995).
- Fetal weight projection model validation against pregnancy outcome in a cohort of serially scanned pregnancies (Hugh O, Gardosi J, 2022).
- Second-trimester measurements of placental volume by three-dimensional ultrasound to predict small-for-gestational-age infants (Hafner E, et al. 1998).
- The association of placental volume measured by MRI and birth weight centile (Derwig IE, et al. 2011).
- Biochemical tests of placental function versus ultrasound assessment of fetal size for stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age infants (Heazell AE, et al. 2019).
- Placental growth factor testing to assess women with suspected pre-eclampsia (Duhig KE, et al. 2019).
- Predictive value of angiogenic factors and uterine artery Doppler for pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (Crispi F, et al. 2008).

The clinical guideline references several studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of different methods and markers in predicting small-for-gestational-age infants and adverse perinatal outcomes. These include placental growth factor, ultrasound parameters, maternal factors, fetal biometry, and various biomarkers. The guideline also discusses the association of chromosomal abnormalities with fetal growth retardation, and the use of genomic microarray in fetuses with early growth restriction. Further, the guideline discusses the outcomes of fetuses with short femur length detected at second-trimester anomaly scan. The guideline also mentions the association between congenital toxoplasmosis and preterm birth, low birthweight and small for gestational age birth, as well as the significance of maternal screening for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infection in cases of fetal growth restriction. Lastly, the guideline discusses the impact of malaria during pregnancy on the newborn, and the pattern of abnormal fetal growth after maternal Zika virus infection.

The clinical guideline references several studies on the prevention and treatment of fetal growth restriction. These include the role of aspirin, heparin, sildenafil, tadalafil, and other interventions. It also discusses the use of fetal surveillance for small-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal results of umbilical artery doppler velocimetry. The guideline further explores the use of amniotic fluid measurements for predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes and compares induction versus expectant monitoring for intrauterine growth restriction at term.

The DIGITAT trial studied long-term outcomes in infants, comparing induction of labour and expectant management for intrauterine growth restriction at term. Other studies have looked at planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby, and the management of intrauterine growth restriction at term. A pilot study on oligohydramnios in uncomplicated pregnancies beyond 40 completed weeks was conducted, as well as a study on labor induction versus expectant management in low-risk nulliparous women. Research has also looked at perinatal death in a term fetal growth restriction randomized controlled trial, management of late-onset fetal growth restriction, and the impact of small-for-gestational-age babies after 37 weeks. The TRUFFLE study examined 2 year neurodevelopmental and intermediate perinatal outcomes in infants with very preterm fetal growth restriction. Further studies have proposed a stage-based management protocol for the diagnosis and classification of fetal growth restriction, a uniform management approach to optimize outcome in fetal growth restriction, and reference ranges for Doppler indices of umbilical and fetal middle cerebral arteries. Other research has focused on the clinical impact of Doppler reference charts on management of small-for-gestational-age fetuses, monitoring of fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction, the relationship between monitoring parameters and perinatal outcome in severe, early intrauterine growth restriction, and the relation of fetal blood gases and data from computer-assisted analysis of fetal heart rate patterns in small for gestation fetuses. The TRUFFLE Group also looked at perinatal morbidity and mortality in early-onset fetal growth restriction, while the Growth Restriction Intervention Trial (GRIT) focused on infant wellbeing at 2 years of age. Further research has compared 2-year outcomes in GRIT and TRUFFLE trials, and the association of neonatal morbidity with long-term neurological outcome in infants who were growth restricted.

This text provides a list of references from various studies, trials, and guidelines related to fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal management. These include the TRUFFLE study, the Growth Restriction Intervention Trial (GRIT), studies on Doppler indices in small-for-gestational age fetuses, and guidelines from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The references discuss topics such as cerebral Doppler indices, adverse neonatal outcomes, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the use of antenatal corticosteroids to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.

The British Association of Perinatal Medicine's Antenatal Optimisation Toolkit and NICE's Inducing Labour Guideline are important resources. Studies have shown that very low birth weight and very preterm infants benefit from perinatal regionalization. The TRUFFLE study, a multicentre randomised study, and the GRIT Study Group's randomised trial of timed delivery for the compromised preterm fetus are significant. Research has also explored the acid-base characteristics of fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation during labor and delivery, the clinical significance of absent or reversed end diastolic velocity waveforms in the umbilical artery, and the detection of the small fetus in need of antepartum surveillance. Induction of labor in pregnancies complicated by late fetal growth restriction has been studied, comparing dinoprostone with cervical balloon and other methods. Adverse intrapartum outcomes in such pregnancies have also been examined. The Royal College of Pathologists has a tissue pathway for histopathological examination of the placenta, and the British Society for Haematology has a guideline for thrombophilia testing. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has published a guideline on the investigation and care of a small-for-gestational-age fetus and a growth restricted fetus.

The clinical guideline consists of studies rated from 1+ to 4 which are applicable to the target population and demonstrate overall consistency of results. The recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment but must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and local populations. Risk assessment for Fetal growth should always be individualised taking into account previous medical and obstetric history and current pregnancy history. For women with maternal medical conditions and individuals with disease progression, an individual's risk may increase and necessitate monitoring with serial scanning. Management of fetal growth restriction (FGR) should be considered after 30+0 weeks and after 32+0 weeks. The guideline will be considered for update 3 years after publication, with an intermediate assessment of the need to update 2 years after publication. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
