This guideline addresses the investigation and care of a Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) and Growth Restricted Fetus. Key recommendations include:

- All women should be assessed by 14 weeks for risk factors for fetal growth restriction (FGR) to identify those who require increased surveillance [Grade GPP].
- Reduce smoking in pregnancy with in-house treatment from a trained tobacco dependence advisor [Grade GPP].
- Women at risk of pre-eclampsia and/or placental dysfunction should take aspirin 150 mg once daily at night from 12+0–36+0 weeks of pregnancy [Grade A].
- Uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out between 18+0 and 23+6 weeks for women at high risk of fetal growth disorders [Grade B].
- Women at low risk of FGR should have serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) at each antenatal appointment after 24+0 weeks of pregnancy [Grade C].
- Women in the moderate risk category require serial ultrasound scan assessment of fetal growth commencing at 32+0 weeks [Grade B].
- Maternity providers should clearly identify the reference charts to plot SFH, individual biometry and estimated fetal weight (EFW) measurements [Grade GPP].
- Ultrasound biometry should be carried out every 2 weeks in fetuses identified to be SGA [Grade C].
- In pregnancies with early FGR, care should be multidisciplinary by neonatology and obstetricians with fetal medicine expertise [Grade GPP].
- In pregnancies with late FGR, birth should be initiated from 37+0 weeks [Grade A].

Fetal growth is a dynamic process requiring multiple assessments during pregnancy. Measurements of head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length, or estimated fetal weight are interpreted using a growth chart. An appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetus is within the 10th and 90th centiles. A fetus is considered small for gestational age (SGA) when measurements fall below set parameters, often defined as below the 10th centile. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) implies a pathological restriction of growth. Defining and diagnosing FGR is challenging, requiring assessment of growth potential and risks. FGR can be subdivided into early and late depending on gestational age. The Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle version 3 (SBLCBv3) provides practical definitions for FGR, highlighting that absence of certain features does not rule out FGR or fetal compromise. FGR in a previous pregnancy is defined by birthweight below the 3rd centile, early onset pre-eclampsia or FGR necessitating birth before 34+0 weeks, or birthweight below 10th centile with evidence of placental dysfunction. FGR in a current pregnancy is defined as either EFW or AC below the 3rd centile or below the 10th centile with evidence of placental dysfunction. Suboptimal fetal growth may also indicate FGR, defined by slowing growth velocity. Low birthweight refers to an infant with a birthweight less than 2500 g regardless of gestation. Small fetuses are divided into normal, non-placenta mediated growth restriction, and placenta mediated growth restriction. The underlying aetiology and timing of onset is important when considering risk of adverse outcome in pregnancy. Serial symphysis fundal height measurement is a method of surveillance for fetal size.

Detection of fetal growth disorders typically relies on ultrasound measurement of fetal AC or estimation of fetal weight. Care is directed at timely birth, with different tests available for surveillance, though there is controversy over which combination of tests should be used. The NHS England SBLCB initially focused on detection and management of SGA, recommending birth at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks. However, this led to increased interventions in women only marginally at increased risk of FGR-related stillbirth, with risks to the babies of early term induction. This was addressed in later versions of the bundle, with different management strategies for SGA and FGR to reduce unnecessary intervention. The latest versions focus on detecting FGR and targeting intervention for those at increased risk of perinatal death.

The guideline was developed using standard methodology, with recommendations based on available evidence where possible. Risk assessment is a fundamental part of care, and should be a dynamic process throughout the pregnancy. All pregnant women should have a risk assessment for FGR by 14 weeks of gestation. The likelihood of a FGR or FGR-related stillbirth is influenced by many factors. Risk assessment in FGR is challenged by many analyses identifying newborns with a birthweight less than the 10th centile as a proxy for FGR, which may underestimate the risk of adverse outcomes. 

Several risk assessment models have been used for SGA prediction. Tools used to assess risk should provide a structured, consistent approach that can adapt throughout the pregnancy and support decision making. Future research should focus on development of prediction models specifically for FGR and FGR with adverse outcome. Known risk factors for FGR and relevant evidence are discussed, along with a pathway for assessing risk and subsequent management. Women must also be assessed at booking for conditions where SFH measurements are not appropriate.

The birthweight, gestation and birthweight centiles of all previous pregnancies should be recorded at the booking appointment for accurate risk assessment. The plan of assessment should be altered based on the combination of risk factors to inform further targeted tests and/or serial ultrasonic surveillance.

Determining the recurrence risk of a fetal growth disorder is limited by the definitions used to identify FGR and SGA. Women who had evidence of placental dysfunction in a previous pregnancy have a risk of recurrence and subsequent FGR affected pregnancy. Therefore, a careful risk assessment must be carried out to identify women who need increased surveillance for early onset FGR. 

Previous stillbirth is associated with an increased risk of SGA in a subsequent pregnancy, especially when there was evidence of FGR in association with the stillbirth. Additional screening should be carried out in cases of placental dysfunction, FGR or pre-eclampsia associated with a stillbirth.

Women with a previous preterm birth (PTB) have an increased risk of SGA/FGR; this effect is greater after extreme PTB. A detailed history is undertaken to determine whether placental dysfunction was implicated and thus whether ultrasound surveillance for FGR and aspirin is required.

Women who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a placenta-mediated complication are at greater risk of recurrence of these complications in subsequent pregnancies. NICE recommends aspirin 75–150 mg daily from 12+0 weeks until the birth of the baby, to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy related to placental dysfunction.

Maternal medical conditions associated with an increased risk of a fetal growth disorder include diabetes with vascular disease, moderate and severe renal impairment, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic hypertension and systemic lupus erythematosus. Women with complex congenital heart disease and/or ventricular dysfunction should be offered fetal monitoring by ultrasound. Medication use should also be considered when assessing the need for growth scans.

Advanced maternal age of 40 years or more is associated with increased risk of SGA and FGR. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI of 20–30 kg/m2 is associated with a lower risk of SGA. Women with excessive weight gain had a lower risk for SGA. Women with a BMI lower than 18.5 kg/m2 and low gestational weight gain had the highest risk for SGA birth. Bariatric surgery appears to increase the risk of SGA independent of BMI associated risks. Ethnicity, specifically Southeast Asian, African and Black African Caribbean, have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of SGA. Nulliparity, social deprivation, unmarried status, maternal SGA, a short or long inter-pregnancy interval have all been shown to have minor associations with SGA. Moderate to vigorous physical activity does not have an association with the risk of SGA. Congenital uterine anomalies are associated with an increased risk of FGR. Maternal alcohol consumption and drug misuse, specifically cocaine use, are associated with being born SGA. Smoking increases the risk of SGA and the effects of smoking are dose dependent and greater in older women.

Women who stop smoking can reduce their risk of having small for gestational age (SGA) infants. If they quit by 15 weeks of gestation, they can return to a similar risk status as non-smoking women. The impact of secondhand smoke on SGA rates is less known. 

The relationship between e-cigarette use and fetal growth disorders is complex. Women who used e-cigarettes before pregnancy and quit during pregnancy can reduce their risk of SGA. However, continued use of e-cigarettes during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of SGA. 

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is less harmful than smoking. However, there isn't enough evidence to say that NRT has no harmful effects on the fetus. E-cigarettes were found to be more effective than NRT for smoking cessation in one study. 

Women who use e-cigarettes or NRT and have a carbon monoxide test > 4 ppm should be offered a scan assessment on the moderate risk pathway. More evidence is required on the benefits and risks of e-cigarettes and NRT. 

Maternal caffeine consumption of 300 mg/day or more in the third trimester is associated with SGA. The recommended daily maximum caffeine intake during pregnancy is 200 mg/day. 

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are associated with SGA. However, other factors also affect the risk of fetal growth disorders. 

Paternity change has been associated with an increased risk of SGA and pre-eclampsia. More research is needed to understand this relationship. 

Low levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) or high levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) or inhibin A are risk factors for SGA and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Women with these markers should be offered additional ultrasound surveillance. Women with a low PAPP-A or high beta-hCG level should be offered aspirin.

Low PAPP- A, raised AFP and/or inhibin A should initiate uterine artery Doppler screening and serial growth scans. However, these biomarkers should not be used in isolation as primary detection tools for fetal growth restriction (FGR) due to their low sensitivity. A prospective study has assessed the predictive performance of a model using maternal characteristics and PAPP- A measurements, suggesting a personalised approach. As these biomarkers are associated with adverse outcomes related to placental disease, it is appropriate to offer women low dose aspirin.

Anomalous screening results can contribute to risk assessment for pregnancy and determine surveillance pathways for fetal growth. Midtrimester anomaly scan findings should be incorporated into the fetal growth risk assessment. Uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out between 18+0 and 23+6 weeks for women at high risk of fetal growth disorders. When certain conditions are identified on midtrimester anomaly scan, uterine artery Dopplers should be carried out to assess the risk of early onset FGR.

At the time of the midtrimester fetal anomaly scan, certain normal variants and incidental findings may be observed. Fetal echogenic bowel has been associated with a small for gestational age (SGA) newborn and intrauterine fetal death. Isolated single umbilical artery is associated with a risk of SGA and growth restricted stillbirths. Where the estimated fetal weight (EFW) is <10th centile, uterine artery Doppler should be performed to assess for placental dysfunction and risk of early onset FGR.

Risk assessment for fetal growth disorders should be a continuous process throughout pregnancy. Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy need to be assessed in line with the NICE guideline Hypertension in Pregnancy to determine if growth scans and pathways need to be applied. Women who have been seriously or critically unwell from COVID-19 should be offered an ultrasound scan to assess the fetal biometry.

The first trimester is common and associated with threatened miscarriage and growth restriction. Bleeding in the second half of pregnancy has conflicting evidence regarding its association with fetal growth disorders. RCOG guidance recommends serial scans for fetal growth following an antepartum haemorrhage (APH). Women who develop hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have an increased risk of an SGA newborn. Maternal COVID-19 infection probably increases the risk of FGR. Prediction models should not be used as the only method for determining ultrasound surveillance. Multiparameter competing risk models for pre-eclampsia and placental dysfunction can help reduce the risk of preterm SGA. Reducing smoking in pregnancy can decrease the risk of SGA. Women should continue to take the recommended amount of vitamin D and folic acid. Balanced energy/protein supplementation has been associated with a reduction of SGA.

The evidence was of low quality, therefore high protein supplementation is not recommended. A Spanish RCT found structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction in high-risk pregnancies can reduce the percentage of newborns who were born SGA and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, due to significant limitations and confounders, neither intervention should be recommended routinely. 

Supplementation with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has not been shown to reduce SGA or intrauterine growth restriction. Multiple micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy appeared to reduce the risk of SGA. However, the only UK study failed to demonstrate any significant effect. High dose folic acid supplementation has not been shown to reduce the risk of SGA. Calcium supplementation has been suggested to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia, though a Cochrane review reported a modest 8% reduction at best. Magnesium supplementation to reduce the incidence of SGA has been extensively investigated, but a Cochrane review concluded there was no effect.

The benefit of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, SGA or FGR in pregnancy remains uncertain. Several systematic reviews have not found evidence of a reduced pre-eclampsia or stillbirth risk, but have found some evidence of a reduced risk of LBW and/or SGA. There is insufficient evidence to recommend high dose supplementation for pregnant women at risk of FGR.

Smoking increases the risk of SGA. Women who can stop smoking can reduce their risk of SGA. If able to quit by 15 weeks of gestation, they can return to the pregnancy risk status of similar non-smoking women. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of e-cigarettes to help stop smoking in pregnancy or whether they have potential harm for the fetus or child after birth. 

Taking folic acid and vitamin D doses above the recommended dose does not appear to provide any additional benefit to women at risk of FGR. Women at risk of pre-eclampsia and/or placental dysfunction should take aspirin 150 mg once daily at night from 12+0–36+6 weeks of pregnancy to reduce their chance of SGA and FGR. LMWH should not be prescribed to reduce the risk of SGA or FGR in at-risk women. 

Antiplatelet agents have been extensively investigated in women at varying levels of risk for pre-eclampsia, with SGA and/or FGR as outcomes. These studies have suggested a reduction in SGA and FGR birth with the use of aspirin in women at risk of pre-eclampsia. Prevention of pre-eclampsia with aspirin is most effective when aspirin is initiated between 11+0 weeks and 16+6 weeks of gestation. A meta-analysis demonstrated administration before 16 weeks was associated with a reduction in SGA, where after 16 weeks there was no significant effect. There is good evidence of aspirin safety and efficacy at 150 mg.

Doses below 100 mg of aspirin should only be considered in the presence of other relative contraindications. Aspirin administration in the evening or night is more effective at lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia than in the morning or day. Aspirin should ideally be commenced at 12–16 weeks and continued until at least 36 weeks. 

Antithrombotic therapy using low- molecular- weight heparin has been trialled in women at risk of FGR, but evidence does not support its use as an effective treatment to prevent SGA or FGR. 

Studies on progesterone to prevent PTB have shown no effect on the risk of pre-eclampsia or FGR. 

Studies examining the effects of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of FGR are small and of low quality and failed to show significant benefit. 

Antihypertensive drug therapy for hypertension in pregnancy does not seem to increase the risk of having an SGA newborn. The evidence regarding the association of SGA and beta-blockers in women who are hypertensive is inconclusive.

Women at a low risk for FGR should have serial assessment of fetal growth using antenatal SFH measurements performed by healthcare professionals trained in their use. Women with a single SFH which plots below the 10th centile or serial measurements which demonstrate suboptimal fetal growth should be referred for ultrasound measurement of fetal size.

Maternal obesity, abnormal fetal lie, large fibroids, hydramnios and the extent of fetal head engagement contribute to the limited predictive accuracy of SFH measurement. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular chart for recording SFH. Studies have shown abdominal palpation to be of limited accuracy in detecting a SGA newborn. SFH measurement would seem superior to palpation in detecting fetuses at risk, although both methods have significant limitations. Charts for recording of SFH commence at 24+0 weeks. Routine assessment for surveillance of fetal growth should not commence until 26+0–28+6 weeks. Women with a single SFH which plots below the 10th centile should be referred for further investigation with ultrasound assessment. There are no high-quality data that enable recommendations on how reducing SFH velocity should be defined. If measurements more than 2 weeks apart do not show any increase in SFH then women should be referred for a single ultrasound assessment of fetal growth. The urgency of this ultrasound assessment will depend on additional clinical findings. Providers should determine which charts they are going to use antenatally to record SFH and staff should be trained in the use of these. Routine measurement of fetal AC or EFW in the third trimester does not reduce the incidence of an SGA newborn nor does it improve perinatal outcome.

Ultrasounds are crucial for fetal growth surveillance and management, performed by various practitioners. High-quality measurements and reports are needed, requiring appropriate training, examination time, quality assurance, and audit. Serial scanning is recommended for women at increased risk of fetal growth disorders. Women at moderate risk of Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) don't require uterine artery Doppler assessment but need serial ultrasound assessment of fetal growth from 32 weeks. The interval between scans should not be more frequent than every 14 days, with optimum assessment for growth velocity being 21–28 days. Maternity providers should ensure they have guidance promoting the use of standard planes of acquisition and calliper placement when performing ultrasounds for fetal growth assessment. Quality control of images and measurements should form part of the monitoring process. If two Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) measurements are used to estimate velocity, they should ideally be a minimum of 3–4 weeks apart to minimise false positive rates for diagnosing FGR. When assessing fetal size, the Hadlock formula should be used with Head Circumference (HC), Abdominal Circumference (AC), and Femur Length (FL). Changing EFW formula during growth monitoring can lead to an artefactual change in growth trajectory and should be avoided where possible. Maternity providers should clearly identify the reference charts to plot individual biometry and EFW measurements to calculate centiles. When determining which charts are to be used to plot EFW, several factors should be considered, including the basis of fetal growth charts, the methodology used for developing them, and the need for adjustment to local or regional populations. Providers should monitor the number of fetuses considered < 3rd centile to ensure that their growth pathway and growth chart is appropriate.

False positive rates for diagnosing FGR were higher when the first scan was carried out at 36 weeks of gestation. To minimize false positive rates, two measurements should be at least 3 weeks apart. Reducing scan interval from 4 weeks to 2 weeks has not been shown to improve pregnancy outcome. Ultrasound biometric measures, both individually and combined, have shown that the fetal AC is better at predicting SGA than HC or FL, but not as good as the three measurements combined as EFW. The Hadlock equation, incorporating HC, FL and AC, is recommended for the estimation of fetal weight. Those performing ultrasound scans for biometry should be aware of the need for appropriate training, time for examination, quality assurance and audit. All measurements should be taken following the same methodology as that used in the studies which produced the reference curves being used. Changing formula during growth monitoring can lead to an artefactual change in growth trajectory. It is important to recognize the imprecision of EFW when interpreting results. Quality control of images and measurements should form part of the assessment. Integral to the assessment of fetal size is the ability to interpret the measurement relative to a given expected growth standard using a fetal growth chart with reference curves. There are several types of charts available, both descriptive and prescriptive. Customised charts have been proposed as an alternative to universal charts. A number of studies have investigated the association of individual customised charts with adverse outcome and different charts and rates of SGA and FGR in populations.

The DESiGN trial evaluated the GAP programme and found no significant impact on antenatal detection of SGA. However, the trial was criticised for various methodological issues and an analysis of all trial participants showed a reduction in both stillbirth and neonatal mortality. It was also observed that detection of SGA increased in the GAP DESiGN centres after the trial. 

The WHO recommends understanding local population characteristics for fetal growth as universal charts may not accurately reflect local variation. The use of universal charts may result in under or over detection of SGA. Maternity providers should monitor and validate local data for fetuses considered <3rd centile. 

The development of growth charts should be based on high-quality methodology. Maternity providers should have clear guidance and processes for fetal biometry measurements, quality control, and the selection of reference charts. 

There is contradictory evidence regarding the precision of EFW improvement by 3D ultrasound volumetry. Evidence suggests that EFW using MRI may be more accurate than ultrasound in predicting SGA and LGA newborns but requires more research due to poor interobserver agreement. 

For high-risk populations, uterine artery Doppler should be carried out at the time of the routine anomaly scan to determine when ultrasound surveillance of fetal growth should commence. Repeating uterine artery Doppler is of limited value in this situation. 

FGR is characterised by lack of adequate trophoblast invasion of the myometrial uterine spiral arteries and reduced uteroplacental blood flow. Uterine artery Doppler has been incorporated into first trimester screening algorithms to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes related to SGA births.

The predictive ability of pler is insufficient to be clinically useful in either the first or second trimester. Using uterine artery Doppler alongside maternal factors and fetal biometry at a midtrimester scan can detect 89% of very preterm SGA below the 5th centile. While there are no effective interventions to reduce this risk, the uterine artery Doppler can help determine further growth surveillance pathways. Abnormal uterine artery Doppler may normalise later in the second trimester, but there is still an increased risk in these women. The mean uterine artery PI is recommended as the index of measurement. Third trimester uterine artery Doppler is not an effective risk assessment tool in unselected pregnancies, but it is moderately useful in predicting adverse outcome in pregnancies with suspected SGA in the third trimester but not as a standalone test. For women at high risk with a normal uterine artery Doppler, serial scans are recommended to commence at 32 weeks and for women with an abnormal uterine artery Doppler these can commence at 24+0–28+6 weeks. Ultrasound biometry shows that fetal size alone is not sufficient to identify FGR, unless AC or EFW is below the 3rd centile. Doppler velocimetry of uteroplacental circulation may be used to help distinguish between SGA and FGR in the third trimester. When a fetal growth disorder is diagnosed an assessment of fetal wellbeing should be made. The optimal approach to interpret the information from serial measurements of the same fetus remains unclear due to non-linear growth across pregnancy. Further research is required to quantify the predictive accuracy of different methods.

This review should include assessment of all fetal biometry measurements since the anomaly scan to identify potentially erroneous single measurements and also the presence or absence of other risk factors for FGR. Attention should be paid to a downward trend in AC growth velocity. When a fetal growth disorder is suspected or diagnosed, an assessment of fetal wellbeing should be made. For fetal growth disorders diagnosed in the third trimester, uterine artery Dopplers can be used to assess for placental dysfunction. 

Clinical tests that measure placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (s-flt1) or the ratio between the two are now clinically available and recommended for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, the use of PlGF/s-flt1 testing for the prediction and diagnosis in non-hypertensive women is not routinely recommended. 

FGR that results from placental dysfunction is known to be associated with placentas that have smaller diameters and increased depth, lower volumes and irregular shapes. MRI can provide placental functional data that further delineate FGR from non-FGR babies and SGA pregnancies, but the high cost and time required for each examination limits its clinical applicability.

There are several biomarkers that have been proposed as adjuncts to serial ultrasound measurements to identify women at high risk of SGA and stillbirth. Addition of these biomarkers within the serial ultrasound screening pathway and the use of the biomarkers to delineate who needs serial scans has been evaluated in both high and low risk women. 

PlGF is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family produced in pregnancy by the placenta; in the circulation it binds to s-flt1. The observation that women with pre-eclampsia have high circulating levels of s-flt1 has been extensively investigated. Clinical tests that measure PlGF, s-flt1 or the ratio between the two are now clinically available and recommended for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The use of PlGF/s-flt1 testing for the prediction and diagnosis of FGR in non-hypertensive women remains uncertain. 

Measurement of PlGF/s-flt1 in the second trimester is similarly hampered by low sensitivity when distant from disease. However, if measured near disease in the third trimester, PlGF/s-flt1 levels may be more clinically useful particularly when used in combination with EFW or uterine artery Doppler or other indicators of FGR.

The clinical guideline recommends referring to fetal medicine when the estimated fetal weight (EFW) is below the 3rd centile or below the 10th centile with abnormal uterine artery Doppler at the midtrimester anomaly scan. Invasive diagnostic testing should be considered for severely small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses with structural anomalies and in non-anomalous fetuses detected before 23 weeks of gestation, especially if uterine artery Doppler is normal. Analysis should include a microarray to detect microdeletions and microinsertions. Prenatal exome sequencing should be considered in cases with multi-system abnormalities or isolated short long bones. Serological screening for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasmosis infection should be offered in severe SGA. Testing for malaria and Zika should be considered in high-risk populations. Invasive diagnostic testing should be offered in severely SGA fetuses with structural anomalies and considered in non-anomalous fetuses detected before 23 weeks of gestation, especially if uterine artery Doppler is normal. Follow-up scans should be arranged given the association with subsequent birth of an SGA infant. Fetal infections are responsible for up to 5% of SGA fetuses. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should not be prescribed to women in whom fetal growth disorders have been diagnosed. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors should not be prescribed to treat FGR outside of randomized controlled trials. There are no proven interventions in SGA and FGR other than birth of the baby.

A small RCT of sildenafil in women with early onset pre-eclampsia reported a prolongation of pregnancy by 4 days, but prospective RCTs focusing on FGR have not shown any benefit. The STRIDER collaboration did not show any prolongation in pregnancy or improvement in outcome from sildenafil treatment. Tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor has also been tested with reported improved neonatal outcome and no adverse effects, but no RCT evidence is currently available. RCT evidence also does not support the use of LMWH as an effective treatment to prevent SGA or FGR.

Ultrasound biometry should be carried out every 2 weeks in fetuses identified to be SGA. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool and should be undertaken at the point of diagnosis of SGA and during follow-up as a minimum every 2 weeks. For fetuses with an EFW between the 3rd and 10th centile, other features must be present for birth to be recommended prior to 39 weeks. For fetuses with an EFW or AC less than the 10th centile where FGR has been excluded, birth or the initiation of IOL should be considered at 39+0 weeks. After 37+0 weeks, an abnormal MCA, CPR or UCR can be used to guide timing of birth.

SGA fetuses are those whose AC or EFW is below the 10th centile but with normal growth velocity and do not exhibit Doppler changes. For these pregnancies where there are no additional maternal risk factors, ultrasound surveillance every 2 weeks is appropriate. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool. Its use in high risk pregnancy has been shown to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, reduce antenatal admissions and inductions of labour.

The recommendations for birth of SGA fetuses are based on the findings of the DIGITAT study and consideration of data related to morbidity related to “early term” (37–38 week) birth. The DIGITAT study found no difference in severe neonatal morbidity or in caesarean birth but an increase in neonatal unit admission with induction before 38 weeks. A Cochrane review showed no difference in perinatal or long-term outcome with a policy of early birth versus expectant management. 

Induction of labor (IOL) between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks should only be considered for fetuses at significantly increased risk of perinatal mortality. For all fetuses with an EFW or AC less than the 10th centile where FGR has been excluded, birth or the initiation of IOL should be considered at 39+0 weeks after discussion with the woman and her partner/family/support network. Birth should occur by 39+6 weeks. 

FGR fetuses defined as those whose AC or EFW below the 10th centile with Doppler changes or AC/EFW less than the 3rd centile, or growth crossing 50 centiles are a higher risk category. Most experts differentiate early from late FGR at 32–34 weeks of gestation. 

Pregnancies with early FGR should be monitored and managed with input from tertiary level units with the highest level neonatal care. Care should be multidisciplinary by neonatology and obstetricians with fetal medicine expertise, particularly when extremely preterm (before 28 weeks). Biometry in FGR should be repeated every 2 weeks. In early FGR, the frequency of assessment of fetal wellbeing will be based on the severity of FGR and UA Doppler assessment with a minimum of weekly, when there are no other concerns, and 2–3 times weekly when there are UA abnormalities. Assessment of fetal wellbeing can include multiple modalities but must include cCTG and/or ductus venosus.

The Dawes-Redman CTG system is recommended for cCTG analysis with short-term variation (STV) being the key parameter. High variability in Doppler reference ranges and indices used has a major clinical impact on prenatal diagnosis, monitoring, decision making around timing of birth and reproducibility. A large prospective observational study found that the ductus venosus and cCTG changes were most discriminatory in relation to the timing of birth. MCA CPR/UCR can inform monitoring strategy and frequency but should not be used to determine birth decisions prior to 37+0 weeks. 

Birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessment or maternal indication (e.g. severe pre-eclampsia). From 26+0 weeks, birth if any of the following is present: spontaneous repeated persistent unprovoked fetal heart rate decelerations; birth if ductus venosus a- wave is at or below baseline or STV is below certain levels depending on the week of pregnancy; birth if UA-EDF is reversed or STV is below certain levels depending on the week of pregnancy. 

In early FGR a woman's subjective assessment of reduced fetal movements or reduced or absent movements on ultrasound should prompt an assessment with cCTG. Pregnancies with early FGR should be monitored and managed with input from tertiary level units with the highest level neonatal care. Management of early FGR requires regional network specialist fetal medicine input to determine the most appropriate monitoring for fetal wellbeing and timing of birth where fetal compromise is demonstrated. 

The optimum management of early FGR has largely been defined by the TRUFFLE study. In this study, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler defined entry to the study, but did not play a part in management until after 32 weeks. The frequency of monitoring in early FGR has not been subjected to any prospective randomised studies. Umbilical artery Doppler changes are defined as: PI above the.

Ductus venosus and umbilical Doppler changes are defined by raised PIV above 95th centile, absent end diastolic flow, or reversed end diastolic flow. Depending on the severity of fetal growth restriction (FGR), repeat ultrasound and CTG monitoring is undertaken weekly or daily. Birth is planned when the Ductus venosus ‘a’ wave is at or below baseline or there are CTG abnormalities. An experienced obstetrician and neonatologist should counsel parents when considering birth of a preterm fetus with FGR.

In late and term FGR, ductus venosus waveform is unlikely to show severe abnormalities. Birth should be based on fetal wellbeing assessments or maternal indication. In pregnancies with late FGR, birth should be initiated from 37+0 weeks to be completed by 37+6 weeks. Cerebral Doppler can inform monitoring strategy and frequency but should not be used to determine birth decisions prior to 37 weeks. In late FGR, reduced fetal movements or absent movements on ultrasound should prompt an assessment with cCTG.

A normal umbilical artery Doppler cannot exclude placental dysfunction and other surveillance methods are needed. Birth based on MCA Doppler changes might not improve outcome and might be harmful. An abnormal uterine artery Doppler is associated with increased risk of intrapartum fetal distress, emergency caesarean birth and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. For all babies with FGR, birth should be planned for and initiated by 37 weeks with birth occurring by 37+6 weeks. 

Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered.

Antenatal corticosteroids should be offered to women between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks of gestation at high risk of imminent preterm birth (PTB). The timing of steroids is key to ensure their effectiveness. All women undergoing a PTB should be offered transfer to a unit with appropriate neonatal cot facilities when safe. Magnesium sulphate should be offered between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks for neuroprotection and considered up to 33+6 weeks. In the case of a fetus with abnormal cCTG STV, ductus venosus alteration, umbilical artery absent or reversed end diastolic flow velocities, caesarean birth is recommended after administration of steroids and magnesium sulphate. For a small for gestational age (SGA) fetus or late fetal growth restriction (FGR) fetus with normal umbilical artery Doppler or with abnormal umbilical artery PI but end-diastolic velocities present, induction of labor can be offered but rates of unplanned caesarean birth are increased. Mechanical methods should be considered for induction of labor. Early admission is recommended in women in spontaneous labour with a SGA/FGR fetus for continuous fetal heart rate monitoring.

Histopathological examination of the placenta may be useful when Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is diagnosed prenatally or at birth to understand the underlying causes and guide management in a subsequent pregnancy. Women who have given birth to a growth restricted infant should be offered an appointment for postnatal counselling, review of placental histology and consideration of investigations of underlying causes as appropriate. The British Society for Haematology recommends against testing for hereditary thrombophilias but for acquired thrombophilias can be considered as it may aid risk stratification and treatment decisions. A plan for future pregnancies and preventative strategies (smoking cessation, aspirin treatment) should be recorded in the notes and discussed with the woman. Following the birth of a baby with FGR, investigations should be offered to try to determine the underlying cause and help provide an opportunity to discuss risk of recurrence and possible interventions to reduce risk at a prepregnancy appointment. Modifiable risk factors should be addressed and plans for prevention and monitoring in future pregnancies should be discussed. Further research is required in several areas related to FGR.

The clinical guideline references multiple studies that highlight the use of uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography in predicting pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and small-for-gestational-age neonates. The studies also discuss the changes in uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and circulating angiogenic factors in pregnancies, the role of early second-trimester uterine artery Doppler screening, and the impact of knowledge of uterine artery resistance in the second trimester. Additionally, studies show that abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry predicts adverse pregnancy outcomes and that increased uterine artery resistance in the third trimester can affect pregnancy outcome. The guideline also mentions the ISUOG practice guidelines for the use of Doppler ultrasonography in obstetrics.

The text discusses various studies on fetal growth, placental volume, and potential indicators of perinatal morbidity. The studies examine the use of ultrasound and Doppler imaging for predicting small fetuses at term, standards for ultrasound fetal growth velocity, and the calculation of reference intervals for fetal size and growth.

2++ - evidence directly applicable to target population or extrapolated from 1++ or 1+ studies
2+ - evidence directly applicable to target population or extrapolated from 2++ studies
3 or 4 - evidence level or extrapolated from 2+ studies
Good Practice Points (GPP) - recommended best practice based on clinical experience of the guideline development group

Clinical guidelines assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about treatment for specific conditions. They are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment and must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources, and limitations unique to the institution and local populations. 

The guideline provides a surveillance pathway for Fetal growth and management of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Risk factors must be assessed at booking and at mid trimester scan. Risk assessment must be individualised taking into account previous medical and obstetric history and current pregnancy history. For women with maternal medical conditions and individuals with disease progression, or institution of medical therapies, an individual's risk may increase and necessitate monitoring with serial scanning. For women with a previous stillbirth, management must be tailored to the previous history. 

The guideline will be considered for update 3 years after publication, with an intermediate assessment of the need to update 2 years after publication.
