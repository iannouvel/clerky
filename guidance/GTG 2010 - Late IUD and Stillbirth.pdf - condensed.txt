Late Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth
Purpose and scope:
To identify evidence-based options for women who have a late intrauterine fetal death of a singleton fetus. The guidance includes general care before, during, and after birth, and care in future pregnancies. This guideline does not include the management of multiple pregnancies with a surviving fetus, stillbirth following late fetocide, late delivery of fetus papyraceous or the management of specific medical conditions associated with increased risk of late IUFD. Recommendations about the psychological aspects of late IUFD are focused on providing a framework of practice for maternity clinicians. 
Background:
Stillbirth is common, with 1 in 200 babies born dead. Over one-third of stillbirths are small-for-gestational-age fetuses with half classified as unexplained. The stillbirth rate has remained constant since 2000. 
Diagnosis:
Real-time ultrasonography is essential for diagnosing late IUFD. Auscultation and cardiotocography should not be used. Discussions about the diagnosis and subsequent care should aim to support maternal/parental choice. 
Investigation of the cause:
Tests should be recommended to assess maternal wellbeing and determine the cause of death. No specific cause is found in almost half of stillbirths. Tests aim to identify scientifically proven causes of late IUFD. Common causes include congenital malformation, congenital fetal infection, antepartum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, and maternal disease. 
Special recommendations for women who are rhesus D-negative:
Women who are rhesus D-negative should have a Kleihauer test undertaken urgently to detect large feto-maternal hemorrhage. Anti-RhD gammaglobulin should be administered as soon as possible after presentation. 
Tests recommended to identify the cause of late IUFD:
Tests should be directed to identify scientifically proven causes of late IUFD. Commonly associated antepartum conditions include congenital malformation, congenital fetal infection, antepartum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, and maternal disease. Transplacental infections associated with IUFD include cytomegalovirus, syphilis, parvovirus B19, listeria, rubella, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, coxsackievirus, leptospira, Q fever, and Lyme disease.

Maternal serology testing for viral infections, syphilis, and other infections is important for assessing risk factors. Maternal blood glucose levels and HbA1c should be monitored for diabetes. Maternal thyroid function and thrombophilia screening may be indicated based on clinical presentation. Testing for immune hemolytic disease, autoimmune diseases, and alloimmune thrombocytopenia should be considered if certain symptoms are present. Sexing the baby should be done carefully by experienced healthcare practitioners. Parental bloods for karyotype testing may be necessary in certain cases. Testing for drug use, fetal infections, and genetic abnormalities should be considered. Postmortem examination can provide valuable information on the cause of intrauterine fetal death. Labor and birth recommendations should consider the mother's preferences and medical history. Induction of labor for women with an unscarred uterus should usually involve a combination of mifepristone and a prostaglandin preparation. Misoprostol can be used as an alternative to prostaglandin E2 for induction of labor.

randomised controlled trials compared oral and vaginal misoprostol. In the first study, vaginal use resulted in a shorter induction to birth interval and reduced need for oxytocin augmentation. In the second study, there was no difference in induction to birth interval for gestations over 28 weeks. Systemic adverse effects were more common with oral misoprostol. 

For women with a history of lower segment caesarean section (LSCS), a discussion of the safety and benefits of induction of labour should be undertaken by a consultant obstetrician. Mifepristone can be used alone to increase the chance of labour significantly within 72 hours. 

Women with a single lower segment scar can safely undergo induction of labour with prostaglandin. Misoprostol can be used for induction of labour in women with a single previous LSCS and an IUFD with lower doses. Women with two previous LSCS can also undergo induction of labour with prostaglandin. For women with more than two LSCS deliveries or atypical scars, the safety of induction of labour is unknown. 

In terms of pain relief in labour, diamorphine is preferred over pethidine. Regional anaesthesia should be available for women with an IUFD. Assessment for DIC and sepsis should be done before administering regional anaesthesia. 

Women undergoing VBAC should be closely monitored for scar rupture. Oxytocin augmentation can be used for VBAC, but the decision should be made by a consultant obstetrician. Fetal heart rate abnormality is not a common sign of scar dehiscence in this circumstance. 

In the puerperium period, women should receive care in an environment that provides adequate safety. Thromboprophylaxis should be routinely assessed, but IUFD is not a risk factor. 

For suppression of lactation, dopamine agonists can successfully suppress lactation in a high proportion of women. Women should be advised about the psychological and social aspects of care following late IUFD. Counseling should be offered to all women and their partners, and other family members should also be considered for counseling. Bereavement officers should be appointed to coordinate services.

Guilt is a common emotion in perinatal grief. Family members, such as grandparents and existing children, can also be severely affected by bereavement. Maternity units should offer debriefing services for traumatic events. Support groups like Sands have been developed to help partners. Carers should support parents in decisions about seeing, holding, naming, and keeping mementos of their stillborn baby. Legal requirements for medical certification of stillbirth should be followed. Maternity units should provide spiritual guidance, burial, cremation, and remembrance options. Parents should be advised about fertility and contraception. Follow-up meetings should include discussions about the cause of late IUFD, prepregnancy advice, and potential psychological issues. Recommendations for pregnancy following unexplained late IUFD include obstetric antenatal care and screening for gestational diabetes. Monitoring growth by ultrasound biometry is recommended for subsequent pregnancies. Studies have shown increased risks in subsequent pregnancies after stillbirth.

- Increased risk of ischaemic placental disease, fetal distress, chorioamnionitis, extreme preterm birth, and early neonatal mortality in pregnancies after stillbirth.
- Rate of gestational diabetes four times higher in women with a history of unexplained stillbirth.
- Unexplained IUFDs may be reclassified as fetal growth restriction with customised charts.
- Maternal care recommendations after next birth include vigilance for postpartum depression and awareness of potential impact on maternal bonding.
- Risk management standards and documentation guidelines for IUFD and stillbirth.
- Information leaflets for women and partners on various issues.
- Recommendations for care of staff involved in IUFD cases.
- Auditable standards for stillbirth incidents.
- Training recommendations for healthcare professionals.
- Future research recommendations include optimal classification of stillbirth, safety of induction of labor, and psychological care for women and partners.

Intrauterine infections, gestational diabetes, and chromosomal abnormalities can be significant factors in stillbirth. Autopsy findings and placental examination can help determine the cause of stillbirth. Induction of labor may be necessary in cases of intrauterine fetal death.
