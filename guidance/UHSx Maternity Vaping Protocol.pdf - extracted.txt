Trust wide: PRH, SRH, WH - Providers WSCC. RSCH provider BHCC  
 
In April 2023, the government announced a commitment to support one million smokers to ‘swap to 
stop’ . Under this new campaign, 1 in 5 smokers in England will be provided with a vape starter kit , 
alongside stop smoking behavioural support.    
 
To facilitate this campaign, the government have enlisted Crown Commercial Services  to launch a 
new vaping solution procurement framework. The framework offers Local Authorities access to 
competitive pricing across a range of suppliers selling the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency approved nicotin e vaping products (e -cigarettes).   
 
This document sets out the pathway for integrating access to regulated nicotine vapes as a smoking 
cessation aid for maternity service users engaging with the smokefree pregnancy service.

1.1 WHY ARE NICOTINE VAP ES BEING DISCUSSED AS AN OPTI ON TO AID SMOKING 
CESSATION  
 Nicotine vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking. It is also one of the most 
effective tools for quitting smoking ( Nicotine vaping in England: 2022 evidence update 
summar y (GOV.UK 29/9/22 ).  
 Users are roughly twice as likely to quit smoking if they use a vape compared with other 
nicotine replacement therapy medications such as: patches and chewing gum.   
 Vaping is not recommended for non -smokers and young people (under  18) because it is 
not completely harmless.   
 From April 2024 smokers will be offered one of the following smoking cessation aids:   
­ Nicotine replacement therapies (NRT): patches, gum, nasal spray, mouth spray, 
inhalator and lozenges products    
­ Nicotine vap e starter kit including 4 weeks of e -liquids and atomizer heads.  
 Previously pregnant smokers have only been offered NRT alongside information about 
vapes/e -cigarettes  for them to purchase independently if they choose to do so . 
 
1.2 WHAT ARE E -CIGARETTES AND HOW DO THEY WORK ?  
 An e-cigarette is a device that allows the users to inhale nicotine in a vapour rather than 
smoke. Using an e -cigarette is known as vaping ( E-cigarettes vs. Ciga rettes - YouTube ).  
 E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco and do not produce tar or carbon monoxide; two of the 
most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.   
 They work by heating a liquid (called an e -liquid) that typically contains nicotine, 
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine, and flavourings.   
 E-liquids come in different nicotine strengths, allowing the user control of the strength 
required to control cravings and manage withdrawal symptoms including irritability and 
low mood.    
 This also allows users to gr adually reduce the strength of the nicotine, as required, in 
order to become nicotine free.    
 Nicotine itself is a relatively harmless chemical and has been effectively used for many 
years in NRT medications to help people stop smoking.   CLINICAL PROTOCOL

 Page 5 of 24  Some people find vaping helps them because the hand -to-mouth action is like smoking, 
giving similar sensations.   
 
1.3 IS VAPING HARMFUL IN  PREGNANCY?   
 In the UK, e -cigarettes are tightly regulated for safety and quality ( E-cigarettes: 
regulations for consumer products (GOV.UK 2/10/22 )  
 Experts agree vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, but it is not risk -free. 
Vaping exposes users to fewer toxins and at lower  levels than smoking cigarettes (Vaping 
Demystified - YouTube ).  
 Switching to vaping significantly reduces the user’s exposure to toxins that can cause 
cancer, lung disease, cardiovascular diseases and circulatory problems, and significantly 
reduces the risk of heart attacks and stroke, compared to tobacco smokers.    
 Little research exists regarding the safety of using e -cigarettes (vaping) during pregnancy, 
however evidence f rom adult smokers in general suggests that they are likely to be 
significantly less harmful to a pregnant woman and her baby than continuing to smoke. E -
cigarettes do not contain carbon monoxide (CO) or many of the other harmful chemicals 
found in cigarett es. CO is especially dangerous during pregnancy because it deprives the 
baby of oxygen, slows its growth and development and results in the adverse outcomes 
seen in pregnancy.    
 Smoking or exposure to second -hand smoke during pregnancy is responsible for a n 
increased rate of stillbirths, complications during labour, premature birth, miscarriages, 
birth defects and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). (Ash. 2019)  * 
 Licensed Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products such as nicotine patches, 
gum and inhalers are the recommended option . However, i f a pregnant woman  or 
birthing person  chooses to use an e -cigarette and if that helps her to quit smoking 
and stay smokefree, she should be supported to do so. (A SH 2019)  * 
 E-cigarettes do not produce tar or c arbon monoxide, two of the most harmful substances 
in tobacco smoke ( Smokefree ‘Health Harms’ – Impact of smoking vs vaping 
demonstration - YouTube ).  
 
1.4 RISKS FROM NICOTINE   
 While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, the harm from smoking comes 
from the thousands of other toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke.   
 NRT medicine has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a 
safe treatment.   
 
1.5 IS A NICOTINE VAPE AN EFFECTIVE QUIT AID TO STOP SMOKING?    
 Thousands of people in the UK have already stopped smoking with the help of an e -
cigarette. Vapes  have been popular with people who smoke for over a decade and are 
now the most common stop smoking aid in England.    
 A 2021 review found people who used e -cigarettes to quit smoking, alongside support 
from an Advisor, specialist or behaviour change suppor t, can be up to twice as likely to CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Due for review:  May 2027  
Name of Protocol : Maternity Vaping  Protocol v1.0  
For use at:  PRH, RSCH, SRH, WH  
  
 Page 6 of 24 succeed as people who used other nicotine replacement products, such as patches or 
gum.   
 Using an e -cigarette can help users manage their nicotine cravings. For it to be most 
effective, ensure they are using it as often a s required, and with the appropriate strength 
of nicotine in the e -liquid.   
 Users will not get the full benefit from vaping unless they stop smoking cigarettes 
completely.   
 Please refer to the NCSCT Vaping Guide for Health and Social Care Professionals for  
more details and evidence regarding why vaping is considered an effective quit aid – see 
section “8 Supporting Resources”.    
 
1.6 INCLUSION CRITERIA   
 All pregnant people self -reporting to smoking tobacco.   
 All smokers where risk/benefit of NRT and e -cigar ettes have been discussed.   
 
1.7 EXCLUSION CRITERIA   
 Any person under 18 years of age .  
 Pregnant smokers after assessment of risk/benefit of pharmacotherapy have chosen to 
quit with behavioural support only.    
 Haemodynamically  unstable patients hospitalised with cerebrovascular accident (unstable 
blood pressure caused by blood clots or broken blood vessels in the brain, such as a 
stroke) .  
 Haemodynamically unstable patients hospitalised with myocardial infarction (unstable 
blood pressure caused by a heart attack) .  
 Haemodynamically unstable patients hospitalised with severe arrhythmias (unstable 
blood pressure caused by abnormal heart rhythm) .  
 Phaeochromocytoma (rare adrenal gland tumour) .  
 
1.8 CAUTIONS  
 Any persons with Diabet es mellitus – blood glucose concentration needs to be closely 
monitored when initiating any treatment Vaping - Safety, Effect on Blood Glucose

If vape  use is being considered by the pregnant person, but the individual has a history of any of the 
listed conditions, please refer to an obstetrician, lead midwife for the smokefree pregnancy service 
or GP for review.    
 
1.9 PARTNERS  
 
 As per Smoking in Pregna ncy protocol  we offer behavioural support to partners and can 
offer access to the Government approved Swap to Stop vouchers if they choose to use a CLINICAL PROTOCOL

 Page 7 of 24 vape to stop smoking. Any offer of voucher codes will be given alongside an information 
sheet detailing info rmation, contraindications and risks. Partners must take personal 
responsibility for their use of these products.  
 As partners do not fall under Smoke Free Pregnancy Service responsibility for ongoing  
care, after the Swap to Stop 4 -week voucher is issued, they will be signposted to local 
smoking cessation services for ongoing NRT/vape provision where available  
 Behavioural support within the expectant family unit can continue to be provided by 
Smoke Fre e Pregnancy to promote Smoke Free homes.  
 
1.10 SERVICE DELIVERY PRO TOCOL   
Issuing Nicotine Vape Starter Kits    
 Advisors will continue to deliver the smokefree pregnancy pathway as specified in the UH 
Sussex Maternity Smoking Cessation guideline based on th e NCSCT Standard 
Treatment Programme.   
 NCSCT maternity care v6   
 This section outlines the service delivery guidance and protocol for the issuance of a vape 
starter kit as a smoking cessation aid for adult smokers (18+) .   
2.0 FIRST APPOINTMENT “I NITIAL ASSESSMENT” ( FACE TO FACE)   
This is an opportunity to discuss the different forms of nicotine replacement products or medication 
available to the pregnant smoker, and to assist them in determining the most suitable option. The 
options available to the client are as follows:   
 
 Behavio ural support alone  
 Various options of NRT medication with behavioural support throughout pregnancy .  
 Voucher codes for online redemption against a free regulated  vape starter kit along with 
ongoing  supply of e -liquids and atomizers in pregnancy as required with behavioural 
support.   
 
2.1 STEP 1: THE CLIENT SELECTS THE VAPE STAR TER KIT OPTION   
2.1.1  EXPLORING VAPE AND E-LIQUID OPTIONS AVAILABLE  
If the pregnant smoker decides to select the vape starte r kit option, the  Tobacco Dependency 
Treatment Practitioner  should demonstrate (using demo kits or video demonstrations) how to 
operate a vape device and outline the distinct functions of each of the models available as part of 
the free vape starter kit as  outlined in Section 4 “Nicotine Vaping Products”. The Advisor should also 
talk the client through the six different e -liquid choices available and determine the correct nicotine 
strength according to the client’s smoking habits (Table 1  below ).   
 
The below table offers the Advisor guidance on what may be an appropriate dosage for the Client 
based on their current smoking behaviour.

2.1.2  THE DELIVERY MECHANISM    
The delivery mechanism for the nicotine in a vape  is quite different to that of NRT. NRT delivers a 
slow, steady release of nicotine to the user, enabling them to reduce their level of nicotine addiction 
over a 12 -week period. Whereas vapes supply nicotine in a ‘rush’ or ‘spike’ similar (but not the 
same ) to that of a cigarette. The advisor should spend time explaining how vapes work in this 
respect, so clients know what to expect.    
 
Vaping is different to smoking and some clients will take longer to get used to it. Additional NRT is 
less likely  to be re quired when clients have the right vape kit and the correct strength of nicotine 
content to alleviate nicotine withdrawal symptoms. It is important to offer ongoing expert support to 
enable clients to vape effectively.    
 
2.1.3  HIGHLY NICOTINE DEPENDENT CLIENTS    
Highly nicotine dependent clients (more likely in clients with severe mental illness, learning disability 
and those who use other substances) may benefit from a NRT patch in addition to the vape for the 
first few weeks of a vape quit programme. Th e dosage and combination can be adjusted to help 
mitigate the client’s experienced withdrawal symptoms.   
The main aim of using NRT in addition to a vape in heavily addicted smokers, is to reduce the high 
frequency of vaping that would be needed to avoid se vere nicotine withdrawal symptoms in these 
smokers. If they do not have NRT, they might find they are constantly having to vape even when 
utilising the highest possible dosage, which may be frustrating and inconvenient.    
 
The preferred form of NRT would b e to use a low -level transdermal patch, as this would provide a 
baseline level of nicotine throughout the day. It should not give the client the ‘highs’ and ‘lows’ that 
they could get with other delivery mechanisms. The Advisor should issue a 10mg/15mg/25m g 16hr 
patch.   
 
If issuing a patch as well as a vape, the Advisor should advise the client to keep an eye out for 
symptoms of receiving too much nicotine. They could experience this in the form of headaches, 
heart racing, feeling clammy, feeling sick. Most  people would describe it as feeling like they have 
had one too many cigarettes. If they do experience these symptoms, they should either cut down on 
the amount they are using the vape or remove the patch.

 Page 9 of 24 2.2 STEP 2: CREATING A N ICOTINE REDUCTION PL AN  
When a client selects the ‘Vaping Starter Kit’ as their smoking cessation aid, it is important to work 
with the client to create a Nicotine Reduction Plan that can help the client achieve their goal for the 
12-week programme.    
 
From the outset, the Advisor needs to develop an understanding of the client’s expectations of 
becoming tobacco and nicotine free using a vape. This insight will help the Advisor to support the 
client to develop a personalised nicotine reduction plan in on e of the following ways:   
 
If the client’s goal is to become tobacco and nicotine free at the end of the 12 -week 
programme, the adviser should work with the client to help them achieve this outcome .  
  
 To achieve this the  Advisor should educate the client on nicotine addiction and how the 
use of vapes can help reduce dependency over time when used effectively and improve 
their health.    
 This Advisor should work with the client to develop a personalised plan to enable the 
client to gradually reduce the frequency of vaping and, gradually reduce the strength of 
the nicotine content of the e -liquid (reducing to zero) over the 12 -week programme. It is 
important that the reduction is gradual to avoid any extreme withdrawal sympto ms or 
cravings that could discourage the client. The plan should outline how the client can best 
reduce the strength and frequency of their vaping over the 12 weeks as well as factoring 
in any additional support they will need over the course of the progra mme (for example 
follow up calls and any other support as per the standard behavioural support offering)   
 When working with a client who wants to stop vaping, it can be useful to organise support 
using the Ask, Advise, Act model, as outlined in the NCSCT g uidance on Supporting 
clients who want to stop vaping (ncsct.co.uk)   
  
If the pregnant person wishes to continue using the vape after the 12 -week programme, then 
it is imp ortant for the Advisor to provide the client with the following information to 
encourage the client to remain smokefree during pregnancy.   
  
Vouchers for  supply of e -liquids and atomizer heads will be provided for the duration of the 
pregnancy and up to 28 days postnatal with CO verified quit at 28 days .  
 
The quit must be CO verified 28 days after quit date and subsequent CO readings must be <4ppm. 
If a relapse is identified, then voucher code issue will cease until the client confirms they are ready 
to re-engage with a quit programme – a Face to Face appointment will be offered as soon as 
possible following any relapse being identified .  
 
 It would also be  useful to provide information and guidance for the Client on what they 
would need to consider if they did at some point choose to stop vaping. Many vapers get 
to this stage after 12 months.    
 A client can start to move towards being nicotine free by:    
 reducing the frequency of vaping over time and    
 gradually reducing the strength of nicotine contained in the e -liquid.

For use at:  PRH, RSCH, SRH, WH  
  
 Page 10 of 24 2.3 STEP 3: RECORDING APPOINTMENT DETAILS   
The Advisor should add the details of the client’s chosen option to MIS. The client will need to refer 
to this information when ordering their chosen starter kit via the voucher scheme. The Advisor will 
issue the voucher codes to the client during their quit date and subsequent appointments.   
3.0 SECOND APPOINTMENT ( ON OR AROUND THE QUI T DATE)  (FACE TO FACE)    
The purpose of the second appointment is to assist the client in getting started on the 12 -week 
programme using vapes as smoke cessation aid. Below are the steps involved.    
 
3.1 STEP 1: OBTAIN CLIENT CO READING    
The Advisor should check  the smoking status of the client by taking a CO reading to confirm they 
are currently smoking tobacco; this should be recorded on the pregnant person ’s maternity 
records.    
 
3.2 STEP 2: CONFIRM SELECTED VAPE PRODUCTS AND OBTAIN VOUCHER CODES   
 The Tobacco Dependency Treatment Practitioner  will then need to confirm the vape 
starter kit that the client selected during their first appointment and provide them with the 
starter kit details (starter kit model, e -liquid strength, and flavour).    
 The Tobacco Dependency Treatment Practitioner  will then use this information to 
determine if the service has the correct voucher available for allocation. Please refer to 
section 4 ‘Totally Wicked Voucher Scheme and Client Order Process’ for a n overview of 
voucher cod es.    
 Voucher codes will be obtained in advance by the Specialist S mokefree Pregnancy 
midwife via the approved procurement platform. For guidance on how to order, receive 
and manage voucher codes please refer to section 3 “Ordering Vape Vouchers via 
procu rement platform.    
 Once the midwife has placed the order, Totally Wicked (who run the client voucher 
scheme) will contact the midwife (via email) with the voucher code details that will be 
required for the client to redeem their chosen products via the Tot ally Wicked website.    
 The Advisor will need to record the client’s case reference number against the specific 
voucher codes allocated on the services’ internal voucher management system (each 
service should have their own system in place to record vouchers ordered and allocated), 
as well as updating the notes section on MIS with the voucher details.    
 These voucher codes will then be issued to the client in line with the below appointment 
and issuance schedule.   
 
3.3 STEP 3: ONGOING FOLL OW UP    
 The Advisor should provide an overview of the 12 -week programme and schedule follow 
up appointments in line with the smokefree pathway. When setting the appointments, it is 
important that the Advisor is mindful of the timings to ensure that the voucher cod es are 
released to the client in good time to enable the client to order required products and 
avoid any disruption to their vaping programme.  It may be useful to time the voucher code 
release to coincide with follow up appointments.  CLINICAL PROTOCOL

can be released to the client in good time for them to order their refill product.

management system and on MIS in ’smoking summary’ in additional notes. The correct 
pharmacotherapy code needs to be updated.   
 The Advisor should only release part 1 of the starter kit (product type “K”) at the Qui t Date 
Appointment. See section ‘Totally Wicked Voucher Scheme and Client Order Process’ for 
an overview of the Totally Wicked Voucher Codes.

Scheme’ for a step -by-step guidance.)   
 The method of releasing voucher codes after the Quit Date Appointment will need to be 
determined by Advisor and the client, in line with the behaviour support and appointment 
schedule agreed.

4.0 THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH APPOINTMENTS (WEEKS 1 -3) FACE TO FACE, 
TELEPHONE, TEXT OR E MAIL.    
 These appointments (weeks one, two and three post quit date) offer an opportunity to 
review the client’s usage, access smoking status, and troubleshoot any questions.    
 During this appointment period, the Tobacco Dependency Treatment Practitioner  will also 
need to issue the client with the second part of the starter kit voucher to ensure the client 
can order refill product type ‘A’ in good time and avoid any disruption in their 
programme.    
 Ideally the Tobacco Dependency Trea tment Practitioner  will release this code to the client 
8-10 days after their Quit Date Appointment – around week 1 -2 of the client’s quit 
programme. This voucher code should have already been allocated to the client and 
logged on their profile notes on MI S during the Quit Date Appointment.   
 
Please note: A client has relapsed, if the client returns a CO reading of above 10 ppm or they 
confirm that they have started smoking again at any stage. At this point, the Advisor should 
stop issuing vaping products  and ask the women  to re -engage with the service when they 
are ready to.    
 
After the initial 4 week ‘swap to stop’ scheme, follow -up vouchers under the Smokefree 
budget can be used. This will need be recorded on the voucher management system.   
 
5.0 SIXTH APPOINTMENT “OUTCOME  APPOINTMENT” (WEEK 4 ) FACE TO FACE    
5.1 STEP 1: DETERMINE NEXT STEPS   
 Following confirmation that the client has quit smoking (i.e., CO reading of below 4 ppm) 
the Tobacco Dependency Treatment Practitioner  should discuss with the client the level 
and type of support required over the remaining pregnancy. Ideally contact should be 
made 2 weekly initially then move to monthly for the reminder of the pregnancy.

6.3.1  VAPES AND OXYGEN THERAPY   
 
Vapes / electronic cigarettes include a power s ource, and this may be charged from a USB power 
port or by using a separate battery charger. These items, when saturated with oxygen may ignite. It 
has been reported that there could be a risk of an ignition of a vapes whilst a patient is undergoing 
oxygen  therapy. As a result, it is advised that clients should NOT vape whilst on oxygen 
therapy .   
  
Additionally, batteries of vapes should not be charged in the vicinity of a patient undergoing oxygen 
therapy or the oxygen source itself. When using electronic  cigarettes, the same safety principles 
should be adopted as smoking burning cigarettes.    
 
6.3.2  STORAGE   
Nicotine vape products should be managed, recorded, and stored in line with your service’s current 
guidelines for NRT products. Smoking cessation aid s should be safely stored in a locked storage 
unit and must be:
