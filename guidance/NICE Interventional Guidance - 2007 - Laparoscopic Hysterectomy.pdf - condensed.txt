Laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy are considered safe and effective, but carry a higher risk of urinary tract injury and severe bleeding compared to open surgery. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, and special training is recommended. Hysterectomy is performed for various benign conditions and cancers of the uterus and ovaries. Different laparoscopic procedures, including TLH, LSH, LAVH, and LH, are outlined. Laparoscopic techniques have been shown to reduce hospital stay and time to return to normal activities compared to open surgery. However, there is a higher incidence of major operative hemorrhage and urinary tract injuries with laparoscopic techniques. Special training is necessary to ensure safety during these procedures.
