Female Genital Mutilation and its Management
Clinicians should be aware of the short- and long-term complications of FGM. All health professionals must be aware of the legal responsibilities regarding FGM, including reporting to the police if FGM is confirmed in a girl under 18 years old. Re-infibulation is illegal, and female genital cosmetic surgery may be prohibited unless necessary for the patient's health. Health professionals should be trained in FGM management and provide sensitive care to women affected by FGM. Women with FGM should be offered psychological assessment, testing for infections, and referral to appropriate services. De-infibulation should be offered to women who may benefit from it. In pregnancy, women with FGM should be identified early and provided with appropriate care, including de-infibulation if necessary. Follow-up care after delivery should also be provided to ensure women's health and legal requirements are met.

The short- and long-term complications of FGM include haemorrhage, urinary retention, genital swelling, infection, fever, and urinary tract complications. Long-term complications include urinary tract infections, dyspareunia, bacterial vaginosis, genital scarring, and psychological effects. FGM is associated with menstrual difficulties, genital infections, infertility, HIV, and hepatitis B infection. Obstetric complications include prolonged labor, postpartum hemorrhage, perineal trauma, and an increased risk of caesarean section. Health professionals must be aware of the legal responsibilities under the Female Genital Mutilation Act and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act. Reporting and recording of FGM cases must be done in accordance with the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset.

Women with FGM should be identified in pregnancy and referred to designated consultants or midwives for care. Antenatal documentation should include FGM history, and women should be offered psychological assessment and treatment. De-infibulation may be performed antenatally or during labor. Intrapartum care for women with FGM should include consideration for de-infibulation if needed, and postnatal care should include follow-up for women who did not undergo de-infibulation due to caesarean delivery.

The discharging midwife should ensure that all legal and regulatory processes have been adhered to prior to discharge. The designated consultant obstetrician or named specialist midwife may consider a postnatal debrief with the patient and her partner, regardless of whether intrapartum procedures were undertaken or not. This represents a further opportunity to educate the family on FGM. All the appropriate legal and regulatory processes should be documented. The discharging midwife should ensure that the documentation is complete. Recommendations for future research include rates of stillbirth and neonatal death in women with FGM, interventional trials to assess the role of de-infibulation in improving pregnancy outcomes, and clinical trials to investigate the safety and effectiveness of clitoral reconstruction. Auditable topics include the proportion of women asked about FGM at booking, the proportion of healthcare professionals familiar with the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset, and the proportion of healthcare workers who have received training on FGM and its management. Useful links and support groups are provided for further information and assistance.

Reporting to social services or the police is only required if a related child is considered to be at risk. Additional management in pregnant women includes referral to designated consultant obstetrician or specialist midwife with responsibility for women with FGM. Local protocols will determine which elements of care should be undertaken by the designated midwife or obstetrician. Offer screening for hepatitis C in addition to routine screening for hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis. Manage as high obstetric risk, document maternal history of FGM in the personal child health record, and offer postnatal follow-up if de-infibulation is performed intrapartum or if planned de-infibulation did not occur because of delivery by caesarean section.
