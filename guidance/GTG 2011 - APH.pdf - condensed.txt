Antepartum Haemorrhage
Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. The most important causes of APH are placenta praevia and placental abruption, although these are not the most common. APH complicates 3â€“5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide. Up to one-fifth of very preterm babies are born in association with APH, and the known association of APH with cerebral palsy can be explained by preterm delivery. Recurrent APH is the term used when there are episodes of APH on more than one occasion. It is important to assess for signs of clinical shock when estimating blood loss, as the amount of blood lost is often underestimated. Fetal compromise or fetal demise is an important indicator of volume depletion. Women with APH should be advised to report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider and be managed in a hospital maternity unit with facilities for resuscitation and emergency operative delivery.

Clinical assessment in women presenting with APH is crucial to determine the need for urgent intervention to manage maternal or fetal compromise. Triage should include history-taking, assessment of vaginal bleeding, maternal cardiovascular status, and fetal wellbeing. Women with major haemorrhage or compromised clinical states should be stabilized first. A full history should be taken to assess pain, risk factors, fetal movements, and previous cervical smear history. Examination should be performed to assess the cause and amount of bleeding. Resuscitation should follow standard protocols, including monitoring pulse and blood pressure. Abdominal palpation and speculum examination can provide additional information. Maternal investigations, including blood tests and ultrasound scans, should be performed based on the extent of bleeding. Fetal investigations, such as CTG monitoring and ultrasound scans, are essential to assess fetal wellbeing. Hospitalization duration should be individualized based on clinical judgment. Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered in certain cases. Tocolytic therapy should not be used in major APH cases. Antenatal care should be altered following APH, with high-risk pregnancies requiring consultant-led care and serial ultrasound monitoring. Delivery should be based on maternal and fetal conditions, with immediate delivery for compromised cases.

Determining the timing and mode of birth in women with APH is crucial. Management should include maternal resuscitation and delivery of the fetus in cases of maternal or fetal compromise. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended for women in labor with active vaginal bleeding. Regional anesthesia is recommended for operative delivery unless contraindicated. Postpartum hemorrhage should be anticipated and active management of the third stage of labor is recommended. Anti-D Ig should be given to all non-sensitized RhD-negative women after any presentation with APH. Massive APH should be managed following multidisciplinary protocols. Fluid replacement and administration of blood products should follow guidelines. In cases of coagulopathy, urgent assessment and expert hematological advice should be sought. Neonates should be assessed by a senior pediatrician/neonatologist in cases of major APH. Management of extremely preterm pregnancies with APH should prioritize the mother's life. Postnatal issues in women with pregnancies complicated by APH should include thromboprophylaxis, debriefing, and clinical incident reporting. Obstetric skill drills should include the management of major APH.

teamworking and ensure prompt and efficient management in such an emergency.
Suggested audit topics: 
1. The administration of corticosteroids to women presenting with APH less than 34+6weeks of gestation.
2. Administration of anti-D Ig to non-sensitised RhD-negative women presenting with APH.
3. Percentage of women with APH referred for serial growth scans.
4. Management of the third stage of labour in women who had a major APH.
5. Appropriate training of the multidisciplinary team. 

Areas for future research:
1. Randomised controlled trials of interventions to prevent placental abruption.
2. Studies on the optimum timing of delivery in women presenting with unexplained APH.
3. Studies on transfusion of blood products in APH to determine maternal and fetal outcomes.

Initial management should follow the ABCD pathway. A high concentration of oxygen should be administered. Establish two intravenous lines and take a blood sample for diagnostic tests. Communication between the team members is crucial. Resuscitation, monitoring, and investigation are key. Delivery of the fetus and placenta is essential to control bleeding in cases of APH. Fluid replacement and blood product administration should be done according to guidelines to maintain hemoglobin, platelet count, and coagulation parameters. Clinical guidelines are developed to assist clinicians in decision-making. The ultimate judgment regarding treatment must be made by the attending doctor based on individual patient needs and available resources.
