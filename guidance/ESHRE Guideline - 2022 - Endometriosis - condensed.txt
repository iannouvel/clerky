Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus. It affects millions of women worldwide and can cause pain and infertility. Therapeutic options include hormone suppression and surgical removal of lesions. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. Significant changes in clinical practice are highlighted, including the shift away from laparoscopy as the gold standard for diagnosis.

Treatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments like combined hormonal contraceptives or progestogens, and surgical options. It is important to consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing treatments. Surgical options may include excision instead of ablation of endometriosis and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma. Referral to a centre of expertise and informed decision-making are recommended for women with deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who no longer wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.

33 Consider long-term consequences of early menopause and hormone replacement therapy when deciding on ovary removal. 
34 Total hysterectomy is preferred when performing hysterectomy. 
35 Preoperative hormone treatment is not recommended for improving surgery outcomes in women with endometriosis. 
36 Postoperative hormone treatment may be offered to improve surgery outcomes in women with endometriosis not desiring immediate pregnancy. 
37 Consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. 
39 Do not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility in infertile women with endometriosis. 
40 Postoperative hormone suppression should not be prescribed solely to enhance future pregnancy rates in women seeking pregnancy. 
41 Hormone therapy may be offered to women not immediately seeking pregnancy after surgery for pain improvement. 
42 Do not prescribe pentoxifylline or other anti-inflammatory drugs to improve natural pregnancy rates in infertile women with endometriosis. 
43 Consider operative laparoscopy for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis. 
44 Consider operative laparoscopy for endometrioma-associated infertility to increase chances of natural pregnancy. 
45 Consider operative laparoscopy for symptomatic patients wishing to conceive with deep endometriosis. 
46 Consider pain symptoms, patient age, preferences, history of previous surgery, and other infertility factors when deciding on surgery for endometriosis. 
47 Intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation may increase pregnancy rates in infertile women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis. 
48 Consider using IUI with ovarian stimulation in infertile women with rASRM stage III/IV endometriosis with tubal patency. 
49 ART can be performed for infertility associated with endometriosis, especially with compromised tubal function or male factor infertility. 
50 Offer GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols based on patient and physician preferences for ART in women with endometriosis. 
51 Reassure women with endometriosis regarding the safety of ART. 
52 Consider antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometrioma. 
53 Extended administration of GnRH agonist prior to ART is not recommended. 
54 Prolonged administration of COC/progestogens as pre-treatment to ART is not recommended. 
55 Do not routinely perform surgery prior to ART to improve live birth rates in women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis. 
56 Do not routinely perform surgery for ovarian endometrioma prior to ART to improve live birth rates. 
57 Consider surgery for endometrioma prior to ART for pain management or accessibility of follicles. 
58 Consider surgical excision of deep endometriosis lesions prior to ART based on pain symptoms and patient preference. 
59 Discuss pros and cons of fertility preservation with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. 
60 Do not advise becoming pregnant solely to treat endometriosis. 
61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma findings in pregnancy to a specialized centre. 
62 Be aware of the increased risk of first trimester miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. 
63 Be aware of rare endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy. 
64 Perform ovarian cystectomy for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain in women with endometrioma. 
65 Consider postoperative use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptive for secondary prevention of endometriosis-associated pain. 
66 Offer long-term hormone treatment after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma for secondary prevention of recurrence. 
67 Consider long-term hormone treatment for prevention of recurrence of deep endometriosis and associated symptoms. 
68 Perform ART in women with deep endometriosis as it does not seem to increase recurrence. 
69 Offer hormone treatment or surgery for recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. 
70 Take a careful history to identify possible risk factors for endometriosis in adolescents. 
71 Consider endometriosis in young women with absenteeism from school or use of oral contraceptives for dysmenorrhea. 
72 Consider specific symptoms as suggestive of endometriosis in adolescents. 
73 Discuss acceptability before performing vaginal or rectal examination in adolescents. 
74 Use transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents. 
75 Do not use serum biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. 
76 Consider laparoscopy in adolescents with suspected endometriosis and negative imaging. 
77 Consider taking biopsies during laparoscopy in adolescents to confirm diagnosis histologically. 
78 Prescribe hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line therapy

The guideline recommends continued treatment with combined estrogen-progestogen for women with a history of endometriosis after surgical menopause. Women with endometriosis who have undergone early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are at increased risk of bone density loss, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and consider surgical removal for abdominal cases. Hormone treatment may be an option when surgery is not possible. Women with asymptomatic endometriosis should not undergo surgical excision or medical treatment. Routine ultrasound monitoring can be considered. Lifestyle changes may help prevent endometriosis, and hormonal contraceptives' effectiveness for prevention is uncertain. Endometriosis is not significantly associated with an increased overall cancer risk, but there may be a higher risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancers. Women with endometriosis should be reassured about their cancer risk and encouraged to follow general cancer prevention measures.

Individuals presenting with cyclical and non-cyclical signs and symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, haematuria, shoulder tip pain, fatigue, and infertility should be considered for endometriosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and a history of ovarian cyst, irritable bowel syndrome, or pelvic inflammatory disease are also risk factors for endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may indicate the presence of endometriosis, but overall, clinical symptoms alone are weak predictors. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be considered even if the examination is normal.

The guideline recommends clinical examination for the diagnosis of endometriosis and further diagnostic steps using medical technologies. Vaginal examination may be inappropriate in certain situations and can be painful for some women. Biomarkers are not reliable for diagnosing endometriosis. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but a negative result does not rule out endometriosis. Laparoscopy may be considered if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful. It is important to confirm endometriotic lesions by histology.

The guideline recommends considering both diagnostic laparoscopy and imaging with empirical treatment for women suspected of endometriosis. Long-term monitoring may not be beneficial in preventing adverse outcomes, but follow-up and psychological support should be considered. Research is recommended for comprehensive consensus criteria for endometriosis diagnosis and long-term management approaches.

Impact of early versus late diagnosis on quality of life in endometriosis is complex and multidimensional, with early diagnosis potentially reducing pain, infertility risk, and providing relief. While no studies directly compare early and late diagnosis, qualitative studies suggest benefits of diagnosis, including feelings of relief and empowerment. The guideline recommends attempting to relieve symptoms in symptomatic women through treatment. Further research is recommended to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on quality of life in endometriosis. 

Analgesics, such as NSAIDs, may be offered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence supporting their use is limited. Hormone therapies, including combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, and antagonists, are recommended options for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. The choice of hormone treatment should consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. These treatments have been shown to lead to a clinically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo, but finding the most effective therapy may require a trial-and-error approach.

Based on clinical trials, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have shown improvements in pain associated with endometriosis. Continuous use of OCP has been suggested as an effective treatment compared to cyclic use. A systematic review found that continuous OCP use may be more effective for dysmenorrhea recurrence. Safety reviews have not shown significant differences between continuous and cyclic OCP use. Recommendations include prescribing combined hormonal contraceptives to reduce endometriosis-associated pain and offering continuous use of OCP for dysmenorrhea. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have also been found to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with continuous progestogens and gestrinone being effective therapies. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems and etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implants is recommended to reduce endometriosis-associated pain. GnRH agonists have shown effectiveness in relieving endometriosis-associated pain symptoms. Additional details are available in the full guideline.

In studies comparing different routes of administration, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches, weight gain, and acne were reported. The bone mineral density was decreased in both groups after treatment, with a significantly higher loss in the full dose group. Add-back therapy is effective in preventing bone loss when administered with GnRH agonists. A meta-analysis showed superior results with GnRH agonist + add-back therapy compared to GnRH agonist alone. It is recommended to prescribe GnRH agonists as second-line treatment due to their side-effect profile. Clinicians should consider prescribing combined hormonal add-back therapy to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors are effective in reducing endometriosis-associated pain and can be prescribed in combination with other treatments.

Surgical treatment for endometriosis involves laparoscopy to eliminate lesions and adhesions. Excision, diathermy, or ablation/vaporisation may be used. Surgery aims to improve pain control and restore pelvic anatomy. Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to be more effective than diagnostic laparoscopy in reducing overall pain at 6 and 12 months. Surgery also improves quality of life and sexual satisfaction. Laparoscopic excision is superior to ablation in reducing pain symptoms. Excision is recommended over ablation to reduce endometriosis-associated pain. Research is needed to determine the impact of surgery on different subtypes of endometriosis. Studies on superficial peritoneal endometriosis are lacking, and more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment for this condition.

Surgical intervention for endometriosis, including nerve pathway interruption and ovarian endometrioma treatment, has been studied in various RCTs and systematic reviews. While laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) did not show additional benefit, presacral neurectomy (PSN) was found to be beneficial in reducing dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain. However, PSN is associated with increased risks. For ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy is recommended over drainage and coagulation due to lower recurrence rates of pain and endometrioma. Various surgical techniques for deep endometriosis involving the bowel have been studied, with segmental bowel resection being a widely accepted option for pain relief. Studies have shown significant improvement in health-related quality of life after surgery for deep endometriosis. Further research is needed to standardize reporting and compare different surgical techniques.

Studies have shown that surgical removal of deep endometriosis can reduce associated pain and improve quality of life. Referral to a center of expertise is recommended for women with deep endometriosis undergoing surgery. Patients should be informed of the potential risks, benefits, and long-term effects of surgery. Complications of surgery for bowel endometriosis can occur, with a preference for a laparoscopic approach for better outcomes. Segmental resection is recommended for lesions on the sigmoid colon, while a more tailored approach can be chosen for deep endometriosis involving the rectum. Surgery for deep endometriosis has been shown to improve pain and quality of life, but careful consideration of the surgical approach is necessary.

Surgery for colorectal endometriosis can lead to recurrence rates of 5-25%. Excision of uterosacral ligament and vaginal endometriosis has shown improvements in pain scores and symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder and ureteral endometriosis is associated with significant improvement in pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy can reduce the risk of urinary retention. Hysterectomy may be effective for relieving symptoms but does not guarantee a cure. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic factors for better outcomes. Further research is needed in this area.

Condensed Version:
Surgical treatment of endometriosis has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients. Different surgical techniques, such as excision and ablation, have been compared in various studies. Complications and recurrence rates after surgery have also been investigated. Overall, surgical management of endometriosis has been found to be effective in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients.

Clinical outcomes after surgical treatment of endometriosis with colorectal involvement. Long-term quality of life and pain relief are important considerations. Studies have shown varying results in different surgical techniques. Further research is needed to determine the most effective approach for treating endometriosis.

The guideline discusses the effectiveness of medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy for endometriosis. Preoperative hormonal treatment is not recommended to improve immediate surgical outcomes, while postoperative hormonal treatment may be offered to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain if pregnancy is not desired. Clinicians are advised to consider individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability when choosing between hormone and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain. Non-medical management strategies, such as acupuncture, have shown limited evidence of effectiveness for relieving symptoms associated with endometriosis. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these strategies.

A study comparing acupuncture for endometriosis pain found that verum acupuncture was more effective than 'sham' acupuncture. Japanese acupuncture was also found to be effective. However, overall evidence on acupuncture for endometriosis is limited. Physiotherapy, massage, and trigger point release therapy may be beneficial, but evidence is lacking. Exercise may help reduce menstrual pain, but more research is needed. Electrotherapy and psychological interventions have shown some promise, but more studies are needed to make recommendations for endometriosis treatment.

Participants included up to 5 years after laparoscopic diagnosis, majority post-treatment condition as "recovered" with no current symptoms collected, limiting efficacy significance. No recommendations for psychological approaches in endometriosis. Limited studies on dietary interventions for endometriosis symptoms, inconclusive findings on omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy not well studied. Women with endometriosis may change diets to alleviate symptoms. Professional nutritionist intervention may help reduce disease burden. Some women reported decreased symptoms with dietary changes. No recommendations for Chinese Medicine to improve quality of life or reduce pain in endometriosis. Potential benefits of fish oils suggested. No specific non-medical intervention recommended for endometriosis pain or quality of life improvement. Research needed for non-medical interventions in endometriosis. Recommendations for discussing non-medical strategies for quality of life and psychological well-being in endometriosis. Importance of multidisciplinary approach to pain management in endometriosis. Recommendation for further research into non-medical interventions for endometriosis.

Women with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis associated pain, infertility, or both. For clarity, the guideline discusses the evidence on pain as the outcome in one chapter and infertility as an outcome in another. 

In terms of medical treatment for endometriosis-associated infertility, ovarian suppression therapy has been found to be ineffective in improving fertility. Therefore, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility in infertile women with endometriosis. 

Additionally, the use of hormone or medical therapies as an adjunct to surgical therapy for endometriosis-associated infertility is uncertain in its effectiveness. While postsurgical medical therapy may increase pregnancy rates compared to surgery alone, it should not be prescribed solely to enhance future pregnancy rates. It may be offered for pain management or to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women who cannot attempt to conceive immediately after surgery. 

Other medical treatments, such as anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors, have shown uncertain effects on clinical pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of these treatments for improving fertility in women with endometriosis.

In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of pentoxifylline, letrozole, or GnRH agonist to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase their chance of natural pregnancy. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for DE improves fertility, operative laparoscopy may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by the presence or absence of pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated EFI. Research is recommended to evaluate the value of surgery for ovarian and deep endometriosis and its effect on natural pregnancy rates. Before and after surgery for endometriosis, individuals who wish to become pregnant should be objectively counseled on their chances of achieving a pregnancy using the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI).

The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated and reproducible tool that can be used to counsel patients on their postoperative non-ART pregnancy rates. It can help reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide joint physician-patient decision-making between surgery, ART, or other fertility management options for individualized treatment of women with endometriosis-related infertility. Women should be informed of their chances of becoming pregnant after surgery and the EFI should be used to identify patients who may benefit from ART after surgery. Studies should further investigate the use of the EFI for patient phenotyping in surgical treatment and the role of medically assisted reproduction in endometriosis-related infertility. In infertile women with rASRM stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may consider performing intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation to increase pregnancy rates. The benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI in patients with moderate to severe endometriosis is unclear and further research is needed. In women with endometriosis, the impact of endometrioma on ART outcomes varies, with lower oocyte numbers but similar pregnancy and live birth rates compared to controls. Studies on the type of ovarian stimulation protocol in women with endometriosis have shown no significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates.

In women with endometriosis, ART can be performed for infertility, with no difference in pregnancy or live birth rates between GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols. ART does not increase endometriosis recurrence rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis at oocyte retrieval for endometriomas is recommended. Overall, endometriosis does not negatively impact live birth rates after ART. Further research is needed on medical therapies as an adjunct to ART for endometriosis-associated infertility. GnRH agonist pre-treatment before ART does not significantly improve live birth rates. There is insufficient evidence to recommend COC/progestogens as pre-treatment before ART.

Surgical therapies as an adjunct to MAR for endometriosis-associated infertility may be effective. Surgery for peritoneal endometriosis prior to MAR has shown higher implantation, pregnancy, and live birth rates. However, surgery for ovarian endometrioma before ART does not improve live birth rates and may negatively impact ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be based on pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain. Further research is needed to determine the impact of surgery on reproductive outcomes.

In symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis, surgical removal of the lesions may be considered. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery, and complication rates are discussed in further detail in section II.3.f. Non-medical treatment strategies for infertility associated with endometriosis do not show clear evidence of benefit. Fertility preservation should be discussed with women with severe endometriosis, although the true benefit remains unknown. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes is still unclear.

Endometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show variable changes, with some lesions decidualizing while others may atrophy, fibrose, or necrose. Decidualization of endometriomas can mimic malignant ovarian tumors, necessitating careful monitoring and management. Pregnancy does not always benefit women with endometriosis, so periodic evaluations and medical treatment should not be discontinued after childbirth. There may be complications during pregnancy from pre-existing endometriosis lesions, such as infected, enlarged, or ruptured endometriomas, which may require surgical intervention. 

Endometriosis can impact early pregnancy, with a possible association with miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of these complications in women with endometriosis. Studies on the evolution of early pregnancy in women with endometriosis are needed for more precise understanding. 

Endometriosis may also affect second and third trimester pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, potentially leading to complications like gestational diabetes, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and placenta previa. The association between endometriosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes is still under investigation, with conflicting results in the literature. Vigilance and further research are needed to better understand the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy.

Women with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth, Caesarean section, and babies small for gestational age. However, the association between endometriosis and obstetric hemorrhages is inconclusive. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, but currently, they do not warrant increased antenatal monitoring. Research is needed to better define obstetric risks for women with endometriosis. In terms of preventing recurrence of endometriosis, ovarian cystectomy is recommended over drainage and electrocoagulation for women with endometrioma.

Cystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation in women with ovarian endometrioma for preventing recurrence of endometriosis-associated pain and endometrioma. Hormone treatment after surgery can help prevent disease recurrence, with options like oral contraceptives and progestogens. For deep endometriosis, long-term hormone treatment can be considered to prevent recurrence of symptoms. ART does not increase the risk of endometriosis recurrence and can be performed in women with deep endometriosis. Postoperative therapy with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or combined hormonal contraceptives is recommended for the prevention of endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea. Consideration should be given to patient preferences, costs, risks, and side effects when choosing a treatment.

IV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis:
Medical treatment for recurrent endometriosis after surgery has been described in few RCTs and uncontrolled observational studies. Different treatments have shown efficacy in reducing symptoms, such as dienogest, depot leuprolide acetate, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, and nafarelin. Surgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis is less studied, with limited evidence on efficacy and safety. Any hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis.

V. Endometriosis and adolescence:
Diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents can be complex, with a delay in diagnosis compared to adults. Risk factors for adolescent endometriosis include a positive family history, genital malformations, early menarche, and short menstrual cycles. Clinicians should take a careful history to identify possible risk factors for endometriosis in adolescents.

In adolescents, diagnosis of endometriosis is often based on pain symptoms only, which may have a more varied presentation compared to adults. Symptoms such as chronic or acyclical pelvic pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dysuria, and dyspareunia should raise suspicion for endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is recommended for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents, with alternatives available based on individual factors. Serum biomarkers like CA-125 are not recommended for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. Diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered if imaging and medical treatments are unsuccessful. Histological confirmation of endometriosis through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended, as negative histology does not rule out the disease entirely.

Adolescents with endometriosis-related pain can be effectively treated with hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line therapy. NSAIDs can be considered as an additional treatment option. GnRH agonists can be used as a second-line treatment with caution due to potential side effects on bone mineral density. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be considered for symptom management, but recurrence rates can be high without hormone treatment post-surgery. Laparoscopic surgery by an experienced surgeon is recommended for adolescents with endometriosis. Studies have shown that a combination of GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery can be effective in preventing recurrence in adolescents.

There is limited data on the prevalence of endometriosis after menopause, estimated to be around 2-5%. Endometriosis can still be active and symptomatic after menopause. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility. Surgical treatment is recommended as the first-line treatment for endometriosis in postmenopausal women.

2007, Pavone and Bulun, 2012, Polyzos, et al., 2011). Limited options for medical treatment in postmenopausal women include analgesics or aromatase inhibitors. Surgical treatment for endometriosis in postmenopausal women has shown effectiveness in reducing pain, with some cases of malignancy found. Consideration of malignancy risk is important and may require further imaging studies or surgical exploration. Aromatase inhibitors are suggested as a medical alternative to surgery for postmenopausal endometriosis. More evidence is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors in this population. Hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms in women with endometriosis is not well studied, with limited evidence on recurrence of endometriosis with MHT. Recommendations suggest considering continuous combined estrogen-progestogen or tibolone regimes over unopposed estrogen in women requiring MHT. Tibolone could be a safe alternative for combined MHT in postmenopausal women with endometriosis.

Abdominal wall endometriosis is associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed through imaging such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome is diagnosed based on symptoms with a cyclical pattern.

Catamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. Pneumothorax is mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in cases of catamenial pneumothorax. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain, with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, while hormone treatment may also be an option. For thoracic endometriosis, hormone treatment can be offered, with surgery performed in a multidisciplinary manner.

Women with incidental findings of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment unless there is evidence of disease progression. Surgical treatment is not recommended due to associated risks, and medical treatment is not advised. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about incidental findings of endometriosis.

Long-term monitoring for asymptomatic endometriosis may be considered to prevent disease progression and adverse outcomes. Routine ultrasound monitoring can be beneficial, but the frequency and duration of monitoring are unclear. Women can be advised to seek medical help if symptoms develop.

Primary prevention of endometriosis focuses on lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet, reduced alcohol intake, and regular physical activity. The use of hormonal contraceptives for prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk is not recommended outside of a research setting. Further research is needed to understand the genetic background of endometriosis and develop validated tests for diagnosis and prevention.

Endometriosis shares features with cancer but is not significantly associated with a higher overall cancer risk. However, it is linked to a slightly increased risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer. Clinicians should inform patients that the absolute risk increase for these cancers is low. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with long-term oral contraceptive use potentially reducing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer but increasing the risk of breast and cervical cancer. Patients should be reassured that their cancer risk is generally low and advised on general cancer prevention measures. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between endometriosis and cancer, including the impact of somatic mutations and hormone treatments.

Women with endometriosis should not be systematically screened for cancer beyond existing guidelines, but individual patients with additional risk factors may be considered for screening. The small increase in ovarian cancer risk does not warrant regular screening, as it has not been shown to reduce mortality and can lead to unnecessary harm. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is not recommended for women with endometriosis without additional risk factors. Further research is needed on the malignant transformation of endometriosis to guide monitoring practices.

Some authors advocate earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete disease removal to reduce future ovarian cancer risk. Others challenge this position, stating that preventative surgery may not significantly reduce future risk. Studies have shown that unilateral oophorectomy or extirpation of all visible endometriosis at surgery can dramatically reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Other types of surgical treatment were not significantly associated with the risk of ovarian cancer. It is important for clinicians to weigh the potential benefits of complete excision of visible endometriosis against the risks of surgery.

The guideline "Endometriosis" was developed using the GRADE approach to label recommendations as either 'strong' or 'weak'. Good practice points are based on the expertise of the guideline group. After finalizing the draft, a review process was initiated, and the guideline was open for review between June and August 2021. The standard dissemination procedure includes publishing on the ESHRE website and in Human Reproduction. Patient versions of the guideline will be developed to aid in clinical decision-making. The guideline will be considered for revision in 2025, with an intermediate search for new evidence two years after publication. Corrections will be published on the web version if needed. The guideline includes flowcharts for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, as well as recommendations for pain, infertility, and pregnancy related to endometriosis. Stakeholder review was conducted, and the full report is available separately.
