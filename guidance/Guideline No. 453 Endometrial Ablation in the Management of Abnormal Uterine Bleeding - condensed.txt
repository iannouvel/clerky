Endometrial ablation is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgical procedure that has become a well-established alternative to medical treatment or hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding in select cases. Medical preparation to thin the endometrium can facilitate resectoscopic endometrial ablation. Both resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic techniques have comparable results in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding. Endometrial ablation procedures do not increase the risk of cancer and may decrease the overall risk of endometrial cancer. Preoperative assessment should be comprehensive, and patients should be counselled about effective contraception following the procedure. Strict protocols for fluid monitoring and management should be followed during resectoscopic endometrial ablation. In cases of uterine perforation, immediate discontinuation of the procedure and close monitoring are necessary. Repeat endometrial ablation should be performed by a skilled hysteroscopic surgeon. Endometrial ablation may be considered in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding related to adenomyosis. Concomitant insertion of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system may improve outcomes. Residency training programs should continue to teach hysteroscopic skills. Persistent abnormal uterine bleeding or uterine pain following endometrial ablation warrants thorough investigation.

Endometrial ablation is a beneficial treatment option for women with abnormal uterine bleeding, providing an alternative to major procedures like hysterectomy. It can be considered in cases of medical therapy intolerance or patient preference. Endometrial ablation is comparable to a levonorgestrel intrauterine system in terms of outcomes, and hysterectomy may offer improved pain control and reduced bleeding but comes with higher risks and longer hospital stays. Preoperative care involves endometrial thinning to improve visualization, and postoperative care includes monitoring for complications. Resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic techniques are available, with advantages and disadvantages to each. Resectoscopic ablation allows for accurate assessment and treatment of uterine pathology but is skill-dependent and has a higher complication rate. Careful fluid management is crucial during endometrial resection to prevent complications like fluid overload and hyponatremia.

Problems post procedure can include hematometrium, pyometrium, and endometritis. More severe complications are rare but may include injury to nearby pelvic structures. Procedural complications like severe pain, bleeding, uterine perforation, and infection may require emergent surgical management. The FDA reports complications such as bowel injury, urinary tract injuries, immediate hysterectomy, gas embolism, necrotizing fasciitis, and death. Long-term recurrent AUB after endometrial ablation may be caused by various conditions and may require further investigation. Serious complications of endometrial ablation include uterine perforation, perioperative hemorrhage, and pelvic infections. Hematometra, post-ablation tubal sterilization syndrome, and complications specific to resectoscopic ablation are also possible. Repeat ablation may be considered in cases of treatment failure, and caution is advised in patients with a history of cesarean delivery or adenomyosis. Intracavitary pathology like fibroids and polyps may impact the success of non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation.

Endometrial ablation is an effective procedure for managing abnormal uterine bleeding, providing a viable alternative to hysterectomy. Cavity assessment and endometrial sampling before the procedure are crucial. Resectoscopic techniques should be a part of residency training programs. Concerns about endometrial ablation causing delayed diagnosis of endometrial cancer are unfounded, and it may even reduce the risk of developing cancer. Pregnancy after endometrial ablation can be complicated, and preoperative discussion on contraception is essential. Adenomyosis is not a contraindication to endometrial ablation, but failure rates may be higher. Combined medical therapy and endometrial ablation may improve success rates. Further research is needed on combined medical therapy and endometrial ablation.

Clinical Guideline: Management of Hypertension in Adults

Hypertension is a common condition that can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. It is important to regularly monitor blood pressure levels and make lifestyle changes to help manage hypertension. In some cases, medication may be necessary to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet low in sodium, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol intake, and quitting smoking can all help to lower blood pressure. It is important for healthcare providers to work with patients to develop a personalized treatment plan that takes into account their individual risk factors and preferences. Regular follow-up appointments are essential to monitor blood pressure levels and adjust treatment as needed.
