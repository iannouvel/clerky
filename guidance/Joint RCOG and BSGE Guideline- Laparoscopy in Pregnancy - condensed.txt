The guideline focuses on laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. It highlights the importance of experienced laparoscopists performing these procedures to ensure maternal and fetal safety. Laparoscopy is considered a safe surgical approach compared to open surgery, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes for the mother or fetus. Studies have shown better maternal outcomes and fewer complications with laparoscopic surgery for these conditions in pregnancy.

Laparoscopic appendicectomy in pregnancy has been associated with a higher risk of spontaneous miscarriage compared to open appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is more common in the first trimester, potentially leading to a spurious association with fetal loss. However, laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy has benefits such as faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower wound infection rates. It is important to consider the risks of vascular and organ trauma, including uterine perforation, with laparoscopic surgery. Anaesthetic risks should be carefully managed, with early involvement of an obstetric anaesthetist and consideration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is generally recommended for laparoscopy in pregnancy. Uterine displacement and monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being are crucial during surgery.

Pregnant women may experience complications related to high neuraxial sensory block level or steep positioning during laparoscopic surgery for non-obstetric conditions. Recent studies show good outcomes for laparoscopic surgeries up to 34 weeks gestation, extending the historical recommendation to limit surgery to the second trimester. A multidisciplinary team should be involved in the care of these women. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed by experienced surgeons, and both laparoscopic and open routes are acceptable depending on the circumstances. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally satisfactory in both approaches. Intraoperative monitoring may be required in selected cases, and antenatal corticosteroids may be used for fetal lung maturation if there is a risk of preterm delivery. Routine tocolysis is not recommended. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed in settings with adequate expertise and monitoring facilities. Placement of surgical ports should be carefully planned based on uterine size and pathology. The Hasson technique may be beneficial in reducing the risk of uterine trauma. Secondary port placement should be considered on the same side as the pathology to avoid instrumenting across the pregnant uterus.

Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg and operating pressures of 12 mmHg are recommended for laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Both 5 and 10 mm diameter laparoscopes can be used, with benefits to each. The choice of laparoscope degree depends on surgeon preference. Ultrasound, bipolar, and monopolar energy sources are safe to use during laparoscopy in pregnancy. The choice of extraction method for surgical specimens should be based on surgeon preference. Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process. In suspected appendicitis in pregnancy, timely surgical intervention is preferable to expectant management.

Should the laparoscopic approach to appendicectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? There is controversy surrounding the association of laparoscopic appendicectomy and miscarriage, requiring further research. It is not possible to recommend one approach over the other at this time.

Is there a role for expectant management of cholecystitis in pregnancy? Conservative management of gallbladder disease in pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity than surgery. Complicated cases require a more proactive approach.

Should the laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with better maternal and fetal outcomes, fewer complications, and a shorter hospital stay.

Should surgery for ovarian cysts be preferred over the conservative approach in pregnancy? Asymptomatic simple cysts may be managed conservatively, while large symptomatic cysts may be aspirated under ultrasound guidance. The risk of torsion requiring emergency surgery is low.

Should the laparoscopic approach to ovarian cysts be preferred over the open approach in pregnancy? Laparoscopic cystectomy is associated with better maternal outcomes in the second trimester, with good fetal outcomes. More research is needed to determine the superiority of one approach over the other.

Adnexal masses in pregnancy can be safely managed laparoscopically, especially for appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and symptomatic adnexal cysts. Adequately trained laparoscopists should perform these procedures with proper peri-operative preparations. More high-grade evidence is needed, and the creation of national large databases may be beneficial.
