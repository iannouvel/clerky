Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage
This is the second edition of this guideline, which was published in 2009 under the same title. The 2009 guideline
was based on an earlier guideline on the management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) developed in 1998 under
the auspices of the Scottish Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and
updated in 2002.
Executive summary of recommendations
Prediction and prevention of PPH
What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised?
Risk factors
Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modified as
and when risk factors arise.

Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a blood
bank on site.

Minimising risk - treating antenatal anaemia
Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the
morbidity associated with PPH. [New 2016]

For women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally, oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscular
injection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose of
oxytocin is unlikely to be beneficial.
A
For women delivering by caesarean section, oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should
be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss.
B
Ergometrine-oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk
of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500-1000 ml).
C
For women at increased risk of haemorrhage, it is possible that a combination of preventative
measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. [New 2016]
Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5-1.0 g), in addition to oxytocin,
at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. [New 2016]

Identification of the severity of haemorrhage
Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and
that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH. [New 2016]
C
Communication and multidisciplinary care
Communication with the woman
Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important, and clear information of
what is happening should be given from the outset. [New 2016]
Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH?
Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH. [New 2016]
The midwife in charge and the first-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when
women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500-1000 ml) without clinical shock.
✓
A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to
women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock.

commence warmed crystalloid infusion.
Measures for major PPH
Full protocol for major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and continuing to bleed or
clinical shock (see Appendix III):
•
A and B - assess airway and breathing
C
evaluate circulation
• position the patient flat
• keep the woman warm using appropriate available measures
•
transfuse blood as soon as possible, if clinically required
until blood is available, infuse up to 3.5 I of warmed clear fluids, initially 21 of warmed
isotonic crystalloid. Further fluid resuscitation can continue with additional isotonic
crystalloid or colloid (succinylated gelatin). Hydroxyethyl starch should not be used.
the best equipment available should be used to achieve rapid warmed infusion of fluids
● special blood filters should not be used, as they slow infusions.
Blood transfusion
There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood
transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. [New 2016]
Selection of red cell units for transfusion
Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with
immediate issue of group O, rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units, with a switch to
group-specific blood as soon as feasible. [New 2016]
D
If clinically significant red cell antibodies are present, close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is
essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage. [New 2016]
D
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52
e109 of e149 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
All delivery units, especially small units without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supply
of group O, RhD-negative blood. [New 2016]
Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with
caesarean section and with vaginal delivery. [New 2016]
Blood components
D
Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing, then, after 4 units of red
blood cells, FFP should be infused at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are
known. [New 2016]
D
If no haemostatic tests are available, early FFP should be considered for conditions with a
suspected coagulopathy, such as placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism, or where
detection of PPH has been delayed. [New 2016]
✓
If prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time is more than 1.5 times normal and
haemorrhage is ongoing, volumes of FFP in excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to
correct coagulopathy. [New 2016]
Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need
for them is anticipated, as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need for
thawing. [New 2016]
Fibrinogen
A plasma fibrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH.

C
Cryoprecipitate should be used for fibrinogen replacement. [New 2016]
D
Transfusion of platelets
During PPH, platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 x 109/1
based on laboratory monitoring. [New 2016]

Is there a role for antifibrinolytic drugs?
Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.

Is there a role for recombinant factor Vila (rFVIIa) therapy?
The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part
of a clinical trial. [New 2016]
Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and how should women be
monitored?
Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml)
and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock:
• immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for:
-
-
cross-match (4 units minimum)
full blood count
coagulation screen, including fibrinogen
renal and liver function for baseline
monitor temperature every 15 minutes
continuous pulse, blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter,
electrocardiogram and automated blood pressure recording)
• Foley catheter to monitor urine output
•
two peripheral cannulae, 14 gauge
consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion)
consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring at
high dependency unit on delivery suite, if appropriate
• recording of parameters on a modified early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart (see
Appendix IV)
• acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed
documentation of fluid balance, blood, blood products and procedures.
What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH?

The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial
role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and, if necessary, in determining and administering
the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. [New 2016]
D
What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding?
Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological, mechanical and surgical
methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor. [New 2016]
D
What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used?
When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding, then a sequence of mechanical
and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52
e111 of e149 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
What surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding?
If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, surgical interventions should be
initiated sooner rather than later.
D
Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate first-line 'surgical' intervention for most
women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage.
C
Conservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line, depending on clinical
circumstances and available expertise.
C
It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre.
Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta or
uterine rupture).
C
Ideally and when feasible, a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for
hysterectomy.
How should secondary PPH be managed?
In women presenting with secondary PPH, an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be
performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy
should be initiated when endometritis is suspected. [New 2016]
D
A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception,
although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable. [New 2016]
C
Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an
experienced clinician.

Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the most common form of major obstetric haemorrhage. The traditional
definition of primary PPH is the loss of 500 ml or more of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birth
of a baby.² PPH can be minor (500-1000 ml) or major (more than 1000 ml). Major can be further subdivided into
moderate (1001-2000 ml) and severe (more than 2000 ml). In women with lower body mass (e.g. less than 60 kg), a
lower level of blood loss may be clinically significant.³ The recommendations in this guideline apply to women
experiencing a primary PPH of 500 ml or more.
Secondary PPH is defined as abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks
postnatally. This guideline also includes recommendations specific to the management of secondary PPH.
Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH;
this guideline does not include specific recommendations for the management of such situations or for managing
haemorrhage in women who refuse blood transfusion. Guidance on these topics is available from other sources.
5-8
This guideline has been developed primarily for clinicians working in consultant-led obstetric units in the UK;
recommendations may be less appropriate for other settings where facilities, resources and routine practices differ.
There is increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units. Obstetricians and
midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community,
including PPH. This is beyond the scope of this guideline.'
||
10
This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH; the management of antepartum haemorrhage is the
subject of the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 63. The prevention and management of PPH related to placenta
praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in Green-top Guideline No. 27, 12 while Green-top Guideline No. 4713
provides guidance on the appropriate use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice.
2.
Introduction and background epidemiology
Obstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and developing
countries. The 2011-13 Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report³ identified 13 direct deaths
due to obstetric haemorrhage in the UK and Ireland; the report places obstetric haemorrhage as the second leading
cause of direct maternal deaths. The recommendations from the report focus on basic clinical skills, with prompt
recognition of the severity of a haemorrhage and emphasise communication and teamwork in the management of
these cases. A systematic review 14 suggests that there may be regional variation in the prevalence of PPH.
Standardisation of the measurement of PPH is recommended so that data from different regions are comparable. 15

Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant
randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published
between 2007 and September 2015. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
terms, including all subheadings, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included 'postpartum
h(a)emorrhage', ‘factor VII', ‘Syntocinon', ‘carbetocin', ‘carboprost', ‘oxytocics', ‘uterotonics', ‘B-lynch suture’, ‘uterine
artery embolism', ‘bilateral internal iliac ligation', '‘balloon, Rusch', 'Sengstaken catheters', 'thromboelastography',
'thromboelastometry', 'fibrinogen concentrate', 'point of care testing' and the search limited to humans and the English
language. The National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant
guidelines and reviews. Guidelines and recommendations produced by organisations such as the British Committee for
Standards in Haematology Transfusion Taskforce and national bodies were considered.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence and the areas where evidence is lacking are
annotated as 'good practice points'. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of
recommendations may be found in Appendix I.

D
A number of case-control studies have identified antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for PPH (see
Appendix II), 16-26 although most cases of PPH have no identifiable risk factors.27 These risk factors have
been summarised in a 2010 review. 28 Despite methodological limitations, these studies provide a guide to
levels of risk, which can help clinicians in their discussions with women about setting for delivery (Table 1).
The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health 29 has recommended that women with known risk
factors for PPH should not be delivered in a hospital without a blood bank on site.
Evidence
level 4
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has published a guideline on the prevention
and management of PPH.30 This summarises the causes of PPH as related to abnormalities of one or more
of four basic processes 'the four Ts': tone, trauma, tissue and thrombin. The most common cause of
PPH is uterine atony.27

Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the
morbidity associated with PPH.
Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 32 recommend that pregnant
women should be offered screening for anaemia. The British Committee for Standards in Haematology³³
has produced guidelines on the investigation and management of anaemia in pregnancy. Haemoglobin (Hb)
levels outside the normal UK range for pregnancy (110 g/l at first contact and 105 g/l at 28 weeks) should
be investigated and iron supplementation considered if indicated. It is recommended that parenteral iron
therapy should be considered antenatally for women with iron deficiency anaemia who do not respond to
oral iron.

Uterine massage
A Cochrane review 35 analysed the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth, and before or after delivery
level |+
of the placenta, or both, to prevent PPH. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and the Evidence
review found no significant difference between groups.
Management of the third stage of labour
35-38
Various Cochrane reviews have addressed prophylaxis in the third stage of labour for women delivering
vaginally. These have established that both active management and the use of prophylactic uterotonics
in the third stage of labour reduce the risk of PPH. Active management of the third stage of labour
involves the use of interventions (including the use of uterotonics, early clamping of the umbilical cord and
controlled cord traction) to expedite delivery of the placenta with the aim of reducing blood loss. In Evidence
expectant management, signs of placental separation are awaited and the placenta is delivered level 1++
spontaneously. A Cochrane systematic review 39 found that, for women at mixed levels of risk of bleeding,
active management showed a reduction in the average risk of maternal primary haemorrhage at time of
birth (more than 1000 ml; average risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.14–0.87) and maternal Hb less than 90 g/l
following birth (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30–0.83).

However, active management results in a lower birthweight, reflecting a lower blood volume from early |
cord clamping. 39 A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials 40 found that delaying clamping
for at least 2 minutes is beneficial to the newborn and that the benefits extend into infancy. Therefore,
active management of the third stage that includes routine early clamping of the umbilical cord can no Evidence
longer be recommended. A detailed consideration of the literature relating to the timing of cord clamping level 1+
can be found in RCOG Scientific Impact Paper No. 14.41 Guidance from NICE⁹ recommends that the
umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than I minute from delivery of the baby if there are no
concerns over cord integrity or the baby's wellbeing.
Oxytocin and ergometrine-oxytocin
36
Ⓡ
McDonald and colleagues' meta-analysis³6 addressed prophylactic ergometrine—oxytocin versus oxytocin for the
third stage of labour. This review indicated that ergometrine-oxytocin (Syntometrine®, Alliance, Chippenham,
Wiltshire, UK), oxytocin 5 iu and oxytocin 10 iu have similar efficacy in preventing PPH in excess of 1000 ml.
Using the definition of PPH as blood loss of at least 500 ml, ergometrine-oxytocin was associated with a small
reduction in the risk of PPH (Syntometrine" versus oxytocin any dose; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95).
There were major differences between ergometrine-oxytocin and oxytocin alone in the adverse effects of
nausea and vomiting, and elevation of blood pressure, with ergometrine oxytocin carrying a five-fold increased
risk (OR 4.92, 95% CI 4.03–6.00). Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of minor PPH needs to be
weighed against the adverse effects associated with the use of ergometrine oxytocin.
An RCT,42 using a primary outcome of any treatment of uterine atony or haemorrhage, assessed whether or

not a higher dose of oxytocin after vaginal delivery was more effective than a low-dose regimen in preventing Evidence
PPH after a vaginal delivery. Compared with 10 iu, administering 40 iu or 80 iu of prophylactic oxytocin did level 1+
not reduce overall PPH treatment when given in 500 ml over I hour for vaginal delivery.
Prostaglandins
37,38
The use of prostaglandins for the prevention of PPH has been the subject of two Cochrane reviews.
Neither intramuscular prostaglandins (such as carboprost, a 15-methyl prostaglandin F2α analogue) nor
misoprostol (a prostaglandin E, analogue given orally or sublingually) were preferable to conventional
injectable uterotonics (oxytocin and/or ergometrine) for routine prophylaxis.³ Furthermore, another
systematic review 43 concluded that oxytocin is superior to misoprostol in the prevention of PPH.
37
Appraisal of the evidence from both the Cochrane reviews, together with consideration of standard practice
in the UK, suggests that, for women delivering vaginally, oxytocin 10 iu by intramuscular injection is the
regimen of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. Intramuscular oxytocin should be administered
with the birth of the anterior shoulder, or immediately after the birth of the baby and before the cord is
clamped and cut. This strategy has been endorsed in the NICE intrapartum care guideline.⁹

Carbetocin
Evidence
A Cochrane review 44 has addressed the use of a longer-acting oxytocin derivative, carbetocin, in the
prevention of PPH. Carbetocin is licensed in the UK specifically for the indication of prevention of PPH in
the context of caesarean delivery. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the
need for further uterotonics compared with oxytocin for those undergoing a caesarean, but not for vaginal level 1++
delivery. However, there were no statistically significant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin in
terms of risk of PPH.

Guidelines from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend that carbetocin
(100 micrograms given as an intravenous bolus over I minute) should be used for the prevention of PPH in
elective caesarean deliveries. Randomised trials have compared different uterotonics (oxytocin,
ergometrine-oxytocin, misoprostol, carbetocin and 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a) for prophylaxis in women
delivering by caesarean section. Appraisal of the evidence from these trials, together with consideration of
standard practice in the UK, led the development group for the NICE caesarean section guideline 5 to
recommend oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection for prophylaxis in the context of caesarean delivery.
Tranexamic acid
52
The use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH in women considered to be at low risk of PPH was
addressed in a Cochrane review. This found that blood loss greater than 400 or 500 ml was less
common in women who received tranexamic acid in addition to the usual uterotonic agent after vaginal
birth or caesarean section in a dosage of 1 or 0.5 g intravenously. Tranexamic acid was effective in
decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 ml in women who had undergone caesarean
section (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.78; four studies; 1534 women), but not vaginal birth. Mean blood loss
until 2 hours postpartum was lower in the group of women who received intravenous tranexamic acid
postpartum (mean difference -77.79 ml; 95% CI -97.95 to -57.64; five studies; 1186 women). The
authors of the Cochrane review on the use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH conclude that
further studies are required to investigate the risk of serious adverse effects, including thromboembolic
events, and the use of tranexamic acid in women considered to be at high risk of PPH (see section 5.3.6).

Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and
that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH.

Clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolaemia should be included in the assessment of PPH. However,
clinicians should be aware that the physiological increase in circulating blood volume during pregnancy
means that the signs of hypovolaemic shock become less sensitive in pregnancy.60 In pregnancy, pulse and
blood pressure are usually maintained in the normal range until blood loss exceeds 1000 ml; tachycardia,
tachypnoea and a slight recordable fall in systolic blood pressure occur with blood loss of 1000-1500 ml.
A systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg, associated with worsening tachycardia, tachypnoea and altered
mental state, usually indicates a PPH in excess of 1500 ml.61

In nonpregnant patients, the shock index, calculated from the heart rate/systolic blood pressure, has been
employed as an early marker of haemodynamic compromise. 61 A retrospective cohort study 62 concluded Evidence
that the shock index identifies women at risk of adverse outcomes secondary to PPH (e.g. admission to an level 2-
intensive care unit) and compares favourably with conventional vital signs.
The 2009-12 Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report³ highlighted the importance

of correlating clinical signs and symptoms expected from different blood loss values to help target decisions Evidence
on resuscitation, and also emphasised the importance of taking the woman's weight into account. It is of note
that the severity of haemorrhage was not recognised in 11 of the 17 (61%) women who died.

5.2.1
Communication and multidisciplinary care
Communication with the woman
Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important, and clear information of
what is happening should be given from the outset.
PPH often occurs unexpectedly and can be very stressful for the woman and her partner or birth attendants; it is
crucial that, where feasible, they are kept informed and reassured, if appropriate, of the clinical development and
proposed management.
5.2.2 Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH?
Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH.
The midwife in charge and the first-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when
women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500-1000 ml) without clinical shock.
A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to
women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock.
✓
Early involvement of appropriate senior staff (including the anaesthetic team and laboratory specialists) is fundamental
to the management of PPH. In minor PPH, the first-line staff should be alerted and in major PPH, the following
members of staff should be called and summoned to attend:
an experienced midwife (in addition to the midwife in charge)
the obstetric middle grade
the anaesthetic middle grade
the on-call clinical haematologist with experience in major haemorrhage
porters for delivery of specimens/blood.
Furthermore, the consultant obstetrician and consultant anaesthetist should be alerted, and the blood transfusion
laboratory should be informed. One member of the team should be assigned the task of recording events, fluids,
drugs, blood and components transfused, and vital signs.
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52
e119 of e149 © 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Clinicians and blood transfusion staff should liaise at a local level to agree:
a standard form of words (such as 'we need compatible blood now' or 'group-specific blood') to be used in
cases of major obstetric haemorrhage
a timescale in which to deliver various blood components.
The use of the term 'controlled major obstetric haemorrhage' or ‘ongoing major obstetric haemorrhage' may be
used to define the urgency to the team.
Senior obstetric staff must be receptive to concerns expressed by less experienced or junior medical
practitioners, and by midwives. The RCOG recommends that the consultant obstetrician should attend in
person when there is a PPH of more than 1500 ml where the haemorrhage is continuing.6³

Administer 1 pool of platelets if haemorrhage is ongoing and platelet count
less than 75 x 109/I.
Administer 2 pools of cryoprecipitate if haemorrhage is ongoing and fibrinogen
less than 2 g/l.
A high concentration of oxygen (10-15 l/min) via a facemask should be administered, regardless of maternal oxygen
concentration. If the airway is compromised owing to impaired conscious level, anaesthetic assistance should be
sought urgently. Usually, level of consciousness and airway control improve rapidly once the circulating volume is
restored.
Establish two, 14-gauge intravenous lines; a 20 ml blood sample should be taken and sent for diagnostic tests,
including full blood count, coagulation screen, urea and electrolytes, and to cross-match packed red cells (4 units).
The urgency and measures undertaken to resuscitate and arrest haemorrhage need to be tailored to the degree of
shock (Table 2).
The cornerstones of resuscitation during PPH are restoration of both blood volume and oxygen-carrying |
capacity. Volume replacement must be undertaken on the basis that blood loss is often
underestimated. 59,64 Compatible blood (supplied in the form of red cell concentrate) to replace red cell
loss should be transfused as soon as available, if necessary. The clinical picture should be the main
determinant of the need for blood transfusion and time should not be unnecessarily spent awaiting
laboratory results. 65,66 Obstetricians should draw on the expertise of their colleagues in anaesthesia,
haematology and transfusion medicine in determining the most appropriate combination of intravenous
clear fluids, blood and blood products for continuing resuscitation. Guidance from the British Committee
for Standards in Haematology 67 summarises the main therapeutic goals of the management of massive
blood loss as maintaining:
Hb greater than 80 g/l
• platelet count greater than 50 x 109/1
• prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 times normal
• activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) less than 1.5 times normal
• fibrinogen greater than 2 g/l.

Fluid replacement is a crucial component of PPH treatment, although a dilutional coagulopathy may occur
when large volumes of crystalloid, colloid or red cells are used with insufficient transfusion of fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) and platelets. Traditionally, a total volume of 3.5 I of clear fluids (up to 2 I of warmed isotonic
crystalloid as rapidly as possible, followed by up to a further 1.5 1 of warmed colloid if blood is still not Evidence
available) comprises the maximum that should be infused while awaiting compatible packed red cells. While level 4
there is controversy as to the most appropriate fluids for volume resuscitation, the nature of fluid
infused is of less importance than rapid administration and warming of the infusion." The woman needs to be
kept warm using appropriate measures to prevent hypothermia which in turn could exacerbate acidosis.

72
There have been no RCTs comparing the use of colloids with other replacement fluids for the
resuscitation of women with PPH. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) 73
recommend that intravenous fluid replacement for PPH should be with isotonic crystalloids in
preference to colloids. A Cochrane review 74 compared colloids with crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in
critically ill, nonpregnant patients (patients with burns, trauma or following surgery). This review
concluded that resuscitation with colloids was not associated with an improvement in survival and that
the use of one particular colloid, hydroxyethyl starch, might increase mortality.

Blood transfusion
There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood
transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment.
75,76
The use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice is addressed in the RCOG Green-top
Guideline No. 47.13 There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion and the decision to
provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. While blood
transfusion is almost always required when the Hb is less than 60 g/l and rarely required when the Hb
is more than 100 g/l, patients with acute haemorrhage can have normal Hb and clinical evaluation in this
situation is, therefore, extremely important. Between 2009 and 2012,³ there were at least three
maternal deaths where an acute point of care Hb measurement result is thought to have falsely
reassured staff. Furthermore, the Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting scheme has highlighted the
risk of errors in using near patient testing of Hb measurements to guide transfusion. While single Hb/
haematocrit estimations may be misleading and can lead to delays in initiating red cell transfusion, serial
measurements may be helpful to monitor ongoing progress. Guidelines from the European Society of
Anaesthesiology 78 recommend that repeated measurements of serum lactate and base deficit, together with
haematocrit/Hb, are made during haemorrhage and resuscitation to assess tissue perfusion and oxygenation;
however, it has not yet been shown whether the outcome of severe bleeding can be improved if volume
resuscitation is guided by serum lactate concentration and base deficit.

Pregnant women (and women of childbearing age) who are RhD negative must only receive RhD-negative
blood to avoid the risk of D alloimmunisation.' Previous blood transfusion is an important cause of
alloimmunisation, with antibodies other than anti-D, in particular anti-K, causing severe haemolytic disease
of the fetus and newborn. 80 Accordingly, unless a woman is known to be K positive, only K-negative blood
should be used for transfusion in women of childbearing age.' The aim of antibody screening is to
determine the presence of red cell antibodies of likely clinical significance. In addition to the risk of
haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, these red cell antibodies may have implications for the
selection of blood for transfusion in the mother owing to the risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions, and
the laboratory should select red cell units negative for the relevant antigen for cross-matching. Close
liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential, with input if needed from the clinical haematology team
and specialist advice from the national blood service.
80
Evidence
level 4
All delivery units, especially small units without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supply of group O, RhD-
negative blood, as this might offer the only means of restoring oxygen-carrying capacity within an acceptable
timescale. The minimum number of units of group O, RhD-negative, K-negative blood to be maintained on site
should be agreed within local protocols and should reflect the likely period of delay in the arrival of further supplies
should an emergency arise; small delivery units remote from the nearest blood bank will require a larger minimum
supply than those a short distance from a blood bank.
Cross-matching versus electronic issue of blood
The principles of blood grouping, antibody testing and selection of blood in pregnancy are addressed in the RCOG
Green-top Guideline No. 47.13
79
The majority of laboratories in the UK now use automated testing for blood grouping and antibody testing
with advanced information technology systems for documentation and reporting of results. The hospital
transfusion laboratory can readily provide red cells that are ABO and RhD compatible using electronic issue
with no cross-matching needed, provided that the patient does not have any antibodies and there are robust
automated systems in place for antibody testing and identification of the patient." In this setting, since blood Evidence
can be readily issued, there is no need to reserve units for individual cases. Where electronic issue is not level 4
available, a locally agreed maximum surgical blood ordering schedule should be used to decide how many red
cell units should be reserved and available for particular cases, based on the obstetric diagnosis. In unforeseen
haemorrhage, group O, RhD-negative and K-negative units must be immediately available for emergency use,
with a switch to group-specific blood as soon as feasible.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status
81,82
In elective transfusion in the antenatal period, CMV-seronegative products should be used to avoid
transmission of CMV to the fetus, although, the UK policy of universal leucocyte depletion substantially
reduces the risk of CMV transmission. In an emergency, such as PPH, standard leucocyte-depleted
components should be given to avoid delay, and CMV-negative blood or platelets are not needed for
transfusion during delivery or in the postpartum period. 82
Intraoperative cell salvage
83,84
Evidence
level 4
Intraoperative cell salvage (the process whereby blood shed during an operation is collected, filtered
and washed to produce autologous red blood cells [RBCs] for transfusion to the patient) is commonly
being used in cardiac, orthopaedic and vascular surgery with a relative reduction of blood transfusion
of 38% and an absolute risk reduction of 21%. Cell salvage does not appear to impact adversely on
clinical outcomes. Several bodies have endorsed cell salvage in obstetric practice, including NICE,85
the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) 10 and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Evidence
Britain and Ireland. It has been proposed that cell salvage should be considered for emergency use
in PPH associated with both caesarean section and vaginal delivery. 87 Although large prospective trials
of cell salvage with autotransfusion in obstetrics are lacking to date, no single serious complication
leading to poor maternal outcome has been directly attributed to its use. A large RCT is currently in
progress comparing intraoperative cell salvage with donor blood transfusions (standard care) during
caesarean section in women at risk of haemorrhage (SALVO study, UKCRN ID14032).88
5.3.5
86
Blood components
level 4
There are limited data to inform best clinical practice for the management of haemostatic impairment during PPH,
but the principle of management is to prevent and treat haemostatic abnormalities during bleeding, but not to
correct abnormalities in nonbleeding women. It is not known whether haemostasis should be corrected to normality
for pregnant or nonpregnant women.
89
90
Methods to assess haemostatic impairment during PPH include clinical observation, laboratory-based tests
(PT, APTT, Clauss fibrinogen and platelet count) and point of care testing. Studies in patients following
surgery show that laboratory or point of care testing leads to appropriate use of blood components and
both may be used simultaneously. Coagulopathies may evolve rapidly and repeated testing (such as every
30 minutes) during continued bleeding and observation of trends are more useful than single measurements.
Routine coagulation tests are widely available and have well-regulated quality control. They include PT,
APTT, Clauss fibrinogen assay and platelet count. However, turnaround times are often too slow to be
clinically useful in acute and rapidly evolving bleeds, and inevitably reflect the past haemostatic status of the
woman. Clauss fibrinogen should always be measured as part of the routine coagulation screen because it
falls early and may be reduced to a clinically significant level despite a normal PT/APTT. 89,91,92 Platelet
number should be measured as part of the full blood count.

Point of care testing using viscoelastometry, such as thromboelastography (TEGⓇ, Haemonetics, Braintree,
Massachusetts, USA) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMⓇ, Tem, Munich, Germany), combined
with an agreed treatment algorithm, has been associated with decreased blood loss and blood product use,
both outside and within the obstetric setting. 89,93,94 The main advantage is that results are known sooner
than for laboratory tests. Point of care testing using TEGⓇ and ROTEMⓇ has been recommended by the
Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.95 However,
NICE has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine adoption of
viscoelastometric point of care testing in the management of PPH. If used, a quality control protocol
should be agreed with the haematology laboratory.
Transfusion of FFP
96
If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing, then, after 4 units of RBCs,
FFP should be infused at a dose of 12-15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are known.
If no haemostatic tests are available, early FFP should be considered for conditions with a
suspected coagulopathy, such as placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism, or where
detection of PPH has been delayed.
If PT/APTT is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing, volumes of FFP in
excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to correct coagulopathy.
Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need
for them is anticipated, as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need for
thawing.
97-99
69,71
Formulaic protocols, such as 1:1 or 6:4 RBC:FFP, based on data derived from traumatic bleeding, have
been advocated for the management of major haemorrhage. However, there is no evidence that this
improves outcomes in PPH. The drawbacks of early FFP are that the majority of women with PPH will
have normal coagulation at the time of administration, and that it is associated with an increased risk
of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)" and transfusion-related acute lung injury."
101 FFP
results in relatively small increments in fibrinogen level, and to increase the level rapidly, cryoprecipitate or
fibrinogen concentrate are required.'
102
100
There are limited data on the utility of laboratory and point of care coagulation tests to guide FFP
replacement during PPH. Abnormal PT/APTT suggests progression towards significant haemostatic
impairment, while PT/APTT greater than 1.5 times normal demonstrate that severe and established
haemostatic impairment has occurred. 67,68,103
If the PPH has stopped, no FFP is required. If haemorrhage is ongoing and the last PT/APTT results are
available and are prolonged, 12-15 ml/kg of FFP should be requested and infused with the aim of
maintaining the PT/APTT at less than 1.5 times normal. 68 If the PT/APTT is greater than 1.5 times normal,
a larger volume of FFP is likely to be required to correct these parameters, and this may be associated
with an increased risk of TACO. If the PT/APTT are normal, then no FFP is required, although repeated
testing should be performed if bleeding persists.

Observational studies show that a fibrinogen level of 1.0-1.5 g/l is likely to be too low for adequate
haemostasis during ongoing PPH. 97,98,109–111 Fibrinogen below 3 g/l and especially below 2 g/l is associated Evidence

A double-blind RCT | 12 has shown that pre-emptive infusion of 2 g fibrinogen concentrate in women with

Evidence
level I
The appropriate fibrinogen intervention trigger or target level is unknown. A pragmatic view based on available
evidence is that, during continuing PPH, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate should be used to maintain a
fibrinogen level of at least 2 g/l, even if PT/APTT are normal. Fibrinogen loss can be replaced by cryoprecipitate
or fibrinogen concentrate, although fibrinogen concentrate is not licensed for acquired hypofibrinogenaemia in
the UK. Similar clinical outcomes and increments in fibrinogen have been reported for cryoprecipitate and Evidence
fibrinogen concentrate, but these are based on limited data. It is expected that 2 pools of cryoprecipitate level 3
(I pool is taken from five donors) would increase the fibrinogen level by about I g/l. Increasing the fibrinogen
level by 1 g/l requires about 60 mg/kg fibrinogen concentrate. Observational studies report improved
clinical haemostasis and possible reduced use of FFP and post-transfusion-related events, such as TACO, 94,115
associated with infusion of fibrinogen, but RCTs are required."

5.3.6 Is there a role for antifibrinolytic drugs?
Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.
119
A large RCT118 found that early administration of tranexamic acid in the management of trauma in
nonpregnant patients resulted in a significant reduction in death from haemorrhage. The dose employed in
this study was I g intravenously over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of I g over 8 hours. One RCT||⁹
assessed the role of high-dose tranexamic acid in PPH. Women with PPH greater than 800 ml following
vaginal delivery were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 4 g over 1 hour, then
infusion of I g/hour over 6 hours) or not; the study concluded that high-dose tranexamic acid can reduce
blood loss, fall in Hb and the need for blood transfusion. The study was not powered to address safety
issues and specifically, the risk of the treatment causing deep vein thrombosis.
120
A Cochrane review² on treatments for PPH found that trials testing the effectiveness of tranexamic acid
were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. A large trial 12 is currently in progress aiming to
determine the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid on mortality, hysterectomy and other
morbidities in women with PPH. The dose of tranexamic acid employed in this trial is I g by intravenous

Evidence
rFVIIa (NovoSevenⓇ, Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) is an expensive product that is licensed in the
UK for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with specific inherited bleeding disorders. Outwith
its licence, it has been used primarily in the management of uncontrolled haemorrhage in the trauma
setting. It reduces blood loss through enhancement of tissue factor-dependent coagulation. Its effectiveness level 3
is markedly diminished by hypothermia, acidosis and low platelets, so effective resuscitation towards
normal physiology is a prerequisite of its use.
121
122
There are only poor quality data from anecdotal reports or patient registries to support its use.
Systematic reviews of case series and observational studies have examined the use of rFVIIa in PPH. 123,124
In a review of the literature regarding the use of rFVIIa in the treatment of PPH, Ahonen 122 concluded that
rFVIIa should not be used to compensate for inadequate blood transfusion therapy; administration of blood
and blood products, as well as management of uterine atony, are essential in the treatment of PPH before
considering administration of rFVIIa. A 2015 open-label RCT 125 (n = 84) found that administration of rFVIIa
lowered the risk of requiring second-line therapies by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.76) compared Evidence
with controls (no rFVIIa) in women with PPH in whom uterotonics had failed to arrest the bleeding. level 1+

The presence of a central line not only provides a means of accurate central venous pressure monitoring,
but also a route for rapid fluid replacement. Nevertheless, the threshold for instituting invasive monitoring
has been controversial, with some authorities advising early recourse to central venous pressure
monitoring and others advocating caution. The 2000-02 report of the UK Confidential
Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) 29 included the recommendation: 'Central venous and direct
arterial pressure monitoring should be used when the cardiovascular system is compromised by
haemorrhage or disease'. Central venous pressure monitoring requires early involvement of a senior
skilled anaesthetist, who will usually take responsibility for this aspect of management. The use of
ultrasound is more likely to make the procedure safer, as this procedure carries significant morbidity and
mortality. Once bleeding is under control, transfer to an intensive care or high dependency unit on
delivery suite should be considered, depending on the severity of the blood loss (see section 5.6.3).

It is also important that once the bleeding is arrested and any coagulopathy is corrected, chemical
thromboprophylaxis is administered, as there is a high risk of thrombosis. Alternatively, anti-embolism Evidence
stockings, foot impulse devices or intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used if chemical level 4
thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated, for example, in cases of thrombocytopenia.
5.5 What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH?
132
The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial
role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and, if necessary, in determining and administering
the most appropriate method of anaesthesia.
Anaesthetists play an important role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the management of patients
with PPH. A senior anaesthetist should be consulted early to help assess, initiate and continue prompt
resuscitation of these patients, using their expertise in fluid and transfusion therapy as well as their
experience in managing critically ill patients."
10
If the patient needs to go to theatre for a surgical intervention, an experienced anaesthetist should
promptly assess the patient in order to decide on the most suitable mode of anaesthesia, depending on
the patient's haemodynamic status. Central neuraxial anaesthesia has become the anaesthetic technique of
choice in the obstetric population and this has resulted in a reduction in maternal mortality.
133
9
While general anaesthesia in obstetric patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality when
compared with regional anaesthesia due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy, it may be
preferable in patients who are haemodynamically unstable or who have a coagulopathy.
The patient may need high dependency or intensive care in the postoperative period. An obstetric early
warning score system would help in the early identification of continuous bleeding, especially in cases
which are not apparent, as recommended by CMACE (see Appendix IV)."

Careful clinical examination is required to determine the cause of PPH (see Table I and Appendix II for
the risk factors and causes of PPH). A 2014 Cochrane review² addressing the treatment of primary PPH

The most common cause of primary PPH is uterine atony. The initial management of PPH should,
therefore, involve measures to stimulate myometrial contractions. The following mechanical and
pharmacological measures should be instituted/administered in turn:²
palpate the uterine fundus and rub it to stimulate contractions ('rubbing up the fundus')
ensure that the bladder is empty (Foley catheter, leave in place)
oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection (may have repeat dose)
ergometrine 0.5 mg by slow intravenous or intramuscular injection (contraindicated in
women with hypertension)
oxytocin infusion (40 iu in 500 ml isotonic crystalloids at 125 ml/hour) unless fluid restriction
is necessary
carboprost 0.25 mg by intramuscular injection repeated at intervals of not less than 15 minutes
to a maximum of eight doses (use with caution in women with asthma)
• misoprostol 800 micrograms sublingually.
The simple mechanical and physiological measures of ‘rubbing up the fundus' and emptying the bladder to
stimulate uterine contraction represent first-line management of PPH. No published studies have been
identified to provide an evidence base for these interventions; nevertheless, professional consensus
supports their continued use.
134
136
Evidence
level 4
Despite decades of empirical use in clinical practice, there are no trials comparing ergometrine with
oxytocin as first-line agents for the treatment of PPH. It seems appropriate to use both agents, although
oxytocin is to be preferred initially, especially in women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Previous
guidance advocated an initial dose of 10 iu oxytocin by slow intravenous injection for treatment (rather
than prophylaxis) of PPH. The British National Formulary recommends a dose of 5 iu 'by slow
intravenous injection (dose may be repeated)'. 135 The 1997-99 report of the UK CEMD highlighted the
risk of profound hypotension that may be associated with oxytocin injection. This guideline has
adopted the CEMD recommendation that 'When given as an intravenous bolus the drug should be given
slowly in a dose of not more than 5 iu'. This dosage is in line with guidance from other authorities. 30,135
There are no trials comparing the prostaglandin carboprost (15-methyl prostaglandin F2a) with other
uterotonic agents. Two case series from the USA, 137,138 comprising 26 and 237 cases, respectively, have
reported on the use of carboprost in the successful management of PPH, without resort to surgical
interventions in 85% and 95% of cases. Two of the four failures in the smaller series were associated with
placenta accreta. If bleeding occurs at the time of caesarean section, intramyometrial injection of
carboprost may be used (although not licensed). It is also possible to inject intramyometrial carboprost Evidence
through the abdominal wall in the absence of laparotomy. The recommended dose is 250 micrograms level 3
intramuscularly. This may be repeated every 15 minutes to a total dose of 2 mg (eight doses). However, if
significant atonic haemorrhage continues after a third dose of carboprost, without significant improvement
(i.e. 30 minutes or more after the first dose was given), the team should consider transfer to the
operating theatre for examination under anaesthesia, with an awareness of the impending need for
laparotomy and/or hysterectomy.

Two systematic reviews, which includes the 2014 Cochrane review, focused on misoprostol to treat
PPH and examined the optimal route and dosage, and its efficacy. Compared with 40 iu oxytocin infusion,
800 micrograms sublingual misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in the number of women
who had blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04–6.75) and who required blood transfusion
(RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.14). The review authors concluded that oxytocin infusion should be
recommended as first-line treatment for primary PPH. When used following prophylactic uterotonics,
misoprostol and oxytocin infusion work similarly.
A study
140
of women in early pregnancy demonstrated that regardless of the route of administration
(vaginal, sublingual or rectal), misoprostol took 1.0–2.5 hours to increase uterine tone. Clinicians should be
aware of this delay in the clinical effect of misoprostol. Guidelines from WHO 141 and the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 142 recommend that in the management of PPH, misoprostol is
administered sublingually.

5.6.2. Uterine balloon tamponade
143
148
144
145
Tamponade using various types of hydrostatic balloon catheter has superseded uterine packing for the
control of atonic PPH. Case series have used a Foley catheter, Bakri balloon,' Sengstaken-
Blakemore oesophageal catheter 146,147 and a condom catheter.' The urological Rusch balloon has been
described as preferable by virtue of larger capacity, ease of use and low cost.
149 A detailed protocol for Evidence
uterine tamponade using the Rusch balloon is available. The 2014 Scottish Confidential Audit of Severe
Maternal Morbidity report identified 339 women who had an estimated blood loss of 2500 ml or higher; in
82 cases, balloon tamponade was employed, successfully avoiding hysterectomy in 75 (91%) women.
This success rate is of the same order as that reported in other case series.
149
150
Some of the reports of balloon tamponade 148,151 describe the intervention as the 'tamponade test'. A
'positive test' (control of PPH following inflation of the balloon) indicates that laparotomy is not required,
whereas a 'negative test' (continued PPH following inflation of the balloon) is an indication to proceed to
laparotomy. The concept of balloon tamponade as a 'test' serves to affirm its place as first-line 'surgical'
management. There is no clear evidence on how long the balloon tamponade should be left in place. In
most cases, 4-6 hours of tamponade should be adequate to achieve haemostasis and ideally it should be
removed during daytime hours, in the presence of appropriate senior staff, in case further intervention is
necessary.

5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing
Several case series $153 have been published describing success with haemostatic brace sutures. The best
known version, described by B-Lynch in 1997, 154 requires hysterotomy for its insertion and is particularly
suitable when the uterus has already been opened for a caesarean section. A review published in 2005155
summarised nine case series of B-Lynch suturing (a total of 32 cases), reporting success in all but one case.
156
157
In 2002, Hayman et al. described a modified compression suture which does not require hysterotomy,
and success in 10/11 women managed with this suture has been reported. Other authors have
described variants on these techniques. 158,159 Double vertical compression sutures have proved effective in
treating PPH due to atony and placenta praevia. This may have a dual action of reducing uterine blood
flow and compressing the bleeding surface. 160
161
A prospective population-based study of 211 women treated with a uterine compression suture to control
PPH concluded that the overall failure rate of sutures leading to hysterectomy was 25%.
There was no
difference in failure rate among B-Lynch, modified B-Lynch and other suture techniques. Risk factors for a
hysterectomy included increasing age and vaginal delivery. In addition, a prolonged delay of 2-6 hours
between delivery and uterine compression suture was independently associated with a four-fold increased
risk of hysterectomy. This emphasises the need for careful postpartum evaluation of blood loss to avoid
prolonged delay in haemorrhage recognition.

167
Stepwise uterine devascularisation describes the successive ligation of (i) one uterine artery, (ii) both
uterine arteries, (iii) low uterine arteries, (iv) one ovarian artery and (v) both ovarian arteries, in the
management of PPH. The original case series' of 103 patients with intractable PPH not responding to
medical management was effective in all cases without the need for hysterectomy, leading some clinicians
to propose that stepwise uterine devascularisation should be the first-line conservative surgical treatment
to control PPH.
When internal iliac artery ligation is being considered, a senior gynaecologist or vascular surgeon should be
informed and involved since this technique requires a high degree of surgical skill and training, and may be
associated with ureteric injury. A case series described 84 women with PPH from various causes who
underwent internal iliac artery ligation as the first-line surgical intervention. Hysterectomy was

The decision for hysterectomy should be made by an experienced consultant clinician and the decision
preferably discussed with a second experienced clinician when feasible. 29 Early recourse to hysterectomy is
recommended, especially where bleeding is associated with placenta accreta or uterine rupture.

performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy
should be initiated when endometritis is suspected.
D
A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception
(RPOC), although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable.
C
Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an
experienced clinician.

The causes of secondary PPH are numerous and include endometritis, RPOC and subinvolution of the
placental implantation site. 177,178 The management of women presenting with secondary PPH should
include an assessment of their haemodynamic status, an assessment of the blood loss and an evaluation of
the woman's concerns (for example, is her bleeding becoming inconvenient because it has persisted longer
than she had expected?).
180
Investigations should include bacteriological testing for endometritis (high vaginal swab), although a low
yield of positive vaginal swab results has been reported in patients with secondary PPH.179 In contrast,
Pather et al. found a high incidence of abnormal vaginal microbiology (52%) and endometritis in their
case series, supporting the practice of routine assessment of vaginal microbiology and appropriate use of
antimicrobial therapy in women presenting with secondary PPH.
181
A Cochrane review investigated the effect of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of postpartum
endometritis. This review concluded that a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate,
and that once uncomplicated endometritis has clinically improved with intravenous therapy, there is no
additional benefit from further oral therapy. The management of women presenting with secondary PPH
and sepsis is addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 64b.
182
Pelvic ultrasound scans are commonly performed on women presenting with secondary PPH to identify
any RPOC. Case series180,183–186 have reported a wide range of sensitivities and specificities of ultrasound
in the detection of RPOC (44-94% and 16-92%, respectively). These series suggest that the presence of
an echogenic mass and a thickened ‘endometrium' is associated with RPOC. In a prospective observational
study 187 of 79 women with secondary PPH, Mulic-Lutvica and Axelsson concluded that an echogenic mass
in the uterine cavity and an anteroposterior diameter of the cavity above the 90th centile (approximately
25 mm on days 1-7 postpartum) was associated with RPOC. Since the range of sensitivities and
specificities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC is so wide, the clinical findings, including the degree of
bleeding and whether the cervical os is open, should be taken into account before the decision to
undertake surgery is made. It has been proposed that colour flow Doppler imaging should be included in
the evaluation of the postpartum uterus, although, there is no strong evidence to support its use;" its
use may facilitate the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, which are rare but
recognised causes of secondary PPH. 188-190

Surgical evacuation of the uterus for RPOC is not without morbidity and can result in uterine
perforation (1.5%) 18 and Asherman's syndrome. 192 It is, therefore, recommended that surgical
evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician.
An appropriately trained clinician may consider performing uterine evacuation under direct ultrasound
guidance.
Evidence
A 2002 Cochrane review (assessed as up-to-date in January 2008) addressed treatments for secondary level 3
PPH. No trials were identified which met the review group's inclusion criteria and no recommendations
were made regarding effective treatments. Uterotonics, such as misoprostol and ergometrine, have been
recommended in the management of secondary PPH, although evidence to support their use is
limited. Transcatheter arterial embolisation 193 and balloon tamponade have been employed in cases
of secondary PPH with ongoing bleeding.

Risk management
7.1
Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of
PPH?
Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH.
14710528, 2017, 5, Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [29/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric
emergencies, including the management of PPH.
B
Training for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals.
B
All cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of a
formal clinical incident review.
D
,195
To ensure optimal management of PPH, every unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol with
which staff should be familiar (see section 5). Updates on the management of obstetric emergencies
(including the management of PPH) are a proactive approach to risk management. Skills drills should
ensure that all members of staff, including those working in the transfusion laboratory, are aware of
their role in the management of PPH. A systematic review' of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary
simulation training in obstetric emergencies (including PPH) showed that teamwork training in a
simulation setting resulted in improvement of knowledge, practical skills, communication and team
performance. Training in a simulation centre did not further improve outcome compared with training
at a local unit.
The RCOG recommends that all cases of PPH with an estimated blood loss of more than 1500 ml should
be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.

7.2 Documentation
Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential.
197
Accurate documentation is important for further clinical management, continuity of care and team work. In
addition, inadequate documentation can contribute to the likelihood of there being medicolegal
consequences. The team member recording events on the structured proforma, the scribe, is crucial in the Evidence
management of PPH (see Appendix V); the proforma is effectively a checklist of available interventions, and level 4
team leaders should communicate with the scribe during the PPH to ensure that no steps have been omitted.
PPH should be notified through a clinical incident reporting or risk management system.
It is important to record:
•
the staff in attendance and the time they arrived
the sequence of events
the administration of different pharmacological agents, their timing and sequence
the time of surgical intervention, where relevant
the condition of the mother throughout the different steps
. the timing of the fluid and blood products given.
7.3 Debriefing
An opportunity to discuss the events surrounding the obstetric haemorrhage should be offered
to the woman (possibly with her birthing partner/s) at a mutually convenient time.
After obstetric emergencies, women can be psychologically affected by postnatal depression or fear of
further childbirth. Major PPH can be traumatic to women and their families and has been associated with
the subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder. 198 Women who have experienced a major
PPH should be offered an opportunity to discuss the events surrounding their delivery. A discussion of
future pregnancy, including the likelihood of a repeat PPH and any fears regarding pregnancy and
childbirth that the woman may have should be addressed. This should include arrangements for
appropriate investigations as necessary, such as testing for coagulopathies if there are other indicators and
screening for the rare complication of postpartum hypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome) secondary to
hypotension.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be
evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations
in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into
routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
