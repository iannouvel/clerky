The Management of Ovarian Cysts in Postmenopausal Women 
This is the second edition of this guideline, which was previously published in 2003, and reviewed in 
2010, under the title ‘Ovarian Cysts in Postmenopausal Women’.
Diagnosis and significance of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women 
Clinicians should be aware of the different presentations and significance of ovarian cysts in 
postmenopausal women. 
In postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdominal pain, the diagnosis of an ovarian cyst 
accident should be considered.
It is recommended that ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women should be initially assessed by 
measuring serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level and transvaginal ultrasound scan.
A thorough medical history should be taken from the woman, with specific attention to risk factors and 
symptoms suggestive of ovarian malignancy, and a family history of ovarian, bowel or breast cancer.
Appropriate tests should be carried out in any postmenopausal woman who has developed symptoms 
within the last 12 months that suggest irritable bowel syndrome, particularly in women over 50 years 
of age or those with a significant family history of ovarian, bowel or breast cancer.
A full physical examination of the woman is essential and should include body mass index, abdominal
examination to detect ascites and characterise any palpable mass, and vaginal examination.
Blood tests should include CA125.
Other tumour markers are not recommended for routine use.
Ultrasound scanning is the most effective way of evaluating ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women.
Doppler and three-dimensional ultrasound studies are not routinely recommended.
CT, MRI, and PET-CT scans are not recommended for the initial evaluation of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women.
The ‘RMI I’ is the most utilised triaging system for women with suspected ovarian cancer.
Asymptomatic, simple, unilateral, unilocular ovarian cysts, less than 5 cm in diameter, have a low risk 
of malignancy and can be managed conservatively.
Symptomatic or suspicious complex adnexal masses require surgical evaluation.
Aspiration of ovarian cysts is not recommended except for symptom control in advanced malignancy.
Laparoscopic management is suitable for women at low risk of malignancy.
All ovarian cysts suspicious of malignancy require a full laparotomy and staging procedure.
Management should reflect the structure of cancer care in the UK.
Women at higher risk should be managed in a cancer centre by a trained gynaecological oncologist.

Postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts should be initially assessed by measuring serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level and transvaginal ultrasound scan. The presentation of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women can vary, with some presenting with acute pain and others being found incidentally during investigations for other conditions. A thorough medical history and physical examination, including assessing family history, are essential in evaluating postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts. CA125 is the recommended serum tumour marker for primary evaluation, but other tumour markers have not shown enough evidence for routine clinical use. Transvaginal ultrasound is the most effective way to evaluate ovarian cysts, with specific features indicating benign or malignant nature. It is important to accurately assess ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women to guide further management.

Postmenopausal ovarian cysts with solid components may include benign or malignant tumors. Ultrasound can provide useful information, but no single finding can definitively differentiate between the two. Doppler and three-dimensional ultrasound studies are not routinely recommended for initial assessment. CT, MRI, and PET-CT scans are also not recommended initially, but may be considered for more complex cases or suspected metastatic spread. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) is a widely used triaging system to predict the likelihood of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts. A RMI score of 200 or higher may indicate the need for further imaging and referral to a gynaecological oncology team. Other scoring systems, such as IOTA classification, may also be used by experienced practitioners.

Women with an ovarian mass with any of the M-rules ultrasound findings should be referred to a gynaecological oncology service. Triaging women using the IOTA logistic regression model LR2 has been proposed as an alternative to RMI-based protocols. ROMA is a quantitative test that can calculate the risk of ovarian cancer based on CA125, HE4 concentration, and menopausal status. OVA1 is a quantitative assay that measures five serum proteins to assess the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women. Asymptomatic, simple, unilateral, unilocular ovarian cysts less than 5 cm in diameter can be managed conservatively with close follow-up. Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women should be undertaken by a surgeon with suitable experience. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is not recommended except for symptom control in women with advanced malignancy. Laparotomy is recommended for suspicious ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women. Women with a high risk of malignancy should be managed in a cancer centre by a trained gynaecological oncologist.

Recommendations for future research:
- Determine the optimum RMI I threshold for managing women with suspected ovarian cancer.
- Define Minimum Data Sets for postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts.
- Evaluate new tumour markers as diagnostic tests.
- Conduct additional external validation of scoring systems in new populations.
- Conduct follow-up studies on adverse outcomes from various surgical settings.

Auditable topics:
- Proportion of women with RMI I score of 200 or greater referred to a specialist gynaecological cancer team.
- Proportion of women with RMI I score greater than or equal to 200 who receive a CT scan and subsequent staging surgery.
- Proportion of women with false-negative and false-positive rates after surgery for presumed benign or malignant cysts.
