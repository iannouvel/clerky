Diabetes in pregnancy: management from preconception to the postnatal period

This guideline covers managing diabetes and its complications in women who are planning pregnancy or are already pregnant. It aims to improve the diagnosis of gestational diabetes and help women with diabetes to self-manage their blood glucose levels before and during pregnancy.

Recommendations:
- Provide information, advice, and support to empower women to have a positive experience of pregnancy and reduce the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
- Explain the risks associated with diabetes in pregnancy and the importance of planning for pregnancy.
- Offer individualized dietary advice and weight management guidance.
- Monitor blood glucose levels and ketones before pregnancy.
- Set target blood glucose and HbA1c levels before pregnancy.
- Advise on the safety of medicines for diabetes before and during pregnancy.

This guideline is for healthcare professionals, commissioners and providers, as well as women with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant, and women at risk of or diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

Long-acting insulin analogues may be used for women with diabetes who have good blood glucose control before pregnancy. Stop certain medications before or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Provide preconception care and education for women with diabetes to improve outcomes during pregnancy. Offer retinal and renal assessments before pregnancy for women with diabetes. Offer tailored interventions and monitoring for gestational diabetes. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and set individualized targets for pregnant women with diabetes. Measure HbA1c levels to assess risk during pregnancy.

Managing diabetes during pregnancy involves considering insulin treatment and the risks of hypoglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are recommended for pregnant women with diabetes. It is important to advise pregnant women with insulin-treated diabetes about the risks of hypoglycemia and to always have fast-acting glucose available. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may be offered to pregnant women who do not achieve blood glucose control with multiple daily injections. Continuous glucose monitoring, including real-time and intermittently scanned monitoring, is recommended for pregnant women with diabetes to improve outcomes. Ketone testing and diabetic ketoacidosis management are important during pregnancy. Retinal and renal assessments, as well as monitoring fetal growth and wellbeing, are also crucial. It is recommended to offer antenatal care specifically for women with diabetes and provide ongoing opportunities for education and information. Regular appointments and tests are essential throughout pregnancy to ensure optimal care.

1.3.43 Do not use betamimetic medicines for tocolysis in women with diabetes.
1.4 Intrapartum care
Discuss the timing and mode of birth with pregnant women with diabetes during antenatal appointments, especially during the third trimester.
Advise pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and no other complications to have an elective birth by induced labor or cesarean section between 37 weeks and 38 weeks plus 6 days of pregnancy.
Consider elective birth before 37 weeks for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have metabolic or other maternal or fetal complications.
Advise women with gestational diabetes to give birth no later than 40 weeks plus 6 days.
Consider elective birth before 40 weeks plus 6 days for women with gestational diabetes who have maternal or fetal complications.
Diabetes should not be considered a contraindication to vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section.
For pregnant women with diabetes who have an ultrasound-diagnosed macrosomic fetus, explain the risks and benefits of vaginal birth, induction of labor, and cesarean section.

Offer an annual Hb A1c test to women with gestational diabetes who have a negative postnatal test for diabetes. Offer women with gestational diabetes early self-monitoring of blood glucose or an OGTT in future pregnancies. Offer a subsequent OGTT if the first OGTT results in early pregnancy are normal.

Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with risks to the woman and the developing fetus. Miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, and preterm labor are more common in women with pre-existing diabetes. Additionally, diabetic retinopathy can worsen rapidly during pregnancy. Stillbirth, congenital malformations, macrosomia, birth injury, perinatal mortality, and postnatal adaptation problems such as hypoglycemia are more common in babies born to women with pre-existing diabetes. This guideline focuses on managing diabetes and its complications in women planning pregnancy and those who are already pregnant. It provides recommendations for areas where additional or different care should be offered to women with diabetes and their newborn babies. Separate recommendations are made for women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes.
