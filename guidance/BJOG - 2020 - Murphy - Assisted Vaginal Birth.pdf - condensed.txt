who have ongoing pelvic ﬂoor morbidity.
Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on the assessment, decision making and conduct of the procedure, a plan for postnatal care and sufficient information for counselling in relation to subsequent pregnancies. Use of a standardised proforma is recommended.
Paired cord blood samples should be processed and recorded following all attempts at assisted vaginal birth.
Adverse outcomes, including unsuccessful assisted vaginal birth, major obstetric haemorrhage, OASI, shoulder dystocia and significant neonatal complications should trigger an incident report as part of effective risk management processes.
Obstetricians should ensure that the ongoing care of the woman, baby and family is paramount.
Obstetricians have a duty of candour; a professional responsibility to be honest with patients when things go wrong.
Obstetricians should contribute to adverse event reporting, confidential enquiries, and take part in regular reviews and audits. They should respond constructively to outcomes of reviews, taking necessary steps to address any problems and carry out further retraining where needed.
Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework to support women, their families and staff when serious adverse events occur.

perform the procedure safely. This includes assessing the clinical situation, communicating effectively with the woman and healthcare personnel, and being proficient in the chosen procedure. Adequate preparation and planning are essential. Ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to assisted vaginal birth is recommended for accurate diagnosis. Consent should be obtained from the woman, taking into account her preferences and ensuring she understands the risks and benefits. Complex decision-making may be necessary in certain cases, and the expertise of experienced obstetricians should be involved. Overall, safe assisted vaginal birth requires careful consideration of the clinical circumstances and clear communication with all involved parties.

- Vacuum and forceps have different benefits and risks
- Birth by vacuum and forceps can have significant maternal and perinatal complications
- Maternal outcomes include episiotomy, vulvo-vaginal tear, OASI, postpartum hemorrhage, and urinary or bowel incontinence.

Perinatal outcomes: Cephalhaematoma, facial or scalp lacerations, retinal haemorrhage, jaundice, subgaleal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, cervical spine injury, skull fracture, facial nerve palsy, and fetal death are all possible outcomes of assisted vaginal birth. The 'Od on' device is not recommended for routine use until fully evaluated. Alternatives to Kielland's forceps for rotational assisted vaginal birth include manual rotation, direct forceps, or vacuum extraction. The use of sequential instruments in assisted vaginal birth should be carefully considered to balance the risks. Obstetricians should be aware of the increased neonatal morbidity following failed assisted vaginal birth and inform the neonatologist when necessary. Neonatologists and midwives should monitor neonates for signs of traumatic injury following failed assisted vaginal birth. Episiotomy should be discussed with the woman as part of preparation for assisted vaginal birth.

The evidence supports the use of mediolateral episiotomy at assisted vaginal birth to prevent OASI, especially for nulliparous women and forceps births. A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to reduce maternal infection. Women should be offered NSAIDs and paracetamol for pain relief after birth. Education on urinary retention risk and monitoring is important. Psychological support and follow-up are crucial for women after assisted vaginal birth. Inform women of the high probability of a spontaneous vaginal birth in future labors. Individualize care for women with perineal tears or pelvic floor morbidity.

- The risk of a further operative birth is higher for women who had an assisted vaginal birth in their first pregnancy, but the absolute risk is low.
- Women who have experienced a third- or fourth-degree tear may be at increased risk of further damage with a subsequent birth.
- Documentation for assisted vaginal birth should include detailed information on assessment, decision making, and postnatal care.
- Obstetricians have a duty to be honest with patients when things go wrong and should contribute to adverse event reporting.
- Maternity units should provide a safe and supportive framework to support women, their families, and staff when serious adverse events occur.

Instrumental delivery and ultrasound: a multicentre randomised controlled trial of ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position versus standard care as an approach to prevent morbidity at instrumental delivery. Ultrasound determination of fetal head position can influence the mode of delivery. Strategies to enhance assessment of the fetal head position before instrumental delivery are important. Abdominal ultrasound can accurately identify the fetal head position in the second stage of labor. Ultrasound measurements can predict the difficulty of vaginal operative delivery. Angle of fetal head progression measured using transperineal ultrasound can predict vacuum extraction failure. Maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with operative delivery in the second stage of labor is a concern. Pelvic floor morbidity at 3 years after instrumental delivery and cesarean section in the second stage of labor is significant. Perinatal outcomes of vacuum-assisted versus cesarean deliveries for prolonged second stage of delivery at term should be considered. Neurodevelopmental outcomes after operative delivery in the second stage of labor are important. Neonatal outcomes and operative vaginal delivery versus cesarean delivery are significant. Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality after attempted operative vaginal delivery at midpelvic station should be monitored. Maternal and neonatal morbidity after attempted operative vaginal delivery according to fetal head station is a concern. Operative vaginal delivery requires valid consent. Minimizing risk through obstetric skills training is essential. Non-technical skills for obstetricians conducting forceps and vacuum deliveries are important.
