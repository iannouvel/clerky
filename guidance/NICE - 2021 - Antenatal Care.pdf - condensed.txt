Antenatal care guideline: 
This guideline covers routine antenatal care for pregnant women to ensure regular check-ups, information, and support. Healthcare professionals should involve women in decision-making and provide necessary information. Antenatal care should start in various ways, offer early pregnancy health information, and be available in different languages. Antenatal appointments should be scheduled, involve partners, and provide additional support as needed. It is important to take and record the woman's medical history at the first appointment.

Consider reviewing the woman's previous medical records if needed, including records held by other healthcare providers. Be aware that women and babies from some minority ethnic backgrounds and those who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of death and may need closer monitoring and additional support. Assess the woman's risk factors for and, if appropriate, discuss female genital mutilation (FGM) in a kind, sensitive manner. Refer the woman for a clinical assessment by a doctor to detect cardiac conditions if there is a concern based on the pregnant woman's personal or family history. Refer the woman to an obstetrician or other relevant doctor if there are any medical concerns or if review of current long-term medicines is needed. After discussion with and agreement from the woman, contact the woman's GP to share information about the pregnancy and potential concerns or complications during pregnancy. At every antenatal appointment, carry out a risk assessment by asking the woman about her general health and well-being, any concerns she would like to discuss, and providing a safe environment for her to discuss topics such as concerns at home, domestic abuse, concerns about the birth, or mental health concerns. Update the woman's antenatal records at every antenatal contact to include details of history, test results, examination findings, medicines, and discussions. Offer to measure the woman's height and weight and calculate body mass index at the first face-to-face antenatal appointment. Offer a blood test to check full blood count, blood group, and rhesus D status at the first antenatal appointment. Discuss and share information about, and then offer, screening programs for infectious diseases, sickle cell, thalassaemia, and fetal anomalies at the first antenatal appointment. Offer pregnant women ultrasound scans to determine gestational age, detect multiple pregnancies, and screen for genetic syndromes at specific weeks of pregnancy. Assess the woman's risk factors for venous thromboembolism and offer referral for further management if needed. Assess the woman's risk factors for gestational diabetes and offer referral for testing if at risk. Assess the woman's risk factors for pre-eclampsia and hypertension in pregnancy, and advise on appropriate interventions. Measure and record the woman's blood pressure at every routine appointment using a validated device. Offer a urine dipstick test for proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a risk assessment for fetal growth restriction and symphysis fundal height measurement at each antenatal appointment. Consider ultrasound scans for fetal growth and wellbeing based on concerns with symphysis fundal height measurements. Do not routinely offer ultrasound scans after 28 weeks for uncomplicated singleton pregnancies.

1.2.34 Discuss the topic of babies' movements with the woman after 24 weeks, ask about any concerns, advise to contact maternity services if needed, and assess if there are any concerns about the baby's movements.

1.2.35 Structured fetal movement awareness packages have not been shown to reduce stillbirth rates.

1.2.36 Offer abdominal palpation after 36 weeks to identify possible breech presentation.

1.2.37 If breech presentation is suspected, offer an ultrasound scan to confirm.

1.2.38 For women with confirmed breech presentation after 36 weeks, discuss different options available, such as external cephalic version, breech vaginal birth, or elective cesarean birth.

1.3 When providing information and support to pregnant women, listen to their needs and preferences, discuss risks and benefits of assessments and interventions, respect women's decisions, and provide information in a clear, tailored, and supportive manner.

1.3.9 Discuss nutrition, diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, and recreational drug use in a non-judgmental way.

1.3.13 Discuss babies' movements after 24 weeks.

1.3.14 Start discussing birth preferences before 28 weeks.

1.3.15 Discuss preparing for labor, recognizing active labor, and postnatal care after 28 weeks.

1.3.16 Continue discussing and confirming birth preferences from 28 weeks onwards.

1.3.17 Discuss prolonged pregnancy and management options from 38 weeks.

1.3.19 Provide appropriate information and support for women whose baby is considered at an increased risk of neonatal admission.

1.3.23 Discuss the potential benefits of peer support with pregnant women (and their partners), and explain how it may provide practical support, help to build confidence, and reduce feelings of isolation.
1.3.24 Offer pregnant women (and their partners) information about how to access local and national peer support services.

1.3.25 Advise women to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks of pregnancy and to consider using pillows to maintain their position while sleeping.
1.3.26 Explain to the woman that there may be a link between going to sleep on her back and stillbirth in late pregnancy (after 28 weeks).

1.4 Interventions for common problems during pregnancy
Nausea and vomiting
1.4.1 Reassure women that mild to moderate nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy, and are likely to resolve before 16 to 20 weeks.
1.4.2 Recognize that by the time women seek advice from healthcare professionals about nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, they may have already tried a number of different interventions.
1.4.3 For pregnant women with mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting who prefer a non-pharmacological option, suggest that they try ginger.
1.4.4 When considering pharmacological treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different antiemetics with the woman. Take into account her preferences and her experience with treatments in previous pregnancies.

Heartburn
1.4.8 Give information about lifestyle and dietary changes to pregnant women with heartburn.
1.4.9 Consider a trial of an antacid or alginate for pregnant women with heartburn.

Models of antenatal care should consider varying numbers and times of appointments, especially for groups at risk of worse outcomes. Routine ultrasound from 36 weeks is effective in identifying breech presentation. Corticosteroids may be effective for severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Recommendations for starting antenatal care emphasize early contact, referral, and individualized care. Involving partners in antenatal care is important, with flexible appointment options to accommodate their involvement. Careful assessment of potential inequalities is needed when considering virtual platforms for appointments. Recommendations for taking and recording the woman's history focus on improving outcomes without significant resource impact.

Addressing inequalities. Recommendations were based on committee consensus on what is best practice, as well as other existing NICE guidelines. Asking the woman about her past and present conditions and experiences in relation to her physical, obstetric, psychological, emotional, and social health enables potential risk factors to be identified and managed. It is important to note which pharmacological and non-pharmacological remedies the woman uses so that current medication can be reviewed in light of pregnancy. It is important that women do not automatically stop using their regular medication without consultation. This discussion also allows for individualized advice on safe medicine use during pregnancy and can help with identifying any health issues that may have otherwise not come up. The committee also agreed that it is important to discuss the woman's home and family situation and the available support she has. Sometimes there may be a reason to review the woman's previous medical records, for example when her previous maternity care has been in a different organization, she cannot recall details of a potentially significant issue, or the discussion somehow triggers a concern. The committee agreed that healthcare professionals should be aware of the disproportionate maternal mortality and stillbirth rates among women and babies from black and Asian backgrounds and those living in deprived areas, as highlighted by the 2020 MBRRA CE-UK reports on maternal mortality and perinatal mortality. This increased risk of death indicates that interventions to improve engagement, support, and closer monitoring need to be explored. Future research could help understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities and what interventions could improve the outcomes. In general, action on the wider determinants of health, including different social, economic, and environmental factors, is also needed to overcome such inequalities. The committee agreed that domestic abuse puts both the woman and her baby at risk of harm, so it is important that all pregnant women are asked about it in a kind, sensitive way. Pregnancy can sometimes be a trigger for domestic abuse or existing domestic abuse can continue or worsen during pregnancy, so it is important that women feel that they can disclose it safely so that they can be supported, and interventions put in place if needed. Although partner involvement in antenatal care is welcome, it is also important to ensure that there is an opportunity to discuss domestic issues privately with the woman. The committee recognized the need to identify women who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) or whose unborn baby girl might be at risk of FGM so that appropriate safeguarding can take place. Identifying underlying cardiac problems is important because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the UK during and after pregnancy. Some women are at a higher risk of undiagnosed structural cardiac problems, such as women with a family history of cardiac abnormalities or women who were brought up in a country with a high incidence of rheumatic fever. Clinical assessment cannot identify all cardiac problems that cause maternal mortality, but it might pick up structural heart disease or concerns that warrant further investigations. Early identification of underlying cardiac conditions allows these women to receive appropriate care during their pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal period, and potentially avoid poor outcomes. The committee also agreed the importance of information sharing between the maternity unit and the GP, and agreeing this with the woman. This is particularly important if the woman has self-referred (because the GP may be unaware of her pregnancy), and if women have a complex medical, psychological, or social history (because different agencies may need to be involved in her and her baby's care). Antenatal appointments are opportunities for continued monitoring and risk assessment on the health and wellbeing of the woman and her baby. They also allow for regular reassessments of women's antenatal care needs and plans.

The committee discussed the importance of fetal movement awareness and the lack of evidence supporting structured awareness packages. They agreed that fetal movements should be routinely discussed and women's concerns taken seriously. There is no agreed definition of normal fetal movements, but discussing changes throughout pregnancy can help women recognize patterns. The recommendations on fetal growth monitoring may lead to changes in practice, such as offering fewer ultrasound scans after 28 weeks or more scans for suspected large for gestational age. Managing reduced fetal movements should follow the NHS care bundle version 2. The recommendations on breech presentation reflect current practice, with no change expected. Communication principles emphasize listening to women, providing tailored information, and supporting decision-making. Information about antenatal care should be provided in stages and cover relevant topics. Antenatal classes may benefit women in coping with labor, and peer support can be valuable during pregnancy. Recommendations on sleep position aim to reduce the risk of stillbirth and babies being born small for gestational age.

28 weeks if women fall asleep on their backs. The committee agreed that there is some uncertainty about this risk because the evidence was from relatively small studies. Further research is unlikely due to the low incidence of stillbirth. The committee advises women to avoid sleeping on their backs after 28 weeks. Providing practical advice about risk reduction is important for pregnant women. Healthcare professionals may need to spend more time discussing sleep positions with women. 

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect daily functioning and quality of life. The committee recommends reassuring pregnant women experiencing mild to moderate symptoms that these are common in early pregnancy and usually settle later in the second trimester. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments are both options. Ginger may be effective for mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and ondansetron are effective in improving symptoms. Acupressure can be considered for moderate to severe symptoms. 

Heartburn recommendations include lifestyle and diet information and considering antacid or alginate therapy. Acupuncture and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended routinely due to low-quality evidence. 

Symptomatic vaginal discharge recommendations focus on reassuring women that it is a normal feature of pregnancy. Antifungal treatment for vaginal candidiasis and antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis can be considered. 

Pelvic girdle pain recommendation is to refer to physiotherapy services for exercise advice to reduce pain intensity and functional disability.

No evidence of adverse effects of using a lumbopelvic belt was found. Providing a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt was also found to be cost-effective. Manual therapy alone was not found to have any benefits for women with pelvic girdle pain. The evidence for acupuncture to treat pelvic girdle pain was mixed and of poor quality. Current practice for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain involves offering analgesics and lifestyle information. Hospitalization should be considered for monitoring and administering corticosteroids for pregnant women with unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks. Around 660,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year. Good quality antenatal care is vital to identify and deal with potential problems. This guideline updates and replaces the version first published in 2008. It covers routine antenatal care for all women.
