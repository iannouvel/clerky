Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
 1.0 Objective  Standards  
1.1  Definition  
 The clinical syndrome associated with ascending infection from the endocervix,  
causing endometritis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo -ovarian abscess, and/or pelvic 
peritonitis.  
 
1.2  Epidemiology  
The incidence of PID is unknown and probably grossly underestimated  as figures 
are either based on inpatient episodes or cases treated in GUM outpa tients.  
Many cases are treated  in primary care and ~50% women have sub-clinical or 
unrecognised disease.  It is estimated to account for 1:60 GP visits by females 
under 45 years.  
 
Rates are probably increasing, reflecting increasing incidence of sexually 
transmitted diseases, particularly Chlamydia.  Behavioural factors that increase 
the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as younger  age at first sexual 
intercourse, multiple sexual partners, and frequency of partner change, are all 
associated with increased risk of PID. 
 
1.3   Pathogenesis  
PID is c ommonly initiated  by an STI, which predisposes to further  colonisation by 
organisms that would normally be non-pathogenic. The isolation of anaerobes 
tends to be associated with more severe disease and anae robes are invariably 
present in tubo-ovarian abscesses. The r isk of PID is also increased by other  
factors that breech cervical host defences, such as IUCD insertion, childbirth, 
miscarriage,  surgical procedures, and TOP. 
 
2.0 Isolation Rates  
 
 Chlamydia trachomatis: 40% (14-65%) using EIA, DIF & culture (higher  with 
NAATs) 
 Neisse ria gonorrhoea: 14%  
 Anaerobes: 60%   
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS  
Maternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  
Date of Issue: May  
 Review Date:  May   
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
  Mycoplasma: 10-15% 
 No organisms isolated: 25-50% 
Complications  
 Infertility (risk after 1 episode 8%, 2 episodes  
 9.5%, 3 episodes 40%),  
 Ectopic pregnancy (9.5 times  more likely)   
 Chronic pelvic pain (9.8 times more likely)   
 
With each infection, host defen ces become increasingly damaged and the risk of 
complications rises  with each subsequent insult. 
3.0 Diagnosis  
PID may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Even when present, clinical symptoms and signs 
lack sensitivity or specificity (positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis is 65 -90% 
compared to laparoscopic diagnosis).  
 
Testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the lower genital tract is recommended since a 
positive result sup port diagnosis.  The absence of infection at this site does not exclude PID 
however.  
 
An elevated ESR or CRP also supports diagnosis but is non -specific  
The absence of endocervical  or vaginal pus cells has a good negative predictive value (95%) 
for a diagnosis of PID but their presence is non -specific (poor positive predictive value - 
17%)  
 
3.1   Sexual History  
 The number of sexual partners within the last 3 months  
 The duration of each relationship  
 The date of last sexual intercourse with each partner  
 Whether barrier contraception used within each relationship

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
 4.0 Clinical Features  
The following features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID  
4.1 Symptoms  
 Lower abdominal pain, usually bilateral  
 Deep dyspareunia  
 Abnormal vaginal bleeding, including post coital, inter -menstrual and 
menorrhagia  
 Abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, which is often purulent  
 
 4.2 Signs  
 Lower abdominal tenderness, which is usually bilateral  
 Adnexal tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination  
 Cervical motion tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination  
 Fever >38°C  
 
A diagnosis of PID, and empirical treatment, should be considered and offered in any young 
woman (under 25 years of age) who is sexually active and has recent onset of bilateral lower 
abdominal pain a ssociated with local tenderness on bimanual vaginal examination, in whom 
pregnancy has been excluded.  
 
 4.2.1 Complicating  Factors  
 IUCD  - Removal of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with 
better short term clinical outcomes.  The decision to  remove the IUCD should 
be balanced against the risk of pregnancy in those who have had otherwise 
unprotected intercourse in the preceding seven days.  Hormonal emergency 
contraception may be appropriate for some women in this situation  
 HIV - women with HIV may have more severe symptoms associated with PID, 
but respond well to standard antibiotic therapy.  No change in treatment 
regime is required.  
 Fitz-Hugh -Curtis Syndrome  - this comprises right upper quadrant pain 
associated with perihepatitis.  Althoug h laparoscopic division of hepatic 
adhesions has been performed, there is insufficient  clinical trial evidence to 
make specific recommendations for treatment beyond those for 
uncomplicated PID

 5.0 Investigations  
 Urinalysis, including pregnancy test  
 Bloods, inc luding FBC and CRP  
 Observations, temperature  
 Routine swabs  
o Endocervical Chlamydia  & gonor rhoea  
o High vaginal swab (black charcoal)  
 Pelvic Ultrasound, particularly  if symptoms/signs of moderat e/severe 
disease  
6.0 Management  
It is likely that delaying treatment increases the long term sequelae , such as ectopic 
pregnancy, infertility and chronic pelvic pain.   Therefore, a low threshold for empiric 
treatment is recommended.  Broad spectrum antibiotics  are required  to cover N. 
gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and a variety of anaerobic and aerobic ba cteria  commonly 
found in the upper genital tract in women with PID . 
Treatment must  be effective (>95% cure rate), easy to take, have low side effects, and be 
given promptly.   
 
If gonococcus diagnosed on NAATs the patient should be reviewed by genitourinary 
medicine so cultures can be taken for gonorrhoea & contact tracing carried out. Please 
contact the liaison Health Advisor on 07789 995086 or ext. 4716  
 
 
6.1   Outpatient Management  
Patients seen in A&E and treated as outpatient must be provided  with emergency 
drug packs.  
 
6.2   Inpatient Management  
 If any of the following features are present, c onsider admission, IV antibiotics 
and/or laparoscopy: 
 Severe  or atypical disease 
 Temp> 38oC 
 Nausea & vomiting,  
 Peritonism   
 WBC >15  
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS  
Maternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  
Date of Issue: May  
 Review Date:  May   
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
  Pregnant or adolescent patient 
 If the diagnosis is uncertain, pelvic abscess suspected or there is a 
possibility of a surgical emergency 
 If the patient has not responded to out-patient therapy, or is intolerant to 
oral therapy  
6.3  General Advice  
 Rest  advised for those with severe disease.  
 Both patient and partner should abstain from sexual contact until 
completion of treatment and review  
 Explanation of the treatment and its possible adverse effects  
 Patient must avoid alcoh ol if being treated with metronidazole   
 Potential OCP interactions  with antibiotics ( advise  to abstain  from sexual 
contact whilst on antibiotics ) 
 Importance of compliance  to treatment  
 Importance of follow up  
 All patients must be asked to give consent for follow up for themselves and 
sexual contacts.  
 It is essential that sexual partners also receive treatment, whether  or not an 
organism is identified on tests  (they should contact CNC for treatment)  
7.0 Patient informatio n 
 
Ensure patients receive patient information leaflet - click here for RCOG  
leaflet (https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patient -information -
leaflets/gynaecology/pi -acute -pid.pdf ).   
 
We should discuss long term sequelae of PID with the patient, including the following:  
 Following treatment, fertility is usually maintained but there remains a risk of 
future infertility, chronic pelvic pain or ectopic pregnancy  
 Clinically more severe disease is associated with a gre ater risk of sequelae  
 Repeated episodes of PID are associated with an exponential increase in the 
risk of infertility  
 The earlier treatment is given, the lower the risk of future fertility problems  
 Future use of barrier contraception will significantly reduce risk of PID  
 The need to screen/treat her sexual contacts for infection to prevent her 
becoming  re-infected

10.0 NICE guidance on dr ug choice during very early pregnancy 
(before a positive pregnancy test )  
 
 PARACETAMOL : experience suggests this can be used at any time during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding [ NTIS, 2004 ; Schaefer et al, 2007 ]. 
 NSAIDS:  The UK Teratology Information  Service (UKTIS, formerly the National 
Teratology  Information Service [NTIS]), reviewed safety data of NSAIDs from  
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS  
Maternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  
Date of Issue: May  
 Review Date:  May   
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
 published research and post marketing  surveillance systems. They concluded that 
'the available data do not indicate that exposure to ibuprofe n before 30 weeks of 
pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects or 
spontaneous abortions' [ NTIS, 2004 ]. 
 ANTIBIOTICS : The RCOG recommends that the risk of giving any of their 
recommended antibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (before a positive 
pregnancy test) is low, since significant drug toxicity results in failed implantation 
[RCOG, 2009 ], and BASHH states that the risk of giving any of the recommended 
antibiotic regimens in very early pregnancy (prior to a pregnancy test becoming 
positive) is justified by the need to provide effective therapy and the low risk to 
the fetus [ BASHH, 2011a ]. 
 CEFTRIAXONE  has not specifically been studied during pregnancy. However, the 
risk associated with use of cephalosporins during pregnancy is thought to be low 
and, a lthough data are limited for individual agents such as ceftriaxone, the 
cephalosporins as a class are considered to be an appropriate choice during 
pregnancy [ NTIS , 2008b ]. Although ceftriaxone crosses the placental barrier, it 
has not been associated with adverse events on fetal development in laboratory 
animals [ ABPI Medic ines Compendium, 2009 ]. 
 DOXYCYCLINE  is contraindicated beyond the 15th week of gestation because, 
from the 16th week of pregnancy it causes tooth and bone discolouration and 
inhibits bone growth. However, it can be used in the first trimester. Inadvertent 
first-trimester use of tetracyclines occurs frequently and has not been associated 
with an increased risk of congenital malformations [ Schaefer et al, 2007 ]. 
 METRO NIDAZOLE  has been in clinical use for a long time, and experience 
suggests that it is not teratogenic in humans [ Schaefer et al, 2007 ]. A recent 
prospective contro lled study in 228  women exposed to metronidazole in 
pregnancy, 86% of whom had first trimester exposure, confirms these findings 
[Schaefer et al, 2007 ]. 
 OFLOXACIN  has only limited pregnancy -exposure data. Quinolones have caused 
arthropathy in animal studies. However, a recent study (most of the data are on 
ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but some are on ofloxacin) did not find that 
quinolone use in the first trimest er of pregnancy was associated with an 
increased risk of malformations or other adverse effects on pregnancy outcome 
[Schaefer et al, 2007 ]. 
 There are fewer publis hed data on the use of AZITHROMYCIN  rather than 
ERYTHROMYCIN  during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The limited published data 
and follow -up data collected by the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS, 
formerly the National Teratology Information Service [ NTIS]), do not

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
 demonstrate an increased risk of congenital malformations following exposure to 
azithromycin in human pregnancy [ NTIS, 2008a ]. 
11.0 IUCD and  PID  
Removal of IUCD should be considered and may be associated with better short term clinical 
outcomes.  The decision to remove the IUCD should be balanced against the risk of 
pregnancy in those who have had otherwise unprotected intercourse in the preceding seven 
days.  Hormonal emergency contraception may be appropriate for some women in this 
situation (BASHH) . 
 
11.1  NICE guidance on IUCD and PID:  
  Evidence  on whether or  not to remove intrauterine contraception in a woman who has 
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is limited and conflicting. There are no long term data on 
the effects on fertility.  
 Expert opinion differs regarding the management of women with PID who have 
intrauterine contraception:   
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS  
Maternity Protocol: GP003 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  
Date of Issue: May  
 Review Date:  May   
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease    GP003  
  The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive  Healthcare  (FSRH), does not routinely 
recommend the removal of intrauterine contraception. The Faculty's Clinical 
Effectiveness Unit supports the continued use of intrauterine contraception and 
appropriate antibiotic treatment if PID is suspec ted; there is no need to remove 
the device unless symptoms fail to resolve within 72  hours, or the woman wants 
it removed [FFPRHC, 2006 ; FSRH, 2007 ]. 
 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists  [RCOG, 2009 ] advises 
that consideration should be given to removing the device, especially if 
symptoms have not resolved within 72  hours.  
 The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV  recommends considering 
removing the device if the woman develops PID. They advise balancing th e 
decision to remove the device against the risk of pregnancy if the woman has 
had sexual intercourse in the preceding 7  days [ BASHH, 2011a ]. 
 The World Health Orga nisation  - selected practice recommendations for 
contraceptive use state that [ WHO, 2004 ]: 
o There is no need for removal of the intrauterine contra ception if the 
woman wishes to continue its use.  
o If the woman wishes removal, it should be removed after antibiotic 
treatment has been started.  
o If the infection does not improve, generally the course would be to 
remove the device and continue antibiotic treatment. If the device is not 
removed, the antibiotic should also be continued. In both cases the 
woman should be monitored closely.  
12.0 Follow  Up 
 
All patients  with a suspected diagnosis of PID should be referred to the liaison 
health advisors at the  Claude Nicole Centre (CNC ) (This involves faxing the PID 
proforma to 01273 6647 20).  
 
For moderate to severe disease treated  as an outpatient, patients should be re-assessed 
at 48h and be investigated further if not responding to treatment.  This should be 
undertaken by the gynae cology  team.  
 
For patients  who require prolonged  inpatient stays or with severe disease, review by 
the health advisors may be possible on the ward. 
 
All patients  will be reviewed at two weeks, by CNC, to assess:
