Diagnosis:
1. Group B Streptococcal (GBS) colonisation
2. Early-onset GBS (EOGBS) disease
3. GBS bacteriuria
4. GBS urinary tract infection
5. Early-onset neonatal infection
6. Severe allergy to penicillin
7. Clinical signs of EOGBS disease

Investigation:
1. Bacteriological screening for GBS
2. Bacteriological testing in late pregnancy
3. Testing for GBS carrier status
4. Testing for GBS carriage
5. Polymerase chain reaction or other near-patient testing at the onset of labour
6. Swab from the lower vagina and the anorectum for GBS carrier status
7. Enriched culture medium tests for GBS carriage
8. Evaluation at birth for clinical indicators of neonatal infection

Management:
1. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)
2. Treatment of GBS urinary tract infection during pregnancy
3. Management of GBS colonisation in women who decline IAP
4. Management of newborn baby with concerns about early-onset neonatal infection
5. Treatment of babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease with penicillin and gentamicin
6. Breastfeeding irrespective of GBS status
7. Management of term labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS disease
8. Management of preterm labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS disease
9. Antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing planned caesarean section
10. Management of term babies whose mothers have received adequate IAP
11. Monitoring of well babies at risk of EOGBS disease whose mothers have not received adequate IAP
12. Management of the baby of a mother who has had a previous baby with GBS disease.
