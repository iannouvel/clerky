Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth
Antenatal care schedule:
- Implement a VBAC versus ERCS checklist or clinical care pathway for best practice in antenatal counselling
Suitability for planned VBAC:
- Planned VBAC appropriate for most women with single previous lower segment caesarean delivery
- Contraindications include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar
Factors associated with increased risk of uterine rupture in VBAC:
- Individual assessment needed for factors increasing risk
Antenatal counselling:
- Document counselling in notes
- Final mode of birth decision agreed upon before expected date
- Consider use of VBAC checklists and provide patient information leaflet
Risks and benefits of planned VBAC versus ERCS:
- VBAC success rate 72-75%
- Previous vaginal delivery increases likelihood of successful VBAC
Intrapartum management of planned VBAC:
- Conduct in suitably staffed delivery suite with continuous monitoring
- Epidural analgesia not contraindicated
Advice on induction or augmentation of labour:
- Increased risk of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery with induction or augmentation
Planning and conducting ERCS:
- ERCS after 39+0 weeks
- Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis recommended
Care for women in special circumstances:
- Caution advised for VBAC in certain circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, or maternal age 40 or older

Previous caesarean deliveries increase the risk of placenta praevia and accreta in subsequent pregnancies. Women with two or more prior caesareans may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician, with consideration of uterine rupture and maternal morbidity. Factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, maternal age, obesity, and myometrial thickness. Antenatal counselling should be individualized and documented, with consideration of VBAC success rates and future reproductive preferences. Planned VBAC has fewer complications than ERCS, but carries a risk of uterine rupture. VBAC and ERCS have different risks and benefits for maternal and infant outcomes. Women should be informed of these risks to make an informed decision about their mode of delivery.

The NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase in serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared to ERCS. A review of other studies also found a similar increased risk for women attempting VBAC. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Factors such as induced labor, no previous vaginal delivery, and BMI over 30 are associated with an increased risk of unsuccessful VBAC. Intrapartum management of planned VBAC should include continuous monitoring and prompt identification of complications. Women should be informed of the increased risks of uterine rupture and emergency cesarean delivery associated with induction or augmentation of VBAC labor. ERCS delivery should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation, with antibiotics administered before incision and thromboprophylaxis given according to guidelines.

Women considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables around a 5% reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, but this delay may be associated with a 5 per 10 000 increase in the risk of antepartum stillbirth. Should there be a need to perform ERCS prior to 39 weeks, consideration should be given to administering maternal corticosteroids. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated a 50% reduction in respiratory morbidity by administering prophylactic betamethasone to women having elective caesarean deliveries beyond 37+0 weeks. However, caution should be taken as there is an absence of evidence available for the safety of antenatal corticosteroids in babies born after 36+0 weeks of gestation. Perioperative preincision antibiotics achieve a greater reduction in the risk of maternal infection than prophylactic antibiotics administered after making the skin incision. The choice of method of thromboprophylaxis should be as per the RCOG guidance. Women in special circumstances, such as those with post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more, should be approached cautiously when considering VBAC. The NICE induction of labour guideline recommends induction of labour from 41+0 weeks as this reduces perinatal mortality without an increase in caesarean delivery rates. Women with previous caesarean delivery should have a review by a senior obstetrician at 41+0 weeks of gestation if spontaneous onset of labour has not ensued. Twin gestation, suspected fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, and maternal age of 40 years or more are all factors that should be carefully considered in the decision-making process for VBAC.

Planned VBAC refers to the intended mode of delivery for women who have had a prior cesarean birth and plan to deliver vaginally. Successful VBAC is indicated by a vaginal delivery, while unsuccessful VBAC involves emergency cesarean delivery during labor. Uterine rupture is the disruption of the uterine muscle, while uterine dehiscence is the disruption of the uterine muscle with intact uterine serosa. Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and neonatal deaths between 20 weeks of gestation and 28 days of life. Term delivery-related perinatal death includes intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Neonatal respiratory morbidity includes transient tachypnea of the newborn and respiratory distress syndrome. Antenatal care includes counseling on delivery options and routine screenings. VBAC success rates and risks of uterine rupture are detailed in the guidelines.

Committee members and chairs from various locations contributed to the development of the guidelines. All developers were required to declare any conflicts of interest. The final version is the responsibility of the RCOG Guidelines Committee.
