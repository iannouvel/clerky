Diagnosis: Breech Presentation

Investigation: 
1. External cephalic version (ECV)
2. Assessment for risk factors for a poorer outcome in planned vaginal breech birth
3. Ultrasound to estimate the position of the fetal neck and legs, and the fetal weight 
4. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring 

Management: 
1. Counselling on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section
2. Individualised assessment of the long-term risks of caesarean section based on their individual risk profile and reproductive intentions
3. Planned caesarean section for breech presentation in spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended
4. Labour with a preterm breech should be managed as with a term breech
5. Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills that are needed during vaginal breech birth by all doctors and midwives
6. Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births
7. Departments should consider developing a checklist to ensure comprehensive counselling of the woman regarding planned mode of delivery for babies presenting by the breech.
