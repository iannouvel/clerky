Management of Breech Presentation
This is the fourth edition of this guideline originally published in 1999 and revised in 2001 and 2006 under the same
title.
Executive summary of recommendations
What information should be given to women with breech presentation at term?
Women with a breech presentation at term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV)
unless there is an absolute contraindication. They should be advised on the risks and benefits
of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery. [New 2017]
A
Women who have a breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of
ECV should be counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus
planned caesarean section.

What information about the baby should be given to women with breech presentation at term regarding mode of
delivery?
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in
perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. Any decision to perform a
caesarean section needs to be balanced against the potential adverse consequences that may
result from this.
A
Women should be informed that the reduced risk is due to three factors: the avoidance of
stillbirth after 39 weeks of gestation, the avoidance of intrapartum risks and the risks of
vaginal breech birth, and that only the last is unique to a breech baby. [New 2017]
B
Women should be informed that when planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of
perinatal mortality is approximately 0.5/1000 with caesarean section after 39+0 weeks of
gestation; and approximately 2.0/1000 with planned vaginal breech birth. This compares to
approximately 1.0/1000 with planned cephalic birth.
C
Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care may allow planned vaginal
breech birth to be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth. [New 2017]

Women should be informed that planned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar
scores and serious short-term complications, but has not been shown to increase the risk of
long-term morbidity. [New 2017]
B
Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way that ensures a proper understanding of
the absolute as well as relative risks of their different options. [New 2017]
✓
What information should women having breech births be given about their own immediate and future health?
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term
carries a small increase in immediate complications for the mother compared with planned
vaginal birth.
Women should be informed that maternal complications are least with successful vaginal birth;
planned caesarean section carries a higher risk, but the risk is highest with emergency
caesarean section which is needed in approximately 40% of women planning a vaginal breech
birth. [New 2017]
Women should be informed that caesarean section increases the risk of complications in future
pregnancy, including the risks of opting for vaginal birth after caesarean section, the increased
risk of complications at repeat caesarean section and the risk of an abnormally invasive
placenta. [New 2017]

Women should be given an individualised assessment of the long-term risks of caesarean
section based on their individual risk profile and reproductive intentions, and counselled
accordingly. [New 2017]

What information should women having breech births be given about the health of their future babies?
Women should be informed that caesarean section has been associated with a small increase
in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies although this may not be causal. [New 2017]
C
What factors affect the safety of vaginal breech delivery?
Antenatal assessment
Following the diagnosis of persistent breech presentation, women should be assessed for
risk factors for a poorer outcome in planned vaginal breech birth. If any risk factor is
identified, women should be counselled that planned vaginal birth is likely to be associated
with increased perinatal risk and that delivery by caesarean section is recommended.

Women should be informed that a higher risk planned vaginal breech birth is expected where
there are independent indications for caesarean section and in the following circumstances:
• Hyperextended neck on ultrasound.
. High estimated fetal weight (more than 3.8 kg).
.
Low estimated weight (less than tenth centile).
Footling presentation.
• Evidence of antenatal fetal compromise. [New 2017]
The role of pelvimetry is unclear. [New 2017]
Skill and experience of birth attendant
The presence of a skilled birth attendant is essential for safe vaginal breech birth.
C
C
C
C
Units with limited access to experienced personnel should inform women that vaginal breech
birth is likely to be associated with greater risk and offer antenatal referral to a unit where
skill levels and experience are greater. [New 2017]
Intrapartum assessment and management of women presenting unplanned with breech presentation in labour
Where a woman presents with an unplanned vaginal breech labour, management should
depend on the stage of labour, whether factors associated with increased complications are
found, availability of appropriate clinical expertise and informed consent. [New 2017]
Women near or in active second stage of labour should not be routinely offered caesarean
section. [New 2017]
Where time and circumstances permit, the position of the fetal neck and legs, and the fetal
weight should be estimated using ultrasound, and the woman counselled as with planned
vaginal breech birth. [New 2017]
All maternity units must be able to provide skilled supervision for vaginal breech birth where a
woman is admitted in advanced labour and protocols for this eventuality should be developed.
[New 2017]
What is appropriate intrapartum management of the term breech?
Are induction and augmentation appropriate?
Women should be informed that induction of labour is not usually recommended.
Augmentation of slow progress with oxytocin should only be considered if the contraction
frequency is low in the presence of epidural analgesia. [New 2017]

What is the role of epidural analgesia?
Women should be informed that the effect of epidural analgesia on the success of vaginal
breech birth is unclear, but that it is likely to increase the risk of intervention. [New 2017]
What fetal monitoring should be recommended?

Women should be informed that while evidence is lacking, continuous electronic fetal
monitoring may lead to improved neonatal outcomes. [New 2017]
D
Where should vaginal breech birth take place?
Birth in a hospital with facilities for immediate caesarean section should be recommended with
planned vaginal breech birth, but birth in an operating theatre is not routinely recommended.
D
What guidelines should be in place for the management of breech birth?
Women should be informed that adherence to a protocol for management reduces the chances
of early neonatal morbidity. [New 2017]
C
The essential components of planned vaginal breech birth are appropriate case selection,
management according to a strict protocol and the availability of skilled attendants. [New 2017]
✓
Management of the first stage and passive second stage
Adequate descent of the breech in the passive second stage is a prerequisite for
encouragement of the active second stage. [New 2017]
D
What position should the woman be in for delivery during a vaginal breech birth?
Either a semirecumbent or an all-fours position may be adopted for delivery and should
depend on maternal preference and the experience of the attendant. If the latter position is
used, women should be advised that recourse to the semirecumbent position may become
necessary. [New 2017]
What are the principles for the management of active second stage and vaginal breech birth?
Assistance, without traction, is required if there is delay or evidence of poor fetal condition.
[New 2017]
All obstetricians and midwives should be familiar with the techniques that can be used to assist
vaginal breech birth. The choice of manoeuvres used, if required to assist with delivery of the
breech, should depend on the individual experience/preference of the attending doctor or
midwife. [New 2017]

Management of the preterm breech
How should preterm singleton babies in breech presentation be delivered?
Women should be informed that routine caesarean section for breech presentation in
spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended. The mode of delivery should be
individualised based on the stage of labour, type of breech presentation, fetal wellbeing and
availability of an operator skilled in vaginal breech delivery.
Women should be informed that caesarean section for breech presentation in spontaneous
preterm labour at the threshold of viability (22-256 weeks of gestation) is not routinely
recommended.
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm
breech presentation where delivery is planned due to maternal and/or fetal compromise.

Labour with a preterm breech should be managed as with a term breech. [New 2017]
C
Where there is head entrapment, incisions in the cervix (vaginal birth) or vertical uterine
incision extension (caesarean section) may be used, with or without tocolysis.
D
Management of the twin pregnancy with a breech presentation
How should a first twin in breech presentation be delivered?
Women should be informed that the evidence is limited, but that planned caesarean section
for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech is recommended. [New 2017]
C
Routine emergency caesarean section for a breech first twin in spontaneous labour, however, is
not recommended. The mode of delivery should be individualised based on cervical dilatation,
station of the presenting part, type of breech presentation, fetal wellbeing and availability of
an operator skilled in vaginal breech delivery. [New 2017]
C
How should a second twin in breech presentation be delivered?
Routine caesarean section for breech presentation of the second twin is not recommended in
either term or preterm deliveries.

What organisational and governance arrangements should be in place to support a routine vaginal
breech delivery service?
Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills that are needed during vaginal
breech birth by all doctors and midwives.
Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed
in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births. Adherence to
the guidelines is recommended to reduce the risk of intrapartum complications. [New 2017]
Departments should consider developing a checklist to ensure comprehensive counselling of the
woman regarding planned mode of delivery for babies presenting by the breech. [New 2017]
1.
Purpose and scope
C
The aim of this guideline is to provide up-to-date information on the modes of delivery for women with breech
presentation. The scope is confined to decision making regarding the route of delivery and choice of various
techniques used during delivery. It does not include antenatal or postnatal care. External cephalic version (ECV) is
the topic of the separate Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guideline No. 20a:
External Cephalic Version and Reducing the Incidence of Term Breech Presentation.'

Breech presentation occurs in 3-4% of term deliveries and is more common preterm. It is associated with uterine
and congenital abnormalities, has a significant recurrence risk and is more common in nulliparous women.² Term
babies presenting by the breech have worse outcomes than cephalic ones, irrespective of the mode of delivery.³
Publication of the Term Breech Trial (TBT) 4 was followed by a large reduction in the incidence of planned vaginal
birth. Nevertheless, vaginal breech births will continue, not merely because of failure to detect breech presentation
and the limitations of ECV, but for reasons of maternal choice. Lack of experience has led to a loss of skills essential
for these deliveries. Conversely, caesarean section can have serious long-term consequences.
3.
Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodology for developing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The
Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
Effects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE and Trip
were searched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all relevant articles published between August 2005
and April 2016. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all
subheadings and synonyms, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included 'breech', 'breech
near presentation', ‘breech presentation', ‘breech near delivery', 'breech delivery', 'breech presentation and delivery',
'breech near extraction', 'breech extraction', 'Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit', 'Burns-Marshall', ‘after-coming head' and
'external cephalic version'. The search was limited to studies on humans and papers in the English language. Relevant
guidelines were also searched for using the same criteria in the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search.

Observational, usually retrospective, series have consistently favoured elective caesarean birth over vaginal
breech delivery. A meta-analysis of 27 studies examining term breech birth,5 which included 258 953 births
between 1993 and 2014, suggested that elective caesarean section was associated with a two- to five-fold
reduction in perinatal mortality when compared with vaginal breech delivery although the absolute risk of Evidence
perinatal mortality with vaginal delivery was 3/1000. This meta-analysis is limited by the retrospective level 2++
nature of many of the studies and the absence of complete intention to treat analysis. The increased
practice of caesarean section accounts for only a small proportion (16%) of the decline in delivery-related
perinatal death.6
The TBT* randomised 2088 women to either planned caesarean section or planned vaginal birth at 121 centres
in 26 countries. This trial was by far the major contributor to the Cochrane Review which demonstrated
a reduction in perinatal mortality with planned caesarean section (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.86) from
1.3 to 0.3%. This trial also reported a reduction in the composite outcome of serious neonatal morbidity
(RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19–0.65). A number of subanalyses examining operator experience, prolonged labour
or augmentation, and national (high or low) perinatal mortality rates failed to identify a group for whom Evidence
morbidity was not increased with planned vaginal delivery although they were underpowered to assess
level 1+
mortality rates.
A 2-year follow-up of 923 out of 1159 children from the TBT showed no difference in 'death or
neurodevelopmental delay' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52–2.30). This renders the morbidity, but not mortality, findings
(and therefore the 'intention to treat' analysis in the original trial paper) less important.
9
13
The TBT led to wide-scale elective caesarean section for breech presentation, with a corresponding
reduction in perinatal mortality. However, criticism of the trial followed, 10-12 particularly regarding case
selection and intrapartum management. For instance, 31% had no ultrasound (to exclude an extended
neck), growth-restricted babies were included and a few women were randomised in violation of the
protocol and included in the 'intention to treat' analysis. A senior obstetrician was absent from 31.9% of births
and any obstetrician was absent from 13% of births in the planned vaginal delivery group. Electronic fetal
monitoring (EFM) was not used in most and prolonged active second stage was not prohibited which, when it
occurred, was associated with increased morbidity. 3 ‘Serious' neonatal morbidity encompassed some
frequently benign outcomes and was twice as common in countries with a low perinatal mortality rate
(5.1% versus 2.5%). Both short-term morbidity and mortality (1.3%) in the planned vaginal delivery group
were higher than subsequent series have reported. 14,15
Glezerman, 10
commenting on analysis by
Su et al.,³ argued that in only 16 of the 69 neonates with the primary composite outcome could this be
related to mode of delivery. However, while some of the deaths may not be attributable to the vaginal breech
birth, it is still reasonable to assume some would not have happened if a caesarean section had been
performed at 39 weeks of gestation. This highlights a fundamental issue: by eliminating the last
1-3 weeks of pregnancy and labour, the perinatal death of at least 1/1000 babies,16 cephalic or breech, could
be prevented.

The limitations of the TBT meant planned vaginal breech birth continued, notably in Scandinavia, France
and the Netherlands. As a result, further mortality and short-term morbidity data have become
available. Vlemmix et al. published a population-based cohort study of 58 320 nonanomalous term
babies presenting by the breech delivered between 1997 and 2007 from the Netherlands Perinatal
Registry, evaluating the effect of increased elective caesarean following the TBT. The perinatal mortality
of babies presenting by the breech halved from 0.13 to 0.07% (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28–0.93). For
planned vaginal breech birth, however, it remained stable (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.52-1.76). More
importantly, the perinatal mortality was 0.16% in the planned vaginal birth group and 0% in the elective
caesarean section group (P < 0.0001) post publication of the TBT report although this mortality rate
with vaginal delivery was notably lower than that reported in the TBT (0.16% versus 1.3%). Elective
caesarean also reduced the risk of low Apgar scores (less than 7 at 5 minutes; OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.09–0.16)
and neonatal 'trauma' (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15-0.37) compared with planned vaginal birth. The
differences in mortality and morbidity persisted among different birth weights, with parity and with type
of breech. The authors estimated that 338 additional caesarean sections were performed for each
perinatal death prevented.
17-21
More strict selection and management protocols than those employed in the TBT have been
employed in smaller retrospective studies from individual institutions. These have limited statistical
power to detect an effect on mortality, but most report reassuring results. Indeed, the lower
rates of short-term morbidity compared with those reported in either the TBT or the Dutch
study4, suggest that although evidence for the individual components is poor, the selection and
management criteria employed were beneficial. They might, therefore, reasonably be expected to
improve mortality.

Examining the effect of more strict selection and management was the intention of the much larger
PREMODA study. The outcomes of 2526 planned vaginal breech deliveries were compared with 5579
planned caesarean deliveries in 174 units in France and Belgium over a 12-month period. The strict
criteria included 'normal' (definition unstated) radiological pelvimetry which was performed in 82.5% of
planned vaginal births, continuous EFM and routine ultrasound. As with the TBT, 4 induction or
augmentation with oxytocin was allowed. Only 0.2% had an active second stage of more than 60 minutes,
while 18.1% had a passive second stage (60 minutes or longer) compared with 5 and 3.1%, respectively, in
the TBT. Only 3.8% of vaginal deliveries had ‘'failed to progress' for more than 2 hours. Outcomes were
analysed for neonates with no lethal congenital abnormality. In the planned vaginal delivery group, of Evidence
whom 79% delivered vaginally, there were two deaths (0.08%); in the planned caesarean group, of whom level 2++
0.16% delivered vaginally, there were seven deaths (0.12%) (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.13–3.06). Planned vaginal
birth showed significant increases in Apgar scores of less than 7 at 5 minutes (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.93–5.3) and
total injuries, most of which were clavicular fractures or haematomata (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.40–6.34).
However, there was no difference in neonatal unit admissions (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.94–1.86), or a composite
measure of mortality or serious neonatal morbidity (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75–0.61). This remained after
adjustment for other factors associated with this outcome (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.89-2.23). The
absolute risks for a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7 (1.3%) and for perinatal mortality (0.08%) compared
favourably to both the TBT and the Dutch cohort study.*

Although data were collected prospectively in each centre, participants were not registered at inclusion,
potentially enabling accusations of bias; furthermore, classification regarding the intended mode of delivery
was made retrospectively. In addition, demographic differences existed between the two groups: notably,
the planned vaginal birth babies were smaller. The study does not enable an accurate comparison of
planned caesarean with breech birth; with a later gestation at planned vaginal birth but all babies alive at
inclusion, it examines the effect of strictly managed labour more than the effect of planned elective
caesarean delivery after 39+0 weeks of gestation.
Evidence
level 2++
Elective caesarean section exerts a protective effect on perinatal mortality, as well as short-term, but
probably not long-term, morbidity although the effect is smaller than suggested by the TBT. Some of the
risk is due to the earlier gestation at which elective caesarean section is performed, while some is due to
the elimination of labour which, even for a cephalic baby, can lead to mortality. The excess risk of breech
compared with cephalic labour is relatively small (1/1000), and implementation of strict selection and Evidence
intrapartum management criteria, together with skilled support, may reduce it further. 14 Perinatal mortality level 2+
is also slightly increased by vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC), which nevertheless remains a
common option.22 Any benefit from elective caesarean section must be viewed in the light of the small
increase in complications associated with subsequent pregnancies. Furthermore, caesarean birth has been
associated with long-term health issues in the offspring.
23
4.2 What information should women having breech births be given about their own immediate
and future health?
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term
carries a small increase in immediate complications for the mother compared with planned
vaginal birth.
Women should be informed that maternal complications are least with successful vaginal birth;
planned caesarean section carries a higher risk, but the risk is highest with emergency
caesarean section which is needed in approximately 40% of women planning a vaginal breech
birth.
Women should be informed that caesarean section increases the risk of complications in future
pregnancy, including the risks of opting for VBAC, the increased risk of complications at repeat
caesarean section and the risk of an abnormally invasive placenta.
Women should be given an individualised assessment of the long-term risks of caesarean
section based on their individual risk profile and reproductive intentions, and counselled
accordingly.

A modest short-term increase in maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.61) is reported with planned
caesarean section in a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Longer term morbidity in the TBT Evidence

documented in the RCOG patient information leaflet: Choosing to have a caesarean section.

For subsequent pregnancies, having had a planned caesarean (compared with planned vaginal) birth causes
a three-fold increase in uterine scarring; more than half of all women with at least one prior caesarean
section have another. 25 The risks of blood transfusion, endometritis, hysterectomy and death are increased
in women with a previous caesarean section (irrespective of whether they attempt a VBAC) when
compared with those who have previously delivered vaginally.22 The risk of scar rupture during attempted
vaginal birth after one caesarean section is approximately 0.5%. 22,26,27 In developing countries, particularly
where birth outside hospital is usual and access to healthcare is poor, the effect on maternal outcomes is Evidence
likely to be considerably greater.2
28
29
A further maternal issue is that of placenta praevia and placenta accreta,2 or abnormally invasive
placentation, for which prior caesarean delivery is the principal risk factor. The risk of abnormally invasive
placentation increases from 0.31% with one prior caesarean section to 2.33% with four 30 and the incidence
is rising. The risk is higher after elective compared with emergency caesarean section.³1 This complication
can lead to massive haemorrhage, hysterectomy, urinary tract injury and maternal death.

What information should women having breech births be given about the health of their
future babies?
Women should be informed that caesarean section has been associated with a small increase
in the risk of stillbirth for subsequent babies although this may not be causal.
32
In a systematic review and meta-analysis, O'Neill et al. compared the risk of stillbirth and miscarriage in
a subsequent pregnancy with a previous caesarean or vaginal delivery. Examining data from 1961 829
pregnancies and 7308 events, they reported an increase in the risk of all stillbirths and unexplained
stillbirths (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20-1.80). These findings have been disputed: 33 the indication for the
caesarean may account for the increase.
Future pregnancies are also at risk of uterine rupture when VBAC is attempted; the risk of delivery-related
perinatal mortality after one caesarean is up to 12.9/10 000, much of which is attributable to uterine
rupture. Please refer to the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 45: Birth after previous caesarean birth.22

Following the diagnosis of persistent breech presentation, women should be assessed for risk
factors for a poorer outcome in planned vaginal breech birth. If any risk factor is identified,
women should be counselled that planned vaginal birth is likely to be associated with increased
perinatal risk and that delivery by caesarean section is recommended.

Women should be informed that a higher risk planned vaginal breech birth is expected where
there are independent indications for caesarean section and in the following circumstances:
• Hyperextended neck on ultrasound.
• High estimated fetal weight (more than 3.8 kg).
Low estimated weight (less than tenth centile).
• Footling presentation.
. Evidence of antenatal fetal compromise.
The role of pelvimetry is unclear.
C
C
The safety of planned vaginal breech birth is dependent on case selection, operator skill and intrapartum
management. There is, however, a paucity of good evidence regarding factors that increase the risks of
vaginal breech birth. Traditional contraindications and those which caused women to be ineligible for the
TBT included an estimated fetal weight greater than 4 kg, footling breech presentation, an extended neck,
'obstructing' fetal abnormalities and an existing indication for caesarean birth. The lower perinatal mortality
and morbidity in the PREMODA study 14 and in the post TBT population-based cohorts 15 are partly
attributable to stricter case selection and management. The findings of these studies, therefore, have limited
applicability where their inclusion criteria were not met or their management protocols were not followed.
Indeed, in a French cohort, composite morbidity and mortality were lower (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.85) Evidence
among units that applied the consensus guidelines.34
Factors associated with increased perinatal morbidity at vaginal breech birth in the PREMODA cohort
included non-European or African origin, gestational age of less than 39 weeks at birth, birthweight less than
the tenth centile and annual number of maternity unit births less than 1500.35 Molkenboer et al. 36 assessed
183 children, born by vaginal breech delivery, at 2 years of age and, from multiple logistic regression,
concluded that there was an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay when the birthweight had been
more than 3.5 kg. As the PREMODA study 14 used an estimated weight upper limit of 3.8 kg, the reassuring
outcomes of the study cannot be extrapolated for larger babies.
level 2+
The role of pelvimetry is unclear. Largely abandoned in the UK, it was employed in 82.5% of planned
vaginal births in the PREMODA study 14 and van Loon et al.³37 reported that the use of pelvimetry reduced Evidence
the emergency caesarean section rate. Further evidence is required to more clearly delineate the role of level 2-
pelvimetry in breech presentation.
5.2
Skill and experience of birth attendant
The presence of a skilled birth attendant is essential for safe vaginal breech birth.
C
Units with limited access to experienced personnel should inform women that vaginal breech
birth is likely to be associated with greater risk and offer antenatal referral to a unit where
skill levels and experience are greater.
✓
14
Evidence
Although largely unproven, the availability of skilled personnel is likely to strongly influence perinatal
outcomes. A senior obstetrician was present at 92.3% of all vaginal deliveries in the PREMODA series;' level 2+
similar figures apply to the smaller consecutive case series describing successful vaginal breech birth.

The decline in vaginal breech delivery in the UK has led to a widespread lack of experience which itself threatens
the safety of planned, and the unplanned but inevitable, vaginal breech birth. An inability of a unit to reliably provide
experienced personnel for the delivery is a contraindication to a recommendation of planned vaginal birth.
5.3 Intrapartum assessment and management of women presenting unplanned with breech
presentation in labour
Where a woman presents with an unplanned vaginal breech labour, management should
depend on the stage of labour, whether factors associated with increased complications are
found, availability of appropriate clinical expertise and informed consent.
Women near or in active second stage of labour should not be routinely offered caesarean
section.

Where time and circumstances permit, the position of the fetal neck and legs, and the fetal
weight should be estimated using ultrasound, and the woman counselled as with planned
vaginal breech birth.
All maternity units must be able to provide skilled supervision for vaginal breech birth where a
woman is admitted in advanced labour and protocols for this eventuality should be developed.
13
39
UK data reported that breech presentation at term is not diagnosed until labour in about 25% of women.
In some women, labour will be so quick that vaginal breech birth is inevitable and assessment using Evidence
ultrasound is impossible. Unplanned vaginal breech birth is associated with increased risk, but the data on
level 2+
planned vaginal birth cannot be simply extrapolated to support routine late labour caesarean section.
Where labour is progressing rapidly, there is a balance of risks: attempting caesarean section where the breech is
very low is likely to be associated with increased perinatal and maternal risk; assessment should include what is
feasible. Attempts at vaginal delivery in theatre with spinal anaesthesia or caesarean section with the breech on the
perineum are likely to be associated with both increased perinatal and maternal risk.
6.
What is appropriate intrapartum management of the term breech?
Evidence
There is a paucity of evidence regarding the best management of the breech fetus in labour.
Recommendations are based on physiology, best practice experience and the management protocols of
series with low complication rates. The limited evidence and expert opinion broadly divides into two
groups: a more interventionist approach supported by data from the large PREMODA study 14 and a less level 4
medicalised approach² which is more traditional in the UK. Both strategies advocate close supervision
and the not infrequent need for caesarean section or intervention during breech birth.

6.1
Are induction and augmentation appropriate?
Women should be informed that induction of labour is not usually recommended.
Augmentation of slow progress with oxytocin should only be considered if the contraction
frequency is low in the presence of epidural analgesia.
D
Both induction and augmentation of labour were used in the PREMODA study 14 in 8.9 and 74.1% of
vaginal breech births, respectively. This very high rate of augmentation, coupled with a very low incidence
of 'slow dilatation', suggests a more prophylactic than a therapeutic role. As a means to treat dystocia,
augmentation should usually be avoided as adequate progress may be the best evidence for adequate Evidence
fetopelvic proportions. However, if epidural analgesia has been used and the contraction frequency is low, level 2-
its use should not be excluded. Notably, labour augmentation is not supported by many experienced
advocates of vaginal breech birth 40 who favour a less interventionist approach. Continuous support is
known to reduce labour length and operative delivery with a cephalic presentation.4
6.2
What is the role of epidural analgesia?
Women should be informed that the effect of epidural analgesia on the success of vaginal
breech birth is unclear, but that it is likely to increase the risk of intervention.
42
There is limited evidence addressing this. However, with a cephalic presentation, a Cochrane meta-
analysis concluded that epidural anaesthesia increases the risk of assisted vaginal delivery. As vaginal
breech delivery cannot be expedited until its final stages, epidural anaesthesia might increase the risk of
caesarean section. Vaginal breech birth is usually easier if a mother is able to bear down effectively and an
epidural may interfere with this. A less interventionist approach advocates a calm atmosphere with
continuous support as a means to avoid epidural analgesia. 41 With a more interventionist approach, 14
seldom used in the UK, epidural analgesia is less likely to have a detrimental effect.

Women should be informed that while evidence is lacking, continuous EFM may lead to
improved neonatal outcomes.

EFM was employed in the PREMODA study, where excellent results of planned vaginal breech birth are
documented. Breech presentation is associated with an increased risk of cord prolapse. During delivery,
D
cord compression as the head enters the pelvis is common; this is likely to be better tolerated by a fetus Evidence
that is not hypoxic. Equally, good fetal tone enables easier breech birth and is more likely in a nonhypoxic level 3
fetus. While good evidence is lacking and higher intrapartum caesarean section rates should be expected,
EFM is likely to improve neonatal outcomes.
Where EFM is declined, intermittent auscultation should be performed as for a cephalic fetus, with conversion to
EFM if any abnormality is detected.

technically possible, is not recommended.

Where should vaginal breech birth take place?
Birth in a hospital with facilities for immediate caesarean section should be recommended with

with breech presentation.*

6.5 What guidelines should be in place for the management of breech birth?
Women should be informed that adherence to a protocol for management reduces the chances
of early neonatal morbidity.
C
The essential components of planned vaginal breech birth are appropriate case selection,
management according to a strict protocol and the availability of skilled attendants.

Evidence from a number of retrospective studies shows that vaginal breech birth is more successful in Evidence
women where strict guidelines for selection are used. 34,43

Management of the first stage and passive second stage
6.6
Adequate descent of the breech in the passive second stage is a prerequisite for
encouragement of the active second stage.
The first stage of labour should be managed according to the same principles as with a cephalic
presentation. To reduce the risk of cord compression, amniotomy is reserved for definite clinical
indications. Where the progress is slow, caesarean section should be considered. In the presence of
epidural analgesia and a contraction frequency of fewer than four in ten, however, oxytocin may be
considered. A passive second stage to allow the descent of the breech to the perineum prior to active
pushing is recommended. If the breech is not visible within 2 hours of the passive second stage,
caesarean section should normally be recommended.

6.7
What position should the woman be in for delivery during a vaginal breech birth?
Either a semirecumbent or an all-fours position may be adopted for delivery and should
depend on maternal preference and the experience of the attendant. If the latter position is
used, women should be advised that recourse to the semirecumbent position may become
necessary.
46
There are limited data in relation to position and outcome of delivery in vaginal breech birth. Comparison
of an upright position with historical data is favourable, 45 with the rate of maternal perineal injuries being
lower. In a cephalic presentation, an upright position is associated with a shorter second stage.*
Compared with the dorsal supine position, the all-fours position considerably increases pelvic dimensions
on magnetic resonance imaging. 47 Delivery with the woman in a forward-facing position (squatting or all
fours) is the position favoured by many experienced operators 40 claiming, particularly, that it is easier to
observe for signs that the delivery will be more difficult.
✓
Evidence
level 3
The principal difficulty with an all-fours position is when manoeuvres are required. Most obstetricians are
more familiar with performing these in a difficult breech birth with the woman in the dorsal position. If a
woman chooses a forward-facing position, they should be made aware that if interventions are required, Evidence
they may be given assistance to move into a dorsal recumbent position. Manoeuvres in an all-fours level 4
position can be performed, however, and if the operator has the skills of undertaking the manoeuvres
with the mother in a forward position these should be performed without delay.
6.8
40
What are the principles for the management of active second stage and vaginal breech birth?
Assistance, without traction, is required if there is delay or evidence of poor fetal condition.
All obstetricians and midwives should be familiar with the techniques that can be used to assist
vaginal breech birth. The choice of manoeuvres used, if required to assist with delivery of the
breech, should depend on the individual experience/preference of the attending doctor or
midwife.
While involuntary pushing may occur earlier, encouragement of maternal effort should not start until the breech is
visible. Once the buttocks have passed the perineum, significant cord compression is common. Traction should also
be avoided; a 'hands-off' approach is required, but with appropriate and timely intervention if progress is not made
once the umbilicus has delivered or there is poor tone, extended arms or an extended neck. Tactile stimulation of
the fetus may result in reflex extension of the arms or head, and should be minimised. Care must be taken in all
manoeuvres to avoid fetal trauma: the fetus should be grasped around the pelvic girdle (not soft tissues) and the
neck should never be hyperextended. Selective rather than routine episiotomy is recommended.
Signs that delivery should be assisted include lack of tone or colour, or delay, commonly due to extended arms or
an extended neck. In general, intervention to expedite breech birth is required if there is evidence of poor fetal
condition or if there is a delay of more than 5 minutes from delivery of the buttocks to the head, or of more than
3 minutes from the umbilicus to the head.
RCOG Guideline No. 20b

The semirecumbent position
There is little comparative evidence regarding techniques of assisted breech delivery. If the back starts to rotate
posteriorly, gentle rotation without traction should be used to ensure that it remains anterior. Once the scapula is
visible, the arms can be hooked down by inserting a finger in the elbow and flexing the arms across the chest or,
if nuchal, Lovset's manoeuvre is advised. Delivery is achieved either with the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre or
with forceps. Suprapubic pressure will aid flexion if there is delay due to an extended neck. Delivery using the
Burns-Marshall technique is not advised due to concern of over extension of the fetal neck.
14
An alternative is the routine use of the Bracht manoeuvre, a mode of delivery favoured in Europe and in
the PREMODA study. Following spontaneous delivery to the level of the umbilicus, the body is grasped
in both hands keeping the legs flexed against the baby's abdomen and, without traction, is brought up
against the symphysis pubis, frequently accompanied by suprapubic pressure.

7.1
How should preterm singleton babies in breech presentation be delivered?
Women should be informed that routine caesarean section for breech presentation in
spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended. The mode of delivery should be
individualised based on the stage of labour, type of breech presentation, fetal wellbeing and
availability of an operator skilled in vaginal breech delivery.
Women should be informed that caesarean section for breech presentation in spontaneous
preterm labour at the threshold of viability (22-25+6 weeks of gestation) is not routinely
recommended.
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm
breech presentation where delivery is planned due to maternal and/or fetal compromise.
Breech presentation is more common preterm and most preterm deliveries are unplanned as a result of
spontaneous preterm labour. Adequate high-quality evidence in relation to the management of preterm
breech birth has proved impossible 48 and the evidence regarding term breech should not be extrapolated
directly to preterm breech delivery. Rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality are higher following
preterm delivery, irrespective of the mode of delivery.

A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effects of planned immediate caesarean section versus
planned vaginal birth for women thought to be in preterm labour with a singleton (cephalic or breech
presentation).49 Data were very limited on clinically relevant outcomes and confidence intervals were
wide, but there were no significant differences with respect to immediate outcomes and no significant
differences between the two groups for abnormal follow-up in childhood. Maternal puerperal pyrexia
was significantly more likely in the caesarean section group (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18–7.53), but there were
no other significant differences in maternal morbidity outcomes.
50
A systematic review and meta-analysis of nonrandomised studies assessing vaginal delivery versus
caesarean section in preterm breech delivery included seven studies involving a total of 3557 women.*
The primary outcome was neonatal mortality. Preterm birth was defined as a gestational age of
25+0 up to 36+6 weeks, and studies published before 1980 or defined by low birthweight rather than
gestational age were excluded. The weighted risk of neonatal mortality was 3.8% in the caesarean
section group and 11.5% in the vaginal delivery group (pooled RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48–0.81). Mortality
differences varied according to study setting with the largest study of 2674 women in Sweden
demonstrating a halving of neonatal mortality with caesarean section.
51
Several retrospective cohort studies have evaluated the relationship between low birthweight and breech
delivery. Muhuri et al. 52 reported that very low birthweight breech or malpresenting fetuses delivered by
a primary caesarean section had significantly lower adjusted relative risks of neonatal death compared
with those delivered vaginally. Demirci et al.53 reported no difference in neonatal complications between
vaginal delivery and caesarean section for babies with birthweights of less than 1000 g or more than
1500 g, but reported an increased mortality associated with vaginal delivery for babies with birthweights
of 1000-1500 g. A population-based study of preterm low birthweight (less than 2500 g) newborns in
California reported significantly increased neonatal mortality with vaginal delivery compared with
caesarean section in all birthweight groups and increased birth trauma in babies with birthweights of
1500-2500 g. However, the caesarean section rate was 86%, suggesting that few vaginal breech
deliveries are conducted and experience may be limited. A further study of survival and morbidity for the
breech fetus at the threshold of viability (23+0 to 24+6 weeks of gestation and 400-750 g birthweight) had
similar proportions of vaginal and caesarean deliveries. 55 Caesarean delivery was associated with a survival
benefit across all birthweights, but morbidity was higher in the caesarean section group. It has been
suggested that the lower gestational age of breech babies in a preterm cohort may account for the
apparently increased mortality and morbidity.

that the retrospective studies cited above which suggest that caesarean section confers a better outcome
in this situation have been subject to selection bias. 58,59 The poor outcome for very low birthweight

In the absence of robust evidence that a preterm baby presenting by the breech needs to be delivered
routinely by immediate caesarean section, the decision about mode of delivery should be made by an
experienced obstetrician following a thorough clinical evaluation, and in consultation with the woman and
partner. The stage of labour is critical: the course of preterm labour may be protracted and Evidence
unpredictable, immediate caesarean section may lead to earlier delivery than vaginal and might hinder the level 4
effect of steroids or prevent the use of magnesium. Likewise, it is prudent to reassess the patient in

uterus is found to be empty with the fetus already delivered vaginally.64

Evidence concerning the management of preterm labour with a breech presentation is lacking. Routine
amniotomy should be avoided. A specific problem encountered during preterm breech delivery is delivery
of the trunk through an incompletely dilated cervix; this occurs in up to 14% of vaginal deliveries.63 In this
situation, lateral cervical incisions have been used to release the after-coming head. The RCOG StratOG
programme recommends incisions at 2, 6 and 10 o'clock. Similar rates of head entrapment have been
described for vaginal and abdominal delivery.64 For head entrapment at caesarean delivery, it may be
necessary to extend the uterine incision to a J shape or inverted T.

Almost half of all twin pregnancies will deliver preterm and decisions regarding mode of delivery need to
be made in that context. If preterm delivery has not occurred, delivery from 37 weeks of gestation is now
recommended. Similar to preterm breech presentation, high-quality evidence is lacking in relation to the
management of twin birth and breech presentation. In a systematic review of three cohort studies
(1812 women) and one randomised controlled trial (120 women), twins with the first twin presenting as
breech were less likely to have a low 5-minute Apgar score if they had a planned caesarean section
(OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17–0.65).66 A further study 67 compared the outcomes of breech presenting first twins
over two time periods, where the caesarean section rate increased from 21% to almost 95%. No Evidence
significant differences in neonatal morbidity or mortality were reported, but there was an increase in level 2+
maternal morbidity in association with caesarean delivery. In a retrospective cohort study of 195 term
twin pregnancies where the presenting twin was breech, Sentilhes et al. 68 compared the outcomes of the
124 attempts at vaginal delivery (48% vaginal delivery rate) with elective caesarean. There was no
difference in the composite primary outcome. Steins Bisschop et al. 69 in a 2012 review concluded that
there was no benefit to the near routine practice of caesarean section if the first twin was breech. One
common concern is the interlocking of twins. Although Cohen et al.70 reported an incidence of 1 in 817,
this is probably an underestimate.
71
Given the uncertain risks, the quality of the evidence, the continuing controversy with singletons and the
exclusion of a nonvertex twin in the 2013 twin trial, a change to the current practice of planned
caesarean section is not recommended.

8.2 How should a second twin in breech presentation be delivered?
Routine caesarean section for breech presentation of the second twin is not recommended in
either term or preterm deliveries.
The second twin is nonvertex at the time of delivery in about 40% of twin pregnancies. One
randomised study has been conducted of twin deliveries where the presentation of the second twin
was nonvertex.'
72 The results showed no difference in 5-minute Apgar scores or in any other indices of
neonatal morbidity between the two groups, but the power to detect differences was low as the study
only included 60 women with twins. Barrett et al.71 randomised 1398 women with a twin pregnancy at
32 to 386 weeks of gestation to planned caesarean section or planned vaginal birth. Outcomes of
planned vaginal delivery included 507 women (36% of all planned vaginal births) whose second twin was
presenting as nonvertex. This trial concluded there was no difference in the composite primary
outcome of mortality or serious morbidity. However, the caesarean section rate was almost 44%
among planned vaginal births and a subgroup analysis of the second twins presenting nonvertex was
not available.

Evidence
The observational studies report conflicting results. Ginsberg and Levine' reported that with second
twin deliveries, low Apgar scores were less frequent when delivery was by caesarean section. A
population-based cohort study 74 of twin deliveries in the USA, using birth certificates and reporting on
infants weighing 1500-4000 g, found a significantly higher frequency of neonatal death, injury and level 2-
perinatal morbidity when both twins of a vertex/nonvertex presentation were delivered vaginally than
when both twins were delivered by caesarean section.

In contrast, a study in France of 614 twins showed no significant morbidity differences and concluded that
76

level 2-
the type of presentation should not influence the choice of mode of delivery. In a retrospective cohort Evidence
study of 1038 twins in the UK, neonatal morbidity after vaginal delivery was similar for nonvertex-
presenting and vertex second twins, particularly at lower gestational ages.
The presentation of the second twin at delivery is not always predictable. The chance of cephalic delivery may be
improved by routinely guiding the head of the second twin towards the pelvis during and immediately after
delivery of the first twin. On the other hand, some attendants prefer to routinely expedite delivery of the second
twin by internal version and breech extraction irrespective of the presentation. There is no evidence as to which
is safest.

What organisational and governance arrangements should be in place to support a routine
vaginal breech delivery service?
Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills that are needed during vaginal
breech birth by all doctors and midwives.
Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed
in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births. Adherence to
the guidelines is recommended to reduce the risk of intrapartum complications.
Departments should consider developing a checklist to ensure comprehensive counselling of the
woman regarding planned mode of delivery for babies presenting by the breech.
C
The evidence discussed on vaginal breech birth supports the adherence to a strict management Evidence
protocol 14 and the presence of skilled birth attendants.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: 'systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for specific conditions'. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be
evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations
in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into
routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
