Long-term Consequences of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Diagnosis
PCOS should be diagnosed according to the Rotterdam consensus criteria.

Counselling
Women diagnosed with PCOS should be informed of the possible long-term risks to health associated with their condition by their healthcare professional.

Metabolic consequences
- Screening for gestational diabetes should be considered for women with PCOS before pregnancy.
- Women with PCOS should be screened for type II diabetes.
- Women should be asked about snoring and daytime fatigue for possible sleep apnoea.
- All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors at diagnosis.

Cancer and PCOS
Women with PCOS should be monitored for endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.
No additional surveillance is required for breast or ovarian cancer.

Strategies for reduction of risk
- Lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and weight loss, should be the first line of treatment.
- Insulin-sensitising agents have not been shown to confer long-term benefits.
- Ovarian electrocautery and bariatric surgery may be considered for certain patients.

Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events and deaths, so it is important to assess their cardiovascular risk factors. Conventional cardiovascular risk calculators have not been validated in women with PCOS, so individual risk factors should be assessed and treated accordingly. Lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and weight loss, are recommended as the first line of treatment for women with PCOS. Women with PCOS should also be screened for psychological issues, such as depression and anxiety. Oligo- or amenorrhoea in women with PCOS may predispose them to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, so regular screening is important. Bariatric surgery may be an option for morbidly obese women with PCOS if standard weight loss strategies have failed. Further research is needed in this area to improve long-term outcomes for women with PCOS.

Clinical guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome recommend lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, as well as medication like metformin to manage symptoms and reduce long-term health risks. It is also important to monitor cardiovascular health, insulin resistance, and mental health in women with PCOS. Regular follow-up appointments and screenings for endometrial hyperplasia and gynecological cancers are recommended.

Psychological interventions for overweight or obesity can have a beneficial effect on fertility in women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex condition with psychological, reproductive, and metabolic manifestations that impact health across the lifespan. Weight control is recommended for the prevention, identification, assessment, and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children. Metformin has been shown to be effective in treating clinical, hormonal, and metabolic characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome. It can reduce hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenemia, and systolic blood pressure, while facilitating normal menses and pregnancy. Metformin treatment can also reduce the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its hepatic involvement in young overweight patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Bariatric surgery may resolve polycystic ovary syndrome associated with morbid obesity. It is important to consider individual patient needs and resources when determining the appropriate course of management or treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty may require further research.
