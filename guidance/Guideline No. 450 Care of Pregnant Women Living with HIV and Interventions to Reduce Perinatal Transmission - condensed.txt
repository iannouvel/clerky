Guideline No. 450: Care of Pregnant Women Living with HIV and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal Transmission

RECOMMENDED CHANGES IN PRACTICE
1. Pregnant women should be offered pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV.
2. Women living with HIV should generally continue established antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy.
3. Past serology results and medical history should be reviewed for pregnancy-relevant co-infections.
4. Evaluation and treatment of nausea during pregnancy is critical.
5. Pregnancy care providers should be aware of potential drug interactions with antiretrovirals.
6. Nevirapine should not be prescribed for the first time in pregnancy.
7. Oral nevirapine is no longer recommended for intrapartum prophylaxis.
8. Categorization of risk of perinatal transmission should be based on adherence to the antiretroviral regimen and viral load near delivery.
9. Antiretroviral therapy should be continued during labor and delivery.

KEY MESSAGES
1. With consistent use of antiretrovirals, newborn prophylaxis, and avoidance of breastfeeding, the rates of HIV transmission to the newborn is <1%.
2. Multidisciplinary input is important for managing HIV in pregnancy.
3. New treatments and information on antiretrovirals require real-time assessment.

SUMMARY STATEMENTS
1. With consistent use of antiretroviral therapy and abstinence from breastfeeding, the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV is less than 1%.
2. Antiretroviral therapy is indicated for all pregnant women living with HIV.
3. Individualization of antiretroviral therapy will maximize adherence.
4. Inclusion of data on pregnancies affected by HIV in surveillance programs is important.

In Canada, formula feeding is preferred for infants of mothers with HIV, but if a mother chooses to breastfeed, enhanced surveillance and treatment for the infant should be planned with pediatric HIV experts. Pregnant women living with HIV should receive antiretroviral therapy for their own health and to prevent perinatal transmission. All pregnant women should be screened for HIV, and pre-exposure prophylaxis should be offered when indicated. Early diagnosis of HIV in pregnancy is crucial for reducing perinatal transmission. Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated immediately, considering the stage of pregnancy, the woman's health status, and drug access. Adherence to the regimen is essential. Consultation with experts in HIV care is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV.

In cases of HIV infection, access to safe termination of pregnancy services should be facilitated if the woman with HIV does not wish to continue the pregnancy. Health care providers should use this opportunity to optimize HIV care and provide reproductive health counseling, including contraception. Antiretroviral therapy is required to reduce HIV viral load at delivery, even in women with low or undetectable baseline viral loads. Recommendations for continuation of therapy in pregnancy should be followed. Monitoring of the woman's clinical, virological, and immunological status should be done regularly throughout the pregnancy. Management of pregnant women with advanced HIV and detectable viral loads requires specialized input from infectious disease specialists. Close clinical follow-up and adjustments to obstetrical assessments and prophylaxis are recommended in the third trimester. Discussions regarding mode of delivery should begin early in pregnancy. Intrapartum management for low and high risk of perinatal transmission should be based on viral load levels and obstetrical factors. Elective cesarean delivery is recommended for high-risk cases. Recommendations for intrapartum management include continuing antiretroviral medications, avoiding fetal scalp blood sampling, and initiating intravenous zidovudine.

Intrapartum management for women with unknown HIV status or ongoing risk includes rapid HIV testing, immediate confirmatory testing, and initiation of intravenous zidovudine. Expedited delivery, consultation with pediatricians, and planning for neonatal antiretroviral therapy are essential. Postpartum care should include planning for infant feeding, antiretroviral continuation, contraception, and psychosocial support. Infant feeding should prioritize formula feeding, but if a woman chooses to breastfeed, close monitoring and adherence to antiretroviral therapy are necessary. Postpartum contraception should be discussed, considering potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy. Coordination of care and ongoing assessment for HIV transmission are crucial for reducing perinatal transmission risk.

Summary:
- Nucleoside/Nucleotide Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) are recommended for use in combination regimens during pregnancy.
- Protease Inhibitors should be used with a boosting agent in pregnancy, with specific recommendations for preferred and not recommended options.
- Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended in pregnancy, with specific recommendations for preferred options.
- Considerations for preterm delivery, hyperbilirubinemia, and drug interactions are important in pregnant women living with HIV.

Dolutegravir-containing regimens can be used in the peri-conception period and first trimester along with folic acid supplementation. Elvitegravir has no reported increased birth defect risk, while data is insufficient for bictegravir and cabotegravir in pregnancy. NNRTIs may be used in pregnancy with a dual-NRTI backbone. Efavirenz and rilpivirine are alternative agents in pregnancy. Nevirapine initiation is not recommended in pregnancy, but can be continued if already tolerated. Limited safety data exists for etravirine and doravirine in pregnancy. NNRTIs have variable placental transfer to the fetus. Teratogenicity data for NNRTIs is limited and variable. Efavirenz use at conception does not show a statistically significant increased risk of birth defects. Rilpivirine requires an acidic environment for absorption and should not be used with acid suppression agents. Other agents in pregnancy are not recommended due to insufficient data on safety and pharmacokinetics.
