DIAGNOSTIC HYSTEROSCOPY UNDER 
GENERAL ANAESTHESIA
This is the second edition of this guidance, which was previously published in October 2004 under the
same title.
This paper provides advice for clinicians in obtaining the consent of women undergoing diagnostic
hysteroscopy under general anaesthesia. It follows the structure of  Consent Form 1 of the Department
of Health, England/Welsh Assembly Government/Scottish Government/Department of Health, Social
Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland. It should be used in conjunction with RCOG Clinical
Governance Advice, Obtaining Valid Consent .1
The aim of this advice is to ensure that all women are given consistent and adequate information for
consent; it is intended to be used together with dedicated patient information.  After discharge, all
women should have clear direction to obtain help if there are unforeseen problems.
Clinicians should be prepared to discuss with the woman any of the points listed on the following
pages.
The above descriptors are based on the RCOG Clinical Governance Advice, Presenting Information on Risk .2  They 
are used throughout this document.
To assist clinicians at a local level, we have included at the end of this document a fully printable page
2 of the Department of Health, England/Welsh Assembly Government/Scottish Government/Depart-
ment of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland, Consent Form 1. This page can be
incorporated into local trust documents, subject to local trust governance approval.Presenting information on risk
Term Equivalent numerical ratio Colloquial equivalent
Very common 1/1   to   1/10 A person in family
Common 1/10   to   1/100 A person in street
Uncommon 1/100   to   1/1000 A person in village
Rare 1/1000   to   1/10 000 A person in small town
Very rare Less than  1/10 000 A person in large townCONSENT FORM
1. Name of proposed procedure or course of treatment
Diagnostic hysteroscopy under general anaesthesia.
2. The proposed procedure
Describe the nature of hysteroscopy. Explain the procedure as described in the patient information.
Note: If any other procedures are anticipated (such as endometrial biopsy, removal of polyp, insertion of
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, treatment of fibroids or division of adhesions) these must be
discussed and a separate consent obtained.
3. Intended benefits
To find the cause of symptoms; as it is a diagnostic procedure it will not alter symptoms unless additional
procedures are anticipated. Occasionally, a minor procedure is appropriate to treat some of the identified
causes or relieve the symptoms.
4. Serious and frequently occurring risk
It is recommended that clinicians make every effort to separate serious from frequently occurring risks.
Women who are obese, who have significant pathology, who have undergone previous surgery or who have
pre-existing medical conditions must understand that the quoted risks for serious or frequent complications
will be increased. The risk of serious complications also increases if an additional therapeutic procedure is
performed. Women should be advised that hysteroscopy may not identify an obvious cause for presenting
complaint.
4.1 Serious risks
Serious risks include:3
●The overall risk of serious complications from diagnostic hysteroscopy is approximately two women in every
1000 (uncommon)
●Damage to the uterus (uncommon)
●Damage to bowel, bladder or major blood vessels (rare)
●Failure to gain entry to uterine cavity and complete intended procedure (uncommon)
●Infertility (rare)
●three to eight women in every 100 000 undergoing hysteroscopy die as a result of complications 
(very rare).
4.2 Frequent risks
Frequent risks include:
●infection
●bleeding.
5. Any extra procedures which may become necessary during the procedure
Laparoscopy or laparotomy in the event of perforation.
6. What the procedure is likely to involve; the benefits and risks of any available alternative
treatments, including no treatment
Vaginal approach and insertion of a hysteroscope through the cervix.  The role of endometrial biopsy and
pelvic ultrasound should be discussed along with the option of no investigation.
Consent Advice 1 2of47. Statement of patient: procedures which should not be carried out without further
discussion
Other procedures which may be appropriate but not essential at the time should be discussed and the woman’s
wishes recorded.
8. Preoperative information
A record should be made of any sources of information (e.g. RCOG or locally produced information
leaflets/tapes) given to the woman prior to surgery.
9. Anaesthesia
Where possible, the woman must be aware of the form of anaesthesia planned and be given an opportunity to
discuss this in detail with the anaesthetist before surgery. It should be noted that, with obesity, there are
increased risks, both surgical and anaesthetic.
