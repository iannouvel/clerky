Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage
Risk factors for PPH should be identified and managed, including treating antenatal anaemia and reducing blood loss at delivery. Uterotonics should be routinely offered during the third stage of labor. Oxytocin is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in vaginal deliveries, while oxytocin or ergometrine-oxytocin may be used in cesarean sections. Tranexamic acid may also be considered in addition to oxytocin for women at increased risk of PPH. Communication and multidisciplinary care are essential in managing PPH, with prompt resuscitation measures for minor and major PPH. Blood transfusion protocols should be followed, and intraoperative cell salvage may be considered. Monitoring and investigation are crucial in major PPH, with appropriate actions taken based on clinical assessment. Surgical interventions should be considered if pharmacological measures fail. Training and preparation are key to optimal management of PPH, and accurate documentation and debriefing should be conducted after each case.

Increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units. Obstetricians and midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community, including PPH. This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH. The prevention and management of PPH related to placenta praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in a separate guideline. Obstetric haemorrhage remains a major cause of maternal death. Risk factors for PPH should be identified and managed. Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated. Uterine massage is not beneficial in preventing PPH. Prophylactic uterotonics should be offered in the third stage of labor. Oxytocin is the preferred agent for prophylaxis in the third stage of labor for vaginal delivery. Carbetocin may be considered for prevention of PPH in the context of cesarean delivery.

Guidelines recommend carbetocin for prevention of PPH in elective caesarean deliveries. Tranexamic acid has been found effective in reducing blood loss in women undergoing caesarean section. Clinical signs and symptoms should be used to assess PPH severity. Communication with the woman and multidisciplinary care are crucial in managing PPH. Resuscitation measures vary based on the severity of PPH, with fluid replacement and blood transfusion being key components. The decision to transfuse red cells should be based on clinical and haematological assessment.

Selection of red cell units for transfusion must include emergency blood provision with immediate issue of group O, RhD-negative and K-negative units. In cases of clinically significant red cell antibodies, close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential to avoid delays in transfusion during life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnant women who are RhD negative should only receive RhD-negative blood to prevent alloimmunization. Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in postpartum hemorrhage. Delivery units should maintain a supply of group O, RhD-negative blood. It is important to maintain a plasma fibrinogen level of at least 2 g/l during ongoing postpartum hemorrhage. Platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 x 10^9/l. Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of postpartum hemorrhage.

Tranexamic acid is being studied for its effectiveness in treating PPH. Recombinant factor VIIa therapy is not recommended unless part of a clinical trial. Monitoring and investigation in major PPH is crucial for proper management. The role of the anaesthetist is important in maintaining stability. A combination of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical methods should be used to stop the bleeding in PPH. Surgical interventions should be considered if pharmacological measures fail. Intrauterine balloon tamponade is a first-line surgical intervention for uterine atony. Hysterectomy may be necessary in severe cases. Compression of the aorta can be a temporary measure to allow time for resuscitation. Management of placenta praevia accreta requires specific guidance.

5.6.2.1 Uterine balloon tamponade
Tamponade using various types of hydrostatic balloon catheter has superseded uterine packing for the control of atonic PPH. The urological Rusch balloon has been described as preferable by virtue of larger capacity, ease of use, and low cost. Balloon tamponade can serve as a 'test' to determine the need for further intervention. Evidence supports the effectiveness of uterine balloon tamponade in resource-poor settings.

5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing
Haemostatic brace sutures, such as the B-Lynch suturing technique, have shown success in treating PPH due to atony and placenta previa. Risk factors for hysterectomy after uterine compression suture include increasing age and vaginal delivery. Combined use of haemostatic suturing and balloon tamponade has been reported in managing PPH.

5.6.2.3 Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation
Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation are conservative surgical treatments for PPH that have shown effectiveness in controlling bleeding. These techniques should be performed by experienced clinicians due to the complexity and potential risks involved.

5.6.2.4 Selective arterial occlusion or embolisation by interventional radiology
Arterial embolisation can be effective in managing PPH, especially after failed internal iliac artery ligation. The procedure does not impair subsequent fertility or obstetric outcomes.

5.6.2.5 Hysterectomy
Hysterectomy should be considered by experienced clinicians in cases of severe PPH, especially with placenta accreta or uterine rupture. Subtotal hysterectomy is often preferred, and there has been a decrease in the proportion of women requiring hysterectomy for PPH.

6. How should secondary PPH be managed?
Secondary PPH requires an assessment of vaginal microbiology, pelvic ultrasound to exclude retained products of conception, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy when needed. Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be supervised by experienced clinicians.

7. Risk management
Maternity units should have a multidisciplinary protocol for PPH management, and all staff should receive training in obstetric emergencies, including PPH. Cases of PPH with significant blood loss should undergo formal clinical incident review to improve future management. Training and simulation have been shown to enhance knowledge and skills in managing PPH.

Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential for clinical management and medicolegal purposes. The team should record staff attendance, events, pharmacological agents, surgical interventions, mother's condition, and fluid and blood product administration. Women who experience major PPH should be offered debriefing to address psychological effects and future pregnancy concerns. Studies are needed to determine optimal treatments for PPH.
