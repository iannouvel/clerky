SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE
No. 454, October 2024
Guideline No. 454: Identification and Treatment of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders
Perinatal mental illness (PMI) encompasses mental health issues and psychiatric disorders during and after pregnancy, up to one year following delivery. PMI can include both pre-existing and new onset mental health problems, with mood and anxiety disorders being the most common presentations. The transition to parenthood may be difficult, and untreated or poorly managed PMI can adversely affect maternal, partner, fetal, and infant health. It is important for health care providers to identify and assist pregnant and postpartum patients with PMI, focusing on risk factors, screening, treatment, and referral. Patient-centered care, using a culturally, gender- and trauma-informed care approach, is crucial for improved patient outcomes.

Anxiety during pregnancy can lead to poor outcomes for both the mother and child, including preterm birth and impaired development. Untreated anxiety can also increase the risk of maternal self-harm and suicide. Maternal mental health has long-term effects on children, impacting their cognitive and emotional development. Interventions for perinatal depression have shown positive effects on both maternal and infant outcomes. It is important to address maternal mental health to ensure the best outcomes for both mother and child.

Perinatal Mental Illness
Obsessive-compulsive disorders:
- Pre-existing beliefs about uncertainty
- Symptoms of depression
- Poor sleep
- Family history of OCD
- Obstetric complications
- Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
- Avoidant personality disorder
- History of pregnancy loss
- Preterm delivery
- Cesarean delivery
Postpartum posttraumatic disorder:
- Depression or trauma during pregnancy
- Obstetrical emergency
- Fetal or newborn loss
- Infant complication
- History of trauma / sexual abuse
- Fear of childbirth (tokophobia)
- Inadequate social support
Postpartum psychosis:
- Bipolar disorder
- History of psychosis (postpartum or other)
- Family history of psychotic illness
- Sleep deprivation
- Medication discontinuation

Racialized Minorities:
- Higher incidences of perinatal depression and anxiety
- Fear of stigma associated with diagnosis
- Differences in timing of treatment initiation

Immigrants and Refugees:
- Rates of perinatal depression and major depressive disorder
- Barriers to accessing perinatal mental health care

Adolescents:
- Increased risk of PMI
- Higher rates of depression and anxiety
- Increased use of substances impacting mental health

Gender-Diverse Patients:
- Higher rates of mental distress, anxiety, and depression

Trauma-Informed Care:
- Trauma history can impact treatment engagement
- Trauma-related disorders common in perinatal period
- Trauma-informed care approach can mitigate effects

Screening and Assessment for Perinatal Mental Illness:
- Assessment of risk factors and mental health history
- Screening with validated tools for depression and anxiety
- Tailored referral process for comprehensive care pathway
- Screening tools for mental illnesses include EPDS, CES-D scale, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory

GAD-7: Screens for generalized anxiety disorder. Total score ranges from 0 to 21, with >8 indicating probable cases of GAD.
PSAT: Measures pregnancy-specific anxiety. Total score ranges from 6 to 24, with >10 requiring further assessment.
Mood Disorder Questionnaire: Screens for bipolar disorder symptoms. Positive screen if 7 or more items are answered affirmatively.
Insomnia Severity Index: Screens for insomnia. Scores range from 0 to 28, with a cut-off of 10 for a diagnosis of insomnia.
Y-BOCS: Rates severity of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Scores range from 0-40, with >34 indicating severe symptoms.

Facilitators to identification, treatment, and referral include how barriers influence provider behavior, collaborative care models, training providers, and community-based resources. Access to perinatal mental health care should consider language and literacy, social determinants of health, protective factors, and decolonizing and destigmatizing care. Innovative strategies and approaches are urgently needed to meet the demand for care and improve health outcomes.

Perinatal depression screening guidelines are available from various organizations and should be implemented to improve maternal mental health outcomes. It is important to address barriers to treatment and provide support for pregnant and postnatal women experiencing mental health issues. Peer support programs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and patient-centered care can help in managing perinatal anxiety and depression. It is crucial to prioritize maternal mental health and address structural barriers to care to improve outcomes for women during the perinatal period.
