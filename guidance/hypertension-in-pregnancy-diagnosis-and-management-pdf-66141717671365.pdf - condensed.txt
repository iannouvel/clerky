Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management NICE guideline. Recommendations include advising pregnant women to see a healthcare professional immediately if they experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia, such as severe headache or sudden swelling. Other recommendations cover the use of aspirin for high-risk women and caution against certain pharmaceutical agents and nutritional supplements. Lifestyle advice for pregnant women with chronic hypertension or at risk of hypertensive disorders is also provided. Management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy includes offering pre-pregnancy advice and discussing alternative antihypertensive treatments for women taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Impact section on monitoring and treatment of gestational hypertension. Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women with gestational hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, unless there are other medical indications. For women with gestational hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg after 37 weeks, timing of birth should be agreed between the woman and the senior obstetrician. Offer antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate if planned early birth is necessary. After birth, monitor blood pressure daily for the first 2 days, then at least once between days 3 and 5, and as clinically indicated if antihypertensive treatment is changed. Continue antihypertensive treatment as needed, adjust if blood pressure falls below 130/80 mmHg. Adjust treatment postnatally based on blood pressure levels. Offer medical review to women on antihypertensive treatment 2 weeks after transfer to community care. Offer all women a medical review 6 to 8 weeks after birth. Assess women with pre-eclampsia for clinical concerns and consider using risk prediction models to guide care decisions. Offer appropriate tests and treatments for pregnant women with pre-eclampsia based on blood pressure levels. Record maternal and fetal thresholds for planned early birth before 37 weeks in women with pre-eclampsia. Involve a senior obstetrician in timing decisions for birth. Discuss with the anesthetic and neonatal teams if birth is planned for women with pre-eclampsia. Offer magnesium sulfate and antenatal corticosteroids if indicated for early birth in women with preterm pre-eclampsia. Decide on timing of birth based on guidelines.

Consider antenatal corticosteroids in line with the NICE guideline on preterm labor and birth. Initiate birth within 24 to 48 hours after 37 weeks onwards. Monitor blood pressure in women with pre-eclampsia post-birth. Offer medical review for women on antihypertensive treatment post-birth. Monitor hematological and biochemical levels post-birth. Provide fetal monitoring for women with chronic hypertension or gestational hypertension. Give advice and treatment to women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy during labor. Monitor blood pressure hourly during labor. Consider anticonvulsants for women with severe pre-eclampsia in a critical care setting.

Use the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial regimen for administration of magnesium sulfate, do not use diazepam, phenytoin, or other anticonvulsants as an alternative. Treat women with severe hypertension in critical care immediately with labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine. Consider corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation in women with pre-eclampsia. Choose the mode of birth based on clinical circumstances and preferences. Refer women with severe hypertension or severe pre-eclampsia to the appropriate critical care setting. Offer antihypertensive treatment during the postnatal period, including during breastfeeding. Advise women with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that their treatment can be adjusted. Monitor babies for possible adverse effects if antihypertensive agents are used. Consider different antihypertensive medications based on individual factors. Provide follow-up care and advice on the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in future pregnancies. Inform women about the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease associated with a history of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

Cardiovascular disease, hypertension in pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension in pregnancy, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, hypertension. Advise women with a history of hypertension in pregnancy to discuss reducing their risk of cardiovascular disease with their GP or specialist. Consider pre-pregnancy counseling for women with pre-eclampsia or hypertension with early birth before 34 weeks. Encourage women who have had pre-eclampsia to achieve and maintain a healthy weight before their next pregnancy. Advising women with pre-eclampsia that the likelihood of recurrence increases with an inter-pregnancy interval greater than 10 years. Tell women with a history of pre-eclampsia and no proteinuria and hypertension at the postnatal review that the risk of end-stage kidney disease is low. Do not routinely screen for thrombophilia in women who have had pre-eclampsia.

The committee recommended against using 24-hour urine collection due to lower diagnostic accuracy. PCR and ACR show high diagnostic accuracy and should be used instead. A PCR of 30 mg/mmol is recommended as the threshold for significant proteinuria, with retesting recommended for results above this threshold. A threshold of 8 mg/mmol for ACR is also recommended for pregnant women. Repeating the ACR measurement is advised if there is ongoing clinical uncertainty. Moving from 24-hour urine collection to spot urine ACR or PCR can save time, improve accuracy, and quality of life. Recommendations have been made for the use of either ACR or PCR, allowing for local decisions. Repeating the PCR or ACR test may incur a small additional cost but can reduce the false positive rate. For the treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy, lifestyle advice similar to other adults with hypertension is recommended. Labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa are preferred treatment options. Aspirin can be offered to reduce preterm births and neonatal unit admissions. Recommendations may lead to standardized practices and improve outcomes for women with chronic hypertension. The use of validated models to predict risk in women with pre-eclampsia may improve consistency in practice and guide interventions. The full clinical assessment and validated models may lead to more women being admitted to hospitals for pre-eclampsia. Recommendations for monitoring and treatment of pre-eclampsia and timing of birth are based on evidence reviewed and may lead to standardized practices for women at high risk of complications.

Based on the CHIPS study, the committee recommends using labetalol as the first-line treatment for hypertension in pregnancy, followed by nifedipine and then methyldopa. For pre-eclampsia, the timing of birth should be based on the risk to the woman and baby. The committee also recommends managing pregnancies in women with pre-eclampsia until 37 weeks unless there are specific concerns. Limited evidence exists on the best place of care for women with pre-eclampsia. 

In the postnatal period, the committee recommends using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as first-line treatment, except for women of African or Caribbean origin who should use a calcium-channel blocker first. Beta-blockers are recommended as the second-line treatment. Recommendations are also provided for breastfeeding while taking antihypertensives. 

Long-term follow-up studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women who experienced hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Recommendations are made for providing guidance on future risks and appropriate care. 

Hypertensive disorders affect around 8-10% of pregnant women and can have serious complications. Maternal mortality from hypertension has decreased significantly. The guideline aims to provide updated evidence-based recommendations to reduce variance in care and improve outcomes.
