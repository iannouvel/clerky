5.0 Principles 
 
Offer  care in a non-judgmental and supportive manner: with an overarching approach to 
understand that surrogacy is unique maintain accura te and contemporaneous records of 
discuss ions and decisions reached.   
 
Confidentiality is vital and disclosure should be made on a need to know basis.  Any 
reference  to the surrogacy arrangement in the medical n otes should only be made after 
discussion with and  permission from the su rrogate person . 
 
The needs of the surrogate person  should always be a priority and all (final) decisions rest 
with them. Information requested by the commissioning parents must be sanctioned by the 
surrogate and documen ted in the medical notes. 
 
 
6.0 Definitions  
6.1 Surrogacy  
 
Surrogacy is the practice  whereby one woman  and person  (the surrogate person ) 
becomes  pregnant, carries and gives birth to a child for another person(s) (the 
commissioning co uple). This is a s the result  of an agreement prior to conception that the 
child shou ld be handed over to that person after birth. 
 
There are two types : 
 
 Straight Surrogacy : Also known as genetic or traditional surrogacy is when 
the surrogate provides her own eggs to achieve the pregnancy. One of the IPs 
provides her own eggs to achieve the pregnancy. One of the IPs provides a 
sperm sampl e for conception either by home -insemination away from a 
licenced setting or artificial insemination with the h elp of a fertility clinic. Home -
insemination does carry risks if the sperm has not been screened for 
infections. Embryos may be created in vitro and transferred into the uterus of 
the surrogate through a UK clinic.  
 Full Surrogacy : Also known as host, gestational surrogacy is when the 
surrogate doesn’t provide her own egg to achieve the pregnancy. In such  
 
   
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 6 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
pregnancies, embryos are created invitro and transferred into the uterus of the 
surrogate using the gametes of at least one IP, plus the gametes of the other 
IP or a donor, if required.  
 
 
6.2 Comm issioning  couple (Intended parents)  
 
The commissioning cou ple are the people who wish to bring up the ch ild after his or her 
birth. They may both be the genetic parents, or one of them may be, or neither of them 
may be  genetically related to the ch ild. The woman  and person for whom the ch ild is to be 
carried (the 'commissioning mother') may be the genetic mother in that she provides the 
egg. The genetic father may be the husb and or  partner of the commissioning mother, or he 
may be an ano nymous donor. (DOH 1998). Intended parents who have no genetic 
connection to the child are not able to access the parental order and therefore extinguish 
the surrogate legal responsibility. It is therefore important for the surrogate/IP to seek legal 
advice . 
 
 
7.0 Accountabilities and responsibilities 
 
Whilst the co nfidentiality of the commissioning and surrogate parents should be uphe ld 
there will need to be certain communications to ensure staff are not comp licit in any  
illegal act  and that all health staff, who need to know, are informed. Please see flowchart 
in Appendix 1. 
 
 
8.0 Surrog acy and the law 
 
The legal framework for surrogacy is the Surrogacy Arrangements Act of 1985, amended in 
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill of 2 007. The intentions of the Surrogacy 
Arrangement Act of 1985 are summarized below: 
 
8.1 Surrogacy is an agreement arranged before the pregnancy begins, with intent  
for another  person to assume parental rights. Pregnancy is determined to begin 
at the time of insemination or embryo transfer. 
8.2 No person with any commercial interest in the surrogacy arrangement may 
initiate or negotiate any part of the surrogacy proceedings. 
8.3 It is illegal to advertise to seek or become  a surrogate, through any form of 
the UK media. 
8.4 Any person breach ing (8.2) and (8.3) above is liable for punishmen t, either a 
fine or by imprisonment. 
8.5 Should staff become suspicious that the parties are involved in a commercial 
arrangement, they should contact the Lead for Safeguarding children for further 
advice and guidance.  
 
The 2007 amendments clarify that non-profit making organisations (such as the agencies 
which ha ve a strong prevalence in many agreements today) are allowed to take part in the    
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 7 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
negotiations nec essary for a successful su rrogate pregnancy. Non-profit making 
organizations are allowed to advertise their services. 
 
Surrogacy UK website provides detailed advice on all aspects of surrogacy:

UK for Healthcare Professio nals.pdf 
 
 
9.0 Parental responsibility: Who  are the child’s legal parents? 
 
The Human  Fertilisation and Em bryology Act 1990 (2) section 27, states that the legal 
mother is always the surrogate mother regardless of genetic makeup and  she is legally 
responsible for the child until such  time as the intended parents seek a p arental orde r. 
 
The surrogate has the legal right to keep the child, even if it is not genetically related to her.  
Surrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable, even if a contract has been signed and 
the expenses of the surrogate have been paid.  
 
The surrogate will be the legal mother of the child unless or until parenthood is transferred to 
the intended person through a parental order. This is because, in law, the surrogate who 
gives birth is always treated as the mother or person.  
 
There are two methods  through which pa rental responsibility may be transferred. 
 
1. A parental order can be made if the case  satisfies section 30 of the Human  
Fertilisation and Embryology Act.  The criteria for accessing the PO are based on 
an enduring relationship not on marriage. It can also be accessed for solo parents 
via a remedial order.  
 
2. An app lication may be made to adopt the child under the Adoption Act 1976. 
 
UH Sussex  staff should ensu re that if there is any cause for concern that they take advice 
from the Safeguarding children’s named doctor or nurse / midwife.  
 
 
9.1 Same sex couples:  
 
Marriage (same sex Couples) Act 2013 set up a framework to allow same sex couples to 
achieve legal recognition of their relationship. Therefore same sex couples are able to apply 
for the parental order.  
 
 
9.2 Foreign commissioning parents and British Surro gate  
 
If neither commissioned parents is domiciled in the UK, they will not be eligible to apply for a 
parental Order. It would be critical that the parents and the surrogate obtain legal advi ce as 
adoption could contravene international adoption rules. Adoption would therefore be the only    
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 8 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
available option to obtain legal parenthood. It would be important to get legal advice on the 
legal status of any child born through surrogacy by non -domicile d intended parents.  
 
 
10.0 Procedures and actions to follow 
 
The immediate postnatal period is a time of great emotional upheaval, which may be 
compou nded in a surrogacy arrangement and great sensitivity is required in han dling 
both the surrogate and  commissioning parents. Where there is conflict the midwife must 
focus  their care on the surrogate person and bab y. 
 
 A child born to a surrogate must  be registered as her child. 
 The commissioning parents, having assumed care of the child,  have no legal 
relationship with it and no rights in law until a pa rental order has been made or 
unless the commissioning father is named on the birth certificate. 
 The HFEA advises that, until the parental ord er comes  into force, strictly speaking 
it is the legal surrogate  who should give conse nt for screening of the newborn.  
 Commissioning or  intended parents will apply for a pa rental ord er (if the genetic 
makeup of the baby comes from either or both of them) or an ado ption order where 
gametes from either of the commissioning parents have not been used.  Until this 
time (6 weeks – 6 months) the legal mother is the surrogate. 
 Handing over the baby will take place following discussion and agreement with the 
surrogate mother as the birth plan guide.  
 The surrogate is cared  for as per routine postnatal  care guidelines. The wom an 
and person ’s GP is notified of their discharge home. 
 The commissioning mother/person  and baby are notified to the appropriate 
community midwife, health visitor and GP.  They  may be prescribed 
Metoclopramide 10 mg tds from 27 weeks of the host surrogate pregnancy to be 
able to breast feed the baby.  The commissioning mother can also start to double 
pump from 26 weeks of the host surrogate pregnancy.  
 
As the Surrogate Mother and person is the legal mother at birth, the baby cannot be 
removed from the hospital by the commissioning parent(s) without her consent. The 
arrangements will have been made by the surrogate and IPs during the antenatal period and 
ideally a birth plan is will be in place for staff to follow. This ensures that  Staff should 
consider whether the Duty Social Worker should be informed of the Surrogacy arrangement 
to ensure that both the Surrogate Mother and the commissioning parent(s) ar e able to 
receive support and advice in the post natal period where appropriate . 
 
The commissioning parent(s) should not be admitted as a patient of the Trust. If the 
surrogate mother requests that the commissioning parent(s) be permitted to stay with her 
until the baby is discharged, this should be accommodated and recorded on MIS .  
 
Where, following birth, the Surrogate Mother delegates responsibility for the child to the 
Intended Parents, this should be written clearly in the m edical notes. If this is the case, 
wherever possible, the intended mother may be accommodated sep arately with the baby in    
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 9 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
a side room on the postnatal ward. Parenting support and advice will then be provided to the 
commissioning parent(s) until the baby is  discharged. This arrangement must be recorded in 
the surrog ate mothers notes on MIS and also the baby’s notes  on MIS , stating that this is the 
request of the surrogate mother. The commissioning parent(s) presence on the ward should 
then be recorded in the  ward day book. If this is not possible, owing to capacity, the baby will 
be transferred for care in TMBU /SCBU where the commissioning parent(s) may visit in 
place of the surrogate mother.  
 
 
10.1 Community midwife  
 
 The midwife should be informed of the status of the pregnancy this will be 
documented on MIS. 
 It is important for the midwife at booking to ascertain who are the baby’s biological 
parents, including where relevant, details of  the donor spe rm and / or egg. This will 
be relevant in order to assess  relevant family history and risk assess for inherited 
diseases. For combined screening and the quadruple test, risk assessment is 
based on the age of the biological mother.  
 The midwife should establish whether the surrogate mother is married. If she is 
married then she  and her husband hold parental responsibility until the legal 
process of transfer PR is comp lete. 
 If the surrogate mother is not married the midwife should establish that the 
(commissioning donor) father is registered on the baby’s birth certificate when the 
baby is born. Only then will he hold parental responsibility. 
 The midwife should notify the health visitor and GP of the baby’s status as above 
so that any consents required will be requested from the person h olding parental 
responsibility (see section 8 & section 9). This is particularly important for the early 
immunisations which are due before the legal process  may have been  finalised or 
if the baby requires immediate/ early surgery or treatments. 
 It may be relevant for the midwife to comp lete safeguarding procedures .  
 It is important to recognise that the Trust's duty of care is to the Surrogate Mother. 
The Trust owes no duty to the commissioning parent(s). All applicable antenatal 
care should be provided to the Surrogate Mother in the usual way. The 
commissioning parent(s) can be involved in this process provided that the 
Surrogate Mother consents to this” and “The Surrogate Mother has the right t o 
make all decisions relating to her antenatal care. It is important to remember that 
the child is not recognised as a "person" until birth and therefore, the rights of the 
mother should take precedence over the interests of the unborn child.  
 
 
10.2 Medical Staff / Nursing and Midwifery 
 
When a baby is to be discharged and transferred to the commissioning parents who live in 
another  part of the country, staff should ensure that the health staff in the new area are 
aware of the status of the baby and that there is full communication with the new area  
midwife and hea lth visitor. 
    
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 10 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
If any staff identify that the due legal process has not been followed they should notify the 
police. 
 
If any staff have concer ns for the safety or welfare of the baby they must follow the Sussex 
Safeguarding and Child Pro tection Procedures and  make a referral to the appropriate local  
Children’s  Social Care and notify the Safeguarding Children’s  Named Doctor/ Nurse/Midwife.  
 
The Consultant Midwife can be contacted  for support and/or  a referral  made  into the 
Consult ant Midwife Clinic for review,  with complex care planning within pregnancy and birth.  
 
 
11.0 Mental capacity of the surrogate mother to make decisions  
 
Should staff have any concerns regarding the mental capacity of the Surrogate Mother to 
make decisions about her pregnancy, a formal assessment of capacity should be performed 
(staff are advised to follow the Trust's consent policy).  
 
In the e vent that the Surrogate Mother lacks capacity to make a particular decision, 
treatment should be given having regard to the best interests of the Surrogate Mother – 
however, staff are advised to consult the Trust's Lead on the Mental Capacity Act prior to 
administering non -emergency treatment in such circumstances.  
 
 
12.0  Termination of pregnancy  
 
A surrogate has the right to a termination. The intended parents have no right to prevent a 
termination taking place. The intended parents should not be informed  about a termination 
unless the surrogate has given consent for this information to be shared.  
 
 
13.0 What if the surrogate mother changes her mind?  
 
If the Surrogate Mother changes her mind and wishes to keep the baby, the Trust must 
respect her wishes. In this situation, the Courts will usually allow her to keep the baby. If 
there is disagreement between the Surrogate Mother and the commissioning parent(s), the 
Lead for Safeguarding Children should be contacted.  
 
 
14.0 What if the intended parents chang e their mind?  
 
If the intended parents change their mind about taking the child for whatever reason, the 
surrogate (and her husband/wife) will be legally responsible.  
 
    
Management of Surrogacy v1. 1 UHS -CG-0005 -2023 Sept 2023  Page 11 of 20 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent  version of this document before use.  
15.0 What happens if there is a dispute between the intended parents and the 
surrogate?  
 
The trust should attempt to work with the surrogate and the intended parents at all times. 
Should a dispute arise, the surrogate’s wishes should be respected at all times and staff may 
wish to consider contacting the Lead for Safeguarding  children for further advice and 
guidance.  
 
If the intended parents attempt to remove the baby from trust premises against the surrogate 
wishes, staff should consider informing the Police, subject to the consent of the surrogate.  
 
Should staff have any co ncerns about the welfare of the baby staff should follow 
standard safeguarding procedures.  
 
 
16.0 What if the child becomes ill and is in need of treatment?  
 
Where possible, decisions about the baby’s treatment should be made jointly, by the 
Surrogate and the commissioning parent(s) in conjunction with the health professionals.  In 
most circumstances, the Surrogate will hand over responsibility to the Intended Parents on 
an informal basis, at birth. However, the surrogate remains legally responsible for the  baby 
until a Parental Order has been confirmed or the baby has been legally adopted by the 
commissioning parent(s). The commissioning parent(s) have no legal rights over the baby 
until this time.  
 
Therefore as a matter of law, even where the surrogate has  delegated the care of the baby 
to the intended parents, this does not mean that she relinquishes all legal rights or 
responsibilities to the baby or that the intended parents automatically assume the legal right 
to make decisions about the baby.  
 
In the e vent of any dispute between the surrogate and the attended parents, it is the 
surrogate mother who has parental responsibility in law to consent/refuse treatment on 
behalf of the child. One of the intended parents may share parental responsibility if 
regis tered on the child’s birth certificate.  
 
Typically there is a good relationship between the surrogate and IPs and this will have been 
discussed in the antenatal period (birth planning meeting) and the IPs will be part of that 
decision making.

Appendix 3: Surrogacy inclusive language in perinatal services

Purpose of the Language Guide  
This guide has been developed to accompany the trust policy f or management of surrogacy. 
The guide seeks to clarify the dynamics between a surrogate and intended parents, so that 
perinatal care is inclusive for all, and acknowledges each person’s position with regards to 
any child/childre n born through surrogacy under the trust.  
 
Significance of the Different Pathways to Parenthood  
Childbirth is a period of significant vulnerability and growth, and we value all the intersecting  
identities that contribute to a person’s experience of this, i ncluding but not limited to race, 
gender identity, sexuality, age, religion and ability. The people experiencing chi ldbirth and 
the transition into parenthood, either as the birthing person, or as an intended parent,  require 
care from midwives and fellow h ealth professionals that is both inclusive and individualised, 
reflecting the pathway they have followed to this point.  
 
A key legal aspect of surrogacy is the application to t he courts for a parental order, 
completed by the intended parents of any child/ children born. The parental order tra nsfers 
the legal parenthood for the child from the surrogate (and her spouse if married) to the 
intended parents. (NGA Law, Parenthood and parental orders, 2019)  
 
Parental order applications are one of the most reliable  ways to trac k surrogacy births, both 
in the UK and internationally. The data is managed by Cafcass (Chil d and Family Court 
Advisory and Support Service), who are an independent advisory organisation that  works 
with families and courts to ensure the safety  and wellbeing of children in the UK on a range 
of cases, including surrogacy.  
 
Since the Cafcass case management system was introduced in 2008,  the number of 
parental orders,  for both domestic and international surrogacy has continued to increase. 
During the first year of using the management system to record data, there were just 67 
applications made. By 2018 this number had risen by four times the amount to around 280, 
with t he majority of them relating to domestic surrogacy within the UK (England having  the 
highest number of cases). Additionally, recent data shows that parental order numbers have 
continued to grow to above 300 applications in 2020, including 100 applications from same -
sex couples and more than 20 from single parents who have pursued surr ogacy as a route 
to parenthood. (Cafcass, 2021)  
 
Until 2018 Surrey and Sussex recorded the third highest number o f surrogacies, exceeded 
only by London and the Avon, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Thames Val ley service area 
group (both of which have higher  population figures). For the past three years, Surrey and 
Sussex have exceeded Surrogacy Inclusive Language in Perinatal Services  the Avon, 
Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Thames Valley service area group in the number of parental  
order applications grante d by the courts.

Legal Frameworks in Relation to Perinatal Care  
 
Equality Act  
The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination, harassment and victim isation of in the 
workplace and in wider society. It is designed to ensure people with certain ‘protected 
characteristics’ are not disadvantaged or subjected to unwanted conduct because of that 
characteristic. Public bodies (such as local authorities and NHS trusts) have an active duty 
to eliminate discrimination, harassment, and victimisation of anyone who is protected under 
the Act, and foster  good relations between persons who share a relevant protected 
characteristic and persons who do not share it.  
 
One of the characteristics protected by the Equality Act is pregnancy  and maternity. The 
care of any pregnant or birthing person should, at all times, meet standards as set out by 
wider Government and internal guidance and should seek to acknowledge the individual 
circumstances of the person being cared for.  
 
Specific Language Replacements
