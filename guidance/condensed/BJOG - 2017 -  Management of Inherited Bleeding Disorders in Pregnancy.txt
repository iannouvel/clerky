Management of Inherited Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy

Haemophilia
- Clinicians should be aware of the different phenotypes and severities of haemophilia.
- Known or potential female carriers may have low factor VIII/IX levels, increasing the risk of bleeding during procedures or delivery.
- Baseline factor levels should be determined before pregnancy.
- Genetic counselling should be provided to women at risk.
- Options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered to carriers of severe haemophilia.
- Antenatal care should be provided by a multidisciplinary team.
- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.
- A clear plan for intrapartum care should be in place.
- The timing and mode of delivery should be decided jointly between the woman and the healthcare team.

von Willebrand disease (VWD)
- VWD is classified based on the deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF).
- Women with VWD have an increased risk of bleeding during pregnancy.
- Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed and VWF levels checked.
- Safe management requires a multidisciplinary approach.
- Factor levels should be monitored and maintained during pregnancy to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage.

Where invasive procedures are required, if VWF activity or factor VIII levels are less than 0.50 iu/ml, women should receive haemostatic support in the form of DDAVP, where responsive, or VWF-containing concentrates. Treatment should be with DDAVP in preference to blood-derived factor concentrates where possible. Fluid intake should be restricted to 1 litre for 24 hours following DDAVP administration to prevent maternal hyponatraemia. Clinicians should be aware that patients with type 2B VWD may develop thrombocytopenia following DDAVP treatment. If VWF replacement therapy is required, a concentrate containing factor VIII and VWF, manufactured from a safe plasma source with adequate viral testing and inactivation procedures should be used. Target peak VWF activity levels should be 1.0 iu/ml and levels maintained above 0.5 iu/ml until haemostasis is secured. For most antenatal procedures, a single preoperative treatment is sufficient, but in some cases, a second dose may be required at 12 –24 hours, depending on the nature of the procedure and the measured levels. The timing of treatment should be as near to delivery as possible, and pre- and post-treatment levels of VWF activity and factor VIII levels should be measured and repeated after delivery, or if labour is prolonged. Tranexamic acid should be considered in combination with treatment for all those with VWF activity less than 0.5 iu/ml, or as sole therapy for those with levels above 0.5 iu/ml if clinically indicated. Platelet transfusions, as well as VWF factor replacement, may sometimes be required in type 2B VWD. The mode of delivery should be guided by obstetric indications. For fetuses at risk of having type 2 or 3 VWD, FBS, external cephalic version, fetal scalp monitoring, ventouse delivery and midcavity forceps should be avoided.

For patients with type 1 VWD, where VWF activity has been normalised by pregnancy or treatment, central neuraxial anaesthesia can be offered. For patients with type 2 disease, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless VWF activity is more than 0.5 iu/ml and the haemostatic defect has been corrected. For patients with type 2N VWD, central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided unless factor VIII level is more than 0.5 iu/ml. Prior to delivery, all women should be given the opportunity to discuss analgesia with a senior obstetric anaesthetist. In patients where an epidural catheter has been placed, consideration should be given to the need for repeat treatment prior to catheter removal. Intramuscular injections and postnatal NSAIDs are only suitable in the short term when VWF activity and factor VIII are more than 0.5 iu/ml.

It is important to ensure that VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at more than 0.5 iu/ml for at least 3 days following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and at least 5 days following instrumental delivery or after caesarean section. Women with VWD should be considered for tranexamic acid for the postpartum period. If thromboprophylaxis is indicated, LMWH may be given to inpatients with adequate correction of VWF:RCo and factor VIII levels. Women with VWD should be made aware of the risk of delayed bleeding and be encouraged to report excessive bleeding. A plan for the diagnostic testing of the neonate following delivery, including cord blood sampling, should be included in the maternal pregnancy management plan. Cord blood samples for VWF activity should be taken for babies at risk of type 2 and 3 VWD. For neonates at risk of type 2 or 3 VWD, vitamin K should be given orally. Neonates with type 3 VWD should be considered for routine cranial imaging prior to discharge and for short-term prophylaxis with factor concentrate if there has been significant potential trauma at delivery.

III de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.

Fibrinogen disorders
What is the nature and inheritance of aﬁbrinogenaemia, hypoﬁbrinogenaemia and dysﬁbrinogenaemia?
Clinicians should be aware that ﬁbrinogen disorders can be autosomal recessive (aﬁbrinogenaemia) or autosomal dominant (with quantitative and/or qualitative defects) and are associated with a variable clinical phenotype.

What are the risks in pregnancy to mother and baby?
Clinicians should be aware that severe ﬁbrinogen de ﬁciency may be associated with bleeding, but quantitative and qualitative de ﬁciency can also be associated with thrombosis and pregnancy loss.

What is the management of pregnancy and delivery?
If functional ﬁbrinogen less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. Higher doses of ﬁbrinogen concentrate are likely to be required to maintain ﬁbrinogen activity as pregnancy progresses. Consider additional ﬁbrinogen concentrate for established labour to ensure ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1.5 g/litre for at least 3 days. Tranexamic acid can be used for minor bleeding.

The bleeding phenotype in haemophilia can be predicted from factor levels, with severe cases requiring regular prophylaxis. Inhibitors to clotting factor treatments can cause significant morbidity. Female carriers are at increased risk of bleeding during procedures and at delivery. Neonates with haemophilia are at risk of bleeding complications. Factor levels in carriers are variable and may increase during pregnancy. Antenatal care should involve a multidisciplinary team and aim for factor levels of at least 0.5 iu/ml. Genetic counselling should be provided to carriers, and options for prenatal diagnosis should be offered. Intrapartum care should be planned in advance for carriers and affected babies. Consideration should be given to mode of delivery to minimize risks.

Precautions required for vaginal delivery include avoiding the use of external cephalic version in pregnancies where the fetus has a bleeding disorder. A joint decision on the timing and mode of delivery should be made between the woman and the multidisciplinary team. For affected male babies, especially those with severe haemophilia, a planned lower segment caesarean section should be discussed. Spontaneous labour is preferred for vaginal delivery, with measures in place to ensure expertise and necessary resources are available. The use of ventouse and midcavity forceps should be avoided for male babies at risk of haemophilia. Fetal blood sampling and fetal scalp electrode should be avoided in babies expected to have severe or moderate haemophilia. The optimal mode of delivery for a carrier may be affected by obstetric considerations and individual factors, including bleeding risk and reproductive expectations. Analgesia and anaesthesia should be managed safely, with factor VIII/IX levels considered for neuraxial anaesthetic techniques. Haemostatic management during labour includes using DDAVP or factor concentrate to raise clotting factor levels if necessary. Tranexamic acid may be considered for women with low normal levels or in conjunction with DDAVP. Treatment should be given as close to delivery as possible.

4.12 Postpartum management:
- Recommend/offer active management of the third stage of labour to minimize the risk of PPH.
- Maintain factor VIII/IX levels above 0.5 iu/ml for 3 days post-vaginal delivery or 5 days post-instrumental delivery or caesarean section.
- Continue tranexamic acid postpartum until lochia is minimal.
- Avoid pharmacological thromboprophylaxis when factor level is 0.6 iu/ml or less, but consider in women with thrombotic risk factors.
- Haemophilia center should maintain contact with the woman post-discharge to report any increase in postpartum blood loss.
- Carriers of hemophilia should be identified as at increased risk of PPH and offered uterotonics for the third stage of labour.
- Maintain haemostatic levels in the initial postpartum period.
- Consider tranexamic acid use in PPH, with no long-term adverse outcomes for breastfeeding children.
- Assess risk of venous thromboembolism vs. PPH in normalizing factor levels.
- Carriers of hemophilia may have increased duration of lochia and should be monitored for any increase in blood loss.

4.13 Neonatal management:
- Plan for diagnostic testing of the neonate, including cord blood sampling.
- Interpret coagulation results in neonates against age-adjusted reference ranges.
- Recommend cord blood sampling and testing for male babies born to carrier mothers.
- Inform parents of neonates diagnosed with hemophilia and arrange for follow-up at a hemophilia center.
- Administer vitamin K to neonates with low factor levels.
- Consider cranial ultrasound prior to discharge in neonates with severe or moderate hemophilia.
- Consider cranial MRI in neonates with symptoms of ICH.
- Provide information on symptoms and signs of ICH to parents.
- Consider short-term prophylaxis in severe and moderate hemophilia neonates.
- Manage clinical bleeding events in neonates with hemophilia according to treatment guidelines.

During pregnancy and childbirth, women with VWD have a significantly increased risk of bleeding, with antepartum hemorrhage increased ten-fold and primary PPH occurring in 15-30% of women. Perineal hematoma is more common in women with VWD, but there is no increased risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, or fetal complications. Neonatal VWF levels are increased at birth, providing some protection against bleeding. Prior to conception, the bleeding phenotype should be assessed, and VWF levels should be monitored throughout pregnancy. DDAVP is safe for use in pregnancy and delivery, but caution should be exercised in certain subtypes of VWD. VWF concentrates may be necessary in cases where DDAVP is contraindicated. Intrapartum management should focus on maintaining VWF activity levels and may involve tranexamic acid or platelet transfusions. Analgesia and anesthesia should be carefully managed based on the type of VWD and VWF activity levels. Central neuraxial anesthesia is generally safe in women with normal VWF activity levels. Intramuscular injections and NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with low VWF levels.

Postpartum management should ensure VWF activity and factor VIII levels are maintained at specific levels following delivery. Women with VWD may consider tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis may be necessary in some cases. Follow-up is crucial to monitor bleeding risk. Neonates at risk of VWD should undergo diagnostic testing. Factor XI deficiency is an autosomal disorder with variable inheritance patterns. Factor XI levels do not typically increase during pregnancy. Factor XI-deficient women are at increased risk of PPH. Treatment options include tranexamic acid, factor XI concentrate, and FFP. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for factor XI deficiency. Factor XI inhibitors may occur after treatment. Tranexamic acid alone may be sufficient for managing factor XI deficiency. FFP with factor XI activity should be used if needed.

Factor XI or tranexamic acid is not usually required antenatally unless an invasive procedure is undertaken or if there is bleeding following miscarriage or surgical procedure. Delivery plans need to be individualized. Prophylactic factor XI replacement should be considered if homozygous/compound heterozygous, previous history of PPH or general bleeding history. Otherwise, management can be expectant, with tranexamic acid alone and factor replacement reserved for excess bleeding. Due to the unpredictable nature of bleeding and the likely unchanged factor XI level during pregnancy, treatment plans around labor and delivery need to be individualized. Central neuraxial anesthesia should not be given to women with low factor XI levels with a known bleeding phenotype, where the phenotype is not clear or when there is a severe reduction in level. Clinicians should be aware that rare bleeding disorders include inherited deficiencies of fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, X, XI and XIII, combined factor V and factor VIII deficiencies, and congenital deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors. Genetic counseling should be provided, with the understanding that most rare inherited bleeding disorders are autosomal recessive in inheritance and heterozygote carriers are usually asymptomatic. Clinicians should appreciate that coagulation factor levels can change during pregnancy. Treatment plans may need to be modified according to the nature of individual bleeds or procedures, and to the background bleeding phenotype of each case. Central neuraxial anesthesia, postpartum pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and NSAIDs should usually be avoided in women with severe deficiencies as it may be difficult to guarantee consistent normalization of hemostasis even after treatment. If factor II activity is less than 0.2 iu/ml and there is significant bleeding, established labor or prior to caesarean section, give prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg to achieve factor II activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. For significant bleeding or delivery in women with factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml, 15–25 ml/kg FFP should be considered once in established labor or before caesarean section. For factor VII activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester with prior history of bleeding, consider recombinant factor VIIa 15 –30 micrograms/kg every 4 –6 hours for at least 3 or 5 days following caesarean section. For delivery in women with factor X activity less than 0.3 iu/ml in the third trimester who have a history of bleeding and all those who require caesarean section, use prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –40 iu/kg (or factor X concentrate if available) to achieve factor X activity more.

Consider further prothrombin complex concentrate 10 –20 iu/kg once daily to maintain factor X activity more than 0.3 iu/ml for at least 3 days. Antenatal prophylaxis maybe considered in women with a history of recurrent bleeding or adverse pregnancy outcome using prothrombin complex concentrate 20 –30 iu/kg two or three times a week to maintain trough factor X more than 0.01 iu/ml.

During pregnancy, increased intensity prophylaxis is required using factor XIII plasma concentrate or recombinant factor XIII (if A-subunit de ﬁciency). Dosing frequency should be increased from every 28 days to every 14 –21 days to maintain factor XIII more than 0.2 iu/ml. For delivery, consider additional factor XIII concentrate 10 –40 iu/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section, depending on the interval since last prophylaxis.

For delivery in women with combined factor V+VIII de ﬁciency, if factor V activity less than 0.2 iu/ml in the third trimester, consider SD-FFP 15 –25 ml/kg once in established labour or before caesarean section to achieve factor V activity 0.2 –0.4 iu/ml. Consider further SD-FFP 10 ml/kg once every 12 hours to maintain factor V activity more than 0.2 iu/ml for at least3 days. Consider additional recombinant factor VIII if the factor VIII activity is less than 0.5 iu/ml in the third trimester.

Severe ﬁbrinogen deﬁciency (aﬁbrinogenaemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder and is associated with mild-to-severe bleeding. If functional ﬁbrinogen is less than 0.5 g/litre, consider prophylaxis throughout pregnancy with ﬁbrinogen concentrate initially 50 –100 mg/kg twice per week, adjusted to maintain trough ﬁbrinogen activity more than 1 g/litre. 

The spectrum of bleeding in patients with platelet function disorders varies and may ﬁrst present in pregnancy. Women known to have a platelet dysfunction disorder should receive prepregnancy counselling from a multidisciplinary specialist team with expertise in caring for patients with platelet function disorders.

Bernard Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is caused by genetic abnormality of an important platelet adhesion receptor (GP Ib-IX-V receptor) and is often associated with a severe bleeding phenotype. BSS is associated with signiﬁcant risk of primary and secondary PPH, and wound haematoma. Management of delivery, therefore, requires careful planning with the multidisciplinary team.

- Platelet transfusions and/or recombinant factor VIIa should be given prophylactically at delivery for patients with a history of bleeding.
- Tranexamic acid should be given from the onset of established labour and continued through the postpartum period until lochia is minimal.
- Central neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided.
- Antenatal bleeding in women with GT is mild, but postpartum bleeding can be severe and occur up to 20 days after delivery.
- Prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to delivery has only shown partial success in reducing PPH.
- Recombinant factor VIIa is licensed for use in patients with GT who have antibodies to GP IIb/IIIa and/or HLA, and with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions.
- DDAVP has not been shown to be effective in GT.
- Maternal alloimmunisation to fetal platelet antigens may cause fetal thrombocytopenia and risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
- Platelet transfusions can lead to alloimmunisation with a risk of fetal maternal alloimmunisation.
- Women with inherited bleeding disorders who request termination of pregnancy require multidisciplinary management in a unit with 24-hour access to blood products and specialist hematological advice.

Referral hospital in Rafsanjan, Iran. The optimal mode of delivery for the hemophilia carrier expecting an affected infant is clinically significant. Maternal obesity and maternal health are important factors to consider. The impact of multiple cesarean deliveries on maternal morbidity is noteworthy. Risks of induction of labor in uncomplicated term pregnancies should be evaluated. The risks and benefits of epidural analgesia in patients with bleeding disorders should be carefully considered. Safety of intramuscular injection of hepatitis B vaccine in hemophiliacs is crucial. Prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage in women with bleeding disorders is essential. Identification and management of women with inherited bleeding disorders is important. Development of the human coagulation system in premature infants is a significant consideration. Perinatal management of newborns with hemophilia is a critical aspect of care. The impact, diagnosis, and treatment of bleeding disorders are essential components of care.

Clinical guidelines for von Willebrand disease diagnosis and management, including pregnancy and delivery, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor changes, and bleeding risks. Treatment options, genetic factors, and bleeding assessment tools are also discussed. The guidelines emphasize the importance of personalized care for patients with von Willebrand disease.

Ultrasound scanning should always be performed to exclude multiple pregnancy. The limitations of fetal sexing by cffDNA analysis must be explained to patients prior to testing. Fetal sex should be confirmed by US at 20 weeks of gestation. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in at-risk fetuses. CVS may be offered between 11 and 13+6 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis may be offered after 15 weeks of gestation for PND when CVS is not available or at > 34 weeks of gestation to inform clinical management plans for delivery of an at-risk fetus. An independent maternal blood sample should be provided to the laboratory for confirmatory mutation analysis alongside the PND sample. Amniocentesis in late pregnancy is recommended to inform clinical management of childbirth. Genetic analysis is carried out for the familial mutation(s) in order to inform the delivery of at-risk fetuses. PGD, an IVF-based process, is an option for couples at risk of transmitting a heritable disorder to their offspring. Noninvasive PND for disease-specific diagnosis is not yet available in general clinical practice. Risk stratification of bleeding risk for the fetus/neonate is categorized into high, medium, mild, and unlikely to be at risk levels based on specific diagnoses. Neonatal bleeding risks and management are outlined based on factor deficiencies and platelet activity in normal term neonates.
