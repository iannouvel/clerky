This policy provides guidance for midwives on the administration and dosage of medicines to ensure legal requirements are met. Midwives can supply and administer certain medicines without a prescription if they have received appropriate training. Documentation and patient safety are key considerations. Midwives must adhere to the list of approved medicines and ensure safe and appropriate use. The policy covers inpatient, home birth, outpatient, and community settings. Registered midwives are accountable for their practice and must have up-to-date knowledge of medications they supply or administer. Student midwives may administer medications under supervision.

Registered midwives must only supply and administer medicines they have been trained on. Before administering a medication under a midwife exemption, the midwife must ensure they are knowledgeable about the medication, the patient is known to them, and that the medication is appropriate for the patient. They must also ensure the patient is not allergic to the medication, there are no contraindications, the dosage is correct, and the patient is informed about the medication. If any issues arise, an authorized prescriber must be contacted promptly. Medication administration should be documented in line with trust policy. In the inpatient/home birth setting, certain Prescription Only Medicines (POM) can be administered without a request for a prescription. Training implications include being familiar with the policy, undergoing necessary training, and complying with trust policies.
