 responsible for: 

• Providing advice and guidance to the preceptee in the absence of their preceptor. 
• Communicating regularly with the preceptorship lead/s or named preceptor on the progress of the preceptee.

Professional midwifery advocates (PMAs) provide support to preceptees and preceptors throughout the preceptorship program using the A-EQUIP model, aiming to contribute to high-quality care by facilitating continuous improvement, valuing the midwife, enhancing health and wellbeing, and building personal resilience. PMAs can offer restorative supervision individually or in a group setting to help midwives feel valued, recognize their strengths and challenges, and identify ways to progress, change, and develop. Preceptees are encouraged to meet with a PMA at least twice during the preceptorship period.

Line managers ensure the implementation of the preceptorship policy within their area, working closely with preceptorship leads to ensure completion of training, providing supernumerary periods, and arranging progression to Band 6.

The chief nurse is responsible for the delivery of the trust's preceptorship programs for NMC registered professionals, while the director of midwifery is responsible for midwives. The head of midwifery provides operational direction and management of midwifery services to ensure high standards of care, patient experience, and satisfaction.

At UHSussex, preceptees follow a structured program of learning, including trust induction, preceptorship study days, mandatory training days, and an infant feeding day, all protected time for preceptorship.

Preceptees have a minimum of four weeks of supernumerary status, working with a named midwife and not personally allocated a caseload or patient.

Protected time is allocated for progress meetings and support for both preceptees and preceptors. Initial and progress meetings track competencies, progress, and development needs, documented in an ePortfolio. Standardized documentation is used across UHSussex for the preceptorship program.

An escalation process is in place for raising concerns, with a flowchart to follow. The preceptorship period ends when the preceptee has acquired all necessary skills and competencies, with a final sign-off meeting to progress to Band 6.

The preceptorship programme includes formal sign-off processes for completion of the preceptorship year, skills passport, and progression from band 5 to band 6. If requirements are not met, the Trust's capability and poor performance guidance may be followed. Evaluation of the programme should be completed annually by preceptorship leads, including feedback from preceptees, preceptors, line managers, and practice educators. Monitoring details are provided in the appendix.
