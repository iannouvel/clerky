Large for Gestational Age Guideline: Aim is to provide evidence-based guidelines for managing suspected LGA fetus. Scope includes all medical and midwifery staff. Responsibilities include accessing and following guidance. Introduction highlights risks associated with LGA and fetal macrosomia. Key points include causes of large babies and risks associated with macrosomia. Antenatal management involves monitoring fundal height and referring for ultrasound if necessary. Fetal macrosomia from 38 weeks requires discussion of induction of labor risks. Caesarean birth may be necessary for high-risk cases. Informed discussion with women and people presenting with LGA baby is crucial.

Options for birth include expectant management, induction of labor, or caesarean birth. Induction of labor reduces the risk of shoulder dystocia but increases the risk of perineal tears compared to expectant management. Risks of perinatal death, brachial plexus injuries, and emergency caesarean birth are similar between the two options. The decision should consider the impact on the birth experience and the baby. Discuss options with the individual and respect their decision.
