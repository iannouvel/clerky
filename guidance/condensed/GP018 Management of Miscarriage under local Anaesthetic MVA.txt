Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) for pregnancy loss <12/40 is a procedure used to manage retained products of conception and failed medical or surgical management of miscarriage. MVA is performed by trained Gynaecologists or Registrar grade doctors who have been signed off for the procedure. Eligible patients must have an early embryonic demise or incomplete miscarriage (<10 weeks) with a mean sac diameter less than 4cm. Exclusions include allergy to local anaesthetic or misoprostol, history of panic attacks, and certain medical conditions. Patients must be counseled, educated, and provide informed consent before the procedure. Pain control options should be discussed, and a health professional will be present during the procedure to provide support. Tissue examination and post-procedure care are also important aspects of MVA. The procedure typically lasts 10-15 minutes with a recovery time of 60 minutes. Patients should perform a urine pregnancy test in 3 weeks and contact EPAU if still positive. Persistent bleeding or pain post-procedure should also be reported to EPAU.
