Prevention of Acid Aspiration Syndrome (RSCH PRH only)  
Late pregnancy and labor increase the risk of acid aspiration due to various factors. All women requiring peri-partum anesthesia for delivery or procedures should be managed with a neuraxial anesthetic technique. Specific interventions are recommended for high-risk women in labor, elective caesarean sections, and emergency caesarean sections. Low-risk and high-risk factors for intervention or aspiration in labor are outlined. Recommendations include antacid prophylaxis, oral medications, dietary restrictions, and fluid intake guidelines.
