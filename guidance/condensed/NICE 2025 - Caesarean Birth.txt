61Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our

This guideline uses specific, inclusiv e language t o describe t he population gr oups it 
covers (f or example, w omen and pr egnant people, or trans and non-binar y people) 
except when: 
• the evidence f or the recommendation has not been r eview ed, and it is not cer tain 
from e xper t opinion whet her it can co ver mor e groups, or 
• the evidence has been r eview ed, but t he inf ormation a vailable f or some gr oups at 
the time of de velopment was t oo limit ed to mak e specific r ecommendations, or 
• only a v ery limit ed number of r ecommendations ha ve been updat ed in dir ect 
response t o new e vidence or t o reflect a change in practice. 
Healt hcare professionals should use t heir clinical judgement when implementing 
gender -specific r ecommendations, taking int o account t he individual's 
circumstances, needs and pr eferences, and ensuring all people ar e treated wit h 
dignity and r espect t hroughout t heir car e. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the

What f actors influence t he decision-t o-bir th interval when t here is a cat egor y 1 level of 
urgency f or caesar ean bir th? [2011] 
Why this is im portant 
'Crash' caesar ean bir th is a psy chologically traumatic e vent f or women and t heir par tners, 
and is also str essful f or clinical staff . Staff and r esour ces might ha ve to be obtained fr om 
other ar eas of clinical car e. This should be done as efficient ly and eff ectiv ely as possible, 
minimising anxiety and ensuring t he saf ety of t he mot her and her bab y. 
For cat egor y 1 caesar ean bir th there is a r ecognised ur gency t o deliv er as quickly as is 
reasonably possible. Most r esear ch in t his ar ea is quantitativ e and looks at t he impact of 
the decision-t o-bir th interval on v arious aspect s of f etal and mat ernal out comes rat her 
than t he int erpla y of f actors t hat can aff ect t his time period it self. Much of t his e vidence is 
retrospectiv e. Alt hough some w ork has been done in t he UK t o examine wher e the 
systematic dela ys ar e and ho w to avoid t hem, mor e work is needed t o det ermine ho w to 
optimise t he decision-t o-bir th interval. This w ork should use qualitativ e as w ell as 
quantitativ e resear ch met hods t o assess which f actors influence t he decision-t o-bir th 
interval for a cat egor y 1 caesar ean bir th. Ev aluation of t hese f actors could be used t o 
inform futur e NICE guidance, f or example, specific guidance f or management of cat egor y 1 
caesar ean bir th. Such inf ormation could also be used b y hospitals f or mat ernity ser vices 
planning, and at a t eam le vel would assist wit h audit and ongoing e valuation and training 
of the multidisciplinar y team. 
A lar ge amount of NHS and ot her stat e funding is used t o provide continuing car e for 
babies who ar e disabled as a r esult of bir th asph yxia and in pr oviding lif elong suppor t for 
the child and t heir f amily . In addition, lar ge sums of public mone y are spent on litigation 
and compensation in some of t hese cases t hrough t he Clinical Negligence Scheme f or

A prospectiv e study t o det ermine whet her t he decision-t o-bir th interval has an impact on 
maternal and neonatal out comes when t here is a cat egor y 2 level of ur gency f or caesar ean 
birth. [2011] 
Why this is im portant 
This r esear ch is impor tant t o inform t he ongoing debat e about t he management of 
categor y 2 caesar ean bir th. The 'continuum of risk' in t his setting has been r ecognised. 
However, most of t he w ork in t his ar ea, looking at mat ernal and f etal out comes, generally 
considers unplanned caesar ean bir th as a whole gr oup wit hout making an y distinction 
betw een degr ees of ur gency . Furthermor e, much of t his w ork is r etrospectiv e. Most 
women who under go intrapar tum caesar ean bir th fall int o the cat egor y 2 level of ur gency 
and t herefore specific inf ormation f or this gr oup could aff ect and benefit man y women and 
contribut e to the deliv ery of equity of car e. 
Delay in bir th wit h a compr omised f etus could r esult in major and long-t erm harm including 
cerebral palsy and ot her major long-t erm disability . The immediat e and long-t erm eff ect on 
a family of t he bir th of a bab y requiring lif elong specialised car e and suppor t is enormous. 
If such harm could be a voided b y appr opriat e hast e this w ould be an impor tant 
improvement in out come. Ho wever, if such hast e is of no benefit, t hen an y related risk of 
adverse mat ernal out come needs t o be minimised. 
A lar ge amount of NHS and ot her stat e funding is used t o provide continuing car e for 
babies who ar e disabled as a r esult of dela y in bir th and in pr oviding lif elong suppor t for 
the child and t heir f amily . In addition, lar ge sums of public mone y are spent on litigation

of 614 Maternal r equest f or caesar ean bir th 
What suppor t or psy chological int erventions w ould be appr opriat e for women who ha ve a 
fear of v aginal childbir th and r equest a caesar ean bir th? [2011] 
Why this is im portant 
Fear of v aginal childbir th can st em fr om: 
• fear of damage t o the mat ernal pelvic floor 
• damage t o the bab y during childbir th 
• self-doubt on t he ability t o physically ha ve a v aginal bir th 
• previous childbir th experience 
• unresolv ed issues r elated to the genital ar ea. 
Currently there is a wide v ariation in practice and limit ed resour ces lead t o limit ed 
availability of eff ectiv e interventions. Int erventions t hat might be appr opriat e include: 
• antenatal clinics dedicat ed to providing car e for women wit h no obst etric indications 
who r equest a caesar ean bir th 
• referral t o a psy chologist or a mental healt h professional 
• referral t o an obst etric anaest hetist 
• intensiv e midwif ery suppor t. 
Continuity of healt hcare professional suppor t from t he ant enatal t o the intrapar tum 
periods and 'one-t o-one' midwif ery car e during labour ar e also oft en lacking and could 
make a diff erence t o women who ar e anxious or afraid. 
All of t hese int erventions ha ve diff erent r esour ce implications and t here is no clear 
evidence t o suggest t hat an y are of benefit. The pr oposed r esear ch w ould compar e in a 
randomised contr olled trial 2 or mor e of t hese int erventions in w omen r equesting a

These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. The y link t o details of t he evidence and a full description of t he 
committ ee's discussion. 
Benefi ts and risks o f caesar ean and v aginal bir th 
Recommendations 1 .1.3 and 1 .1.4 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was some e vidence f or a select ed number of out comes on t he shor t- and long-t erm 
effects of caesar ean bir th compar ed wit h vaginal bir th, alt hough t here were some 
limitations wit h the quality of t he evidence, and not all e vidence was fr om a comparison of 
planned mode of bir th. The committ ee used t his e vidence, along wit h their clinical 
exper tise, t o updat e the advice comparing t he relativ e benefit s and risks of t hese 2 modes 
of bir th. 
For some out comes t here was conflicting or limit ed evidence, and t here were also a 
number of out comes f or which no e vidence was identified f or inclusion, so t he committ ee 
highlight ed these uncer tainties. 
As the evidence was limit ed for this review t he committ ee made a r esear ch 
recommendation. 
Ther e were also 3 outcomes included in t he 2011 guideline which had not been included in 
this curr ent r eview (v aginal t ears, lengt h of sta y and pain) but t he committ ee agr eed t hat 
the advice was still appr opriat e and should be carried f orward into the updat ed guideline. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The committ ee consider ed that t heir r ecommendations w ould r einforce best practice. It is 
already curr ent practice t o discuss t he risks and benefit s of alt ernativ e modes of bir th 
during t he ant enatal period and t his review has simply led t o an updat e of t he inf ormation 
that should be discussed wit h women. Caesar ean bir th (NG192)

Placenta ac creta spe ctrum 
Recommendations 1 .2.7 to 1.2.13 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The r outine 20-w eek ultrasound scan off ered to women and pr egnant people is used t o 
determine placental location, so t he committ ee agr eed t hat identification of a placenta 
prae via or lo w-lying placenta at t his scan in t hose wit h a pr evious caesar ean scar , or a 
scar fr om pr evious ut erine sur gery, should be t he trigger f or fur ther in vestigations t o 
check f or the pr esence of placenta accr eta. Ther e was e vidence fr om a number of studies 
that gr eyscale ultrasound wit h colour doppler had moderat e sensitivity and high specificity 
for det ecting placenta accr eta. Ho wever, the committ ee w ere awar e that t he sensitivity 
and specificity of ultrasound scans is v ery operat or-dependent, and t hat if a case of 
placenta accr eta is missed, t here is a risk of se vere morbidity or mor tality at bir th. The y 
therefore recommended t hat t he scan should be done b y a senior clinician wit h the 
necessar y exper tise and e xperience t o det ect placenta accr eta. 
The committ ee discussed t he timing of t his scan and not ed that in most of t he included 
studies, it was carried out betw een 28 and 37 weeks. The committ ee agr eed t hat an 
earlier scan w ould allo w mor e time f or planning t he bir th, par ticularly if an early bir th was 
thought t o be needed, but t hat scanning t oo early w ould not be an adv antage as t he 
placenta ma y mo ve. The y therefore recommended t hat t he scan be done ar ound 
28 weeks, but not lat er than 29 weeks. 
The committ ee discussed t hat, since 2020 , NHS England has commissioned a specialised 
maternity ser vice for women and pr egnant people diagnosed wit h placenta accr eta 
spectrum (which t hey refer to as abnormally in vasive placenta, or AIP). This ser vice 
enables diagnosis and car e, including t he bir th, to be giv en in a centr e wit h an appr opriat e 
multidisciplinar y team, access t o adult int ensiv e car e, level 3 neonatal car e and access t o 
blood pr oduct s. The committ ee therefore recommended t hat, if placenta accr eta is 
suspect ed at t he scan carried out ar ound 28 weeks, w omen and pr egnant people should 
be referred to a specialist placenta accr eta centr e. 
The committ ee discussed e vidence sho wing t hat t he sensitivity and specificity of MRI

of 61was no bett er than t hat f or ultrasound wit h colour doppler , and t herefore agr eed t hat it 
was not necessar y to off er an MRI scan t o confirm t he pr esumed diagnosis of placenta 
accreta. Ho wever, the committ ee also agr eed t hat MRI was a useful imaging t echnique 
when planning sur gical management of placenta accr eta t o identify if , for example, 
placenta per creta had impact ed on ot her or gans, and so updat ed the recommendation on 
this. 
Although t he committ ee w ere awar e that w omen and pr egnant people wit h placenta 
accreta ar e now referred to specialist placenta accr eta spectrum centr es, they discussed 
that some people ma y present v ery late in pr egnancy or in labour and need t o be car ed for 
at their local mat ernity unit, and so t he recommendations on car e in t his setting w ere 
retained. The committ ee agr eed t hat t he discussion on bir th options should be carried out 
by a senior obst etrician, and t hey also updat ed the advice on who ma y need t o be 
consult ed or pr esent f or the caesar ean bir th, including t heir r oles. The committ ee also 
advised t hat a critical car e bed should be a vailable f or the w oman or pr egnant person and 
for the bab y in case t hey are needed, but t hat emer gency sur gery should not be dela yed if 
a bed was not immediat ely a vailable. 
The committ ee amended t he existing r ecommendation on use of blood pr oduct s to clarify 
that t his should only be if t he use of such pr oduct s is acceptable t o the w oman or 
pregnant person, and included a link t o the NICE guideline on blood transfusion as t his 
provides some useful advice on alt ernativ es to blood transfusions and also cell salv age 
and trane xamic acid. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat as placenta accr eta was no longer managed b y local hospitals, 
a local pr otocol was no longer appr opriat e, but t hat specialist placenta accr eta spectrum 
centr es should de velop pr otocols wit h their local mat ernity unit s about ho w placenta 
accreta should be managed wit hin the netw ork, such as met hods f or referral and ongoing 
management. The committ ee also agr eed t hat t he pr otocol should include details of ho w 
local mat ernity unit s should pr ovide car e if placenta accr eta was identified v ery late, which 
may include, f or example, emer gency transf er to a specialist r egional centr e or suppor t 
from t he specialist centr e being pr ovided t o the local mat ernity unit. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The 20-w eek ultrasound scan is r outinely off ered to all w omen and pr egnant people 
already , so t his will not be a change in practice. The use of a 28-w eek ultrasound scan 
with colour doppler t o assess f or the pr esence of placenta accr eta is also not a change in Caesar ean bir th (NG192)
© NICE 2025 . All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 45
of 61practice, and alt hough t he timing is no w earlier t han pr eviously r ecommended, t his will not 
lead t o additional scans. Advising t hat t he scan is done b y a senior clinician wit h exper tise 
in placenta accr eta is a change t o the pr evious advice, but in practice, t he scan is alr eady 
done b y a consultant in most cases so it is not t hought t his will r esult in a major change in 
practice. Using a mor e experienced operat or for when looking f or placenta accr eta is lik ely 
to lead t o the best sensitivity and specificity fr om t he scan. This in turn is lik ely to corr ectly 
identify mor e cases, r educing t he risk of serious morbidity or mor tality f or the mot her and 
baby, and optimising r esour ce use b y preventing complications at bir th that ma y otherwise 
need e xpensiv e critical car e. This should also r educe t he number of f alse positiv es 
referred to specialist centr es wher e the pr esumed diagnosis of placenta accr eta is lat er 
found t o be incorr ect. 
The r ecommendation t o consider MRI only when planning sur gery ma y reduce t he use of 
MRI f or the diagnosis of placenta accr eta, in turn r educing cost s. The discussion about 
birth options being carried out b y a senior obst etrician is not a change in practice and so 
will not ha ve a resour ce impact. 
Specialist r egional placenta accr eta spectrum centr es ar e already established, so 
recommending appr opriat e referral t o them will not ha ve a resour ce impact. Ensuring t hat 
all mat ernity centr es (bot h local unit s and specialist centr es for placenta accr eta 
spectrum) understand t heir r esponsibilities will enable saf e car e to be pr ovided.

Ther e was e vidence t hat a lo w transv erse straight skin incision wit h blunt dissection of

of 61spinal or epidural diamorphine in t his wa y reduces t he need f or additional opioids and 
other r escue medications during sur gery, and it r emains eff ectiv e for up t o 12 hours (when 
pain is lik ely to be most se vere). The committ ee agr eed t hat it was not necessar y to 
specify a range of doses f or diamorphine. The committ ee w ere awar e of e vidence t hat 
suggest ed a ceiling eff ect in neuraxial opioid doses, abo ve which t here is no mor e 
analgesic eff ect but t here is an incr eased risk of side eff ects. In most cases, a maximum 
intrat hecal dose of 300 micrograms and a maximum epidural dose of 3 mg ar e consider ed 
to be adequat e. These ar e the doses suggest ed by the Obst etric Anaest hetist s' 
Association and ar e the doses used in curr ent clinical practice. In individual cases, and 
based on clinical judgement, anaest hetist s ma y choose t o use alt ernativ e doses of 
intrat hecal or epidural diamorphine. 
As there ma y be int ermitt ent shor tages of diamorphine, t he committ ee agr eed t hat 
preservative-free morphine could be used as an alt ernativ e and t hat advising t his 
alternativ e will pr ovide clear guidance f or healt hcare professionals t o follow in t his 
situation. This will r educe t he lik elihood of incorr ect pr eparations or dosages of morphine 
being substitut ed for diamorphine. The committ ee agr eed t hat f entan yl has a rapid onset 
of action and will help ensur e rapid onset of pain r elief until t he intrat hecal morphine tak es 
full eff ect. The dose of intrat hecal morphine plus f entan yl and of epidural morphine ar e 
based on t hose r ecommended b y the Obst etric Anaest hetist s' Association. In individual 
circumstances, and based on clinical judgement, anaest hetist s ma y choose t o use 
alternativ e doses of t hese drugs. 
The committ ee w ere awar e that neuraxial morphine was mor e likely to lead t o side eff ects 
than neuraxial diamorphine, and so advised t hat t hese side eff ects ma y need tr eatment t o 
reduce t he se verity of sympt oms. Based on stak eholder f eedback, t he committ ee made an 
additional r ecommendation t o advise on t he saf e storage and use of pr eservative-free 
morphine, par ticularly in settings wher e bot h preservative-free and pr eservative-
containing morphine ar e available. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat w omen r eceiving r egional anaest hesia should be off ered oral 
morphine sulf ate, as t he evidence sho wed it t o be eff ectiv e. 
The e vidence on pain r elief f or women aft er general anaest hesia was sparse, but t he 
committ ee agr eed t hat intra venous patient -contr olled analgesia (PCA) using morphine 
should be off ered as t hese w omen will lik ely ha ve a higher le vel of pain. Monit oring 
requir ement s for women and people ha ving PCA morphine no w includes pulse o ximet er 
oxygen saturation as t his is one of t he respirat ory monit oring modalities used in Caesar ean bir th (NG192)

of 61conjunction wit h respirat ory rat e and sedation assessment. If PCA morphine is not 
acceptable t o the w oman, t hen oral morphine should be consider ed as a less in vasive 
alternativ e. 
From t heir kno wledge and e xperience, t he committ ee agr eed t hat paracetamol and a non-
steroidal anti-inflammat ory drug (NSAID) such as ibupr ofen should be off ered in 
combination t o all w omen t o limit t he amount of opioids needed, and t o allo w opioids t o be 
stopped. Based on t he evidence on t he benefit s of fix ed int erval pain management timing, 
the committ ee recommended t hat t hese ar e prescribed t o be tak en regularly t o maintain 
good pain contr ol, in pr eference t o on-r equest administration, which had lo wer rat es of 
satisf action r epor ted by women. 
Some w omen will ha ve contraindications t o NSAIDs (f or example, inflammat ory bowel 
disease, gastric ulcer or pr e-eclampsia) and will not get sufficient pain r elief fr om 
paracetamol alone. Based on t heir e xperience, t he committ ee suggest ed an alt ernativ e of 
dihydrocodeine in addition t o paracetamol, or co-dy dramol, as t hese ar e also suitable f or 
use while br eastf eeding. 
Ther e was e vidence f or the eff ectiv eness of o xycodone, and some e vidence f or tramadol, 
but t he committ ee w ere awar e bot h of t hese drugs can cause neonatal sedation and 
respirat ory depr ession if used when br eastf eeding. Ho wever, in w omen wit h severe pain, 
the committ ee agr eed t hat a shor t course of tramadol or o xycodone could be consider ed 
as long as t he w oman was inf ormed of t he risks and chose t o use t hem. The lengt h of t he 
course was not defined as t here was no e vidence f or a specific period or dosage. 
The committ ee w ere awar e that t here were general r ecommendations in t he BNF on t he 
use of opioids in br eastf eeding w omen and so included t hese as par t of t he 
recommendations. The committ ee w ere also awar e of an MHRA warning on t he risk of 
serious neonatal r espirat ory depr ession and sedation wit h codeine in some w omen. 
Because of t his, t hey recommended t hat codeine, or medications t hat include codeine 
(such as co-codamol), should not be used, and t hat w omen should be advised not t o use 
codeine-containing medicines while br eastf eeding. 
Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, t he committ ee recommended t hat anti-emetics 
could be pr escribed if needed f or nausea and v omiting, and t hat laxativ es should be 
consider ed for the pr evention of constipation. Caesar ean bir th (NG192)

of 61How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The dosing of intrat hecal and epidural diamorphine will be simpler f or staff and no 
resour ce impact is anticipat ed fr om t his change. These r ecommendations will lead t o 
increased use of pr eservative-free morphine if t here is a shor tage of diamorphine. 
Preservative-free morphine is mor e expensiv e than diamorphine so t here ma y be an 
increased cost t o the NHS, but as t he fr equency and duration of diamorphine shor tages is 
not kno wn, it is difficult t o predict t he resour ce impact. 
The tr eatment of t he possible side eff ects from morphine ar e not e xpect ed to have a 
resour ce impact as t hese will not aff ect all w omen, some w omen will alr eady r eceiv e anti-
emetics aft er a caesar ean bir th, and t he medicines ar e generics. 
The separat e storage and labelling of diff erent morphine pr eparations ma y requir e 
additional staff time, but as t he fr equency and duration of diamorphine shor tages is not 
known, it is difficult t o predict t he resour ce impact. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he recommendations on post operativ e pain management 
would r einforce curr ent practice. Ho wever, there ma y be a r eduction in t he use of 
intravenous PCA opioids f or pain management aft er caesar ean bir th, and an incr ease in 
the use of oral morphine. The committ ee agr eed t hat t he recommendations r elating t o 
dihydrocodeine and codeine-containing medicines w ould pr ovide gr eater clarity and 
increase saf ety.
