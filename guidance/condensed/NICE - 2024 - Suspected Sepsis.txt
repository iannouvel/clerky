95Could this be sepsis? 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 W hen to suspe ct sepsis 
1.1.1 Think 'could t his be sepsis?' if a person pr esent s wit h sympt oms or signs t hat 
indicat e possible inf ection. [2016] 
1.1.2 Take into account t hat people wit h sepsis ma y have non-specific, non-localised 
presentations, f or example f eeling v ery unw ell, and ma y not ha ve a high 
temperatur e. [2016] 
1.1.3 Pay par ticular att ention t o concerns e xpressed b y the person and t heir f amily or 
carers, f or example changes fr om usual beha viour . [2016] 
1.1.4 Assess people who might ha ve sepsis wit h extra car e if t here is difficulty in taking 
their hist ory, for example people wit h English as a second language or people 
with communication difficulties (such as learning disabilities or autism). [2016 , 
amended 202 4] 
1.1.5 Assess people wit h any suspect ed inf ection t o identify: 
• possible sour ce of inf ection (see t he recommendations on finding and 
contr olling t he sour ce of inf ection ) 
• factors t hat incr ease risk of sepsis (see people who ar e most vulnerable t o Suspect ed sepsis: r ecognition, diagnosis and early management (NG51)

• any indications of clinical concern, such as new-onset abnormalities of 
beha viour , circulation or r espiration. [2016] 
1.1.6 During a r emot e assessment, when deciding whet her t o off er a f ace-t o-face-
assessment and, if so, on t he ur gency of it, identify: 
• factors t hat incr ease risk of sepsis (see people who ar e most vulnerable t o 
sepsis ) and 
• indications of clinical concern such as new-onset abnormalities of beha viour , 
circulation or r espiration. [2016] 
1.1.7 Use a structur ed set of obser vations t o assess people in a f ace-t o-face setting t o 
stratify risk if sepsis is suspect ed. (See t he recommendations on f ace-t o-face 
assessment and t he recommendations on e valuating risk in people wit h 
suspect ed sepsis f or the relevant population gr oup). [2016] 
1.1.8 Use t he national early warning scor e (NEWS2 ) to assess people wit h suspect ed 
sepsis who ar e aged 16 or o ver, are not and ha ve not recent ly been pr egnant , and 
are in an acut e hospital setting, acut e mental healt h setting or ambulance. [202 4] 
1.1.9 Consider using an early warning scor e to assess people wit h suspect ed sepsis 
who ar e: 
• under 16 , in an y setting 
• pregnant or ha ve recent ly been pr egnant, in an y setting 
• 16 or o ver, in a community or cust odial setting. [2016 , amended 202 4] 
1.1.10 Suspect neutr openic sepsis in people who become unw ell and: 
• Are having or ha ve had syst emic anticancer tr eatment wit hin the last 30 days 
• Are receiving or ha ve receiv ed immunosuppr essant tr eatment f or reasons 
unrelated to cancer . Use clinical judgement (based on t he person's specific 
condition, medical hist ory, or bot h, and on t he tr eatment t hey receiv ed) t o 
determine whet her an y past tr eatment ma y still be lik ely to cause Suspect ed sepsis: r ecognition, diagnosis and early management (NG51)

Why this is im portant 
The lack of r obust UK based epidemiological studies on t he incidence and out comes fr om 
sepsis ha ve been clear t hroughout t he guideline de velopment pr ocess. A lar ge 
epidemiological study t o collect inf ormation about wher e sepsis is being tr eated, patient 
interventions and patient out comes w ould pr ovide population based statistics on 
epidemiology of sepsis which ar e necessar y to suppor t evaluation of int erventions, 
planning of ser vices and ser vice r edesign. The mor tality and morbidity and ser vice 
comple xity associat ed wit h severe infection and sepsis, and t he need t o use br oad-
spectrum antimicr obials t o treat sepsis, justifies t he cost r equir ed to set up such a study .

The NEWS2 has been intr oduced in 2017 and is widely used acr oss t he NHS pr e-hospital

Lack of data t o stratify risk of se vere illness or deat h from sepsis and estimat e possible

In primar y car e and emer gency depar tment s people wit h suspect ed sepsis ar e oft en seen 
by relativ ely ine xperienced doct ors. Man y of t hese people will be in lo w and medium risk

The committ ee car efully t hought about car e for people wit h neutr openia or 
immunosuppr ession, such as t hose on anticancer tr eatment and immunosuppr essant 
therapies, because sepsis shar es man y of t he same signs and sympt oms as neutr openic 
sepsis. The committ ee agr eed t hat people wit h suspect ed neutr openic sepsis ar e at v ery 
high risk and should be tr eated in line wit h NICE's guideline on neutr openic sepsis in 
people wit h cancer . 
Return t o recommendations

Recommendation 1 .3.9 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he initial assessment is an impor tant oppor tunity t o identify

Evidence sho wed an incr eased risk of ICU admission and mor tality in people wit h

suppor ts the findings of t he 2022 AoMRC stat ement on t he initial antimicr obial tr eatment

The committ ee agr eed, based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, t hat:

95Interpr eting NEW S2 scor es 
The committ ee discussed t he impor tance of clinical judgement when int erpreting t he 
NEWS2 scor es. The y agr eed t hat t he NEWS2 should be used as a t ool to suppor t clinical 
decision making, not t o replace clinical judgement. A NEWS2 scor e should t hus be 
interpreted wit hin the cont ext of t he patient's hist ory and ph ysical e xamination r esult s. 
The committ ee also ackno wledged t hat NEWS2 can be less accurat e in people wit h 
certain conditions, such as people wit h spinal injur y or hear t or lung disease, because of 
their alt ered baseline ph ysiology . 
The committ ee also highlight ed that mott led or ashen appearance, non-blanching rash or 
cyanosis of skin, lips or t ongue can be signs of meningococcal disease. [202 4] 
NEW S2 scor e of 0 
The committ ee discussed t he car e for someone wit h a NEWS2 scor e of 0 . The y were 
concerned t hat a scor e of 0 ma y be int erpreted as indicating t hat t here was no risk and no 
action was needed. The y emphasised t hat people wit h a possible or confirmed inf ection 
and a NEWS2 scor e of 0 ar e still at risk of sepsis and should r eceiv e routine NEWS2 scor e 
monit oring in line wit h local practice. 
They also agr eed t hat acut e illness is a dynamic stat e and tr eatment priorities must be 
adjust ed over time. The y agr eed t o highlight t hat det erioration or lack of impr ovement in 
the person's condition might indicat e the need t o tak e mor e urgent actions t han suggest ed 
by their NEWS2 scor e alone, depending on an y previous NEWS2 scor e or action alr eady

Single par amet er contributing 3 point s to a NEW S2 scor e 
In the NEWS2 framew ork as defined b y the Royal College of Ph ysicians f or the assessment 
of acut e illness se verity (t hat is, not specific t o sepsis), specific att ention is giv en to a 
NEWS2 scor e of 3 in a single paramet er, which is classified as lo w-medium risk. The 
AoMRC r epor t on t he initial antimicr obial tr eatment of sepsis uses t he NEWS2 t o evaluat e 
risk of se vere illness or deat h from sepsis. It does not suppor t syst ematic use of a single

No e vidence was identified f or acut e mental healt h settings, so t he committ ee made

The committ ee agr eed t hat, in acut e mental healt h settings, immediat e transf er will not 
alwa ys be needed f or people wit h a moderat e, low or v ery low risk of se vere illness and 
deat h from sepsis. [202 4] 
In people at moderat e risk of se vere illness or deat h from sepsis, t he committ ee agr eed 
that transf er to hospital ma y be needed, depending on t he definitiv e diagnosis of t he 
person's condition and whet her it could be tr eated saf ely out side of hospital. The 
committ ee was awar e that not all mental healt h settings w ould ha ve the exper tise t o

healt h conditions. Because of t he variation in ser vices, and t he lack of e vidence, t he 
committ ee recommended f ollowing local emer gency pr otocols on tr eatment and 
ambulance transf er. [202 4]. 
People at lo w or v ery low risk of se vere illness and deat h do not need immediat e transf er, 
but t heir le vel of risk can still change rapidly . The committ ee recommended pr oviding 
information t o these people about which sympt oms t o monit or and ho w to access medical

How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice

to avoid an e xcessiv ely high v olume of r eferrals, t hat w ould put undue pr essur e on 
emer gency depar tment s and acut e hospital war ds, while also a voiding geographical 
inequalities associat ed wit h transf er time. The committ ee striv ed to create a bett er 
balance while a voiding a negativ e impact on curr ent practice. [202 4] 
If not alr eady in place, rural ambulance ser vices ma y need t o produce local guidance or 
put mechanisms in place t o ensur e antibiotics can be pr escribed f or people at high risk of 
severe illness or deat h from sepsis. This ma y involve:

Why the committ ee made t he recommendations 
Timing of antibiotics 
Given the lack of dir ect e vidence, t he committ ee decided, b y consensus, t o recommend 
adopting t he initial antimicr obial tr eatment of sepsis out lined in t he 2022 AoMRC

• by somet hing ot her t han t he curr ent inf ection or 
• by the body's dysr egulat ed response t o the inf ection leading t o organ f ailure (that is, 
by sepsis). 
Based on t heir clinical e xper tise, t he committ ee concluded t hat, if t he lik ely cause of t he 
3 point s in 1 paramet er is t he curr ent inf ection, t he person's risk of se vere illness or deat h 
from sepsis is higher t han t hat indicat ed by their NEWS2 scor e alone and t he timeframe 
for antibiotic tr eatment should be adjust ed accor dingly . [202 4, amended 202 4] 
When t o count time fr om (time z ero) 
To guide t he appr opriat e timing f or deliv ering antibiotics, t he committ ee discussed what

However, the committ ee raised concerns about possible inequalities and dela ys in clinical

so the committ ee recommended t hat clinical judgement should be used when deciding if a

For people at high risk, t he committ ee br oadened t he 2016 r ecommendation on escalation 
to cover lack of r esponse wit hin 1 hour of an y intervention (t he original r ecommendation

For people at moderat e risk whose NEWS2 scor e remains t he same or goes up f ollowing

95Context 
Sepsis is a clinical syndr ome caused b y the body's immune and coagulation syst ems being 
switched on b y an inf ection. Sepsis wit h shock is a lif e-threatening condition t hat is 
charact erised b y low blood pr essur e despit e adequat e fluid r eplacement, and or gan 
dysfunction or f ailure. Sepsis is an impor tant cause of deat h in people of all ages. Bot h a 
UK Parliamentar y and Healt h Ser vice Ombudsman enquir y (2013) and a UK National 
Confidential Enquir y into Patient Out come and Deat h (NCEPOD , 2015) highlight ed sepsis 
as being a leading cause of a voidable deat h that kills mor e people t han br east, bo wel and 
prostat e cancer combined. 
Sepsis is difficult t o diagnose wit h cer tainty . Although people wit h sepsis ma y have a 
history of inf ection, f ever is not pr esent in all cases. The signs and sympt oms of sepsis can 
be very non-specific and can be missed if clinicians do not t hink 'could t his be sepsis?' . In 
the same wa y that healt hcare professionals consider 'could t his pain be car diac in origin?' 
when pr esent ed wit h someone of an y age wit h chest pain t his guideline aims t o mak e

infection. 
Detailed guidelines e xist f or the management of sepsis in adult and paediatric int ensiv e 
care unit s, and b y intensiv e car e clinicians called t o other settings. T o reduce a voidable 
deat hs, people wit h sepsis need t o be r ecognised early and tr eatment initiat ed. This 
guideline aims t o ensur e healt hcare syst ems in all clinical settings consider sepsis as an 
immediat e life-threatening condition t hat should be r ecognised and tr eated as an
