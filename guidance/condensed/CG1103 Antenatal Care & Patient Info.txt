The purpose of this guideline is to provide good practice evidence for staff involved in antenatal care. It aims to provide clear guidance on the provision of antenatal care for pregnant women and birthing people including booking appointments, antenatal risk assessments. The antenatal period is defined from conception to the birth of the baby. Antenatal care provision is in an area local to the pregnant woman and birthing person by a team of midwives. All health professionals involved in providing care for pregnant women and birthing people should work together to ensure the package of care offered is individualized and meets their needs. Each antenatal appointment should be structured and focused with adequate time for discussion to enable informed choices and to discuss concerns and anxieties. This guideline applies to midwives, obstetricians, specialist midwives, anaesthetists, and maternity support workers. Pregnant women and birthing people with existing health problems/medical concerns may be reviewed by an Obstetric Consultant or other relevant doctor prior to booking. The booking appointment is primarily a process of risk assessment, information giving, and health promotion. Pregnant women and birthing people will have an antenatal risk assessment completed at booking by the midwife. This contains all relevant medical, obstetric, psychiatric, and social history. Pregnant women and birthing people aged 24 and under should be offered Chlamydia & Gonorrhea Screening in every pregnancy. The midwife must also explain and gain consent for other blood tests and urine tests and document this on MIS. If booking blood tests are declined, this must be clearly documented and the Screening Team notified.

Women and birthing people should be asked at booking for consent to receive blood and blood products. Midwives should discuss antenatal screening and record consent. Maternity records should include various details like test results and risk assessments. Antenatal care information should be provided at appointments, including screening programs and baby development. Partners should be involved in care if desired. Community midwives should ensure access to online resources and the Patient Knows Best platform. 

Midstream urine samples should be taken and cultured for pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. Urinalysis should be done at each appointment to check for proteinuria and UTIs. Recurrent UTIs should be reviewed by an obstetrician. 

Documentation and ongoing appointments should include updating records, risk assessments, and discussions on various topics. Consultant-led care should be provided based on risk assessments, with referrals made as needed. Specialist referrals may be required for certain conditions. Safeguarding concerns and vulnerabilities should be raised appropriately, and referrals to mental health services and support for domestic abuse should be made. Pregnant women at risk of FGM should also be identified and supported.

Pregnant women with FGM should be identified and supported accordingly. Smoking cessation advice should be given at the first antenatal appointment. Alcohol consumption should be discussed and low-risk drinking guidelines followed. Weight management advice should be provided to pregnant women with a BMI <30. Monitoring fetal growth and wellbeing is essential to reduce stillbirth risk. Common pregnancy problems like nausea, heartburn, vaginal discharge, pelvic girdle pain, and vaginal bleeding should be addressed and managed accordingly.

Refer pregnant women and birthing people with unexplained vaginal bleeding to EPAC if under 16 weeks. Pregnant women and birthing people over 16 weeks should be reviewed on labour ward. Pregnant women and birthing people from minority ethnic backgrounds and deprived areas may need closer monitoring and additional support due to increased risks. Migrant pregnant women should have a medical history taken and clinical assessment. Language support should be provided for patients requiring it. Pregnant women and birthing people should have access to unbiased information to make informed choices. Antenatal care should be provided in a welcoming and accessible environment. Monitoring of fetal growth is essential, with referrals for growth scans as needed. Review previous pregnancy health records for high-risk pregnant women and birthing people. Maintain continuity of carer throughout the antenatal period. Ensure clear communication and coordination of care for pregnant women and birthing people with complex medical problems.

Please send the records to the Antenatal Clinic at the appropriate address. Thank you for your assistance. Senior Midwife, Antenatal Clinic, Worthing Hospital / St Richards Hospital, Chichester.
