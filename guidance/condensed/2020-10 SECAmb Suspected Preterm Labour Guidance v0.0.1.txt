Suspected Preterm Labour: Guidance for Frontline Clinicians

Over the last 25 years, the prospects for babies born very premature have greatly improved. Services have been re-organised into networks to ensure expert care can be delivered when needed. It is crucial to have extremely preterm births in the right place for better outcomes. In an emergency, go to the nearest hospital with a labour ward. Different neonatal units provide care based on gestational age. If there are concerns for preterm labour, assess clinical status and make appropriate transfers to the nearest facility with the necessary level of care.
