Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth
Recommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS, offering planned VBAC to most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. VBAC success rate is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being a predictor of success. Planned VBAC should be conducted in a suitably staffed delivery suite. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis given. VBAC may not be suitable for pregnancies with certain complications. A structured antenatal care schedule should be followed, with counselling by a member of the maternity team. VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with certain risk factors may have increased adverse outcomes with VBAC.

Previous caesarean deliveries increase the risk of placenta praevia and placenta accreta in subsequent pregnancies. Women with two or more prior caesareans may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC include short inter-delivery interval, post-date pregnancy, maternal age over 40, obesity, and decreased myometrial thickness. Antenatal counselling should be individualized and documented, with consideration of VBAC success rates and future reproductive preferences. Planned VBAC has fewer complications than ERCS, with a small risk of uterine rupture. VBAC is associated with a slightly increased risk of stillbirth, while ERCS has a higher risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Long-term outcomes of repeated ERCS include increased risks of placenta praevia and accreta. Consideration should be given to attempting VBAC in women with multiple future pregnancies.

The NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase in serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared to ERCS. A summary of outcomes indicates a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC compared to ERCS. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Induction and augmentation of VBAC labour are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be given, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Recommended practices for ERCS are outlined in the NICE caesarean section guideline.

Women considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables a reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, particularly reducing the risk of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. Administering maternal corticosteroids may be considered if ERCS is needed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics are more effective in reducing the risk of maternal infection. The choice of thromboprophylaxis should follow RCOG guidance. Special circumstances such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more require a cautious approach when considering VBAC. Induction of labor from 41+0 weeks is recommended to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates in twin pregnancies are similar to singleton pregnancies. Antenatal screening for placenta praevia and accreta is important. Further research is needed on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC with ultrasound, and understanding the increased risk of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery. Auditable topics include documented discussions of risks and benefits of VBAC, successful versus unsuccessful VBAC rates, and maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality.

Condensed version:
- Various studies have been conducted on the risks and outcomes associated with different modes of delivery after a previous cesarean section.
- Factors such as uterine rupture, placenta previa, and maternal morbidity have been examined in relation to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and repeat cesarean sections.
- Patient decision aids and personalized decision-making tools have been developed to assist women in choosing the mode of delivery.
- It is important to consider the risks and benefits of different delivery options, including the impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Planned VBAC refers to the intended mode of delivery for women with a prior cesarean birth who plan to deliver vaginally. Successful VBAC is a vaginal delivery, while unsuccessful VBAC is a cesarean during labor. Uterine rupture is a disruption of the uterine muscle, while uterine dehiscence is a disruption with intact uterine serosa. Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Term delivery-related perinatal death is specific to births at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Neonatal respiratory morbidity includes transient tachypnea and respiratory distress syndrome. Antenatal care includes counseling on delivery options and routine tests. VBAC success rates are influenced by various factors, and guidelines outline intrapartum care for VBAC and ERCS. The pathway for birth choices after cesarean delivery considers risks and benefits, with a focus on VBAC success and uterine rupture risks. The guidelines are based on evidence levels and grades of recommendations.

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG. The review process will commence in 2018.
