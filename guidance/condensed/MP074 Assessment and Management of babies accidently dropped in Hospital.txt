Assessment and Management of babies accidentally dropped in hospital

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards used to determine a course of action. Professional judgement and clinical context should be considered in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all babies who are dropped by any person while in the hospital. It is not applicable to older children over one year.

Responsibilities: Midwives, Obstetricians, and Neonatologists should follow this guidance and use their professional judgement in application of this protocol.

Rationale: Despite efforts to make handling of babies safe, incidents of accidental dropping still occur, leading to significant harm in some cases.

Prevention: New parents should be advised not to fall asleep with babies in the bed or chair and not to leave the baby unattended on a bed, sofa, or changing table.

Management: Babies accidentally dropped in the hospital should be immediately reviewed by staff, and a full set of observations should be taken. A neonatal doctor should be urgently asked to attend for a full clinical assessment.

CT scan Criteria: Suspicion of non-accidental injury, post-traumatic seizure, suspected skull fracture, and other signs may warrant a CT scan.

Safeguarding Issues: Any suspicion of non-accidental injury should be escalated to the safeguarding team for further advice and investigation.
