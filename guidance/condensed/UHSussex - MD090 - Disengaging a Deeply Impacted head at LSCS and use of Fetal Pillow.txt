Disengaging a Deeply Impacted Fetal Head at LSCS and Use of Fetal Pillow

This guideline applies to pregnant individuals requiring a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) at or beyond 37 weeks gestation with a cephalic presentation. It outlines the use of a Fetal Pillow as a first-line action to disengage a deeply impacted fetal head during LSCS. If the fetal head remains impacted, a reverse breech extraction technique can be used as a second-line action. The guideline also provides detailed instructions on how to insert the Fetal Pillow and emphasizes the importance of professional judgment in its application. The management of pre-term cases will depend on individual circumstances and obstetrician's decision-making. The guideline is based on current research and best practice standards.

Clinical Guideline: Fetal Pillow Insertion for Impacted Head at LSCS

- Fetal pillow is a disposable soft silicone balloon inserted into the vagina before LSCS to elevate the fetal head in cephalic presentation.
- Studies suggest it elevates the head by 2-4cm.
- Indications for fetal pillow use include failed instrumental delivery, full dilatation cesarean with the fetal head at or below the ischial spines, and severe caput or molding.
- Operator training is required before using the pillow.
- Various assessments are needed before and during the procedure.
- Perceived difficulty of delivering the head, mode of delivery, Apgar score, injuries to the baby, cord gases, SCBU admission, uterine incision extensions, estimated blood loss, bladder injury, and ICU/HDU admission should all be documented during the procedure.
