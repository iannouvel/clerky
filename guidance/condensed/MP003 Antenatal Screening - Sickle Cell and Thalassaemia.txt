Antenatal screening for Sickle Cell and Thalassemia is a crucial part of maternity care. The screening aims to identify women and couples at risk of having an affected pregnancy. Screening should be offered to all pregnant women, ideally before 10 weeks of pregnancy. Couples who are already aware of their carrier status should be referred for further assessment. It is important to note that screening based on the Family Origin Questionnaire may not identify all carriers of haemoglobin disorders. Women have the right to decline screening if they choose to do so.

9. Women who decline screening should have the reason documented and can opt for screening at a later date through their community midwife. 
10. Samples for screening can be taken at booking and should be sent to the laboratory within one working day. 
11. Unacceptable samples will be notified to the screening midwives for action. 
12. Results will be available within 3 working days, with some rare disorders taking longer for a final diagnosis. 
13. A failsafe check should be done within 10 days of sample collection to ensure results are followed up. 
14. Screening results will fall into four categories: non-carrier, inconclusive, clinically significant disorder, or genetic carrier. 
15. Samples from the baby's father or second biological parent should be taken if indicated, with results communicated back to the parents.

requested, these cases MUST be discussed with the appropriate prenatal diagnostic laboratory prior to testing to ascertain whether additional blood samples are required from the mother or birthing parent and to clarify the likelihood of limitations to testing with the absence of paternal or second biological parent DNA diagnosis. 

Follow up of Paternal Blood Results:
- Nothing abnormal detected on screening of babyâ€™s father: The parents should be informed that they are not at risk of having a baby with a major haemoglobin disorder, but there is a 50% chance their baby will inherit the same haemoglobin type as the mother. Implications should be discussed.
- Where the father is found to be a carrier at-risk couple identified: Couples identified as at-risk should be referred to the antenatal screening midwives for discussions about prenatal diagnosis. Specialized counseling can be accessed for unusual hemoglobin types.

Screening Results:
- Testing babies born to known at-risk couples: Couples known to be at high risk who declined prenatal diagnosis may request postnatal testing for their child. The neonatal team should take a blood specimen for analysis soon after birth.

Failsafe arrangements:
- Antenatal screening midwives maintain a shared database of carrier women to ensure timely follow-up of results.

Patient information:
- The NHS Sickle Cell & Thalassaemia Screening Programme was set up in England in 2001 to address sickle cell disease and thalassaemia disorders. These conditions affect the quality or quantity of hemoglobin in red blood cells and are autosomal recessive conditions.

Antenatal Screening for Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia: Provide written and verbal information and offer screening to all women at booking. Results will be checked 2 weeks after being taken. If results show a carrier or affected mother, refer to obs cons. A letter is sent to carrier mums inviting the dad for a screening test. If both parents are carriers, there is a 1 in 4 chance the baby could inherit a haemoglobin disorder. Contact BSUH designated programme leads for maternity services for more information.
