Recovery Care Maternity Protocol: MP051
Date agreed September 2018

Key Principles:
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope:
This protocol applies to any woman following regional block/general anaesthetic for caesarean section or any other operative obstetric procedure.

Responsibilities:
Recovery Practitioners, Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Objective Standards Recovery:
Post anaesthetic recovery involves the short term critical care required by patients until stable, conscious, and orientated, and discharge criteria have been met.

Resources:
All patients should be recovered in a designated area by trained staff with continuous one-to-one care available immediately following anesthesia.

Roles and responsibilities for staff in obstetric recovery:
Various staff members have specific responsibilities for communicating, providing care, and coordinating with others in the recovery process.

Equipment that should be available:
Specific equipment should be available in each bed area and in close proximity to the recovery area.

Criteria for transfer to the Recovery Area:
Patients must meet specific criteria before being transferred to the recovery area, including being extubated, self-ventilating, oxygenated, and cardiovascularly stable.

Hand-Over to the Recovery Area:
Details such as the procedure performed, type of anesthesia used, and post-operative instructions should be communicated during hand-over to the recovery area.

Care of mother in Recovery:
Following any procedures, patients will be transferred to the designated recovery area and receive one-to-one care for a specific duration based on the procedure and risk category.

Referrals:
Recovery staff should refer to the midwife or obstetrician if there are concerns about maternal blood loss during the recovery period.

- If a patient is bleeding heavily and/or showing signs of hypovolaemic shock, the recovery nurse/midwife should trigger the Obstetric Haemorrhage emergency pathway
- If the MEOWS chart triggers a review, an Obstetric and Anaesthetic review is required
- If a woman's pain is not managed with prescribed drugs, the anaesthetist should be asked to review
- If recovery nurses/midwives have concerns about the woman's condition, they should ask for an Obstetric and Anaesthetic review
- An anesthetist should be informed if the patient does not meet discharge criteria
- Criteria for discharge and transfer from recovery area include consciousness, stable cardiovascular system, controlled pain, stable vital signs, and other factors
- When ready to be transferred to postnatal care, the mother should be returned to the ward with clean pads and a neat bed
- A qualified midwife or nurse should give handover to the midwife taking over the patient's care
- Anaesthetist should be informed if the patient does not meet discharge criteria
- If oxygen saturation is <95% in air, oxygen therapy is required and the anaesthetist should be notified
- If temperature is outside the normal range, the doctor should be informed
- Attending staff must document their assessment in the Obstetric Theatre and Recovery Care Pathway when assessing a woman for discharge or transfer
- Post-operative period should be observed for complications and urinary catheter should be removed once the woman is mobile
- Inadequate pain relief after surgery may contribute to negative perceptions of birth, chronic pain, and depression. Pain scores should be measured regularly and all patients should receive regular analgesic drugs as prescribed
- All patients who have received opiates should receive regular laxatives post-operatively unless there are concerns about bowel injury or an ileus
- Women with problems attributable to a complication of their anaesthetic should be referred to the obstetric anaesthetist for review
