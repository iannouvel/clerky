RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49
PREVENTING ENTRY-RELATED GYNAECOLOGICAL LAPAROSCOPIC INJURIES
Approximately 250,000 women undergo laparoscopic surgery in the UK each year, with serious complications occurring in about one in 1000 cases. This guideline aims to reduce complications related to laparoscopic entry techniques. Bowel damage associated with laparoscopic surgery may not be immediately recognized, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Surgeons should be trained in safe laparoscopic techniques, and the primary trocar should be inserted in a controlled manner at 90 degrees to the skin. The Veress needle or open (Hasson) approach can be used for entry, with no significant safety advantage to either technique. Direct trocar insertion is an acceptable alternative method, and there are devices available to minimize risks during trocar insertion. Surgeons should be aware of the risks and complications associated with laparoscopy and counsel patients accordingly. Women should be informed of the risks and potential complications, including injury to the bowel, urinary tract, major blood vessels, and later complications associated with entry ports. Surgeons should ensure appropriate training, supervision, and experience in laparoscopic surgery. Intra-abdominal pressure should be maintained at 20-25 mmHg before inserting the trocar. Alternative entry techniques, such as direct trocar insertion or alternative devices, can also be considered.

Alternative sites for primary trocar or Veress needle insertion include Palmer's point, especially in cases of previous surgery or splenomegaly. Adhesion formation at the umbilicus may make it an inappropriate site for insertion after abdominal surgery. Secondary ports should be inserted under direct vision perpendicular to the skin, ensuring pneumoperitoneum at 20-25 mmHg. In obese women, the open (Hasson) technique or entry at Palmer's point is recommended. For very thin women, the Hasson technique or insertion at Palmer's point is preferred. Special care is needed for entry in young, thin, nulliparous women with well-developed abdominal musculature. Documentation of appropriate counseling and reporting of adverse events or complications are essential auditable standards.

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines and Audit Committee of the RCOGRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 49 10 of 10Grades of recommendations
Requires at least one randomised controlled trial as part of a body of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation. (Evidence levels Ia, Ib)
Requires the availability of well controlled clinical studies but no randomised clinical trials on the topic of recommendations. (Evidence levels IIa, IIb, III)
Requires evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experiences of respected authorities. Indicates an absence of directly applicable clinical studies of good quality. (Evidence level IV)
Good practice point
Recommended best practice based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.

Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1: Guidance for the Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at www.rcog.org.uk/clingov1 ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
