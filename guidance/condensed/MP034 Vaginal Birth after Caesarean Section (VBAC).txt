Benefits and Risks of VBAC compared to ERCS:  
 
Planned VBAC:  
- If successful, shorter stay and recovery  
- Approximately 0.5% risk of uterine scar rupture  
- Increased likelihood of future vaginal birth  
- Risk of anal sphincter injury is 5%  
- Maternal death risk is 4/100000  
- 72-75% chance of successful VBAC  
- Increased rate of instrumental delivery up to 39%  
 
ERCS from 39+ Weeks:  
- Longer stay and recovery  
- Virtually avoids risk of uterine rupture  
- Likely to require caesarean delivery in future pregnancies  
- Increased risk of placenta previa/accreta and adhesions  
- Maternal death risk is 13/100000  
- Option for sterilization if fertility is no longer desired  
 
Infant Outcomes:  
- VBAC: 8 per 10000 risk of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)  
- VBAC: 2-3% risk of transient respiratory morbidity  
- ERCS: <1 per 10000 risk of delivery-related perinatal death or HIE  
- ERCS: Risk of transient respiratory morbidity of 4-5%
