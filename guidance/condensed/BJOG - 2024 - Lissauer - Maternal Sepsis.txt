This is the second edition of this guideline, which was first published in 2012 as two separate guidelines: Green- top Guideline (GTG) No. 64a Bacterial Sepsis in Pregnancy ; and GTG No. 64b 
Bacterial Sepsis Following Pregnancy . KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
• Consider sepsis as a possible diagnosis in all women during pregnancy, and in the intrapartum and postpartum period, with a 
suspected infection and whose clinical condition rapidly deteriorates. [Good Practice Point (GPP)]
• If sepsis is suspected in the community, urgent escalation and referral to hospital is indicated. [GPP]
• Monitoring of a woman with suspected sepsis should be performed using an early warning system modified for obstetrics, 
managed through a multidisciplinary approach with early escalation and senior input. [GPP]
• Serum lactate should be measured urgently in women with features indicating a high risk of sepsis. Serum lactate of 4 mmol/l or 
more should prompt immediate escalation of care, including consideration of discussion with critical care team. [Grade D]
• Any relevant imaging studies should be performed promptly to confirm the source of infection. [Grade D]
• Use of a sepsis bundle may improve compliance with urgent management in women at high risk of sepsis. [Grade D]
• Administration of intravenous broad- spectrum antibiotics is recommended within one hour in women at high risk of sepsis, 
with or without septic shock. [Grade C]
• In a critically ill pregnant woman, birth of the baby can be expedited if it would be beneficial to the woman or the baby or to 
both. A decision on the timing and mode of birth should be made by a senior obstetrician following discussion with the woman 
and/or family if her condition permits. [GPP]
• During the intrapartum period, continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended. Caution is required if considering fetal 
blood sampling. [GPP]
• An individual risk assessment should be made by a senior anaesthetist with regards to type of anaesthesia, as well as the need 
for invasive monitoring. [GPP]
• Babies of women treated for sepsis during labour, or in the 24 hour period before or after birth, require assessment for risk 
factors and clinical indicators of neonatal infection. [Grade D]

e62 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 20251 | Purpose and Scope
The need for such a guideline was originally identified by the 
2007 Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths [ 1]. The scope 
of this guideline covers the recognition and management of 
sepsis in the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum periods, 
including post- abortion sepsis. The scope includes bacterial in -
fections arising in the genital tract or elsewhere and influenza 
and their management in secondary care. Sepsis arising due to 
primary viral (other than influenza and HSV) or parasitic infec -
tion is outside the scope of this guideline. There is separate spe -
cific guidance available on Coronavirus (COVID- 19) infection 
in pregnancy [ 2].
This guideline is for healthcare professionals who care for 
women, non- binary and trans people suspected of, or diagnosed 
with, sepsis in primary or secondary healthcare. This guideline 
excludes mild to moderate illness in primary care.
Within this document we use the terms woman and women's 
health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not 
only women for whom it is necessary to access women's health 
and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaeco -
logical health and reproductive wellbeing. Gynaecological and 
obstetric services and delivery of care must therefore be appro -
priate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals 
whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were as -
signed at birth.
2 | Introduction and Background
Sepsis during and following pregnancy remains an import -
ant cause of maternal death globally, accounting for 11% of 
all maternal deaths [ 3]. Between 2019–21, 241 of 2 066 997 
women giving birth in the UK died. Of these, 78 women died 
of sepsis, either direct or indirect. Despite a statistically non- 
significant increase in the overall maternal death rate due to sepsis in the UK between 2016–18 and 2019–21, most of 
this was accounted for by SARS- COV- 2 viral infections in 
unvaccinated women.
In the UK and Ireland, during or up to six weeks after the end 
of pregnancy and defined “ in the broadest sense as death from a 
primary infective cause ” the overall mortality rate for sepsis was 
2.50 per 100 000 maternities (95% CI 1.89–3.25 per 100 000) [ 1, 4].
Between 2019–21, 10% of all maternal deaths were due to sepsis 
and 14% of deaths were due to COVID- 19 infection [ 4]. Overall, 
47 of the 78 deaths (60%) were attributable to viral infections, 
43 due to COVID-19, one varicella zoster virus, one viral myo -
carditis of unknown cause and two following influenza A [ 4]. 
Deaths attributable to influenza A were significantly lower than 
in the years 2010–12 when 13 women died, reflecting the impor -
tance of vaccination. Only one of the 43 women who died from 
SARS- CoV- 2 had been vaccinated, and had only had one dose of 
COVID- 19 vaccine [ 4].
The number of bacterial sepsis related deaths was significantly 
higher than in the previous MBRRACE report (2015–2017), [ 5] 
where a breakdown of responsible agents was given as 27 deaths 
overall, 16 classified as ‘direct’ maternal deaths from sepsis and 
ten due to genital tract sepsis [ 5]. Excluding SARS- COV- 2 deaths, 
the dramatic decline from an overall figure of 2.04 deaths due to 
sepsis per 100 000 maternities (data from the 2009–12 MBRRACE 
report) [ 6] likely reflects the combination of increasing influenza 
vaccine uptake, mandatory education of healthcare staff to rec -
ognise sepsis and implementation of various sepsis- related guide -
lines, including the previous edition of this RCOG Green- top 
Guideline. The National Maternity and Perinatal Audit (NMPA) 
report examining maternity admissions to intensive care in 
2015/2016 highlighted the importance of infection as the second 
most common cause for admission, after haemorrhage. The most 
common infections were pneumonia (44%), urinary tract (20.4%) 
and genital tract infections (18.5%) [ 7].
Suboptimal care continues to be identified in many cases where 
women die from sepsis [ 1, 3, 4 ]. To reduce maternal death from 
sepsis requires high levels of vigilance and to “ Think Sepsis ” at 
an early stage with any unwell, pregnant or recently pregnant 
woman. Key actions are the importance of early diagnosis, the 
rapid initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics and the need for 
review by senior doctors and midwives and early involvement 
of relevant experts such as infection specialists and critical care, 
where appropriate. To avoid preventable deaths the importance 
of maternal vaccination for influenza and COVID- 19 must be 
continually promoted [ 2, 4, 5 ].

These cases prompted calls for HSV and other viral infections to 
be considered when evaluating the cause of postpartum infec -

report on the cases [ 9].
3 | Identification and Assessment of Evidence
This RCOG guideline was developed in accordance with stan -
dard methodology for producing RCOG Green- top Guidelines 
[10]. The Cochrane Library and electronic databases (DARE, 
EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed) were searched using 
the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including 
all subheadings and synonyms, and this was combined with a 
keyword search. Search terms included ‘sepsis and pregnancy’, 
‘bacterial infection and pregnancy’, ‘antenatal bacterial infec -
tion’, ‘bacterial sepsis’, ‘intrapartum septic shock’, ‘intrapartum 
infection’ and ‘maternal pyrexia’ and the search was limited to 
humans and English language. The search was restricted to arti -
cles published between September 2011 to October 2023.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available ev -
idence. In the absence of published evidence, these have been 
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about 
the assessment of evidence and the grading of recommendations 
may be found in Appendix 1 .
4 | Understanding Maternal Sepsis
4.1 | What is Maternal Sepsis?
In 2017 the World Health Organisation defined maternal sepsis 
as “a life- threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction re -
sulting from infection during pregnancy, childbirth, post- abortion, 
or postpartum period.” [11] This definition is aligned with the 
current international consensus definition of adult sepsis and 
supersedes the prior use of the term sepsis to describe infection 
that has caused a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) [ 11].
Aligning the definition of maternal sepsis with the definition 
used in the wider adult population is important for consistency 
in care across patient groups and to enable direct comparisons. 
This also reduces the challenge caused by the physiological 
changes arising from the pregnancy itself, which make it dif -
ficult to apply the SIRS criteria during pregnancy. The inter -
national consensus statement defines organ dysfunction as an 
increase in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) 
score of more than two points. This makes the formal diagno -
sis of sepsis a retrospective one, as the calculation of the SOFA 
score requires laboratory investigations to be completed (See 
Appendix 2).
Septic shock is now described as a clinical construct of sepsis with 
persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain an 
adequate blood pressure (MAP 65 mm Hg or more), alongside a 
persistent serum lactate (either venous or arterial) level more than 
2 mmol/L despite adequate volume resuscitation. Using these cri -
teria, hospital mortality is in excess of 40%. There are no widely 
agreed pregnancy specific adaptations to this definition [ 12].4.2 | Which Women are at Risk of Sepsis?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
All women are at risk of 
sepsis during pregnancy and 
the postpartum period .4 GPP Sepsis is a recognised 
complication of 
labour and birth.
During pregnancy and the 
postpartum period clinicians 
should be aware of and 
be able to recognise the 
risk factors for developing 
maternal sepsis .4 GPP Sepsis is an 
important cause of 
maternal morbidity 
and mortality.
Women at risk of sepsis in 
pregnancy should be made 
aware of this and provided 
information including access 
to care to reduce risk .4 GPP Sepsis is an 
important cause of 
maternal morbidity 
and mortality.
Multiple risk factors for maternal sepsis are described in the 
literature and in maternal morbidity and mortality reports 
(Table  1). Pregnant women are at 20 times increased risk of in -
vasive Group A beta- haemolytic Streptococcus (iGAS) infection 
compared with non- pregnant women, [ 13] and are at an 80- fold 
increased risk up to 28 days postpartum [ 14].
4.3 | What are the Common Organisms Causing 
Sepsis?
Maternal sepsis is caused by a wide range of organisms (Table  2). 
The emergence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and beta- haemolytic 
streptococci of Lancefield group A (GAS) as important causes 
of sepsis and death in pregnant women has been highlighted 
by several authors [ 13, 14, 17–20 ]. In one series, 13 of 45 (29%) 
women with iGAS infections were admitted to intensive care, 
and two died [ 20].
Morbidity due to iGAS remains significant, however, it has 
fallen to less than one third of that reported in the early Centre 
for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) report that initially 
recommended specific education on sepsis for maternity staff 
[22]. During 2019–2021, six women (accounting for 7.6% of the 
sepsis attributable deaths) died of GAS [ 4].
Pregnancy associated GBS sepsis remains an important cause 
of maternal sepsis [ 21, 23, 24, 25 ] and, although morbidity with 
GBS is more common than that of iGAS, there were no GBS re -
lated maternal deaths during 2019–21 [ 4]. [Evidence level 3]
Co- infections with mixtures of Gram- positive and Gram- 
negative organisms remain common, especially in chorioamni -
onitis. Coliform infection is particularly associated with urinary 
sepsis, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and 
cerclage [ 15, 26, 27 ]. Anaerobes, usually Peptostreptococcus spp 
and Bacteroides spp in mixed infections, account for some 8.3% 
of the organisms causing maternal sepsis, especially assoiciated 
with chorioamnonitis [ 21]. [Evidence level 3]
Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in 
pregnancy was reported in 1.9% of North American women [ 28]. 
Since routine antenatal MRSA screening is no longer conducted 
in the UK, the current prevalence in pregnancy is unknown,

e64 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025but is probably below 1%, in line with other European contries 
[29]. In 2010, 0.5% of pregnant women screened in Birmingham 
were MRSA positive [ 30]. Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)- 
producing MRSA was responsible for maternity outbreaks in 
Ireland in 2021 [ 31] and London in 2021–22 [ 32]. Vertical trans -
mission of MRSA at birth due to vaginal colonisation occurs in 
13% of neonates born to carrier mothers [ 33]. PVL- producing 
staphylococci are particularly associated with mastitis and 
breast abscesses [ 32, 34, 35 ]. PVL- related maternal deaths 
have been reported rarely, and more likely to occur with unex -
pected MRSA producing PVL [ 1]. The true prevalence of PVL- 
producing staphylococci in pregnancy in the UK is unknown 
since few laboratories test for PVL production. [Evidence level 3]
Gram negative producing extended- spectrum beta- lactamases 
(ESBL) [ 36] are increasingly carried by UK residents and foreign 
travellers. Carbapenemase producing Enterobacteraceae (CPE) 
are increasing worldwide and pregnant women who are gut 
[36–38 ] or vaginal [ 39] carriers may pass these organisms to the 
baby [ 40]. Since ESBLs render most cephalosporins ineffective 
and CPEs render carbapenems ineffective, their presence means 
empirical choices for mildly penicillin- allergic patients (simple 
rash) are ineffective. [Evidence level 3]
4.4 | What are the Likely Causes of Sepsis Outside 
the Genital Tract and how Might They be Identified?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
A thorough history is 
recommended as soon as 
possible after presentation 
and an appropriate 
physical examination 
should be offered .4 GPP This is considered 
best practice.
Consider and investigate 
other non- infective causes 
that can masquerade as 
sepsis .4 GPP Other obstetric and 
non- obstetric conditions 
share features with the 
presentation of sepsis 
and must be considered.
With increased awareness and earlier, more effective therapy, 
the reported incidence of pregnancy associated GAS has fallen 
[4]. GAS was the cause of five maternal deaths (11%) during the 
2019–21 period [ 4]. Pregnancy- associated GBS sepsis remains 
more common than GAS [ 23–25 ], but the rate of neonatal GBS 
sepsis continues to fall, [ 41] and no women died of GBS sepsis in 
the UK during 2019–2022 [ 4].The first point of contact with a woman may not be face to face, 
and careful assessment should be encouraged via telephone tri -
age and community assessment. However, “repeated presenta -
tion to the general practitioner or community midwife or repeated 
self- referral to the obstetric triage or day assessment unit should be 
considered a ‘red flag’ ” [4] and warrants a thorough clinical assess -
ment to investigate for signs of sepsis (see Table  5 and Appendix 3 ). 
Therefore, women with infection should be offered early in- person 
assessment [ 4] and those with red- flag features seen urgently in 
a setting where appropriate treatment can be rapidly initiated. 
Other diseases can masquerade as sepsis, such as pre- eclampsia 
or other rare diseases (e.g. thrombotic thombocytopenic purpura, 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). [Evidence level 4]

identified; Table  4 lists conditions that may masquerade as sepsis.

e65Healthcare professionals should assess all women with suspected 
infection for maternal sepsis with a risk stratification tool; an 
example of a sepsis risk stratification tool is given in Appendix 
3. The possibility of COVID- 19 must also be considered, and 
an assessment for possible COVID- 19 conducted in line with 
current recommendations [2 ]. Health care providers should be 
aware of the red flag symptoms and signs of maternal sepsis and 
of the rapid, potentially lethal course of sepsis and septic shock (Table  5). Disease progression may be much more rapid than in 
the non- pregnant state. Signs of infection, including pyrexia, may 
not always be present and are not necessarily related to the sever -
ity of sepsis. Genital tract sepsis may present with constant severe 
abdominal pain and tenderness not relieved by usual analgesia. 
Severe infection may be associated with preterm labour. Toxic 
shock syndrome (TSS), caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal 
exotoxins, can produce generalised symptoms including nausea, TABLE 3 | Potential sites of sepsis outside the genital tract and clinical features of their presentation.

clinical signs, suggests necrotising fasciitis (NF) [42, 45]. Blisters 
developing on a background of inflammation or a watery vaginal 
discharge suggests haemolytic streptococcal infection. A ‘sun-
burn’ rash and conjunctival suffusion suggests early TSS (i.e. due 
to S. aureus), whereas the rash is only present in 50% of strepto -
coccal toxic shock [46]. Mastitis can occur in the antenatal period 
as well as postnatally. [Evidence level 4]
Occasionally viral infections can present with sepsis, e.g. influ -
enza, [ 49] SARS- COV- 2 and disseminated HSV [ 50, 51 ]. HSV is 
a rare and potentially fatal disease if contracted in the peripar -
tum period. While it can present with encephalitis, or rarely 
febrile hepatitis, in many cases there are no obvious clinical 
signs of disseminated herpetic infection which can differenti -
ate it from a bacterial cause of sepsis [ 50]. Pregnancy is a risk 
factor for HSV hepatitis, which is responsible for 2%–4% of all 
acute hepatitides [ 50]. The sicker the woman is with dissemi -
nated HSV infection (in the absence of rash), the more likely

e67and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome or acute fatty liver of 
pregnancy [ 51]. [Evidence level 4]
Disseminated HSV infection, presenting with sepsis, encephalitis 
or hepatitis, is rare but often fatal if contracted in the peripartum 
period. As there are often no clinical signs of disseminated her -
petic infection which can differentiate it from bacterial causes 
of infection, HSV should be considered as a causative agent in 
women where there is a failure of first- line antibacterial medica -
tion. Early intravenous aciclovir therapy is vital, and should ide -
ally be started at the same time as the first change in antibacterial 
regime. The diagnosis should be considered if a pregnant woman 
presents with acute febrile hepatitis, as evidenced by markedly 
(greater than 10 times) raised ALT with normal bilirubin, enceph -
alitis or disseminated, often vesicular skin lesions, or a combina -
tion of these [ 50, 51 ]. [Evidence level 4]
Women of Black, Asian and minority ethnic background are at 
higher risk of developing sepsis. This highlights the clear need 
to develop culturally relevant maternity services, to meet the 
growing needs of pregnant women from Black, Asian and mi -
nority ethnic backgrounds in the UK, and reduce the persistent 
health inequalities to improve maternal and infant outcomes 
[52, 53 ]. Healthcare providers must be aware of this increased 
risk in ethnic minority groups and recognise that important 
signs of sepsis, such as skin rashes, may present differently [ 48]. 
[Evidence level 2–]
Non- response of symptoms to treatment for other causes of se -
rious illness, e.g. treatment of haemorrhage, or deterioration 
should prompt a re- consideration of sepsis as a concurrent or 
alternative diagnosis.
5.2 | What are the Appropriate Triggers 
or Features of Sepsis that should Prompt hospital 
Admission from the Community?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
If sepsis is 
suspected in 
the community, 
urgent escalation 
and referral 
to hospital is 
indicated .4 GPP Sepsis is a medical 
emergency requiring 
hospital based care.
Signs and symptoms of possible sepsis should prompt urgent 
referral for hospital assessment; if a woman appears seriously 
unwell, referral for hospital assessment should happen by 
emergency ambulance services. Screening and decision tools 
suitable for community use are available and may assist with 
appropriate management [ 12]. The 2023 MBBRACE report rec -
ommended “post delivery, streptococcal infection, particularly 
GAS, is most likely to present within 12 hours post- birth. Infection 
should be suspected and actively ruled out for women who have 
recently given birth and experience significant abdominal pain 
or persistent vaginal bleeding . […] After pains typically reduce 
in the hours following childbirth and do not develop after dis -
charge. Pain after a vaginal birth that does not settle with simple analgesia should prompt a face to face review and a clinical ex -
amination including both abdominal and vaginal examination if 
indicated ” [4] If there is any concern or repeated presentations 
to the GP or emergency care, all women must be referred im -
mediately back to the obstetric maternity unit or Accident and 
Emergency (A&E). [Evidence level 4]
5.3 | What is the Optimum way to Monitor Women 
with Suspected Sepsis?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
Monitoring 
of a woman 
with suspected 
sepsis should be 
performed using 
an early warning 
system modified 
for obstetrics, 
managed through 
a multidisciplinary 
approach with 
early escalation 
and senior input .4 GPP This reflects best 
practice and NICE 
guidelines on improving 
the recognition and 
response to deterioration 
in unwell adults [ 47].
Women who become unwell during pregnancy and birth often 
deteriorate abruptly following a period of physiological com -
pensation [ 54]. This narrows the window for early detection of 
developing illness. Early escalation to a senior clinician is rec -
ommended for pregnant women. Observations of all vital signs, 
including temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, oxygen sat -
urations and respiratory rate, should be recorded on an early 
warning system [ 55]. This should be modified for obstetrics 
to account for the physiological changes of pregnancy. There 
should be clear instructions for escalation using a structured 
Situation- Background- Assessment- Recommendation (SBAR) 
communication tool [ 54]. [Evidence level 4]
5.4 | What are the Common Investigations when 
Sepsis is Suspected?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
Blood cultures are a key 
investigation and two sets 
should be obtained prior to 
antibiotic administration; 
however, antibiotic 
treatment should be 
started without waiting 
for microbiology results. 
Consider HSV polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) when 
indicated .4 D The key 
investigations for 
suspected sepsis in 
women during and 
after pregnancy 
are described 
in NG51 [ 47].
Serum lactate should be 
measured urgently in women 
with features making them 
at high risk of sepsis. Serum 
lactate of 4 mmol/l or more 
should prompt immediate 
escalation of care, including 
consideration of discussion 
with the critical care team .2— D Recommended 
by NG51 [ 47].

recommendation
Any relevant imaging 
studies should be performed 
promptly to confirm the 
source of infection. These 
may include a pelvic 
ultrasound scan or computer 
tomography scan if pelvic 
abscess is suspected, or a 
chest x- ray for possible chest 
pathology .4 D Recommended 
by NG51 [ 47].
Other microbiological 
samples taken should 
be guided by the clinical 
suspicion of focus of 
infection as appropriate .4 GPP This would be 
regarded as 
best practice.
Routine blood tests should 
include full blood count, 
coagulation screen, urea, 
electrolytes, creatinine, 
liver function tests (LFT), 
C- reactive protein (CRP), 
venous blood gas (or other 
near patient testing) for 
glucose and lactate .4 GPP Recommended 
by NG51 [ 47].
Appropriate virological 
testing, including SARS- 
Cov- 2 testing should be 
undertaken if indicated .4 GPP Follow 
recommendations 
of current 
COVID- 19 
guidance [ 2].
Any woman who is unwell 
with symptoms of tonsillitis/
pharyngitis should have 
a throat swab sent for 
bacterial culture .4 GPP This would be 
regarded as best 
practice to identify 
GAS infection.
If the MRSA status of the 
woman is unknown, a 
premoistened nose swab 
should be sent for rapid 
MRSA screening where such 
testing is available .4 GPP Identification of 
MRSA is important 
to guide therapy 
and infection 
control measures.
Serum lactate should be measured urgently in women with fea -
tures indicating a high risk of sepsis to guide care; however, it 
is recognised that lactate may also be elevated by the physio -
logical process of labour and due to other complications com -
mon in pregnancy, such as bleeding. A lactate of 2 mmol/l or 
more should initiate immediate senior review, intravenous fluid 
administration and repeat lactate measurement thereafter to 
gauge response to treatment. Serum lactate of 4 mmol/l or more 
is indicative of tissue hypoperfusion or cellular metabolic dys -
function. This should prompt immediate escalation of care, in -
cluding consideration of discussion with critical care regarding 
ongoing care and intravenous fluid bolus administration [ 56]. 
[Evidence level 3]
Routine blood tests should include a venous blood gas analysis 
for lactate and glucose and a full blood count, urea, electrolytes, 
creatinine, clotting screen, LFT and CRP [ 56]. The CRP serum 
level rises with bacterial sepsis, thrombus and post- surgery, and 
rarely with viral infections (such as SARS- COV- 2, influenza and 
adenovirus pneumonia). While procalcitonin (PCT) levels can 
help differentiate bacterial from viral infection in non- pregnant 
women, [ 57] hormonal resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
activation by the main PCT producers, [ 58] and a wide range 
of PCT levels in the setting of PPROM, with a doubling of the normal labour mean values [ 59] must be considered when re -
sults are interpreted.
If LFTs show an anicteric pattern (i.e. markedly raised ALT with 
normal bilirubin) consider a diagnosis of herpetic hepatitis and 
treat appropriately, while waiting for results to exclude other 
causes of hepatitis.
In women at high risk of sepsis these investigations and the ini -
tiation of care should commence immediately. Thrombocytosis 
(high platelet count) with a rising CRP and a swinging pyrexia 
often indicates a collection of pus or an infected haematoma. 
[Evidence level 4]
5.4.1 | Bacteriology Samples
A though history can help identify the cause of sepsis (Table 7 ).
Two sets of blood cultures (each set including an aerobic and an -
erobic bottle) should be taken sequentially, within in minutes of 
each other. Increasing the volume of blood sampled maximises 
the aspiration of circulating bacteria and thus the yield of patho -
gens. Blood cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotic ad -
ministration and empirical treatment started without waiting for 
any microbiology results. Consider if a blood sample is indicated 
for HSV PCR. Other microbiology sampling should be guided 
by clinical suspicion of the focus of infection. Where testing is 
available, a nasal in viral transport media may be sent for rapid 
MRSA molecular diagnostic screening. The alternative is a pre- 
moistened nasal swab cultured overnight on selective media. If 
a woman has a normal CRP or symptoms are more suggestive 
of a viral respiratory infection (e.g. SARS- CoV2, influenza) then 
a viral nasal swab should be taken for PCR. Swabs taken from 
throat, vagina, caesarean or other wounds should be sent for bac -
terial culture as appropriate. [Evidence level 4]
Symptoms of tonsillitis/pharyngitis should prompt a throat 
swab for bacterial culture. Diarrhoea warrants routine stool 
culture (e.g. Salmonella, Campylobacter ) as well as testing for 
Clostridium difficile toxin, [ 60] the latter especially if diarrhoea 
follows antimicrobial therapy. An infection specialist should be 
consulted because of the wide range of highly contagious in -
fections necessitating high- level infection control precautions 
to protect staff and other patients. The laboratory should be TABLE 6 | Surviving Sepsis Campaign Hour- 1 Bundle of Care

e70 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025informed if there is a clinical indication for investigations for un -
usual pathogens e.g consumption of soft cheese or cured meats 
(Listeria monocytogenes) , a history of foreign travel (parasites, 
malaria, typhoid, cholera, viral haemorrhagic fever, brucella) 
or hospitalisation (multi- drug resistant organism screening). 
Microbiology results should be reviewed when available to allow 
optimisation of the antibiotic regimen and more targeted ther -
apy [ 61]. [Evidence level 3]
If the woman has been on broad- spectrum antimicrobials before 
developing signs of sepsis it is likely the pathogen is multi- drug 
resistant, and an infection specialist should be consulted for ad -
vice on further antimicrobial options.
Prompt imaging may identify the source of the infection, al -
lowing early definitive treatment, and should not be deferred 
on the grounds of pregnancy alone. This could include a chest 
X- ray and, in women following pregnancy, a pelvic ultrasound 
scan, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance im -
aging (MRI) scan if pelvic abscess is suspected. In women at 
moderate risk of sepsis it is suggested clinical examination 
and results review should be carried out within 1 hour [ 56]. 
[Evidence level 4]
5.4.2 | Samples for Viral Infection Diagnosis
Women suspected of having influenza should be tested im -
mediately using a viral nasal/throat swab for influenza PCR, 
barrier nursed and treated with antivirals while awaiting PCR results [ 62]. Women suspected of SARS- CoV- 2 should be assesses 
according to the RCOG guidance Coronavirus (COVID- 19) infec -
tion in pregnancy [ 2]. [Evidence level 4]
During 2009–12, an upsurge in influenza combined with a 
low vaccination rate, diagnostic delay and lack of treatment ac -
counted for 43% of all infection- related deaths in pregnancy (36 
women); [ 5] in stark contrast to only one death during the three 
years of the subsequent report when vaccination increased, [ 63] 
and two in the 2023 MBRRACE report [ 4].
Influenza related morbidity and mortality is associated with a 
body mass index (BMI) of over 30 kg/m2. Early birth may be in -
dicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. Pulmonary hae -
morrhage due to primary influenza has been reported [ 64, 65 ].
Secondary bacterial infection with pneumococci, beta- 
haemolytic streptococci and S. aureus occur typically after in -
fluenza and other viral respiratory infections. GAS exotoxins 
[66, 67 ] and S. aureus associated PVL [ 68, 69 ] produce a second -
ary necrotising haemorrhagic pneumonia with severe respira -
tory compromise and a high mortality rate [ 43]. [Evidence level 3]
Initiating extra- corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
should be considered in fulminant cases of primary influenza 
pneumonia or SARS- CoV- 2 [4]. The need for updated guidance 
on referral for ECMO therapy was highlighted in the recent

seven percent of those who died received antibiotics the same 
day of diagnosis (c.f 85% controls). Overall, only 33% of those 
who died received antimicrobials within 1 hour of diagnosis, 
and 58% within three hours [ 73]. [Evidence level 2–]
Early fluid resuscitation of crystalloid should be administered, 
starting with a fluid bolus of 500ml in women with hypotension 
or elevated lactate of more than 4mmol/L [ 82]. Further fluid bo -
luses may be required based on the response, but ensure inten -
sive care input if more than two litres volume has been required 
without improvement in hypotension [ 47]. When indicated, 
urine output should be measured with a urinary catheter and 
urometer, recording urine output hourly. Care must be taken in 
women who also have pre- eclampsia or eclampsia as they are 
at higher risk of pulmonary oedema; with individualised care 
guided by close anaesthetic or critical care involvement [ 83]. 
[Evidence level 4]
During and after pregnancy it should be noted that current sys -
temic infection is an important risk factor for venous throm -
boembolism and should prompt reassessment for the correct 
thromboprophylaxis according to current guidelines [ 80].
Maternal pyrexia is an important potential marker of infection, 
but may not always be present in maternal sepsis and is not 
necessarily related to the severity of illness. Indeed, it is im -
portant to recognise that sepsis can present with hypothermia. 
Pyrexia in labour can be managed with supportive measures 
such as increased fluid intake, paracetamol, tepid sponging 
and lowering the environmental temperature. Non- sepsis 
causes of maternal hyperthermia such as epidural anaesthe -
sia and misoprostol are diagnoses of exclusion. Women with a 
fever during labour should be screened for sepsis as already de -
scribed, and the underlying source of infection identified and 
managed [ 84]. Women with pyrexia and suspected infection in 
labour should be offered an antibiotic regimen which covers 
GBS, [ 70, 71 ] and they should be offered continuous fetal mon -
itoring [ 85]. [Evidence level 3]If genital tract sepsis is suspected, GAS and E.Coli are likely 
pathogens [ 4]. Prompt treatment with a combination of high- dose 
broad- spectrum intravenous antibiotics, active against Gram- 
negative bacteria and capable of preventing exotoxin production 
from Gram- positive bacteria, may be lifesaving. The empirical 
choice of antimicrobials should be tailored to local epidemi -
ology and resistance. Local formularies should be consulted, 
narrowing the agent spectrum to that of the causative organ -
ism(s) once identified. Early oral switch and a documented du -
ration should be included in the individual's medical notes [ 61]. 
Source control should be a priority, e.g. surgery to drain pus, 
expedited birth where necessary. Women suspected of having 
infected retained products of conception should be given antibi -
otics and surgery to remove the infected products of conception 
should be performed promptly [ 4]. [Evidence level 4]
Increasing resistance of GBS to clindamycin (31% resistance in 
2022) has necessitated recommendations for substituting ceph -
alosporins or vancomycin for beta- lactam allergic women need -
ing prophylaxis in labour [ 44, 71, 72 ]. Do not use clindamycin 
for prophylaxis or treatment of GBS infection unless it is known 
to be sensitive. [Evidence level 4]
6.1.1 | Group A Beta- haemolytic Streptococcus
Only 0.03% to 0.06% of pregnant women have perineal coloni -
sation with GAS, and are usually asymptomatic [ 86]. Vaginal 
discharge is often watery (leucocytes are destroyed by GAS leu -
cocidins), and not offensive, so may therefore not be thought to 
be significant. However, ascending vaginally, GAS can cause 
endometritis, myonecrosis, peritonitis and streptococcal toxic 
shock syndrome (STSS) [ 87]. [Evidence level 4]
6.1.2 | Necrotising Fasciitis
Post birth wound infection can lead to serious abdominal or remote 
necrotising fasciitis (NF) [ 1, 44, 87–92] and STSS [41, 43 ]. NF refers 
to infection causing necrosis of the superficial and/or deep fascia 
and subcutaneous tissue [ 42, 45 ] and has been reported to occur in 
1.8 per thousand caesarean births [ 91]. Rare cases of NF following 
vaginal birth have been reported [ 4, 42, 43 ]. The most rapid and se -
vere forms of NF are usually due to GAS. Haematogenous or direct 
seeding of tissues followed by spread along fascial planes produces 
few visible external signs in the early stages. Later, tissue oedema 
and thrombosis of the arterial supply to the nerves contributes to 
the cardinal feature of NF, namely very severe pain out of propor -
tion to what can be seen. Typically, increasingly stronger analgesia 
culminating in opioids is an indication of possible NF and regular 
pain scores should be performed. In late infection, the necrotis -
ing process ascends to the surface causing bruising, blisters and 
finally, obvious necrosis [ 42, 45 ].
Bruising in the context of sepsis should raise suspicions of a 
deeper necrotising process [ 4, 42, 45 ]. Following a fatal case 
of delayed diagnosis of NF following birth by caesarean sec -
tion, the authors of the MBRRACE report concluded “ un-
likely a wound will become bruised a week after surgery without 
an underlying cause… …Women often have pictures of their 
wounds ….or they can describe the course of the change if asked… TABLE 8 | Indications for transfer to Intensive Care Unit.

e73Healthcare professionals should also document the appearances 
of a wound when assessing it to allow other staff to compare any 
reported changes.” [ 4]
Women with NF need urgent involvement of a plastic surgeon, 
an intensivist and an infection specialist. Barrier nursing includ -
ing masks should be instituted because of the risk of spread of 
GAS to other patients and healthcare workers [ 93]. For suspected 
NF, a combination of intravenous piperacillin- tazobactam or meropenem plus clindamycin covers most bacteria, including 
GAS, the clindamycin aimed at switching off exotoxin produc -
tion. Since clindamycin is not renally excreted, there is no need 
to reduce the dosage in renal failure. If MRSA is likely, vanco -
mycin should be added. [Evidence level 4]
Streptococcal TSS presents similarly to staphylococcal TSS ex -
cept that less than 50% of streptococcal TSS patients have the 
classical ‘sunburn rash’ found in 100% of patients with TSS.TABLE 9 | Antimicrobial choices and limitations of antimicrobial spectrum (see also Appendix 5 ).

e74 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 20256.1.3 | Antimicrobial Management of Sepsis
Information on antimicrobials and spectrum of activity which may 
aid in guiding choice is given in Table  9. Empirical local hospital 
guidelines should be consulted as they will reflect local epidemiol-
ogy, as the incidence of resistant organisms varies with geograph-
ical areas. The antimicrobials to include in the hospital formulary 
and maternity unit guidelines for sepsis in the puerperium should 
be agreed by clinicians and an infection specialist. [Evidence level 4]
For empirical therapy of life- threatening sepsis, a combination 
of either piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem (for Gram nega -
tive cover) plus clindamycin (for Gram positive and anaerobic or -
ganisms) provides very broad cover, but lacks guaranteed MRSA 
cover. Therefore, if there is any suspicion of MRSA, addition of 
vancomycin is advisable. Local guidelines should always be con -
sulted. If there is a history of severe beta- lactam allergy, an in -
fection specialist should be consulted. An unwell woman with 
a history of multi-drug resistant organism carriage or infection 
(e.g. ESBL/CPE/Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE), or 
suspected PVL or iGAS warrants discussion with an infection 
specialist. Appropriate national guidelines are available on the 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) website. [Evidence level 4]
6.1.4 | Intravenous Immunoglobulins
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
IVIG should be 
considered as part of 
treatment for Gram 
positive necrotising 
infections and 
toxic shock when 
other measures are 
failing. Use should 
be limited to the 
sickest women, 
and administered 
in a critical care 
setting, with a 
blood warming 
device. The main 
contraindication 
to IVIG use 
is congenital 
immunoglobulin 
A deficiency in the 
mother .3 D Intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
has a role in neutralising 
circulating exotoxins 
and superantigens in 
severe unresponsive 
Gram- positive 
necrotising infections 
and toxic shock.
Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) is not effective or indi -
cated for Gram negative infections or sepsis in general. However, 
in severe Gram- positive necrotising infections and toxic shock, 
IVIG has been shown to neutralise circulating exotoxins and su -
perantigens [ 81, 94, 95 ]. The combination of IVIG and clindamy -
cin has been reported as synergistic and beneficial [ 95–97 ] and is 
recommended in the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for 
suspected GAS sepsis in pregnancy [ 95]. IVIG has been recom -
mended for consideration when other measures are failing [ 98]. 
The main contraindication to IVIG use is congenital immuno -
globulin A deficiency [ 98]. [Evidence level 3]
Small case series involving Gram- positive exotoxin- related sep -
sis have reported dramatic improvement with IVIG [ 95, 96, 99 ], 
but data from large trials are lacking. Furthermore, since dosages and timings of administration of IVIG during the septic event 
differ widely between centres, meaningful interpretation of the 
published data is difficult. [Evidence level 3]
IVIG administration should be reserved for critically ill women 
with Gram- positive infections and administered in a critical care 
setting with a blood warming device. Local hospital protocols for 
replacement therapy in haematology patients may be used. Varying 
doses of IVIG of up to 2g/kg have been reported in exotoxin- related 
sepsis in pregnancy with no adverse effects [ 93, 95, 96, 99 ].
6.2 | How should the Fetus be Monitored 
and Timing and Mode of Birth be Decided?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
In a critically ill 
pregnant woman, 
birth of the baby can 
be expedited if it would 
be beneficial to the 
woman or the baby or 
to both. A decision on 
the timing and mode of 
birth should be made 
by a senior obstetrician 
following discussion 
with the woman and/
or her family if her 
condition permits .4 GPP Decisions around 
birth must be 
individualised and 
should be led by a 
senior obstetrician 
in consultation 
with the woman.
If preterm birth is 
anticipated, magnesium 
sulfate should be 
considered if indicated 
and consideration 
should be given to 
the use of antenatal 
corticosteroids for 
fetal lung maturity in 
women with sepsis .4 GPP This follows the 
recommendation 
in NICE guideline 
NG25 [ 100].
During the 
intrapartum period, 
continuous electronic 
fetal monitoring 
is recommended. 
Caution is required if 
considering fetal blood 
sampling .4 GPP These 
recommendations 
are aligned with 
NG121 [ 101] and 
NG229 [ 85].
An individual risk 
assessment should 
be made by a senior 
anaesthetist with 
regards to type of 
anaesthesia, as well as 
the need for invasive 
monitoring4 GPP This 
recommendation 
is derived from 
NG121 [ 101].
The effects of maternal sepsis on fetal wellbeing include the di -
rect effect of infection in the fetus, the effect of maternal illness/
shock and the effect of maternal treatment. The risk of neonatal 
encephalopathy and cerebral palsy is increased in the presence 
of intrauterine infection [ 100]. [Evidence level 2+]
If preterm birth is anticipated, the use of antenatal cortico -
steroids for fetal lung maturity in the woman with sepsis can 
be considered [ 100–102 ]. The use of magnesium sulfate is not 
contraindicated in sepsis, but additional monitoring is advised 
as hypotension may be exacerbated. It should be used for fetal

e75neuroprotection if preterm birth is planned within 24 hours, or 
the woman is in preterm labour. It should be offered to women 
between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks of pregnancy and considered up to 
33+6 weeks of pregnancy [ 101]. [Evidence level 1+]
During the intrapartum period, continuous electronic fetal 
monitoring is recommended in the presence of maternal pyrexia 
(defined as a temperature above 38.0°C once, or 37.5°C on two 
occasions 1 hour apart) [ 84, 100 ]. This should also apply to sepsis 
without pyrexia. Objective evidence of intrauterine infection is 
associated with abnormal fetal heart monitoring. However, elec -
tronic fetal monitoring is not a sensitive predictor of early onset 
neonatal sepsis [ 103, 104 ]. Also consider that CTG changes may 
serve as an early warning sign for derangements in maternal 
physiology and organ dysfunction [ 105]. Caution is required if 
considering fetal blood sampling, as in women with sepsis the 
results can be falsely reassuring [ 100]. [Evidence level 4]
Attempting birth in the setting of maternal instability increases 
maternal and fetal mortality rates, unless the source of infection 
is intrauterine [ 106]. The decision on mode of birth should be in -
dividualised by the consultant obstetrician, in consultation with 
the woman, with consideration to severity of maternal illness, 
the woman's preference, duration of labour, gestational age, 
fetal wellbeing and viability and response to treatment [ 100]. 
[Evidence level 4]
6.3 | What are the Neonatal Issues that must be 
Considered?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
Babies of women 
treated for 
sepsis during 
labour, or in the 
24 hour period 
before or after 
birth, require 
assessment for 
risk factors 
and clinical 
indicators 
of neonatal 
infection .4 D This recommendation is 
derived from NICE NG195 
on neonatal infection [ 72].
If either the 
woman or the 
baby is infected 
with iGAS 
disease in the 
postpartum 
period, both 
should be treated 
with antibiotics .4 GPP This follows advice 
on management of 
GAS contacts [ 17].
It is recommended that babies of women who receive parenteral 
antibiotic treatment for confirmed or suspected invasive bacte -
rial infection at any time during labour, or in the 24- hour peri -
ods before and after the birth, have a careful assessment of risk 
factors and clinical indicators of possible early- onset neonatal 
infection to guide investigations and management including an -
tibiotic treatment [ 72]. [Evidence level 4]
Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against GBS should be of -
fered to women with a maternal pyrexia or signs of sepsis during labour [ 70]. Babies in whom there are any risk factors or clinical 
indicators of possible early- onset neonatal infection should be 
cared for as per NICE Guideline [NG195] Neonatal infection: an -
tibiotics for prevention and treatment [ 72].
Specific investigations, management of neonatal infections 
and advice to parents should be conducted according to NICE 
Guideline [NG195] [ 72].
GAS and PVL- producing S. aureus infections have been transmitted 
to babies during birth and breastfeeding, causing severe infection. 
GAS poses the highest risk of sepsis in the baby, with numerous 
cases where both the woman and baby have been affected [14, 18]. 
Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be routinely given to 
babies of women with GAS infection [17, 18]. [Evidence level 4]
6.4 | What Postnatal Care and/or Infection 
Control Issues should be Considered?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for the 
recommendation
All pregnant women 
and women who have 
recently given birth 
should be informed of 
the signs and symptoms 
of genital tract infection .4 GPP Good clinical 
practice.
Any GAS identified 
during pregnancy 
should be treated 
aggressively and full 
infection control 
precautions adopted, 
including barrier 
nursing as per local 
guidelines .4 GPP This is guidance 
from UKHSA [ 17].
Close household contacts 
of women with GAS 
infection should be 
warned to seek medical 
attention should 
symptoms develop, and 
may warrant antibiotc 
prophylaxis .2— A This is guidance 
from UKHSA [ 17].
Healthcare workers who 
have been exposed to 
respiratory secretions 
of women with GAS 
infection should be 
considered for antibiotic 
prophylaxis .3 GPP This is guidance 
for control of GAS 
in healthcare 
and maternity 
settings [ 18].
GAS and MRSA are easily transmitted by the hands of health -
care workers and by close contact in households. Local infection 
control guidelines should be followed for hospital–specific isola -
tion and contact precautions. iGAS infections are notifiable and 
the infection control team and the UKHSA should be informed 
[17, 18, 63 ]. CPE and VRE carriers should be isolated in accor -
dance with local protocols. [Evidence level 4]
Women suspected of, or diagnosed with, GAS sepsis should 
be barrier nursed with protective clothing, including masks, 
in a single room with en- suite facilities to minimise the risk of 
spread to other women and staff. Local advice from infection 
control should be sought [ 18]. [Evidence level 4]

be informed of the signs and symptoms of genital tract infec -
tion and how to prevent its transmission. Advice to all women 
should include verbal and written information about GAS pre -
vention, signs and symptoms and the need to seek advice early 
if concerned, as well as the importance of good personal hygiene 
being essential. This includes avoiding contamination of the 
perineum by washing hands before and after using the lavatory 
or changing sanitary towels. Such emphasis on hygiene is espe -
cially necessary when a woman or her family or close contacts 
have symptoms of GAS infection such as sore throat, impetigo or 
scarlet fever [ 17, 18 ]. [Evidence level 4]
Any GAS identified during pregnancy should be treated aggres -

• Developing and validating pregnancy specific diagnostic 
criteria and practical screening tools for maternal sepsis.
• Further research is required to quantify the importance of

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists pro -
duces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical prac -
tice. They present recognised methods and techniques of 
clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consider -
ation by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant 
health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding 
a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be 
made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical 
data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treat -
ment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or 
guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to 
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of man -
agement. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or 
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case 
notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.

Explanation of Grades and Evidence Levels
Classification of evidence levels
1++ High- quality meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a very low risk 
of bias
1+ Well- conducted meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a low risk of 
bias
1— Meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a high risk of bias
2++ High- quality systematic reviews of case–control or cohort studies or high- quality
case–control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding, bias or chance and a
high probability that the relationship is causal
2+ Well- conducted case–control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or chance
and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal
2— Case–control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding, bias or chance and a
significant risk that the relationship is not causal
3 Non- analytical studies, e.g. case reports, case series
4 Expert opinion
Grades of Recommendation
AAt least one meta- analysis, systematic reviews or RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target population; or 
a systematic review of RCTs or a body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the 
target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results
BA body of evidence including studies rated as 2++ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall 
consistency of results; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++ or 1+
CA body of evidence including studies rated as 2+ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall 
consistency of results; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++
DEvidence level 3 or 4; or
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+
Good Practice Points
GPP Recommended best practice based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group. *
* on the occasion when the guideline development group find there is an important practical point that they wish to emphasise but for which there is not, nor is there 
likely to be any research evidence. This will typically be where some aspect of treatment is regarded as such sound clinical practice that nobody is likely to question it. 
These are marked in the guideline, and are indicated by ✓ . It must be emphasised that these are NOT an alternative to evidence- based recommendations, and should 
only be used where there is no alternative means of highlighting the issue.

According to the Sepsis- 3 criteria, a total score of 2 points or more is associated with life- threatening organ dysfunction and sepsis.
There have been efforts to modify the SOFA score to account for physiological changes during pregnancy, but these have not been well validated [ 62].
