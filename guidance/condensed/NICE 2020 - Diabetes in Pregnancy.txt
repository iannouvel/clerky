Why this is im portant Babies born t o women wit h diabet es ha ve a high risk of ha ving congenital malf ormations and t his risk is gr eater if blood glucose contr ol is poor ar ound t he time of conception. However, lowering t he risk t o that of w omen wit hout diabet es w ould r equir e normalisation of blood glucose le vels, and t his is difficult t o achie ve wit hout incr easing t he risk of serious hypogly caemia. Insulin pump t herap y and r tCGM ha ve been sho wn to reduce bot h blood glucose le vels and rat es of h ypogly caemia in t he non-pr egnant population, but it is uncer tain if t his holds true bef ore conception and in early pr egnancy . Ther e is t herefore an urgent need t o test t he eff ectiv eness and acceptability of t hese t echnologies in w omen with diabet es who ar e planning pr egnancy . This w ould be best under taken in a randomised contr olled trial of w omen wit h diabet es who ar e trying t o conceiv e. Women would be allocat ed to receiv e either con ventional car e (self -monit oring of blood glucose and insulin adjustment) or insulin pump t herap y and r tCGM. 2 Testing f or gestational diabe tes When should t esting f or gestational diabet es tak e place – in t he first or second trimest er? Why this is im portant Conventionally , testing f or gestational diabet es tak es place in t he second trimest er. Diabet es in pr egnancy: management fr om pr econception t o the postnatal period (NG3) © NICE 2025 . All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and- conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 33 of 42Intervention has been sho wn to impr ove out comes f or women diagnosed wit h gestational diabet es. Ho wever, mat ernal age and obesity ar e incr easing, and some w omen ( especially those fr om populations wit h a high incidence of type 2 diabet es) ent er pr egnancy wit h undiagnosed type 2 diabet es, but ma y not be t ested for diabet es until t he second trimest er. This e xposes t he w oman and t he fetus t o risks r esulting fr om early and prolonged mat ernal h yperglycaemia. It is pr esumed t hat t his is associat ed wit h incr eased morbidity . UK population studies ar e needed t o establish t he incidence of glucose intolerance in w omen in t he first trimest er. Well-designed randomised contr olled trials ar e needed t o establish if t esting, diagnosis and int ervention in t he first rat her t han t he second trimest er impr oves mat ernal, f etal and neonatal out comes, including f etal hyperinsulinaemia. 3 Barrier s to achie ving b lood g lucose tar gets bef ore and during pr egnanc y What ar e the barriers t hat w omen e xperience t o achie ving blood glucose tar gets? Why this is im portant It is vital f or normal f etal de velopment in t he first trimest er that w omen wit h pre-existing diabet es achie ve good blood glucose contr ol bot h bef ore and during pr egnancy . Good contr ol also helps t o prevent macr osomia and ot her complications in t he third trimest er in women wit h pre-existing or gestational diabet es. Wher eas man y women manage t o achie ve blood glucose tar gets, a pr opor tion of w omen continue t o find it difficult t o do so. A number of f actors could be in volved, such as healt h belief s, a poor understanding of t he impor tance of good blood glucose contr ol, an inability t o be able t o comply wit h a demanding r egimen of blood glucose t esting up t o 7 times a da y, and t he need t o adjust insulin dosage. A bett er understanding of t he barriers in t his cohor t of w omen is needed so that healt hcare professionals can w ork t o overcome t hem. R obust qualitativ e studies are needed t o explor e these barriers, wit h the aim of impr oving blood glucose contr ol and fetal out comes in pr egnancy f or women wit h pre-existing diabet es and w omen wit h gestational diabet es. 4 Risk o f fetal de ath for w omen wi th diabe tes How can f etuses at risk of intraut erine deat h be identified in w omen wit h diabet es?

Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and- conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 34 of 42Why this is im portant Unexpect ed intraut erine deat h remains a significant contribut or to perinatal mor tality in pregnant w omen wit h diabet es. Con ventional t ests of f etal w ellbeing (umbilical ar tery doppler ultrasound, car diotocograph y and ot her bioph ysical t ests) ha ve been sho wn to have poor sensitivity f or pr edicting such e vents. Alt ernativ e appr oaches t hat include measur ement s of er ythropoietin in t he amniotic fluid and MRI spectr oscop y ma y be effectiv e, but t here is curr ently insufficient clinical e vidence t o evaluat e them. Well-designed randomised contr olled trials t hat ar e sufficient ly po wered ar e needed t o determine whet her t hese appr oaches ar e clinically and cost eff ectiv e. 5 Postna tal tr eatmen t for w omen diagnose d wi th gestational diabe tes Are there eff ectiv e long-t erm pharmacological int erventions t o prevent t he onset of type 2 diabet es that can be r ecommended postnatally f or women who ha ve been diagnosed wit h gestational diabet es? Why this is im portant Gestational diabet es is one of t he str ongest risk f actors f or the subsequent de velopment of type 2 diabet es: up t o 50% of w omen diagnosed wit h gestational diabet es de velop type 2 diabet es wit hin 5 years of t he bir th. Ther e are some data suggesting t hat changes in diet and e xercise, wit h or wit hout metf ormin, can pr event type 2 diabet es de veloping in non-pr egnant middle-aged people wit h glucose int olerance, but t here are no studies specifically in w omen wit h a past hist ory of gestational diabet es. Ther e is t hus an ur gent need t o investigat e what int erventions ma y dela y or pr event type 2 diabet es de veloping in this high-risk population of w omen. Under taking a f ormal randomised contr olled trial involving long-t erm out comes is oft en not f easible in practice. Ho wever, it w ould be possible t o have a quasi-randomised study comparing 2 populations of w omen wit h similar demographic pr ofiles who had gestational diabet es. One population w ould be encouraged at their annual check t o follow a specific diet and e xercise r egime and t hose in t he ot her population w ould not. The incidence of t he de velopment of type 2 diabet es in t he 2 groups at 5 years, 10 years and 20 years w ould be compar ed.

Continuous g lucose moni toring Recommendations 1 .3.17 to 1.3.20 Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions Ther e was e vidence comparing r eal-time continuous glucose monit oring (r tCGM) wit h intermitt ently scanned CGM (isCGM) and wit h intermitt ent capillar y glucose monit oring, f or pregnant w omen wit h type 1 diabet es. When compar ed wit h intermitt ent capillar y glucose monit oring, r tCGM r esult ed in: • more women achie ving t heir blood glucose tar gets • fewer caesar ean sections • fewer neonatal int ensiv e car e unit (NICU) admissions. One r etrospectiv e study was identified t hat compar ed isCGM wit h rtCGM. This study showed no clear diff erence betw een t he 2 monit oring syst ems in mat ernal and neonatal outcomes. Healt h economic modelling f ound t hat isCGM clearly has t he lo west o verall cost of t he 3 options. It is much less cer tain t hat isCGM pr ovides t he most benefit (a finding t hat is in line wit h the clinical e vidence). The committ ee w ere concerned b y the very low quality of the evidence f or isCGM, t he accuracy of isCGM (par ticularly in t he hypogly caemic range) and t he number of finger -pricks t hat w ould still be needed t o use isCGM saf ely. The committ ee agr eed t hat all t he uncer tainties in t he evidence w ould be lik ely to lead t o the benefit s of isCGM being o verestimat ed. Ther efore, they could not be confident t hat isCGM r epresent s a bett er use of NHS r esour ces t han r tCGM, which had been sho wn in high-quality e vidence t o have bett er out comes t han int ermitt ent capillar y glucose Diabet es in pr egnancy: management fr om pr econception t o the postnatal period (NG3) © NICE 2025 .

Based on t hese findings, t he committ ee recommended t hat r tCGM should be off ered to all women wit h type 1 diabet es to help w omen meet t heir pr egnancy blood glucose tar gets and impr ove neonatal out comes. The committ ee also not ed that some w omen ma y be unable t o use r tCGM or ma y prefer using isCGM inst ead. In t hese situations, t hey recommended off ering isCGM. The committ ee amended t he 2015 r ecommendation on considering r tCGM f or pr egnant women who ar e on insulin t herap y but do not ha ve type 1 diabet es because t hey want ed to identify specific scenarios in which r tCGM could be consider ed. The committ ee belie ved that education and suppor t are impor tant f or pr egnant w omen using continuous glucose monit oring (CGM), t o ensur e they get t he full benefit. Ther efore, they updat ed and e xpanded t he 2015 r ecommendation on pr oviding suppor t.
