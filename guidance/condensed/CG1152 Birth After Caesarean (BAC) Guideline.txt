Version 6.1 January 2021. Aim: To provide guidance on the management of women during pregnancy and in childbirth who have had a previous caesarean section. Scope: To support staff in the management of pregnant women who have had a previous caesarean section, ensure patient safety, provide support throughout pregnancy and labor, and offer consistent information for informed decision-making. Responsibilities: Midwives and obstetricians are expected to follow and apply this guidance. Management is responsible for reviewing the protocol as needed and ensuring accessibility to all relevant staff. Introduction: Recommends Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) versus elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS) clinical care pathway for antenatal counseling and shared decision-making. Birth after caesarean (BAC) refers to discussions for women with a previous caesarean. Antenatal Management: Includes referral pathway, antenatal counseling, and special circumstances. Intrapartum Management: Covers the diagnosis of labor, admission, and ongoing management in labor.

Women with unplanned labor onset and a history of previous cesarean delivery should discuss the feasibility of VBAC with an experienced obstetrician. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended for the duration of planned VBAC. Epidural analgesia is not contraindicated in planned VBAC. Women should be encouraged to remain mobile during labor. Active management of the third stage of labor is recommended for successful VBAC. In case of suspected uterine rupture, immediate cesarean section should be performed. Women should be supported in making informed decisions about their care. Audit standards include the rate of successful VBAC and documented discussions for vaginal birth options.
