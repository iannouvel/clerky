Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management guideline covers diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage in women with complications in early pregnancy. It aims to improve early pregnancy loss diagnosis and support for women. Healthcare professionals, commissioners, and women with complications in early pregnancy are the target audience. Recommendations include providing support and information with dignity and respect, early pregnancy assessment services available 7 days a week, and recognizing the symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy for prompt referral.

In women of reproductive age, consider offering a pregnancy test even with non-specific symptoms. Healthcare professionals should have access to pregnancy tests. Refer women with positive pregnancy tests and specific symptoms for further assessment. Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy even without known risk factors. Refer women with early pregnancy complications for assessment based on clinical situation. Use ultrasound scans to diagnose viable intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies. Consider signs indicating tubal ectopic pregnancy during ultrasound scans. Use serum hCG measurements cautiously in women with pregnancies of unknown location. Provide written information to women with pregnancies of unknown location for monitoring symptoms and accessing emergency care.

1.4.29 For a woman with an increase in serum hCG levels greater than 63% after Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: diagnosis and initial management:
- Inform her that she is likely to have a developing intrauterine pregnancy.
- Offer her a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the location of the pregnancy between 7 and 14 days later. Consider an earlier scan for women with a serum hCG level greater than or equal to 1,500 IU/litre.
- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed, offer her routine antenatal care. 
- If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not confirmed, refer her for immediate clinical review by a senior gynaecologist.

1.4.30 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels greater than 50% after 48 hours:
- Inform her that the pregnancy is unlikely to continue but this is not confirmed.
- Provide her with oral and written information about where she can access support and counselling services.
- Ask her to take a urine pregnancy test 14 days after the second serum hCG test.

1.4.31 For a woman with a decrease in serum hCG levels less than 50%, or an increase less than 63%, refer her for clinical review in the early pregnancy assessment service within 24 hours.

1.4.32 For women with a pregnancy of unknown location, when using serial serum hCG measurements, do not use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.

Offer systemic methotrexate to women with an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy who have no significant pain, an adnexal mass smaller than 35mm, a serum hCG level less than 1,500 IU/litre, and no visible heartbeat. Surgery should be offered if methotrexate is not acceptable or if the woman has significant pain, a larger adnexal mass, a visible heartbeat, or a serum hCG level of 5,000 IU/litre or more. Women with an ectopic pregnancy and a serum hCG level between 1,500 and 5,000 IU/litre can choose between methotrexate and surgical management if they meet certain criteria. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed when surgical treatment is needed, and competent surgeons should be available. Salpingectomy should be offered unless there are other risk factors for infertility, and salpingotomy can be considered for women with infertility risk factors. Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis should be offered to all Rh-negative women undergoing surgery for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Do not offer it to women receiving solely medical management or with certain pregnancy conditions.

Over the past 2 decades, there have been significant changes in the management of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, with a shift towards outpatient or day case care and the introduction of medical and expectant management as alternatives to surgery. However, there is a lack of research into the effects of these different approaches from the woman's perspective, particularly their psychological and emotional impact. Miscarriage is distressing for most women, and the type of management itself might affect women's need for counseling, resulting in a cost to the NHS. Therefore, further research in this area is important.

A comparative study should be conducted to assess how the type of intervention impacts women's experience, including psychological and emotional outcomes. Currently, there is no evidence exploring the psychological impact of different treatments for ectopic pregnancy. A qualitative comparative study is needed to reduce the emotional impact of the condition and maximize women's emotional recovery in the short and long term.

Additionally, recommendations have been made regarding the use of ultrasound for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy and the use of progestogens for preventing miscarriage. Standardizing practices across the NHS based on evidence will improve the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and reduce risks to women. The use of progestogens to prevent miscarriage is cost-effective and will standardize the preparation of progesterone used in such cases.

Furthermore, recommendations have been made for the medical management of miscarriage, including the use of a combination of medications to reduce the need for surgical intervention. These recommendations aim to improve the management of miscarriage and reduce costs for the NHS.

Lastly, recommendations have been made for the expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, offering clinically stable women an alternative to medical management. These recommendations aim to standardize the management of ectopic pregnancy and make expectant management available when clinically appropriate, potentially resulting in cost savings through a reduction in drug use.

Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage have an adverse effect on the quality of life of many women. Approximately 20% of pregnancies miscarry, and miscarriages can cause considerable distress. Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is 11 per 1,000 pregnancies, with a maternal mortality of 0.2 per 1,000 estimated ectopic pregnancies. About two-thirds of these deaths are associated with substandard care. Women who do not access medical help readily are particularly vulnerable. Improvement in the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy loss is therefore of vital importance, in order to reduce the incidence of the associated psychological morbidity and avoid the unnecessary deaths of women with ectopic pregnancies.
