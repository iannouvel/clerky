Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Guideline: This document provides evidence-based guidance for the recognition, reporting, and management of FGM. It outlines legal responsibilities, prevalence, safeguarding measures, mandatory reporting requirements, and guidance for healthcare professionals. FGM is defined as all procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons, with no health benefits and significant harm. Types of FGM include clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation, and other harmful procedures. UK health professionals are legally obligated to report cases of FGM and safeguard at-risk individuals. Prevalence is high in certain countries, with over 200 million affected globally. Mandatory reporting to the police is required for cases involving girls under 18 who have undergone FGM. Health professionals must report cases promptly and follow specific guidelines for reporting. Guidance pathways are provided for identifying and addressing risks related to FGM in patients and their families. Assessment and information obtained must be documented in the patient's healthcare record. Referrals to safeguarding processes may be necessary based on the assessment.

Seek professional support before making decisions. Consult with relevant agencies for additional support. Record and share information about decisions. Mandatory recording of FGM cases for data quality purposes. Use FGM datasets to collect patient information. Patient objections to data collection must be respected. FGM Information Sharing system for potential at-risk individuals. Maternity-specific guidance for identification and care of FGM cases. Support and advice resources available for professionals. Audit guidelines for FGM identification and reporting.

Defibrillation should be offered around 20 weeks and re-offered at 30 weeks if declined.

Initial/On-going Assessment: This is to help when considering whether a child is at risk of FGM or whether there are other children in the family for whom a risk assessment may be required. 

Indicator: Ask more questions if one indicator leads to potential area of concern. Consider risk - if one or more indicators are identified, you need to consider what action to take. If unsure whether the level of risk requires referral, discuss with your safeguarding lead. 

Significant or immediate risk: If you identify serious or immediate risk, or other risks are considered serious, refer to Social Services/CAIT Team/Police/MASH. If harm is imminent, emergency measures may be required. 

In all cases, share information with the patient's GP, document in notes, and discuss health complications of FGM and the law in the UK. 

Risk Assessment Tool: Complete for children under 18 years of age and review findings with Named Nurse or Safeguarding Lead. 

FGM Information Leaflet: Provide to those at risk. 

Prevalence of FGM: Consider risk factors and take appropriate action.
