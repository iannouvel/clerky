- Screening for hepatitis C should be offered in addition to routine antenatal tests
- De-infibulation can be performed antenatally, during labour, or at delivery
- Intrapatum care for women with FGM should be carefully managed
- Postnatal care should include follow-up for de-infibulation if not performed during delivery
- Legal and regulatory processes should be followed and documented
- Global epidemiology of FGM varies by country and region
- Medicalisation of FGM is increasing globally

'clitoridectomy' and 'defibulation'. Clinicians should be aware of the short- and long-term complications of FGM. Reported complications include haemorrhage, urinary retention, genital swelling, infection, fever, scarring, urinary tract symptoms, dyspareunia, bacterial vaginosis, genital scarring, urinary tract complications, damage to the urethra, dyspareunia, sexual consequences, psychological effects, menstrual difficulties, genital infection, infertility, HIV and hepatitis B infection, and obstetric complications. Health professionals must understand the legal responsibilities regarding FGM in the UK, including mandatory reporting of FGM in girls under 18 years. FGM is illegal in the UK and health professionals must be familiar with the requirements of the HSCIC FGM Enhanced Dataset. Reporting and recording guidelines are provided for health professionals.

Women with FGM should be assessed during pregnancy and appropriate care provided, including referral to designated consultants and midwives. Healthcare professionals should be trained in FGM management and ensure safe and sensitive care. De-infibulation may be necessary for women with FGM, and should be offered before pregnancy if possible. Postnatal care should include follow-up for women who did not undergo de-infibulation during delivery.

Women with FGM should be offered de-infibulation before pregnancy. Discharging midwives should ensure legal processes are followed before discharge. A postnatal debrief may be considered for education on FGM. Future research should focus on stillbirth rates and the role of de-infibulation. Auditable topics include healthcare worker training and referrals for FGM patients. Useful links and support groups are available for further information.

Additional management in pregnant women:
- Refer to designated consultant obstetrician or specialist midwife with responsibility for women with FGM.
- Local protocols will determine which elements of care should be undertaken by the designated midwife or obstetrician.
- Make an individual risk assessment using an FGM safeguarding risk assessment tool.
- Offer screening for hepatitis C in addition to routine screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis.
- Manage as high obstetric risk.
- Document maternal history of FGM in the personal child health record.
- Notify designated child protection midwife if delivery of a baby girl.
- Offer postnatal follow-up if de-infibulation performed intrapartum or if planned de-infibulation did not occur because of delivery by caesarean section.
