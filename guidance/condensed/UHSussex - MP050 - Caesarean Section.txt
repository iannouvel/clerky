Caesarean Section Protocol: MP050  
Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.  
Scope: This protocol applies to any woman/person requiring or requesting a caesarean section.  
Responsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.  
Classification of Caesarean Section: Categories include emergency, urgent, scheduled, and elective caesarean sections.  
General Preparation and Management: Documentation is key, including completion of the WHO Safety Surgical Checklist.  
Considerations for all caesarean births: Intra-operative cell salvage, blood transfusion, PPI/Sodium Citrate, antibiotics, and surgical techniques should be considered.

- Do not routinely suture the visceral or the parietal peritoneum in caesarean birth to reduce operating time and the need for postoperative analgesia, and improve maternal satisfaction.  
- Do not routinely close the subcutaneous tissue space in caesarean unless the subcutaneous fat >2cm.  
- Close the skin with sutures rather than staples to reduce the risk of superficial wound dehiscence.  
- Do not routinely use superficial wound drains in caesarean birth as they do not decrease the incidence of wound infection or wound hematoma  
- Consider negative pressure wound therapy after caesarean birth for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more to reduce the risk of wound infections  
- Only use forceps in caesarean birth if there is difficulty delivering the baby's head.  
- Delayed cord clamping (at least 1 minute from delivery) should be considered routine for deliveries by caesarean  
- Cord milking is beneficial in cases where delayed cord clamping is not appropriate.  
- Cord blood samples should be taken in any Category 1 or 2 LSCS  
- Oxytocin 5 units should be given as a slow intravenous injection after the cord is clamped  
- Oxytocin 40 units infusion should not be routinely used  
- Oxytocin 40 units infusion should be considered prophylactically for patients who are at risk of PPH  
- An appropriately trained practitioner skilled in the resuscitation of newborn babies is present for caesarean birth performed under general anesthesia, or if there is evidence of fetal compromise.  
- Offer and facilitate early skin-to-skin contact between the woman/person and their baby where possible  
- Support women/people who have had a caesarean birth and who wish to breast/chest feed to start as soon as possible after the birth of their baby.

9.5 Consider negative pressure wound therapy for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more after caesarean birth to reduce the risk of wound infections.  
9.5.2 No type of wound dressing has been shown to be better than another at reducing the risk of wound infections  
9.5.3 Remove standard dressings 6 to 24 hours after the caesarean birth  
9.5.4 Assess the wound for signs of infection, separation, or dehiscence  
9.5.5 Encourage loose, comfortable clothes and cotton underwear  
9.5.6 Advise gentle daily cleaning and drying of the wound  
9.5.7 Ensure plan put in place for the removal of sutures or clips if required.  
9.6 When caring for women who have had a caesarean birth with heavy and/or irregular vaginal bleeding, consider whether this is more likely to be because of endometritis than retained products of conception, and manage accordingly.  
9.6.2 Escalate to senior obstetric team to review where bleeding does not settle, or where passing clots despite antibiotic treatment  
9.7 All women should have VTE risk assessment and have thromboprophylaxis prescribed appropriately  
9.7.2 Be alert to increased risk of VTE and pay particular attention to women who have respiratory symptoms or leg symptoms.  
9.8 All mothers should have a discussion about the implications for future pregnancies before they are discharged, including suitability for VBAC  
9.8.2 All mothers should have the opportunity to discuss with an Obstetric Registrar (or Consultant) the reason for their LSCS, any complications during surgery, and the implications of having a LSCS on their future pregnancies before discharge home  
9.8.3 This discussion must be documented on Badgernet  
9.8.4 Mothers who have had non-elective LSCS should be provided with information about the Birth Stories service and this should be documented in the maternal postnatal notes  
9.8.5 Some mothers may warrant referral to see a consultant for a debrief in clinic. Please discuss this with the consultant beforehand  
9.8.6 Discuss with women who have had a caesarean birth that there is not an increased risk of depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, pain on sexual intercourse, faecal incontinence, or difficulties with breastfeeding  
9.9 Ensure that the discharge summary is complete with relevant information about category of caesarean, any complications  
9.9.2 Inform the GP if follow-up investigations are needed after discharge from hospital, and include details of the plan or course of action if the results are abnormal  
9.9.3 Inform women who have had a caesarean birth that they can resume activities when they feel they have fully recovered from the caesarean birth, including any physical restrictions or pain.

Outcomes that are similar for caesarean or vaginal birth  
Pregnant women / people  Babies  
VTE Admission to neonatal unit  
Major obstetric haemorrhage  Infection  
Post natal depression  Persistent verbal delay  
Infant mortatility (upto 1 year)  
Outcomes for pregnant women / people and babies that have conflicting or limited evidence about the risk include ITU admission, stillbirth in a subsequent pregnancy; and for babies - neonatal respiratory morbidity, cerebral palsy, autism spectrum condition and type 1 diabetes  
Please refer pregnant women / people to be seen from 24 weeks of pregnancy.  
This is not an exhaustive list – please discuss other referrals with the Obstetric Anaesthetist on bleep 8140 (RSCH) or bleep 6327 (PRH).  
Anaesthetic clinics operate cross-site, therefore pregnant women / people should be advised that appointments could be offered for either PRH/RSCH clinic subject to availability – this will not affect their booked site for delivery.
