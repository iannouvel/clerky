The guidelines provide guidance on best clinical practice in the treatment and management of women living with HIV during pregnancy and postpartum, and their infants. Recommendations include the use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent vertical transmission of HIV, mode of delivery, and management of specific patient populations. Changes in recommendations include updated prevalence data on HIV in pregnancy, updated advice on infant feeding, expanded section on psychosocial care, and new data on antiretroviral safety. All women are recommended to start treatment and remain on lifelong treatment.

Women with HIV should defer invasive diagnostic tests until viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. If immediate testing is necessary, cART and nevirapine should be given. For mode of delivery, vaginal delivery is supported for viral load <50 copies/mL, while CS is recommended for viral load ≥400 copies/mL. PLCS is recommended for viral load between 50-399 copies/mL. For preterm SROM, intramuscular steroids should be given and delivery timing discussed. Zidovudine infusion is recommended for viral load >1000 copies/mL. All women with HIV should give birth in a facility with pediatric care. Water births are supported for viral load <50 copies/mL. Infant PEP duration is based on risk level and maternal viral load. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended for infants with HIV. Immunizations should follow national guidelines. Formula feeding is recommended for infants born to women with HIV. Lactation suppression is advised if viral load is >50 copies/mL. Breastfeeding is supported for virologically suppressed women. Infant HIV status should be monitored with molecular diagnostics and antibody testing. Postpartum care should include cART continuation, support services assessment, mental health evaluation, contraception discussion, and cervical cytology. Testing partners and older children for HIV is recommended for newly diagnosed women.

15 Proportion of mothers reviewed postpartum by 6 weeks.  
16 Proportion with documented mental health assessment at booking, and at 4 –6 weeks postpartum.  

A key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimise a woman’s own health. Furthermore, one 
of the major successes in the management of individuals living with HIV has been the prevention of vertical 
transmission of HIV. With the widespread implementation of routine antenatal screening for HIV, vertical 
transmission is now a rare occurrence in the UK. Practice continues to evolve based on observational data, theoretical considerations, and expert opinion. These guidelines aim to provide practical guidance for healthcare workers in managing pregnancy in the context of HIV. 

Particular areas of focus include psychosocial, infant feeding, neonatal, and postnatal management. The guidelines emphasize the need for antenatal HIV care to be delivered by a multidisciplinary team and recommend mental health assessment at booking and 4 –6 weeks postpartum. Infant feeding advice has been updated, and the use of cabergoline in non-breastfeeding women is discussed. The guidelines also address postpartum management of women living with HIV. 

The guidelines provide guidance on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum, with a focus on reducing vertical transmission rates and improving outcomes for both mothers and infants.

4. The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after pregnancy  
4.1 Psychosocial issues around HIV and pregnancy  
- Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).  
- Pregnant women living with HIV should be offered peer support.  
- Some women may experience psychosocial challenges during and/or after pregnancy.  
- HIV is associated with a higher risk of poor mental health.  
- Women living with HIV may experience significant psychosocial barriers to accessing care.  
- Postnatal depression prevalence among women living with HIV is reported to be between 30% and 53%.  
- Factors associated with postnatal depression in women living with HIV include past history of mental health issues, financial concerns, lack of social support, and HIV-related stigma.  
- The link between gender-based violence and HIV is well established.  
4.1.1 Social issues  
- Women living with HIV may have issues relating to social support and immigration.  
- Dispersal in pregnant women is generally inappropriate, and treatment for HIV is freely available regardless of immigration status.  
- Antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal services are required to be considered 'immediately necessary'.  
- Advice can be sought from various organizations for access to healthcare in the UK.  
4.1.2 Psychosocial care  
- Engagement in care from an MDT is crucial for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV.  
- Confidentiality processes impact adherence to ART.  
- Adherence to medication is vital for the success of ART.  
- Reassurance about confidentiality is important for women living with HIV.  
- HIV status should be included in the birth plan.  
4.1.3 The antenatal HIV MDT  
- The minimum team should comprise an HIV specialist, obstetrician, specialist midwife, and pediatrician.  
- Peer support workers are a valuable component of care for women living with HIV.  
4.1.4 The psychosocial care of women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy  
- Women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy may require the support of an MDT.  
- Prompt linkage to HIV care is beneficial for newly diagnosed pregnant women.  
- Confidence in disclosing an HIV diagnosis varies among women and cultural factors may influence disclosure.  
- Talking about HIV should be encouraged in all women.  
- HIV testing of existing children should be raised with all women.  
4.2 Perinatal mental health assessment  
- Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken at booking, and 4-6 weeks postpartum and 3-4 months postpartum.  
- Existing NICE guidance on the detection of antenatal and postnatal depression should be followed by HIV MDTs.

5.1 Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. For women living with HIV already engaged in care who become pregnant, sexual health screening is suggested. Genital tract infections should be treated according to guidelines. Screening for STIs is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV. Cervical cytology should be managed as per guidelines, with routine cytology deferred until postpartum. Contraception should be discussed antenatally. Pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV do not require additional baseline investigations. Resistance testing should be completed before treatment initiation. CD4 cell counts should be monitored throughout pregnancy.

During pregnancy, women on cART should have regular HIV viral load tests, liver function tests, and interventions if viral load is not suppressed. Women conceiving on cART should continue treatment, with exceptions for certain regimens. Women on dolutegravir should take folic acid, and all women should start folic acid before pregnancy. It is recommended to continue cART throughout pregnancy and lifelong. Recommended and alternative agents in pregnancy are listed in Table 6.1.

The writing group recommends discussing therapy options with pregnant women to individualize treatment based on their concerns and preferences. Recommended nucleoside backbone combinations for HIV in pregnancy include tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine. Zidovudine monotherapy is not recommended. Treatment should be initiated in pregnant women with baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL by the start of the second trimester. Integrase inhibitor-based regimens are recommended for women with high baseline viral load or treatment failure. Raltegravir and dolutegravir can be used from 6 weeks' gestation. Late-presenting women after 28 weeks should start cART immediately, with consideration for raltegravir or dolutegravir-containing regimens.

In untreated women presenting in labor at term, a stat dose of nevirapine should be given along with oral zidovudine, lamivudine, and raltegravir. Intravenous zidovudine should also be administered during labor. In preterm labor, if the infant cannot absorb oral medications, consider adding double-dose tenofovir DF. Women presenting in labor without a documented HIV result should have an urgent HIV test and treatment should be initiated immediately to prevent vertical transmission. 

Data on teratogenicity and neonatal outcomes of ART in pregnancy are based on various studies. Some antiretrovirals have shown no increased risk of birth defects, while others have inconclusive data. The use of dolutegravir in pregnancy has shown conflicting results, with some studies reporting an increased risk of neural tube defects. Pregnant women on dolutegravir should be informed of these risks and supported in their decision-making. 

Rates of preterm delivery in women with HIV remain high, with some studies implicating boosted PIs. However, data on the association between antiretroviral agents and preterm delivery are complex and vary between populations. Studies have shown conflicting results, with some not finding an association between cART and preterm delivery.

An association between PI-containing cART and PTD has been reported in several studies. The timing of cART initiation, particularly in the first trimester, has also been linked to an increased risk of PTD. Studies have shown that lopinavir/r should be avoided, while atazanavir/r may be preferred if a PI is indicated. Randomized controlled trials have not specifically addressed the impact of ART on PTD rates. The pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals in pregnancy can be affected by physiological changes, but most NRTIs do not require dose adjustments. NNRTIs such as rilpivirine and efavirenz have been studied in pregnancy, with recommendations for monitoring and potential dose adjustments. Integrase inhibitors like raltegravir have shown variable levels during pregnancy, but no adverse events have been observed in infants. PIs, particularly cobicistat-boosted regimens, may have lower exposure during pregnancy and should be used cautiously. Overall, the data on cART and PTD remain complex, emphasizing the importance of safety in pregnancy.

Switch from cobicistat to ritonavir when initiating PIs during pregnancy. Protein binding reductions in the third trimester can increase free drug levels. No dose adjustment is needed for lopinavir/r in pregnancy. Atazanavir may require a dose increase to 400 mg in the third trimester. Consider twice daily darunavir dosing in pregnancy. Limited data on PI formulations in pregnancy. Enfuvirtide does not cross the placenta. Stopping ART postpartum is not recommended. A boosted PI-based regimen is recommended in women with HIV-2. Vertical transmission of HIV-2 is less common than HIV-1. Use ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimen and tenofovir with darunavir/r for HIV-2. Limited data on enfuvirtide, tipranavir, and maraviroc in pregnancy.

The combination of HIV, chronic HBV infection, and pregnancy presents unique management considerations. Referral to a specialist is necessary to address all aspects of care, including effects on pregnancy, antiretroviral management, and prevention of vertical transmission. The prevalence of HBV co-infection in pregnant women varies by region and ethnicity. While there is no evidence of increased vertical transmission of HBV in co-infection compared to mono-infection, the impact of HIV on HBV disease progression is significant. Routine monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Treatment with antiretrovirals active against HBV should be continued during pregnancy. Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and lamivudine are recommended as the backbone of an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-naïve patients with HIV/HBV co-infection. Tenofovir DF should be added to cART if not already included, and lamivudine/emtricitabine may be omitted if necessary. Tenofovir alafenamide can be considered after the first trimester.

Lamivudine or emtricitabine should not be used as the only active drug against HBV in cART. Emtricitabine is the preferred option to be given with tenofovir DF in women with HBV and HIV. Tenofovir DF is effective at suppressing HBV DNA in mono- and co-infected patients. Liver enzymes should be monitored frequently after starting cART. HAV vaccine is recommended for all HAV non-immune women with HBV and HIV. cART active against both HBV and HIV should be continued postpartum. Neonatal immunisation with or without HBIG should commence within 24 hours of delivery. Maternal cART together with prompt post-delivery neonatal immunoprophylaxis is the ideal approach for preventing vertical transmission of HBV. All pregnant women with active HCV and HIV should be managed jointly with a clinician experienced in the management of these co-infections. LFTs should be repeated regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry are relatively contraindicated during pregnancy. In chronic HCV infection, there is unlikely to be a significant change in the HCV viral load during pregnancy.

Treatment of HCV infection is not recommended during pregnancy. Ribavirin is teratogenic and should be discontinued immediately if pregnancy occurs during treatment. DAAs in pregnant women have unknown effects. Thyroid function testing should be included in routine blood tests during IFN therapy. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be avoided in male partners of pregnant women. Women with co-infection should discontinue HCV therapy when pregnancy is confirmed. Effective contraception should be used during and after ribavirin therapy. Pregnant women with both HCV and HIV should not be treated with ribavirin-based DAA therapies. Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all women with both HCV and HIV. HAV vaccination is recommended for non-immune women with both HCV and HIV. Normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if effective cART is being received. cART should be continued postpartum in all women with both HIV and HCV.

8.1.1 Fetal ultrasound imaging should be performed as per national guidelines regardless of maternal HIV status. 
8.1.2 The combined screening test for fetal aneuploidies and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for those who screen as high risk is recommended as this has the best sensitivity and specificity and will minimize the number of women who may need invasive testing. 
8.1.3 Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the woman is known, and should ideally be deferred until HIV viral load has been adequately suppressed to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
8.1.4 If not on cART and the invasive diagnostic test procedure cannot be delayed until viral suppression is achieved, it is recommended that women should commence cART to include raltegravir and be given a single dose of nevirapine 2 –4 hours prior to the procedure.

No transmissions were observed in women with undetectable plasma viral load during amniocentesis. External cephalic version is recommended for breech presentation. Mode of delivery should be based on plasma viral load results at 36 weeks. Vaginal delivery is supported for viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, while PLCS is recommended for viral loads ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL. Limited data suggest no increased risk of vertical transmission with certain obstetric procedures. Vaginal birth after CS can be considered for women with viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL.

In a consultant-led maternity unit, a trial of labour with proper monitoring and rapid recourse to CS if needed has good outcomes for both the woman and neonate. For women attempting VBAC, 70% achieve vaginal delivery with a low uterine rupture rate. CS for prevention of vertical transmission should be done between 38 and 39 weeks' gestation. Timing of CS is crucial to balance the risks of TTN and labor onset. Immediate delivery within 24 hours is recommended for term pre-labour SROM. For women with SROM and a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate induction or CS is recommended. In cases of preterm SROM, decisions should be made in consultation with the full MDT. Intravenous zidovudine infusion is recommended for certain circumstances. Multiple pregnancies in women with HIV should be managed according to obstetric need. Women with HIV are recommended to give birth in a facility with direct access to pediatric care. Water births should be discussed with caution, especially for women with HIV.

Infant PEP should be started within 4 hours of delivery. Zidovudine monotherapy for the infant is recommended for very low-risk cases, while combination PEP should be used for high-risk cases. Neonatal PEP should be started as soon as possible after birth, and within 4 hours. Maternal viral load at the time of delivery is crucial in determining the level of risk and treatment approach.

In the last version of the BHIVA pregnancy guidelines, 4 weeks of oral zidovudine was recommended for all infants except in specific HIGH-RISK circumstances relating to detectable or unknown maternal viral load at the time of delivery. This strategy has been successful in reducing vertical transmission rates in the UK and Ireland. In Germany, a 2-week neonatal zidovudine strategy has been recommended for over 10 years without increased transmission. French cohort data supports the safety of reducing neonatal PEP duration. BHIVA guidelines recommend a 2-week course of zidovudine in VERY LOW RISK situations. European cohort data shows that maternal cART initiated more than 10 weeks before delivery reduces transmission risk. For LOW RISK situations, 2 weeks of zidovudine is recommended if specific criteria are met. For HIGH RISK situations, combination therapy in neonates has shown reduced transmission rates. Combination PEP use in neonates has increased over time, with no advantage of combination PEP over single-drug prophylaxis noted. The choice of triple combination PEP for neonates should be based on specific criteria and expert advice. Intravenous ART in neonates is limited to zidovudine, with specific dosing regimens for premature infants. All infant PEP should be initiated within 4 hours of delivery.

Immediate administration of PEP is especially important where the woman has not received any ART. For infants born to women on fully suppressive cART, zidovudine monotherapy PEP remains reasonable, even where the woman has a previous history of zidovudine exposure with resistance. Neonatal zidovudine monotherapy remains a reasonable approach for infants born to women with a plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, even if there is a previous history of zidovudine resistance. If a woman is known to have HIV-2 infection, follow the same advice as for HIV infant PEP but if HIGH RISK, nevirapine will not be effective. Seek expert advice. PEP should not be given beyond 2 weeks for VERY LOW-RISK or 4 weeks for LOW-RISK infants even if the infant is breastfed. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended from 1 month of age if HIV PCR screening is positive at any stage or if the infant is confirmed to be diagnosed with HIV. Immunisations should be given as per the national schedule. Breastfeeding advice for women with HIV living in the UK recommends formula feeding to eliminate the risk of postnatal transmission. Women not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of viral load >50 HIV RNA copies/mL, should be offered cabergoline to suppress lactation. Women who are virologically suppressed on cART with good adherence and who choose to breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should be informed about the risks.

Low risk of transmission of HIV through breastfeeding in this situation and the requirement for extra maternal and infant clinical monitoring. When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding. Maternal cART is advised to minimize HIV transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the woman’s health. Women who choose to breastfeed should be advised of the small ongoing risk of HIV transmission. They should be supported in their decision if they fulfill specific criteria. Women who breastfeed with a known detectable HIV viral load should be referred to social care as this places their infant at significant risk of HIV infection. Healthcare providers requiring advice on the use of medicines during the breastfeeding period can contact the UK Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service. Women should inform partners/families and healthcare providers about their HIV status. Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on specific occasions for both breastfed and non-breastfed infants. Management of infants diagnosed with HIV should include starting cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and urgent referral to a specialist center. Follow national guidance for the management of maternal HBV and HCV in pregnancy. Timely routine vaccination should be ensured for HIV exposed but uninfected (HEU) children.

Guidelines for the management of HIV infection in pregnant women recommend risk-adapted transmission prophylaxis to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission. Effective antiretroviral therapy starting before conception has been shown to prevent perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Shortened zidovudine regimens can also help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Additionally, combination neonatal prophylaxis has been used successfully to reduce transmission rates. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy has led to further declines in mother-to-child transmission rates.

HIV during breastfeeding. All women recommended to continue cART postpartum. Support services should be assessed and referrals made without delay. Postnatal follow-up within 4-6 weeks is essential. Mental health assessment and support should be provided. Contraceptive needs should be discussed and ART may be changed to optimize contraception choice. Cytology should be scheduled 3 months post-delivery. Testing of partner and/or older children should be completed for women newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy.

Clinical guideline on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa. Includes recommendations on antiretroviral therapy, retention in HIV care, and postpartum depression among women in Malawi. Also covers cervical screening and guidelines for the sexual and reproductive health of people living with HIV. No changes made to the clinically significant text.

2 mg/kg twice a day for 2 weeks, then 2 mg/kg three times a day. For infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and ≤2 kg, the dose is 4 mg/kg twice a day. Duration of oral dosing depends on the risk level. Intravenous dosing is different for infants born at ≥34/40 gestation and <34/40 gestation. Lamivudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir, Nevirapine, Raltegravir, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Enfuvirtide, and Co-trimoxazole are all part of combination therapy with specific dosing instructions. PCP prophylaxis with Co-trimoxazole is recommended for HIV-infected infants starting at 4 weeks of age.
