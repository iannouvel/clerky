Ovariancancerepidemiology
Ovarian cancer remains the6thmost common cancer infemales in
theUKwith7,495 newcases annually (2016 –18),equating toalifetime
riskof1in50UKfemales [2].Thecrude all-age incidence rateis22.8/
100,000 (2016 –18).However, changes intheageofthepopulation at
diagnosis hasresulted inthepeakageincidence rising from60-64 years
to75–79years. Ovarian cancer incidence rates have been falling over
thepastdecade, withthegreatest fallbeing seeninthe60to69-year-old
population, falling from 60.7/100,000 in2001 –3,to46.7/100,000 in
2016 –18.Noclear differences have been identified inincidence with
deprivation [3].Theincidence ofovarian cancer appears tobelower in
Asian, Black andMixed/Multiple ethnicity populations ascompared to
theWhite ethnic group [4].
Along withchanging incidence rates, ovarian cancer mortality has
alsochanged overtime. Thepeak ageforovarian cancer mortality is
85–89years, andnearly halfofallovarian cancer deaths occur inpatients over theageof75years (2017 –19).Mortality rates have
decreased by23%overthepastfivedecades, andhaveaccelerated in
thepastfewyears andarenowat12.2/100,000 for2017 –19,equating
to4142 deaths annually (2017 –19),andareprojected tofalleven
further [5].Thegreatest fallinmortality ratesisseenintheage60–69-
year agegroup, from 42.2/100,000 (1988 –90)to24.5/100,000
(2017 –19).
Many factors have been reported tocontribute tothechanging
ovarian cancer landscape, forexample increasing contraception use,
risk-reducing surgery andevolving treatment options; these willbe
discussed inthesubsequent chapters. There isagreat needforaccurate
Cancer Registry data, without which itwould notbepossible toexplore
andunderstand thetrends inovarian cancer carewithin theUKas

Screening
Theaimofascreening program istoidentify individuals with a
condition, oratanincreased riskofacondition orhealth problem, ata
time point whereby atimely intervention canbeoffered tomake
informed decisions toimprove health outcomes [7].Screening canbe
universal, whereby anill-defined population (forexample females overa
certain age)isenrolled orcanbecasefinding inwhich onlythose with
defined riskfactors arescreened [8].Theprinciples ofascreeningprogramme wereformalised byWilson andJungner in1968 [9].TheUK
National Screening Committee (UKNSC) have alsoestablished clear
criteria andguidance forevaluating apopulation screening program
[10].
Riskfactorsforovariancancer
Hereditary
Twin studies suggest thatinherited genetic factors contribute around
22%towards ovarian cancer risk[11].BRCA1/BRCA2 genes account
formostoftheknown inheritable component ofriskofovarian cancer.
Around 15–22%ofovarian cancers arecaused bypathogenic orlikely
pathogenic variants (called ‘pathogenic variants ’or‘PVs ’)incancer
susceptibility genes (CSGs) [12,13] .These includeBRCA1, BRCA2,
RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1,PALB2 andMMR (mismatch repair) genes.
Together these PVsaccount forupto40%oftheinheritable component
ofovarian cancer risk.However, these dataarefrommajority Caucasian
populations. Lynch syndrome, aninherited deficiency within the
mismatch repair system, alsoleads toanincreased lifetime riskof
ovarian cancer [14],anditisthesecond mostcommon hereditary cause
ofovarian cancer being associated with around 0.5–2%ofcases
[15,16] .Ofnote, thebiology ofLynch syndrome-associated ovarian
cancer isdifferent anditisoften diagnosed atanearlier stage andmay
belesslikely tometastasise [17].Alistofcommon CSGs associated with
ovarian cancer riskaresummarised inTable 1.Inaddition tomoderate/
highpenetrance CSGs, anumber ofcommon genetic variants called
SNPs maybeassociated withovarian cancer riskwithoddsratios (OR)
varying from0.8to1.4.Around 36validated SNPs havebeenidentified
forovarian cancer through Genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
These explain around 6%ofheritability ofovarian cancer [18].Multiple
SNPs canbecombined intoapolygenic riskscore (PRS) which canbe
usedtorefine riskstratification, bothingeneral population women and
inwomen withhigh-risk CSGs, leading toimproved riskestimation and

72more informed decision making with respect totargeted prevention
[19–22].Having afamily history ofovarian cancer isastrong factor
affecting ovarian cancer risk.Having afirstdegree relative (FDR) with
epithelial ovarian cancer canincrease theriskofdeveloping ovarian
cancer byaround threefold [23].Higher relative risksarereported for
women withtwoorthree FDRs withovarian cancer [24].Epigenetics
toomayplayaroleinthefuture. Recently, aDNAmethylation signature
obtained from cervical cellshasbeen shown topredict future ovarian
cancer risk[25].
Environmental /epidemiologic
Environmental factors thatincrease thenumber oflifetime ovula-
tions areconsidered riskfactors forovarian cancer [36].These include
nulliparity, early menarche andlatemenopause. Factors thatreduce
ovulation, such asoralcontraceptives, have been shown toreduce
ovarian cancer risk[37,38] .Increasing parity, breast feeding andalater
ageatbirths arealsoimportant protective factors against ovarian cancer
[37,39] .Tubal ligation [40,41] andsalpingectomy havebeenshown to
reduce theriskofovarian cancer [42–44].Casecontrol studies have
explored theimpact ofbenign gynaecological conditions andtheriskof
ovarian cancer. Endometriosis isassociated withanincreased riskoflow
grade serous, endometrioid andclearcellovarian cancers [45–47].Case
control studies havefound anassociation between pelvic inflammatory
disease andborderline ovarian tumours, butnotinvasive cancers
[48–50].Thepresence ofacommunity typeOcervicovaginal microbiota
wasrecently reported asapossible riskfactor forovarian cancer [51].
Onbalance, datafrom theCollaborative Group onEpidemiological
Studies onOvarian Cancer suggests theuseofHRTincreases anin-
dividual ’sriskofovarian cancer, especially theserous andendometrioid
histotypes [36,52] .However, datafromtheOvarian Cancer Association
Consortium (OCAC) found anincreased riskwithoestrogen alone rather
than continuous combined oestrogen andprogestogen preparations
[53,54] .Height isanindependent riskfactor forovarian cancer, and
some studies suggest thatBMImay[55]ormaynotbeanindependent
riskfactor [56].IVFmay beassociated with anincreased riskof
borderline butnotinvasive ovarian cancers [57].Ameta-analysis has
found smoking increases theriskofinvasive mucinous ovarian cancer
[58].Additionally, exposure toasbestos isthought toincrease anin-
dividual ’sriskofovarian cancer, although theevidence fortalcum
powder islessconclusive [36].
Chemoprevention
Although thecombined oralcontraceptive pill(COCP) reduces
ovarian cancer riskithasnever been routinely prescribed justforpri-
mary prevention. TheCOCP isassociated witha29%(95%CI23to34
%)reduction inovarian cancer riskinlow-risk women perfiveyears of
use[38],andanapproximately 50%reduction inovarian cancer riskin
high-risk women i.e.those withaninherited pathogenic variant inBRCA
(33%to80%forBRCA1 carriers and58%to63%forBRCA2 carriers)
[59].Benefits persist forupto30years afterstopping theCOCP, but
decrease withtime. COCP useinlow-risk women isassociated witha
transient increase inbreast cancer risk,although theabsolute riskis
small. Datainhigh-risk women havesome uncertainty withcasecontrol
studies showing noincrease inbreast cancer riskbutcohort studies
showing anincrease inbreast cancer riskinBRCA carriers [59].Arecent
modelling study indicates thatoralcontraceptive useinBRCA carriers in
theshort-term wasassociated withanincrease inbreast cancer inci-
dence butinthelong-term ledtoadecrease inovarian cancer incidence
andoverall cancer incidence [60].These benefits arealsoimpacted by
future risk-reducing surgery choices. Women whoareathighriskfor
ovarian cancer should receive informed counselling regarding thepros
andconsoftheoralcontraceptive pillandalternative options. Theother
drug thathasbeen associated with apotential reduction inovarian
cancer riskisaspirin, withanumber ofstudies suggesting areduction in
OCrisk[61–63].However, areduction inassociated mortality wasnotfound [64].
Population screening forovariancancer
Randomised control trial (RCT) data donotcurrently support
population-level screening forovarian cancer. Three RCTs have inves-
tigated screening forovarian cancer inlow-risk postmenopausal women.
These include theJapanese Shizuoka (n82,400) (65), theUSAPLCO
(Prostate Lung Colorectal andOvarian-cancer Screening) (n78,216)
[66] andtheUKCTOCS (United Kingdom Collaborative Trial on
Ovarian-Cancer Screening) (n202,000) trials [67].TheJapanese and
PLCO studies used acombination ofannual ultrasound andabsolute
CA125 value toscreen forovarian cancer. TheJapanese trialreported a
non-significant stage shift, withahigher proportion ofstage-I ovarian
cancers (63%)inthescreened armversus thecontrol arm(38%),but
didnotreport onmortality [65].Both thePLCO andUKCTOCS trials
reported mortality outcomes ofscreening forovarian cancer. ThePLCO
trialfound nomortality benefit (mortality riskratio of1.18(95%CI
0.82to1.71), identified only28%early-stage ovarian cancers inthe
screened armwithnostage shift, andreported ahighcomplication rate
of15%from bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) undertaken in
screen positives [66].UKCTOCS investigated amultimodal sequential
longitudinal CA125 biomarker-based screening strategy called theRisk
ofOvarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) along-with anannual ultrasound-
based screening strategy ina1:1:2 randomised design. ROCA based
screening wasfound tohave highsensitivity (84%to85.9%),high
specificity (99.8 %),anacceptable 3operations percasedetected anda
3.1%complication rate[68,69] .Long-term follow-up data were
recently reported. ROCA based multimodal screening wasassociated
withastatistically significant stage shift, witha39⋅2%(95%CI16⋅1%
to66⋅9%)higher incidence ofstage I/IIdisease and10⋅2%(–21⋅3%to
2⋅4%)lower incidence ofstage III/IV disease inthescreening arm[70].
Women inthescreened group hada24.5%lower incidence ofstage IV
and47.2%higher incidence instage Icancers. However, despite a
significant down-staging ofdisease, andahigher rateofachieving no
macroscopic residual disease (NMRD) atprimary cytoreductive surgery
(PCRS) forscreen detected cancers, long-term follow-up datademon-
strated nomortality benefit [71].Primary analysis showed noreduction
inovarian/tubal cancer deaths ineither theROCA/multimodal (296
deaths, P0⋅58)orultrasound-based screening (291deaths, P0⋅36)
groups compared withcontrols (619deaths) [70].Secondary analysis of
alldatafrom2001 to2020 toofound nomortality benefit withahazard
ratio0.96(95%CI0.83to1.10). Results showed thatthestage I
cancers found inthescreened group proved tobemore fatalthanthose
inthenon-screened group (case fatality rate14.8%versus 9.4%).Itis
likely thatthenatural history orbiology ofmany ovarian cancers is
poor/lethal, and,despite cancers being identified earlier inthescreened
group, noadditional liveswere saved. Parallel evaluation ofpsycho-
logical outcomes showed thatwhile screening didnotraiseanxiety, it
wasassociated with increased psychological morbidity andsexual
dysfunction inwomen needing repeat screens orthose diagnosed with
cancer [72,73] .
Based onavailable data, general population screening forovarian
cancer inaverage riskwomen cannot berecommended asthere isno
mortality benefit. Women should beencouraged toseekmedical review
iftheydevelop symptoms suggestive ofovarian cancer, forfacilitating
early diagnosis [74].
Surveillance inhigh-riskgroups
Ovarian cancer surveillance inhigh-risk groups isnotrecommended,
butisanoption forthose declining ordelaying riskreducing surgery,
afterexplanation thatthisisnotaalternative andthere is“littleevidence
thatthisleads toimproved outcomes andsaves lives ”[75].
Thecurrent evidence baseisfocused onwomen withanincreased≽

73(including ethnicity), carrying aPVinBRCA1/BRCA2 orMMR genes or
aclose family member. Annual screening forovarian cancer using an
absolute CA125 andanultrasound scanwasevaluated intheUKFa-
milial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS) Phase-1 study, and
notfound tobeeffective [76].Hence, annual screening isnotadvocated.
Amore frequent (3–4monthly) longitudinal CA125 ROCA-based
screening strategy inhigh-risk womenF35years wasevaluated in
theUKFOCSS Phase-2 study (4,348 women; 13,728 women screen
years) intheUK[67]aswellastheUSACancer Genetics Network (CGN)
andGynecological Oncology Group (GOG) studies (3692 women;
13,080 women screen years) [77,78] .Screening wasperformed using a
four-monthly ROCA andannual ultrasound scanacross 42sitesinthe
UK.Results from theUKFOCSS Phase-2 study demonstrate good
modelled sensitivity of94.7%(95%CI74.0%to99.9%),PPVof10.8
%(95%CI6.5%to16.5%),andNPVof100%within oneyearof
screening. Intotal162women underwent screen positive surgery; of
these 13hadacancer. Five(38.5 %;95%CI13.9%to68.4%)ofthe13
screen-detected ovarian ortubal cancers were early stage I/IIdisease.
Within ayearofascreening test,sixwomen were found tohave an
occult cancer (microscopic disease found atriskreducing surgery),
however, none were found tohave aninterval cancer. Screening was
associated withasignificant stage shift.Seven ofthe19(36.8 %)women
diagnosed withcancer within oneyearoflastscreen hadstage IIIB/IV
disease, compared with17/18 (94.4 %)ofthose diagnosed more one
yearafterthelastscreen (P0.001). Additionally, 95%ofwomen with
screen-detected cancers hadnomacroscopic residual disease (NMRD)
aftercytoreductive surgery. Similar findings werereported intheCGN/
GOG studies. TheAvoiding LateDiagnosis ofOvarian Cancer (ALDO)
study demonstrated real-world implementation offour-monthly ovarian
cancer surveillance inhighriskwomen withsimilar performance char-
acteristics toUKFOCSS [79].Down-staging from screening willavoid
PARP-inhibitor treatment costs. However, whether anypotential sur-
vival benefit (currently unknown) fromearlier stage disease, willoffset
thepotential survival benefit from PARP-inhibitor treatment remains
unaddressed.
There were alimited number ofwomen withLynch syndrome in
these studies, with themajority beingBRCA PV-carriers. Lynch syn-
drome ovarian cancer isbiologically different formBRCA -related can-
cers[80]andaremore likely tobeclinically diagnosed asearly (stage I/
II)disease [17].However, theevidence-base forovarian cancer
screening infemale Lynch syndrome carriers issmall, andscreening for
endometrial cancer isinconclusive [81].Routine ovarian cancer
screening isnotrecommended inwomen withLynch Syndrome [82].
Asencouraging assome ofthefindings from cohort studies seem,
these arenon-randomised andshould beconsidered withadegree of
caution. These studies donotshow thatscreening high-risk women saves
lives. Unfortunately, these studies arenotdesigned toaddress theimpact
onsurvival. Also, despite good screening performance interms of
sensitivity, specificity, PPVandNPV, asignificant stage shifttowards
early-stage disease, aswellasahigher NMRD rates, theRCTs inlow-risk
women using theROCA based screening strategy didnotshow amor-
tality benefit. Therefore, risk-reducing surgery remains themainstay of
ovarian cancer prevention andmanagement inhigh-risk women.
Further information about riskandcounselling, andwhen tooffer
risk-reducing surgery, isavailable intherecent NICE guidance (NG241)
[75].Four-monthly surveillance withserum CA125, using alongitudinal
algorithm toanalyse results of,andanannual review todiscuss the
ongoing recommendation forrisk-reducing surgery, canbeoffered asan
interim riskmanagement strategy inwomen delaying risk-reducing
surgery following careful counselling. Women should beaware that
thisisnotanalternative torisk-reducing surgery andthatthere isarisk
offalse-positive andfalse-negative tests. Decision forsurveillance

Futurescreening strategies
Although there iscurrently noevidence tosupport screening for
ovarian cancer inthegeneral population, astechnologies develop this
maybeanoption inthefuture. While acomprehensive discussion about
these potential technologies isbeyond theremit ofthisguideline, the
authors recognise thatadvances inscreening strategies andbiomarkers
suchasDNA methylation [25],cellfreeDNA [83],novel biomarkers
[84],useofmulti-marker longitudinal algorithms, andmulti-cancer
early detection biomarker strategies, mayplayaroleinthefuture.
Additionally, itiscritical thatforanybiomarker-based ovarian cancer
screening strategy tobeeffective, gynaecologists/gynae-oncologists/
multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) would need tobewilling tooperate
onthebasisofarising biomarker without radiological corroboration of
anyabnormality, balanced against themorbidity associated withthe
proposed staging procedure. Moreover, itisclearthatanyfuture general
population ovarian cancer screening strategy needs tobeevaluated ina
robust RCTwithmortality astheprimary outcome, because secondary
orsurrogate outcomes, suchasstage shift(asdemonstrated inUKC-
TOCS), areinappropriate inthecontext ofovarian cancer. Hence, any
future screening programme isatleastadecade away. These guidelines
should beregularly reviewed andmeaningful research intothisarea
should besupported andprioritised.
Ovariancancerprevention: riskascertainment inthegeneralpopulation
Itisincreasingly important tomaximise identification ofthose who
areatincreased riskofovarian cancer sothattheycanbecounselled and
offered targeted prevention strategies [75].Clinicians should takea
three-generational family history routinely toidentify pedigrees and
women atanincreased riskofovarian cancer. Women withastrong
family history ofcancer should bereferred totheir regional genetics
service forriskassessment. Individuals whohavea10%probability of
carrying aBRCA PVareoffered genetic testing. Anumber ofrisk
assessment toolsareavailable tohelpidentify these women [85].Most
commonly used aretheManchester scoring system forBRCA testing
[86,87] andtheBOADICEA orCANRISK model [21,88,89] intheUKand
BRCAPRO intheUSA[90,91] .
Uptoto20%ofovarian cancers inthegeneral population and40%
ofovarian cancers intheJewish population arecaused byanovarian
cancer-associated cancer susceptibility geneandaretherefore prevent-
able. Identification ofunaffected women atincreased riskistherefore
critically important. Onein40Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ)individuals carry
oneofthree JewishBRCA founder-mutations. Sixty percent ofBRCA
carriers aremissed byaclinical criteria orfamily history-based testing
approach [92].Apopulation-based approach toBRCA testing (irre-
spective offamily history ofcancer) isnowrecommended forthe
following populations (with atleast1grandparent fromtherespective
population): Ashkenazi Jewish; Sephardi Jewish; Greenlander [75].
Population-based testing inthebroader general population, remains
amatter ofongoing research [93].Thisapproach hasbeenshown tobe
cost-effective forarange ofcancer susceptibility genes andcanprevent
thousands more cancers thanthecurrent approach [94,95] .Complex
ovarian cancer riskmodels incorporating multiple riskfactors including

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
Surgical prevention isthekeystrategy toreduce ovarian cancer risk
intheabsence ofaneffective screening programme. Themostclinically
effective method ofpreventing ovarian cancer inhigh-risk women is
bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Thisisusually
undertaken through minimal access surgery oncethewoman ’sfamily is
complete. Ithasbeenshown toreduce ovarian cancer riskby80–97%in
BRCA carriers [98–102] although asmall residual riskofhigh-grade
serous cancer remains [100,102] .RRSO alsoreduces ovarian cancer
andall-cause mortality [98].Oophorectomy hasalsobeen shown to
reduce ovarian cancer riskby94%inwomen ataverage orpopulation-
levelriskofovarian cancer [103] .While earlier studies suggested RRSO
isassociated withareduction inbreast cancer risk,recent studies cor-
recting forearlier biases suggest thisisnotthecase[104 –106].RRSO
hasbeenshown tobecost-effective at4–5%lifetime ovarian cancer risk
thresholds [107 –109].RRSO should beoffered towomen at≽4–5%
lifetime riskofovarian cancer, asrecommended byascientific impact
paper from theRoyal College ofObstetricians andGynaecologists
(RCOG) [110] andtheUKCancer Genetics Group [111] .Another USA
review hassuggested alower 3–4%riskthreshold [112] .
Inaddition tothestandard BRCA1 andBRCA2 genes, RRSO canbe
offered towomen withPVsinmoderate riskcancer susceptibility genes
including RAD51C ,RAD51D, BRIP1,PALB2 (5–13%lifetime ovarian
cancer risk)[27,28,33] ,andselected women withasignificant family
history ofovarian cancer (e.g.oneortwofirst-degree relatives with
ovarian cancer) whoareatintermediate risk(5–10%lifetime risk)
[23,24] .Family history should beincorporated intotheindividualised
riskassessment process forallwomen. Decision-making toundergo
RRSO isacomplex anddynamic process which canchange withtime
[113] .Itrequires informed counselling ofadvantages anddisadvantages
with patients managed within amulti-disciplinary team framework
[114] .RRSO isassociated witha3–5%complication rate[115] .The
timing ofsurgery isindividualised, taking intoaccount personal pref-
erences andclinical factors. Itmayvaryaccording toage,menopausal
status, typeofcancer susceptibility gene, personal history ofbreast or
other cancer andpersonal preference. Table 1provides guidance on
timing ofRRSO according toriskandcancer susceptibility gene[110] .
RRSO involves removal ofbothtubes andovaries (usually viamin-
imalaccess surgery), aswellasperitoneal cytology orwashings. Hys-
terectomy isnotcurrently recommended inBRCA -carriers orwomen at
increased riskofovarian cancer alone, unless there isanother gynae-
cological indication. While some recent papers suggest anincrease in
serous endometrial cancer riskwithBRCA1 PV-carriers (alsoreferred to
asBRCA1 mut)[116 –118],other studies havenotfound thisassociation
[119,120] .Serous endometrial cancers remain asmall proportion (7%)
ofendometrial cancers andstudies indicate thattheoverall riskof
endometrial cancer isnotincreased. Currently there isinsufficient evi-
dence torecommend routine hysterectomy forprevention inBRCA1-
mut-carriers. Hysterectomy isrecommended inwomen with Lynch
Syndrome, astheyalsohave anincreased riskofendometrial cancer.
Diathermy injury tothefimbrial endcreates heatartefacts which reduce
theoddsofidentifying occult cancers orSTIClesions, andhence, should
beavoided [121] .Itisessential thatastrict surgico-pathological pro-
tocol involving serial sectioning ofthetube called a‘SEE-FIM ’
(Sectioning andExtensively Examining theFIMbria) protocol isusedfor
histopathological assessment, andpathologists should bealerted tothe
indication forBSOonthepathology request form [122] .AUK-wide
protocol forthishasbeen published recently [123] .Fivepercent of
high-risk women haveanoccult microscopic insitu(called serous tubal
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC)) orinvasive cancer identified athistological assessment [115,124] .Seventy percent ofoccult lesions are
tubal rather than ovarian inorigin [124] andthese lesions maybe
missed ifaSEEFIMprotocol isnotused. Women diagnosed withaSTIC
orinvasive cancer athistology following RRSO should bereferred toa
gynaecological cancer MDT forfurther management (seeTable 2for
management details) [123,125] .
Premenopausal RRSO leads toaniatrogenic early menopause and
incurs theassociated detrimental sequelae tolong-term health. Itis
associated with vasomotor symptoms, hotflushes, mood swings,
reduced libido, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, sexual dysfunction, higher
riskofheart disease, increased riskofcardiovascular mortality (without
HRT), osteoporosis, andneurocognitive decline [110,126] .HRTisrec-
ommended inwomen undergoing premature surgical menopause
following early oophorectomy, provided there isnoother contraindi-
cation. Forwomen undergoing RRSO alone, withanintact uterus, oes-
trogen combined withprogestogen HRT(EP-HRT) isrecommended.
Inwomen with Lynch Syndrome whoalsoundergo ahysterectomy,
oestrogen-only HRT(E-HRT) isadvocated. Adetailed description on
HRTmanagement following RRSO isprovided inarecent RCOG Sci-
entific Impact Paper [110] .Ajoint BGCS/British Menopause Society

Earlysalpingectomy anddelayedoophorectomy
Theincreasing evidence baseandwide acceptability ofthecentral
roleofthefallopian tubes intheaetiopathogenesis ofovarian cancer,
coupled withthedetrimental consequences ofearly menopause, hasled
totheproposition ofatwo-step surgical prevention strategy involving an
initial riskreducing early salpingectomy, followed bydelayed oopho-
rectomy (RRESDO) atalaterdate,toavoid detrimental consequences of
early menopause [125] .However, theprecise level ofrisk-reduction
obtained, andtheimpact onmenopause isunknown. RRESDO has
beenshown tohavehighacceptability amongst patients andclinicians
[114,128,129] .Prospective, ongoing studies intheUK,Netherlands and
USA areevaluating acceptability, safety, quality oflife,impact on
menopause andcost-effectiveness ofthisstrategy [123,130,131] .Initial
data suggest, early salpingectomy isassociated with better sexual
function andmenopause symptoms compared tostandard RRSO [130] ,
andhashighacceptability andsatisfaction [114] .RRESDO iscurrently
onlyrecommended inthecontext ofaresearch study. TheTUBA-WISP-
II,SOROCk andPROTECTOR Phase-2 trials willreport onovarian
cancer riskreduction inthecoming years.

Emerging dataparticularly fromNorth America, havedemonstrated itis

associated withanincreased postoperative complication rate,although
analgesic requirement isincreased [132,133] .There isanincreased risk
ofhaemorrhage (odds ratio(OR)1.24, 95%CI1.15to1.33) andblood
transfusion hasbeen reported ifperformed atthetimeofcaesarean

increasing uptake ofOBSinpractice. Twolarge retrospective studies
fromDenmark andSweden reported a42%(OR0.58, 95%CI0.36to
0.95) [44]and65%(hazard ratio (HR) 0.35, 95%CI0.17to0.73)

respectively [42].However, systematic reviews highlight thepoor
quality ofevidence from these studies inrelation tolevel ofrisk
reduction [135,136] .These studies areretrospective, suffer from con-
founders, andindication anddetection biases. Additionally, thepro-
cedures evaluated werenot‘opportunistic ’salpingectomies, thenumber
ofovarian cancers werefew,andthecomparator inboththese studies is
nointervention atallrather thanthestandard surgical procedure. A
follow-up study from theSwedish cohort which adjusted forthe
confounder ofpelvic inflammatory disease (PID), subsequently found a
much lower benefit ofovarian cancer riskreduction of28%(HR0.72,
95%CI0.56, 0.93) frombilateral salpingectomy [43].Additionally, the
impact onlong-term endocrine function isunknown. Recent, short-term
RCTs show nodetrimental impact onovarian function [137] .However,
these dataintheliterature arelimited bysmall sample sizes, younger
ages,useofsurrogate markers andshort follow-up. These results arenot
predictive ofonset ofmenopause [138] .Long-term longitudinal
assessment ofhormonal function andmenstrual cycle isessential to
address thetrueassociation withpremature menopause. Arecent study
reported OBSathysterectomy wasassociated withlonger hospital stay
andanincreased riskofmenopausal symptoms atoneyearfollow-up

Approximately 7,500 women arediagnosed with ovarian cancer
annually intheUK,andfive-year overall survival isaround 45%,lower
thancomparable European countries [140] .Ovarian cancer incidence is
projected toincrease by15%by2035, duetoageing andincrease in
prevalence ofriskfactors [5].
Ovarian cancer hashighcasefatality inthefirstyear, highlighting
thatimproved diagnostics maybecritical toimprove outcomes: 32%women diagnosed willdiewithin thefirst12months; 14%within the
firsttwomonths [6].Twenty-two percent ofwomen withovarian cancer
inEngland willnotreceive anyanticancer treatment, likely duetopoor
performance status atdiagnosis and26%ofwomen arediagnosed
following anemergency presentation [141] .
Ovarian cancer isfrequently diagnosed atadvanced stages (FIGO
stages IIIandIV).Stage Icancer hasa90%five-year survival, compared
to~15%atStage IV.Theproportion ofovarian cancer diagnosed at
stage Iranged from 10.0%to47.9%across England; concomitantly
five-year survival from ovarian cancer varies between 28%to49%
across England, revealing huge variation andinequalities [6].TheNa-
tional Cancer Diagnosis Audit found thatwomen diagnosed withovarian
cancer havealonger median diagnostic interval (time frompresentation
todiagnosis) of55days, compared tomedian of40daysforalltypes of
cancer [6].Unfortunately, oncereferred tosecondary care,median time
tostarttreatment is69days; oneofthelongest ofallcancers. Substantial
room forimprovement exists inthediagnostic pathway, from commu-
nitythrough totertiary care[142] .
Symptom-triggered testingforovariancancer
Ovarian cancer isassociated withsymptoms inbothearly- andlate-
stage cancer [143] .Unfortunately, symptoms arevague andnon-specific
andfrequently mis-attributed toseveral more common conditions,
including irritable bowel syndrome, menopausal changes, andendo-
metriosis. Symptoms include bloating, abdominal discomfort/pain,
early satiety, change inbowel andurinary habit, back pain, vaginal
bleeding, tiredness. Women withovarian cancer usually havesymptoms
andreport them toprimary care, sometimes months before diagnosis
[144 –146].NICE guidance recommends thatwomen contact primary
careiftheyexperience these symptoms frequently (roughly 12ormore
times amonth) [147] .
Community diagnosis
A‘BeClear onCancer ’awareness campaign wassuccessful inraising
awareness ofsymptoms ofovarian cancer, withincreased numbers of
women visiting theirGPwithbloating (ranging from14–30%based on
age),butitdidnotimpact thenumber ofovarian cancers diagnosed, nor
thestage ofdisease atdiagnosis, although these were short termpilot
studies [148] .
Charities, suchasOvacome, Target Ovarian Cancer andEveAppeal,
have helplines andinformation sources thatcanbeaccessed ifpeople
areworried about symptoms. TheCLOCS case-control pilotstudy, using
analysis ofsupermarket loyalty carddata, demonstrated thatwomen
with ovarian cancer aremore likely topurchase non-pharmacy pre-
scriptions, suchaspainkillers andindigestion medicines, thancontrols
inthefewmonths priortodiagnosis [149] .Ifvalidated inalarge cohort
study, thiscould beanimportant observation.
Primarycarediagnosis
NICE guidance advocates sequential testing withCA125 andultra-
sound forwomen whopresent totheirGPwithnon-specific symptoms
onafrequent basisorpersistent basis, especially ifmore than12times a
month [147] .IfCA125 isF35IU/ml andtheGPconsiders theultra-
sound tobeabnormal, referral tosecondary careismandated. Anurgent
referral togynaecological cancer service isrecommended ifphysical
examination identifies ascites and/or apelvic orabdominal mass (not
obviously caused byfibroids). Women withnormal CA125, butpersis-
tentsymptoms, orelevated CA125 butnormal ultrasound, should be
assessed carefully forother clinical causes andkeptunder review in
primary care, with repeated samples andreferral forfurther in-
vestigations ifrising, without other obvious cause.
Substantial variation inpractice exists intheuseofthispathway and
GPsaremore likely torefer, based onanabnormality ineither test.NICEE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
76guidance does notspecify what constitutes anabnormal ultrasound,
resulting inmany referrals forphysiological cysts. Post-COVID andwith
theincreasing useofvirtual clinics, itislikely thatmany women with
symptoms willnotreceive aphysical examination prior toreferral. The
impact ofthisonoutcomes isnotyetknown. Thishasresulted inalarge
year-on-year increase inreferrals forsuspected ovarian cancer, with
impact onconversion rates toovarian cancer lessclear cut[150] .Un-
fortunately, current diagnostic tests(CA125 andultrasound) areneither
highly sensitive, norspecific. CA125 iselevated inmany conditions,
including during menstruation, fibroids, endometriosis, whereas CA125
isonlyelevated in50%ofStage Icancers. Ultrasound invariably picks
upnormal physiological ovarian cystsinpremenopausal women andup
to20%postmenopausal women willhavebenign ovarian cysts. Ultra-
sound scoring systems canbecomplex, arenotusedroutinely inprimary
care,andthequality ofultrasound inprimary careishighly variable.
Making adiagnosis ofovarian cancer inprimary careischallenging
andone-third ofwomen present toprimary carewithrelevant symptoms
three ormore times before specialist referral. Theaverage GPwillseea
newdiagnosis ofovarian cancer onceevery fiveyears andUKGPshavea
lower readiness torefer patients ontospecialists, compared toother
countries [144 –146].
Adual-testing approach where anabnormality ineither testwarrants
referral (asalready performed inScotland andsome Integrated Cancer
Boards), maybe more sensitive forearlier diagnosis andisbeing pro-
posed bycancer charities andtheNHScancer programme.
Organisation ofprimarycarepathway
Rapid Diagnostic Clinics andCommunity Diagnostic Hubs offernon-
specific symptom pathway routes forpatients whodonotfitintosite-
specific faster diagnosis pathways andmaysupport thefaster diag-
nosis ofovarian cancer forthose without araised CA125.
Diagnostic tests
Asignificant proportion ofwomen with high CA125 levels have
other cancers. Ahighincidence (12.3 %)ofnon-ovarian cancers were
found inwomen withelevated CA125 levels (20%ofwomen aged≽50
years withaCA125≽35IU/ml), particularly forundiagnosed lungand
pancreatic cancer. Over athird (38%)ofpatients diagnosed witha
lower gastrointestinal (GI)cancer, which hasoverlapping symptoms
withovarian cancer, hadCA125 levelsF35IU/ml [151] .Thissuggests
referral toa‘vague symptoms pathway ’,where investigations areper-
formed formultiple cancers simultaneously, could facilitate cancer
diagnosis.
Funstonetal.demonstrated thatage-specific thresholds forCA125
(asdiscussed inNICE guidelines forovarian cancer section above), can
provide anindividual ovarian cancer riskscore forpatients, which may
provide amodel forreferral pathways. Acceptability amongst patients
andprimary careproviders willneed tobeunderstood prior toimple-
mentation. TheSONATA study isfunded bytheNHScancer program
andinvestigates atriaging strategy using ROMA inplace ofCA125 for
women withsymptoms inprimary care.
Younger women aremore likely tohave rarer tumour types,
including germ celltumours, sowomen under 40should alsohavebeta-
human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) performed ifasuspiscious massisseenon
pelvic ultrasound scan[152] .
Other ovarian tumor markers may include inhibin, carcinoem-
bryonic antigen (CEA), CA19–9,andHE4). Serum levels canbeelevated
inpatients withrarer ovarian cancer types (e.g., mucinous orendome-
trioid) orsecondary ovarian malignancies/other primary tumours (e.g.,
appendiceal, colorectal andupper gastrointestinal tumours). Measure-
ment ofthese markers prior tosurgery canhelpavoid inappropriate
treatment forother tumour types, ifhistological confirmation isnot
obtained prior tosurgery, andforfuture monitoring aftertreatment in
patients whodonothaveelevated serum CA-125 atbaseline [153] .Secondary care
Organisation ofdiagnostic pathway
NHS England published guidance thatsetsouthowadiagnosis
within 28-days canbeachieved forthesuspected gynaecological cancer
pathway, supporting theon-going improvement effort toshorten diag-
nosis pathways, reduce variation, improve patient experience ofcare,
andmeet theFaster Diagnosis Standard [154] .One-stop clinics for
suspected ovarian cancer referrals hope tostreamline referrals, reduce
thesubstantial variation inimaging availability, andreduce timeto
biopsy ifCT/ultrasound isrequired. Inaddition, biopsy slotscanbe
aligned tothese clinics. One-stop clinics arealsointegral toimproving
secondary careultrasound, andallow iterative learning andimple-
mentation ofultrasound models, such astheInternational Ovarian
Tumor Analysis (IOTA) score [155,156] .Ongoing quality improvement
projects investigate whether frailty assessments, same dayimaging/bi-
opsy andprehabilitation efforts canbeimplemented inthese clinics
[157] .
Diagnostic tests
Previous NICE andRCOG guidance recommend theuseoftheRiskof
Malignancy Index I(RMI) insecondary carefortriage intotertiary care
[158,159] .However, theRMIhaspoor sensitivity andspecificity for
premenopausal women andthese guidelines arenowoutdated, with
newevidence tosupport better models. TheRiskofOvarian Malignancy
Algorithm (ROMA) model combines theserum levels ofHe4andCA125
inanalgorithm [160] .Testthresholds vary based ontestprovider
(Abbott versus Roche) withcomparable testperformance across both
providers. TheIOTA ADNEX score combines ultrasound characteristics
with CA125 andage[161] .Arecent Cochrane review analysed 58
studies (30,121 patients, 9061 cases ofovarian cancer). Prevalence of
ovarian cancer ranged from 16to55%instudies reflecting highly
selected/pre-triaged populations. Forpremenopausal women, ROMA at
athreshold of13.1(/2)andADNEX atathreshold of10%(post-test
probability ofovarian cancer of10%),demonstrated higher sensitivity
compared toRMIF200(ROMA77.4%;ADNEX95.5%;RMI
57.2%)butlower specificity (ROMA84.3%;ADNEX77.8%;RMI
92.5%).Forpostmenopausal women, ROMA andADNEX demonstrated
higher sensitivity compared toRMI(ROMA90.3%versus ADNEX
97.6%versus RMI78.7%).Specificity ofROMA wascomparable with
RMI, (ROMA81.5%versus RMI85.4%),whilst thespecificity of
ADNEX waslower compared toRMI(ADNEX55.0%)[162] .
ROMA isnotcurrently available routinely within theNHS, dueto
lackofHe4testing. TheROCkeTS study evaluated RMIversus ROMA
versus IOTA models inaprospective diagnostic testaccuracy study
recruiting mainly from secondary carerapid access clinics withultra-
sound performed mainly byNHSsonographers, results have been pre-
sented butnotyetpublished [156,163] .They found thatIOTA ADNEX
(F10%)hadthehighest sensitivity butlower specificity, andROMA
(F29.9%)hadmarginal improvement ofsensitivity overRMIF250but
with reduction inspecificity. ORADS hadlittle advantage overRMI
[156] .They recommended thatIOTA ADNEX (at10%threshold) in
real-world NHSpractice hashighest sensitivity andshould replace RMI
asthenewstandard ofcarediagnostic testinovarian cancer forpost-
menopausal women.
TheOvarian-Adnexal Reporting andDataSystem (O-RADS) lexicon
forultrasound waspublished in2018, providing astandardized glossary
thatincludes allappropriate descriptors anddefinitions ofthecharac-
teristic ultrasound appearance ofnormal ovaries andvarious adnexal
lesions [164] .Dataarestillaccruing andgiven theconsiderable overlap
between ORADS andtheIOTA terminology, thisguideline willadhere to
theIOTA model asithasmore supporting evidence. TheuseofORADS
lexicon byNHSsonographers isnotrecommended until further pro-
spective evidence isavailable.
Implementation ofIOTA ADNEX at10%willrequire skilling-up of

Feasibility Pilot(OCAFP) found thatoneinfourwomen withadvanced
ovarian cancer didnotreceive anyanticancer treatment (surgery or
chemotherapy) andlessthanhalfreceived standard ofcaretreatment i.
e.,thecombination ofsurgery andchemotherapy. What wasapparent
fromthese datawasthatwomen diagnosed inacancer centre weremore
likely toreceive surgery thanthose diagnosed inaunit,although surgery
forthose withovarian cancer iscentralised. Asaresult, theBGCS pub-
lished a“calltoaction ”anddeveloped keyperformance indicators
following aconsensus meeting [172] .Inorder toimprove identification
ofreasons forsuboptimal management, andpoorsurvival outcomes, the
MDT plays animportant roleinrecording patient factors andsurgical
outcomes. Completeness ofinformation forregional andnational auditsisreliant onaccurate recording ofinformation anddecision-making. The
rationale forseveral oftherecommendations inthissection aresetoutin
thisdocument andtargets forkeyperformance indicators wereagreed at
thismeeting [173] .
Ultrasound isuseful fordetermining thesiteoforigin ofapelvic mass
andtocharacterize thefeatures ofthemass andthelikelihood ofma-
lignancy [174] .Theuseofstandardised ultrasound reporting models,
combining bothmorphological andDoppler waveform analysis, suchas
IOTA ADNEX ultrasound scoring system, areencouraged, inorder to
provide consistency ininterpretations, standardisation oflexicon, lesion
riskstratification andmanagement [155,161,175] .
In2021 TheEuropean Society ofGynaecological Oncology (ESGO),
theInternational Society ofUltrasound inObstetrics andGynecology
(ISUOG), theInternational Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and
theEuropean Society forGynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE) jointly
endorsed theuseoftheIOTA ADNEX forcharacterising adnexal masses
onultrasound followed bytheuseoftheO-RADS score todirect further
management [176] .Patients withanIOTA-ADNEX threshold ofF10%
should have further investigations andbereferred tothespecialist
gynaecological centre MDT [175 –177].

allows identification ofcalcified peritoneal deposits (psammoma
bodies), which arenotreadily identified onMRI[178,179] .
CTimaging ofthethorax, abdomen andpelvis isrecommended to
helpdefine theextent ofdisease andtoaidinsurgical planning. How-
ever, retrospective datahaveshown thatCTcannot accurately predict
finenodule peritoneal carcinomatosis, andtherefore mitigate against
suboptimal cytoreduction [180] .Areview comparing 11studies that
usedCT-based models toassess residual disease showed thatCThada

andspecificity from 32to64%[181] .Inparticular, CThasalow

resulted inunnecessary surgery in6to45%ofcases [185 –187].
Currently, twolarge multi-centre trials (MROC andMRStagingOC)
areongoing toconsider whether MRIcanaccurately select patients for
whom cytoreductive surgery toachieve nomacroscopic residual disease
(NMRD) ornotumour depositsF1cm(small volume residual disease

DWI-MRI toCTforthepre-operative assessment ofincomplete cytor-
eduction with residual disease ofanysize, Whole-Body DWI-MRI
showed significantly higher sensitivity (94%versus 66%),specificity
(97.7 %versus 77.3%)andaccuracy (95.7 %versus 71.3%)compared
toCT[188] .

with CT(71%)[194,195] andmay provide agreater diagnosticaccuracy forthedetection ofsupra-diaphragmatic disease [196,197] .

diagnostic modality forthetrueextent ofperitoneal spread ofovarian
cancer, specifically bowel andmesenteric serosa, andtherefore failsto
predict resectability inthose keysites, especially inthepresence oflow-
volume, orlow-grade disease [195] .
Thediagnostic performance ofPET-CT canalsobeimpacted nega-
tively bycertain tumour histological subtypes, duetolower fluo-
rodeoxyglucose uptake inclear cellandmucinous invasive subtypes
[176] .ACochrane review of18FDG PET-CT andMRIforassessing

MRI; 46women would beincorrectly classified ashaving residual dis-
easeaftersurgery (false positive) according toPET-CT, compared to8
women according toDWI-MRI [199] .Amore recent clinical study in20
women withHGCS, comparing CTwithPET-CT, found thatPET-CT had
alower sensitivity, detecting fewer disease sitesthanCT,especially in
theupper abdomen andalong thegastrointestinal tract[200] .
Several studies, including systematic reviews andmeta-analyses,
comparing thedifferent imagining modalities intheassessment of
ovarian cancer recurrence demonstrated pooled accuracy of94%for
MRI; 88–95%forPET-CT and76–79%forCT[201 –205].Magnetic

Highgradeserouscarcinoma
Primarysiteassessment
Theorigin ofhigh-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) hasbeen
thesubject ofintense study. Thedistal fallopian tubehasemerged asthe
likely siteoforigin formost HGSC. Thisobservation is,ingreat part,
attributable totheuseofsampling protocols thatthoroughly examine
thedistal fallopian tubeandalsoduetothereporting bygreater number
ofspecialist pathologists withasub-specialty interest ingynaecological
pathology. Thediscovery ofserous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma
(STIC) inwomen withBRCA1 orBRCA2 pathogenic variants following
risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomies (RRSO) andinwomen with
advanced ovarian carcinoma ledtothehypothesis thatthenatural his-
toryofHGSC might involve anorigin inmostcases atthedistal fimbria
ofthefallopian tube. Identification ofSTICin18%to60%ofcases of
advanced/symptomatic HGSC supports thisassertion. STIClesions are
characterized byDNAdamage, TP53 mutation, andprogressive molec-
ularabnormalities thatarealsoseeninhigh-grade serous carcinoma. An
origin fromepithelial inclusion cystsintheovary hasbeenproposed asa
potential explanation assiteoforigin inthecases where complete ex-
amination ofthefallopian tube does notreveal STIC. Aconsensus
statement onprimary siteassignment intubo-ovarian HGSC hasbeen
made (seeTable 3)[208] .
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofHGSC
HGSC oftubo-ovarian andperitoneal origin have similar morpho-
logical andimmunohistochemical features. HGSC canbearranged in
papillary, glandular orsolid architecture. HGSC exhibits moderate to
marked nuclear atypia andtypically show greater than12mitoses per10
highpower fields. Necrosis andmultinucleate cellsareoften present.
Thedistinction between low-grade andhigh-grade serous carcinoma is
based oncytological, notarchitectural, features. Homologous recombi-
nation deficient tumours frequently display SET(solid, endometrial-like,
transitional) patterns. These tumours often show geographic necrosis
andaprominent lymphocytic infiltrate.
Onimmunohistochemistry, HGSC oftubo-ovarian andperitoneal
origin aretypically positive forCK7,WT1, PAX8, oestrogen receptor and
CA125. They donotexpress CK20, CEAandCDX2. Aberrant expression
ofp53isareliable method ofidentifying theunderlying TP53 mutation
in96%ofcases. In4%ofcases, awild-type pattern ofstaining maybe
observed despite anunderlying lossoffunction (LOF). Immunohisto-
chemistry forp53should notbereported aspositive ornegative, butas
aberrant/mutant orwild-type. Inthemajority, theaberrant staining isa
mutant overexpressed pattern characterised bydiffuse strong positive
nuclear staining incontrast tothewild-type staining observed inback-
ground normal tissues (e.g., fat,stroma). Inaminority, there iscomplete
absence ofstaining, reported asanullmutant pattern, orleast
frequently, amutant cytoplasmic pattern. Especially inthelatter two
patterns, thewild-type staining observed intheinternal control serves to
confirm thattheaberrant staining isgenuine. Inmost cases, there isdiffuse positivity forp16,aprotein thathasanimportant roleincell
cycle regulation. Unlike incervical adenocarcinomas, diffuse p16posi-
tivity inHGCS isunrelated toanHPVaetiology.
Genetics
p53.Asstated above, inF95%ofcases, immunohistochemistry is
reliable indetecting thepresence ofanunderlying TP53 mutation, the
driver event inpathogenesis. Innearly allcases ofHGSC, acombination
ofmorphology andimmunohistochemistry issufficient fordiagnosis.
However, there mayberarecases where morphology isequivocal and
thestaining pattern ofp53iswild-type, whereTP53 mutational analysis
helps distinguish HGSC fromlowgrade serous carcinoma.
Homologous recombinant deficiency (HRD)
Asdescribed above, pathogenic variants inhomologous recombinant
(HR)genes result inaninability torepair breaks indouble stranded DNA
andincreases theriskofdeveloping tubo-ovarian/peritoneal HGSC. HR
deficient tumours show increased sensitivity toplatinum therapy and
PARP inhibitory therapy. BRCA1/2 genes arethemost commonly
affected, butlessfrequently, pathogenic variants mayoccur inother HR
genes such asBRIP1 ,RAD51C ,andRAD51D [209] .Furthermore, ho-
mologous recombination deficiency maybecaused byepigenetic events,
including BRCA methylation which won ’tbeidentified bygenomic
sequencing. Although mostly germline, HRDmaylessfrequently result
from somatic mutations inBRCA 1/2andother HRgenes, confined to
tumour tissue only. Testing performed ontumour tissue detects somatic
mutations andgermline mutations. However, asgermline BRCA variants
withlarge genomic rearrangements arenotcaptured bytargeted next
generation sequencing usedfortissueBRCA (tBRCA )testing, thelatter
doesnotreplace theneed forgermline testing. TheNICE approval in
March 2021 ofmaintenance olaparib (PARP inhibitor) therapy in
advanced (FIGO stages IIIorIV),HRdeficient, highgrade epithelial
ovarian, fallopian tubeorprimary peritoneal cancer, irrespective ofthe
BRCA status, hasledtoroutine HRD testing ontumour tissue insuch
cases. However, aspernational testdirectory, tumourBRCA testing is
performed inallcases ofHGCS irrespective ofFIGO stage. These testsare
routinely requested bythepathologists onthetissue biopsy orresection
specimen andoccasionally oncytology cellblock samples (ifhistology
tissue sample isnotavailable) provided patient consent hasbeen
obtained.
Women with HGSC orG3endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma
haveF10%riskofanunderlying BRCA mutation andshould beoffered
genetics counselling andtesting.
TheBAGP/BGCS recommendations fortumour andgermline BRCA
andtesting areasfollows [210] :
≡Patients withnon-mucinous high-grade tubo-ovarian carcinoma are
offered testing asearly intheircarepathway aspossible.
≡Clinicians mustcommunicate tothepathologist thatthepatient has
beenconsented, prior totesting being initiated.
≡Tumour andgermline (usually blood) testing should beundertaken
inparallel.
Chemotherapy responsescore
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) isincreasingly usedinadvanced
HGSC. Thechemotherapy response score isbased onomental exami-
nation oftheinterval debulking specimen andprovides histological
assessment oftheNACT effect. Itstratifies patients intocomplete/near
complete response (CRS 3),partial response (CRS 2)andnoorminimal
response (CRS1).Asitcorrelates withprogression freesurvival andhas
good reproducibility [211,212] ;itisrecommended byInternational
Collaboration onCancer Reporting (ICCR), andRoyal College ofPa-
thologists (RCPath) asaprognostic tooltoguide further treatment in
cases when there ispoorresponse toNACT. Atpresent there isnoclinicalE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
80evidence thatwould recommend changing thestandard adjuvant
treatment approach based onCRS.
Clearcelladenocarcinoma
Ovarian clearcellcarcinoma (CCC) accounts forapproximately 10%
ofepithelial ovarian cancer, withahigher prevalence inEastAsia.These
tumours areusually unilateral andarecommonly associated with
endometriosis. CCCisthemostlikely component tobepartofamixed
carcinoma [213] .Themajority ofwomen present withearly-stage dis-
ease, butduetorelatively lowchemosensitivity, prognosis istypically
poorwhen presenting athigher stages (III-IV).
CCCtypically displays atubulocystic, papillary and/or solid archi-
tecture, with asingle layer oftumour cells, which show hobnailing.
Hyaline globules maybepresent. Thetumour cellshaveuniform nuclear
atypia, although areas ofpleomorphism maybepresent, andmitotic
rates areusually relatively low.While thecytoplasm isoften clear, it
maybeeosinophilic (oxyphilic variant) andthismayrepresent apitfall
infrozen section assessment.
CCCisgenerally positive forPAX8 byIHCandnegative forER.The
majority ofcases show wild-type p53immunoreactivity, butasubset
(reported incidence varying from 7-20%)shows anaberrant/mutant
p53staining pattern corresponding todriver mutations inTP53 and
which isanindependent poorprognostic factor [214 –217].IHCmarkers
helpful fordiagnosis indifficult cases include Napsin A,HNF1 βand
AMACR, allofwhich arevariably positive inCCC;however, Napsin Ais
theleastspecific andmayalsobeexpressed inendometrioid ovarian
carcinoma, while AMACR isspecific, butnotsensitive, andmayonly
stainapproximately halfofCCCcases [218] .
CCCischaracterised predominantly bymutations intheARID1A or
PIK3CA genes [219,220] ,although aminority harbour aTP53 driver
mutation. Alower proportion ofovarian CCCshows mismatch repair
deficiency than their endometrial counterpart ortheendometrioid
subtype within theovary (reported rates vary from 2-7%)
[216,217,223 –225],butgiven thatapproximately 12–14%ofLynch
syndrome-associated ovarian cancers areofCCCsubtype [223] ,itseems
reasonable torecommend universal MMR immunohistochemical testing
onthese tumours. Those with MMR deficiency often have agreater
number oftumour-infiltrating lymphocytes andareenriched forARID1A
mutations [221] .Asmall number ofstudies haveattempted toclassify
ovarian CCCaccording toTGCA andhave demonstrated averylow
number ofPOLE mutations (D1%)inthistumour type[217,221] .
Ovarianendometrioid adenocarcinoma
Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (OEC) accounts forapproximately
10%ofepithelial ovarian cancer andhasamore favourable prognosis
thanhighgrade serous, mucinous andclear cellcarcinomas stage for
stage [224] .OECtypically presents atanearly-stage withlow-grade
tumours. Grade 3endometrioid carcinomas oftheovary aremuch
rarer thantheirendometrial counterparts. OEChassimilar morpholog-
icalfeatures tothatseenintheuterus, withlow-grade tumours dis-
playing aglandular architecture, often withcribriforming orpapillary
architecture, composed ofcolumnar cellswithmildtomoderate cyto-
logical atypia andscattered mitotic figures. Squamous and/or mucinous
differentiation iscommon. Other lesscommon patterns include sexcord-
stromal/sertoliform morphology [225] ,which mimic sexcord-stromal
tumours andaspindled cellcomponent orcorded andhyaline features
(CHEC); inthese variant patterns, therecommendation isthatgrading is
based onareas ofconventional endometrioid morphology. Arecently-
described pattern isthatresembling pilomatrix carcinoma withhigh-
grade features, which isclinically aggressive [226] .Some cases give
risetoamalignant squamous component andother rarecases are
associated withsomatically-derived yolksactumours. Cases associated
withanundifferentiated component aretermed dedifferentiated carci-
noma, analogous totheir endometrial counterpart. Ovarianadenocarcinomas previously falling intothecategory ofseromucinous
carcinoma arenowalsoincluded inthishistotype [227] .
Byimmunohistochemistry, OECisusually positive forPAX8 andER,
shows awild-type p53staining pattern, mosaic p16staining andis
negative forWT1. However, OEChave ahigher propensity forWT1
expression thanintheendometrium and,while often focal, evendiffuse
WT1 staining withtypical endometrioid morphology should notdeter
pathologists fromdiagnosing assuch[226,228] .Inaddition, there may
belossofPAX8 expression inthespindled orCHEC areas inthese
variants.
OECoften arises within abackground ofendometriosis, although
other precursor lesions, suchasendometrioid adenofibroma/endome-
trioid borderline tumour, maybepresent without definite endometri-
osis.Given theirassociation withendometriosis, appropriate sampling is
required toexclude amixed carcinoma withahigher grade (usually
clear cell)component. Approximately 10%ofpatients presenting with
OEC willhave asynchronous endometrial endometrioid primary;
although these maybeclonally related, theyareforclinical purposes
regarded asdiscrete primaries duetotheirexcellent prognosis andoften
thepresence ofprecursor lesions atbothsites(atypical hyperplasia in
theendometrium, endometriosis intheovary). Therefore, endometrial
sampling isparamount incases offertility-preserving surgery foran
endometrioid ovarian primary toexclude concurrent hyperplasia or
overt malignancy.
OEChave similar mutation profiles tothose intheendometrium,
although havebeenshown tohavelower rates ofPTEN mutations and
microsatellite instability than their endometrial counterparts and
conversely higher ratesofCTNNB1 mutations [229,230] .While therates
ofmismatch repair deficiency arelower than intheendometrium,
immunohistochemistry formismatch repair proteins isrecommended in
allcases ofOECtoavoid missing adiagnosis ofLynch syndrome, in
addition tothepotential forimmunotherapeutic options inrelapsed or
advanced disease. However, asintheendometrium, themajority of
mismatch repair deficiency inOECissporadic innature. Some studies
havebeenperformed toinvestigate TheCancer Genome Atlasmolecular
subgroups asdescribed inendometrial endometrioid carcinomas; over-
alltheratesofPOLE mutation areslightly lower intheovary thaninthe
endometrium andanincreased proportion ofcases fallintothenospe-
cificmolecular profile group. While numbers aresmall, ameta-analysis
hasdemonstrated similar outcomes tothose described intheendome-
trium when ovarian endometrioid carcinomas arecategorised inthis
manner, withthemost favourable prognosis seeninPOLE-mutated tu-
mours andthepoorest outcomes inthep53-abnormal group [231,232] .

Mesonephric-like carcinoma
These tumours generally occur inpostmenopausal women [234] and
tendtobeconfined totheovary atpresentation. Abdominal orpelvic
painisthecommon mode ofpresentation. Diagnosis ismade byhistol-
ogy.Morphological features include glandular, ductal andsolid pat-
terns. Intra-luminal eosinophilic colloid-like material maybeseen. No
squamous ormucinous differentiation isnoted. These carcinomas areE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
81regarded ashighgrade. Onimmunohistochemistry, thecellsaretypi-
cally negative forhormone receptors andWT1. They arepositive for
GATA3, TTF1, luminal CD10 andPAX8 [235] .Background endometri-
osismaybepresent. Targeted genomic profiling reveals activating KRAS
mutations andPIK3CA mutations [236] .
Undifferentiated anddedifferentiated carcinomas
These aretumours ofperi-menopausal women. They arehighgrade
tumours thatareconstituted bycellsthataretypically discohesive and
arranged insheets. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes areoften afeature
[237] .Mitotic activity ishigh, andnecrosis isnotuncommon. There may
beawell-differentiated component, and,inthese instances, these are
regarded asdedifferentiated carcinomas. Thecellsareusually negative
forPAX8, ER,PRandWT1. EMAstaining isusually focalandp53wild
type. LossofSMARCA4 (BRG1), SMARCA2 (BRM), SMARCB1 (INI1), or
ARID1A andlossofmismatch repair proteins arecommon [238,239] .
Smallcellcarcinoma oftheovary,hypercalcemic type
Thisisamalignancy thatoccurs inyoung women withamedian age
of25years. Presenting symptoms arethose ofapelvic orabdominal
mass; uptotwo-thirds ofthepatients have serum hypercalcaemia at
presentation. Onmicroscopy, these areundifferentiated tumours
composed ofmonomorphic cellswithround nuclei, vesicular chromatin
andbrisk mitotic activity. They aremostly arranged insheets with
typical scattered follicle likespaces [240] .Onimmunohistochemistry,
thetumours arepositive forWT1, p53,andp16withvariable expression
ofSALL4, keratins, EMA, CD10, calretinin, allneuroendocrine markers,
andPTHrP. Inhibin andTTF1 aretypically negative. Almost alltumours
show lossofSMARCA4 (andSMARCA2 )expression. Molecular testing
shows somatic orgermline inactivating mutations inSMARCA4 [241] .
Histogenesis ofthese tumours isstillundecided. Their molecular profile
raises theconsideration thattheybelong toafamily thatincludes ma-
lignant rhabdoid tumours [242] .Cases withscattered mucinous glands
areseen. Thisraises thepossibility thattheymaybeassociated with
teratomas andmayrepresent germ celltumours. Prognosis ispoorin
cases presenting withspread outside theovary.
Mixedcarcinomas
With increased understanding ofovarian cancer morphology and
molecular pathology, thecategory ofmixed carcinoma israre.Atleast
twohistological types must beclearly recognizable onH&E-stained
sections. Thedifferent histological components should beconfirmed by
ancillary testing when appropriate. Anypercentage ofasecond histo-
logical typethatcanbeconfidently demonstrated issufficient tolabel
thetumour asmixed. Thetypes present andtheirpercentages should be
stated inthediagnostic report. Themost common mixed tumour is
endometrioid andclear cellcarcinoma [213] .Acombination ofNapsin
A(expressed intheclear cellcomponent) andhormone receptor
immunohistochemistry (expressed intheendometrioid component) can
beusedtodistinguish between thetwotypes ofcarcinomas.
Solidpseudopapillary tumour
Thisisararetumour, which hasbeenmostcommonly recognised in
thepancreas. Morphologically they typically show solid nests and
pseudopapillary structures. These lackvascular cores. Thecells are
typically polygonal [243] .There maybeanantipodal distribution ofthe
nuclei atthebaseofthepapillae. Tumour cellsareusually positive for
vimentin, CD10, CD56, CD99, WT1, and β-catenin (nuclear andcyto-
plasmic). Chromogranin, calretinin, andinhibin arenegative [244] .The
typical finding onDNAsequencing isanactivating mutation ofCTNNB1
[245] .Although originally considered benign, there areincreasing

Medically frailpatients, asassessed byclinical frailty scores, e.g.the
Rockwood Score [246] ,experience higher complications, readmissions,
andmortality rates from surgical procedures [247 –249].Frailty may
occur across theagespectrum ofovarian cancer patients since itis
defined asincluding chronic co-morbidities, notnecessarily exclusive to
increasing age,thataffect bothphysiologic resilience andresponse to
stressors [250] .Upuntil now, research inprehabilitation hasbeen
largely limited topilot studies. These studies have demonstrated
decreased length ofhospital stay, decreased rates ofpost-operative
complications andaquicker return tobaseline performance status
[251,252] aswellasdecreased healthcare costs [253] .
Optimising fitness prior toanyovarian cancer treatment isaE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
82challenge. Many women present withdisease atanadvanced stage and
arelikely tobephysically compromised bythetimetheyarefirstseenin
aclinical setting. Howbesttooptimise fitness atalllevels requires new
ways ofthinking (and further research). Anyintervention requires
effectiveness within ashort timeframe. Studies inbothcolorectal and
thoracic care, emphasise thatprehabilitation must startonfirstseeing
patients withinterventions inbothnutritional andexercise tolerance
status [254] .
Many women undergoing abdominal surgery willbeathighriskof
postoperative complications andsignificant decline inphysical function
[255] .
Prehabilitation forpatientsundergoing treatment
Therecent Ovarian Cancer Audit Feasibility Pilot[6]demonstrated
that,amongst women withstage II-IVandunknown stage ovarian can-
cer,fewer thanhalfreceived standard management withacombination
ofsurgery andchemotherapy. Additionally, 26.2%ofwomen werenot
offered anytreatment. Thismaybeduetopoorfitness levels asreported
inaprevious study [256] .Therapidity ofinstigating investigations and
appropriate treatment therefore become critical before thewoman be-
comes tooclinically weak andunwell fortreatment. Prehabilitation isan
integral partofthisprocess, aspartofacontinuum ofpreventative,
restorative, supportive andpalliative rehabilitation; andevenwithout
peri-operative complications, surgical stress isassociated witha20–40%
decrease infunctional capacity [257,258] .
Useofphysical activity andexercise science principles isrecognised
asbeing important [259] .Inaddition, useofbehaviour change strate-
giesmaybeconsidered. Asystematic review [260] examined exercise
training interventions inpeople withcancer undergoing adjuvant cancer
treatment following surgery, however, duetothelackofadequately
powered RCTs, itremained unclear whether exercise training inthis
context improved clinical outcomes, other physical fitness andhealth
related quality oflife(HRQoL).
Inasystematic review ofpatients undergoing major abdominal
cancer surgery andgynaecological surgery, fivestudies ofpre-
habilitation programs ingynaecology (three RCTs, onestudy protocol,
onepilotstudy) were identified [261] .Study protocols were heteroge-
nous, butshowed improvements inboth physical andpsychological
parameters. Moststudies showed improvement incomplication rateand
shorter length ofhospital stay.
Multimodal prehabilitation programs mayinclude exercise, nutri-
tional counselling (e.g., protein supplementation), psychological sup-
port (e.g., stress-reducing strategies), andstrategies tooptimise
underlying conditions andpromote cessation ofnegative health be-
haviours suchassmoking andalcohol consumption [262] .These in-
terventions have been associated with reduced treatment associated
morbidity andmortality, reduced length ofhospital stay, improved
cardiorespiratory fitness, nutritional status andmobility, aswellas
improvement inneuro-cognitive function [263] .Thepositive effect of
these interventions canbeseeninaslittleastwoweeks, withtheeffects
being maximised thelonger theyarecontinued [264] .Active partici-
pation ofboth healthcare providers andpatients leads tobetter out-
comes [265] .
Miralpeix etal.2019 suggest asafe,reproducible, functional, and
easy-to-apply multimodal prehabilitation program forgynaecological
oncology practice. Asuggested interval fordelivery isshown below

ACochrane review demonstrated thatpreoperative carbohydrate
treatment wasassociated withasmall reduction inlength ofhospital
staywhen compared with placebo orfasting inpatients undergoing
elective surgery [266] ,butshould either beavoided oradministered
withcaution inpatients withdiabetes.Prehabilitation intheelderly
Older women arecommonly seenasunable totolerate extensive
surgery andanincrease inreferral forneoadjuvant chemotherapy isseen
inwomen overtheageof65years ofage[267] .Biasagainst surgery for
women over75years ofageisalsodemonstrated byexclusion from
clinical trials [268] .Theconcept offrailty hasalready been discussed
andfrailty, rather than chronological age,should beconsidered in
treatment decision-making. Inaprospective study [254,269] ofwomen
over 75years with newly-diagnosed ovarian cancer, patients were
referred toaCareoftheElderly clinic forevaluation before cytoreduc-
tivesurgery. Although there werenostatistical differences inoutcomes
between women treated withsurgery whodidanddidnothaveapre-
operative geriatric evaluation, there were twodeaths inthegroup that
didnotundergo evaluation andmore unplanned ICUadmissions (6
versus 1).
Timinganddeliveryofprehabilitation
Recommendations
Community-delivered prehabilitation
Inaprospective cohort study, 189patients underwent an‘optimi-
sation bundle ’assessment which aimed toidentify opportunity to
improve anaemia, smoking andalcohol behaviour, diabetes, hyperten-
sion,existing comorbidities, lowBMI,andphysical activity levels [270] .
Ofthe15patients diagnosed withcancer, eight (53.3 %)underwent
potentially curative surgery, ofwhom seven (87.5 %)required optimi-
sation. None suffered significant therapy-related complications.
Prehabilitation beforeneoadjuvant chemotherapy
Miralpeix etal.conducted aretrospective observational pilotstudy
ofpatients withadvanced ovarian cancer treated withNACT andICS
[271] .Theprehabilitation group received astructured intervention
based onphysical exercise, nutritional counselling, andpsychological
support. Theprehabilitation group hadhigher mean totalprotein levels
inbothpreoperative (7.4vs.6.8,P0.004) andpostoperative (4.9vs.
4.3,P0.005) assessments, withfewer intraoperative complications
(40%vs.14.3 %),andlower requirement ofintraoperative blood
transfusion (14.3 %vs.53.3%,P0.027). Thedayofthefirstambu-
lation, rateofpostoperative complications, andlength ofhospital stay
were similar between thegroups.
Timinganddeliveryofassessment ofprehabilitation optimisation
Fang Huang etal.reported thesuccess ofanAdvanced Practitioner
Registered Nurse-led preoperative assessment andeducation (APAE)
clinic which ranalongside theGynaecological Oncology clinic where
patients withgynaecological cancer were seenatfirstvisitwhen plan-
nedforsurgery. Thisstudy demonstrated clinical impact byinfluencing
patients ’expectations about what theycould anticipate before andafter
surgery andmaking appropriate home carearrangements earlier [272] .
Prehabilitation validated inpatientswithovariancancerandperitoneal
carcinomatosis
Unlike other disciplines inwhich prehabilitation hasbeen well
studied through awell-structured multimodal prehabilitation program,
there arefewstudies published onprehabilitation programs ingynae-
cological surgery, andevenfewer ingynaecological oncology patients
[273] .There have been fewstudies onthebenefit ofprehabilitation
programmes inpatients withovarian cancer undergoing surgery, andso
theevidence islacking.
Prehabilitation andimpactoncompletion oftreatment
Asystematic review ofrandomised trials ofadult patients undergo-
ingchemotherapy, comparing anexercise intervention withstandard
careshowed thataerobic exercise improved, oratleast maintainedE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
83fitness during chemotherapy [274] .Moderately intense exercise, upto
70–80%ofmaximum heart rate,wassafe.Adherence wasgood(median
72%).Exercise improved QoLandphysical functioning, withearlier
return towork.
Twooutoffourstudies reported improved chemotherapy comple-
tionrates. Four outofsixstudies reported reduced chemotherapy
toxicity. There wasnoevidence thatexercise reduced myelosuppression
orimproved response rateorsurvival.
Enhanced recoveryaftersurgery(ERAS)
Prehabilitation andenhanced recovery often overlap andtheterms
areusedinterchangeably. Generally, prehabilitation occurs wellbefore
surgery andenhanced recovery around thetimeofandaftersurgery.
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) isamultidisciplinary, multi-
modal approach tothecareofthesurgical patient [275] .TheERAS
society havepublished guidelines (part 1andpart2)forgynaecologic
oncology surgery in2016 [276,277] andthenupdated guidelines in
2019 [278] .
Enhanced recovery aims toimprove post-operative outcomes and
hasten functional recovery through areduction instress levels by
attenuating themetabolic response tomajor surgery. Itbegins withpre-
operative education andpsychological preparation which hasbeen
shown toimprove post-operative painandnausea, reduce anxiety and
increase patient satisfaction [261,279,280] .OneRCTdemonstrated
written information intheformofapre-operative leaflet wassuperior to
oralinformation [281] although bothisbestpractice.
Bowel preparation priortomajor gynaecologic oncology surgery has
beengiven assuming there isareduction inpost-operative infections and
anastomotic leakfollowing colonic resection, although severalmeta-
analyses from colorectal surgery have notdemonstrated areduction
following mechanical bowel preparation [282,283] .Furthermore, me-
chanical bowel preparation canleadtodehydration andelectrolyte
imbalances thatcanleadtopoorer outcomes andworse patient satis-
faction. However, onemeta-analysis showed acombination oforalan-
tibiotics andmechanical bowel preparation wasassociated withalower
rateofsurgical siteinfection overall (7.2%vs16%,PD0.001) and
incisional siteinfections (4.6%vs12.1%,PD0.001) withcomparable
organ space infections (4%vs4.8%,P0.56) [284] .Although no
randomized controlled trials have compared oralantibiotics alone to
mechanical bowel preparation, several retrospective studies have sug-
gested theantibiotics alone reduce post-operative infections [285,286] .
Other recommendations forenhanced recovery include pre-
operative carbohydrate drinks, avoidance ofhypothermia andhyper-
glycaemia, avoidance ofpre-operative sedative, avoidance ofdrains/
nasogastric tubes, reduction ofopioid analgesics, antimicrobial and
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, regular dietwithin 24h,
removal ofcatheter within 24handearly mobilisation [278,287] .
Data suggest thatERAS pathways canreduce complications by
10–20%andsavemoney [288 –290]butunfortunately implementation
anddissemination canbeslow. Twonewstudies areunderway which
combine prehabilitation andERAS which evaluate patient outcomes to
determine iffurther improvements canbemade forpatients undergoing
complex gynaecologic oncology surgery [261,291] .

Surgicalstaging
Treatment forpresumed early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)
should aimtoremove allvisible tumour deposits. Surgical staging
traditionally hasincluded peritoneal washings, totalabdominal hyster-
ectomy (TAH), BSO, omentectomy, systematic pelvic andpara-aortic
lymphadenectomy andblind peritoneal sampling [292] .
Depending onthehistological grade andsubtype, upto30%of
patients withapparent early-stage EOCwillbeupstaged aftercompre-
hensive surgical staging [293,294] .Aretrospective study of96patients
withgrade 3tumours, andgross disease confined tooneovary, found
that15%hadmicroscopically positive lymph nodes [295] .Inapro-
spective study ofparticipants withovarian cancer, 15/111 participants
(13.5 %)hadlymph nodemetastases, ofwhom 13hadpara-aortic node
involvement (86.6 %)[296] .Lymphadenectomy-related complications
(lymphocyst formation andlymphorrhoea) were found in14.4 %
patients.
Surgical staging mayprovide useful prognostic information andmay
inform subsequent adjuvant treatment, especially withregard toaccessE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
84totargeted agents. Thesurvival benefit offullsurgical staging in
apparent stage Iovarian cancer haslargely beenextrapolated fromdata
from retrospective sub-group analysis ofRCTs performed toassess the
benefit ofadjuvant chemotherapy inearly-stage disease. Intheinitial
sub-group analysis ofthepatients allocated toobservation only, full
surgical staging wasassociated withanimprovement inOSandPFSover
those without lymph node andblind-peritoneal sampling (HR1.75, 95
%CI1.04to2.95; P0.03andHR1.78, 95%CI1.15to2.77; P
0.009, respectively) [297] .Anupdated Cochrane review, often-year
follow-up data, could “neither confirm norexclude survival benefits in
lower riskdisease orinoptimally staged disease ”,andjudged them tobe
ofverylowcertainty [298] .
Aprospective RCTofsystematic lymphadenectomy versus node
sampling, in268participants withEOCclinically confined tothepelvis,
found thatpositive nodes were detected more often inpatients under-
going systematic lymphadenectomy, compared tothose whounderwent
nodesampling (22%vs.9%;P0.007). Theconfidence intervals were
verywide, withverylowcertainty intheresults. Arecent systematic
review oftheroleoflymphadenectomy inEOCfound oneRCTinearly-
stage disease [299,300] .They noted significant biases inthestudy
design, including noassessment forsurgical quality andunilateral
lymphadenectomy wasallowed inunilateral tumours. Mostimportantly,
theprimary endpoint ofthestudy wastheprevalence ofpatients with
positive nodes. Atamedian follow-up of87.8months, theadjusted risks
wereHR0.72forPFS(95%CI0.46to1.21, P0.16) andHR0.85forOS
(95%CI0.49to1.47; P0.56). They concluded that “lymphadenec-
tomy wasnotassociated withimproved OS”[300] .When theRCTwas
combined withdatafromfourretrospective studies, lymphadenectomy
wasnotassociated withimprovement inPFS(HR0.71, 95%CI0.47to
1.07). Combining theRCTandretrospective studies demonstrated in
improvement inOS(HR0.74, 95%CI0.68to0.82, andwithout SEER
study; HR0.64, 95%CI0.42to0.97). However, asonlyonestudy was
anRCT(with littletonodifference inOS),andalloftheretrospective
studies were athighriskofbias, theevidence isveryuncertain. The
authors concluded thattheeffect oflymphadenectomy onsurvival is
unknown and,astheresults oftheLION study [301] inadvanced
ovarian cancer demonstrate thatmicro-metastases should betreated
withchemotherapy, rather thansurgical excision, the“main purpose of
systematic lymphadenectomy istoidentify thepatients whocanavoid
orbenefit fromadjuvant chemotherapy andcould beomitted withim-
provements indiagnostic imaging orwithsentinel lymph node biopsy ”
[300] .Asdiscussed above, eventhose withearly-stage ovarian cancer
maybenefit fromchemotherapy [298] ,andtherefore, given thehigher
rateofshort- andlong-term adverse events withlymphadenectomy, this
maynotbeofbenefit unless knowledge ofoccult nodal involvement
would affect access totargeted agents, suchasPARP inhibitors, socanbe
considered where nodal involvement would change adjuvant treatment
options.
Several studies haveshown thattherateofpositive lymph nodes in
stage Imucinous cancer andlow-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer are
extremely lowandtherefore there isnobenefit tolymph nodesampling
[302 –306].
Diagnostic accuracy ratesforfrozen section analysis (FSA) ofovarian
masses arehighformalignant andbenign ovarian tumours, butlower
forborderline tumours, mucinous tumours andlarger ovarian lesions
[307] .Apooled analysis of14observational retrospective studies
demonstrated sensitivity of99%and94%forbenign andmalignant
tumour, respectively [308] .Thecorresponding false positive ratefor
malignancy was0.23%andthefalsenegative rate1.3%.Thepooled
sensitivity forborderline andbenign ovarian tumours waslower at66%
duetoanincreased incidence offalse-negative results [309] .ACochrane
diagnostic testaccuracy review of38studies included asubset of3953
participants withintraoperative frozen section andeither borderline or
invasive cancer, based onfinal diagnosis ofmalignancy [309] .Ifa
positive testindicates invasive cancer andnegative testindicates either a
borderline orbenign tumour (i.e.lymph node sampling notindicated),sensitivity was90.0%(95%CI87.6%to92.0%)andspecificity was
99.5%(95%CI99.2%to99.7%).Duetotherelatively large sizeand
heterogeneity ofmucinous tumours, FSAisprone tomisdiagnosis and
thisshould beconsidered toprevent under-treatment, although,
mucinous tumours have lowpositive node rates, sodifferentiating be-
tween abenign, borderline orinvasive mucinous tumour islessimpor-
tant[302 –305,307,310] .FSAislessreliable atdetermining tumour
subtype andendometrioid, intestinal mucinous, andclear celltumours
areparticularly prone tofrozen section misdiagnosis [307,310] .
Nevertheless, asFSAisusedforguiding intraoperative management and
finaldiagnosis, andsubsequent management isbased onformalin-fixed,
paraffin embedded samples withimmunohistochemistry, FSAremains
aninvaluable toolfortheidentification ofmalignancy insuspected
early-stage disease, andcanbeusedtolimittheneed forinvasive and
morbid staging procedures.
Confirmation ofmalignancy allows forfullstaging surgery tobe
undertaken atthetimeofthediagnostic laparotomy, according topre-
operative consent, avoiding theneedforsecond dedicated staging pro-
cedures andsubsequent delay inaccess toadjuvant treatment. Optimal
assessment offrozen section histology depends onthefollowing: (1)
clinical information including tumour markers, radiology andintra-
operative findings; (2)careful andthorough gross examination with
judicious selection ofthebestareas forsampling: (3)accurate inter-
pretation offrozen section histology andintraoperative cytology: (4)an
effective andclear communication between surgeon andpathologist.
Discordant results between frozen section andfinaldiagnosis areoften
duetosampling orinterpretation errors [311,308,312 –318].
Afurther challenge tothepathologist liesinthediscrimination be-
tween borderline andmalignant ovarian tumours atfrozen section. In
contrast tothesituation described above, intra-operative diagnosis of
borderline tumour carries ahigher riskofdiscordance withthefinal
histological diagnosis [307,318 –323].DeDecker etal.conducted a
systematic review andmeta-analysis ofeight studies ofborderline tu-
mours andfound that41%ofwomen diagnosed withatleastborderline
onfrozen section were found tohave invasive carcinoma upon final
diagnosis when compared with9.7%ofwomen withastraightforward
borderline frozen section diagnosis [323] .They recommend fullstaging
surgery upfront incases of‘atleastborderline ’toavoid asecond surgical
procedure.
Fertility-sparing surgery
Young women whowish topreserve their fertility, withapparent
early-stage EOC, canbeconsidered forfertility-sparing surgery. This
requires careful counselling about thepotential riskofrecurrent
epithelial ovarian cancer andneedforfurther treatment. Patients with
grade 1or2mucinous, serous, endometrioid, ormixed histology and
FIGO stage IAorstage ICwithunilateral ovarian involvement maybe
considered forunilateral salpingo-oophorectomy incombination with
surgical staging. Inalarge retrospective study, women withG3disease,
orstage IC3withclearcellhistology, hadahigher riskofrecurrence, but
thismainly related tothehigher incidence ofoccult extra-ovarian
spread, rather than toahigher relapse rateinthepreserved ovary
[324] .Therefore, these patients should alsobecarefully informed about
their prognosis, toenable them tomake aninformed choice about
fertility-sparing surgery.
Routineappendicectomy inovariancancer
Appendiceal involvement ineither mucinous borderline orinvasive
ovarian cancer israre, unless there isclinically apparent disease
[305,325] .Inonecaseseries of309women with mucinous ovarian
tumours, 197(64%)werebenign, 68(22%)borderline, and44(14%)
were invasive. Appendicectomy wasperformed in155women; there
wasonly1metastatic lowgrade mucinous appendiceal tumour, andthis
wasinagrossly abnormal appendix. Asystematic review of12non-
randomised studies inborderline mucinous ovarian tumours, included
667patients with borderline ovarian tumours. Appendicectomy wasE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
85performed in232patients andonlytwo(0.86 %)appendiceal carci-
nomas werefound onhistology, bothofwhich wereabnormal clinically
[325] .Inaddition, increasing evidence from national casecontrol
studies suggests theappendix maynotbevestigial andappendicectomy
hasbeen linked toanincreased riskofClostridium difficile infection,
sepsis, andcolorectal cancer [326,327] .Appendicectomy should not
therefore beconsidered asbeing without long-term consequence.

Rationale forcytoreductive surgery. Theaimofsurgery inadvanced EOC
istheremoval ofallvisible disease toleave nomacroscopic residual
disease (NMRD). Several studies have demonstrated aninverse corre-
lation between theamount ofresidual disease andsurvival [328 –332].A
recent Cochrane prognostic review found 46retrospective studies that
mettheirinclusion criteria andexamined results separated bytiming of
surgery (PCRS andICRS) [329] .InPCRS, women withvisible depositsD
1cm(small volume residual disease (SVRD)) hadmore thantwice the
riskofdeath compared towomen withNMRD (HR2.03, 95%CI1.80to
2.29; moderate-certainty evidence) [329] .Thiswassimilar totheICRS-
setting. Women whohadanyamount ofvisible RDafterICRS(SVRD and
large volume RD(LVRD;F1cm)hadmore thantwice theriskofdeath
compared towomen withNMRD (HR2.19, 95%CI1.06to4.52: very

analyses andtheachievement ofNMRD isdependent upon arange of
patient, tumour andsurgical factors andarenotabletotelluswhether
there isnovalue inattempting surgical debulking, ifNMRD ornear-
optimal debulking isnotlikely tobeachieved. Results ofother studies
suggest there isvalue tosurgical intervention even inthese circum-
stances, asdiscussed below.
CRS forEOC includes total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy±removal ofbulky lymph nodes

[333,334] .
Variations insurgery foradvanced EOCtherefore include degree of
radicality employed toachieve NMRD, timing ofsurgery (PCRS versus
ICRSafterNACT), andpatient eligibility forsurgical effort. TheOCAFP
found thatonlyhalf(51%)ofwomen withStage II-IVandunstaged
ovarian cancer received surgery andinfouroutofthe19Cancer Alli-
ances therates were more thantwostandard deviations (SD)below
average [6].
Inaretrospective cohort study of249women treated intwoneigh-
bouring cancer centres inLondon, afteramean follow upperiod of24
months, OSwas37months (95%CI33.17 to40.8months) atcentre A
compared to36.5months atcentre B(95%CI31.8to41.1months; P

atedwithimproved OScompared withchemotherapy alone (HR0.31
(95%CI0.19to0.52) forICRSandHR0.39(95%CI0.22to0.67) for
PCRS), even after adjustment forother prognostic factors. However,
these arenon-randomised data, sorepresent association, notcausation,
anditisunclear towhat extent patient selection mayhaveinthiseffect.
Acohort study from Sweden found thataltering thesurgical para-
digm tomaximal cytoreductive surgery, withsupra-centralisation, did
notconfer anoverall survival benefit tothepopulation presenting with
advanced ovarian cancer intheirregion (HR1.03, 95%CI0.87to1.22;
P0.75) [336] .Thiswasdespite anincrease inachieving NMRD (37%
versus 67%;PD0.001), andanincrease intherateofPCRS withthe
systematic switch tomaximal effort surgery (41versus 62%;P≼0.001).E.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
86However, theirsurgical paradigm included apreference forPCRS anda
significant reduction inrates ofneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)
before interval CRS(ICRS) from34%to4%(PD0.001). Interestingly,
theswitch toaprimary maximal cytoreductive surgical approach was
alsoassociated withan11%decrease insurgically-treated patients (75
%versus 66%;P≼0.001), andconsequently anincrease innon-
surgically treated patients (24%versus 33%;P≼0.001). They
concluded thatanallornothing approach toresidual tumour isnotvalid
andpatient selection forthose whomight benefit from maximal cyto-
reductive surgery mustbeindividualised beyond stage andperformance
status. These findings align withtheHalletal.study [335] .
Aletti etal[337,338] inretrospective cohort studies combining data
from “aggressive ”cancer centres intheUSargue thattwofactors, age
andco-morbidities, asmeasured byeither performance status orASA
grade, areassociated with adverse outcomes themore complex the
surgery being undertaken, asmeasured bySurgical Complexity Score
(SCS) [337,338] .Thissystem assigns points toindividual procedures to
determine anoverall degree ofsurgical extent (seeTable 7andTable 8
fordetails). Anoverall SCSof≼3,≽4-7or8aligns withlow,interme-
diate andhighcomplexity surgery, respectively. Pre-op albumin levels
lessthan35g/L,ASAgrade 3/4andsurgical complexity were allposi-
tively correlated with 30-day post-operative mortality. Three-month
post-operative mortality waspositively correlated with ageandASA
status [337,338] .
SOCQER2 wasaprospective, multi-national observational study,
which reported quality oflifescores for247women withstage IIIorIV
ovarian cancer undergoing surgery defined asoflow,intermediate or
high complexity, asmeasured according totheSCSclassification
[334,337,338] .There were noclinically orstatistically meaningful dif-
ferences inquality-of-life (QoL) score at6week, 6months and12
months regardless ofthethree grades ofsurgical complexity. There were
small statistically significant improvements inQoLovertimeinallpa-
tients, regardless ofSCS.Physical andemotional function werelower in
thegroup ofwomen withhighSCSat6weeks post-surgery, butby12
months there were nodifferences between each ofthethree groups.
Further population-level datafrom centres involved intheSOCQER2
study, including allthose with Stage III-IV orandunstaged disease,
demonstrated adifference inoverall survival between those centres that
hadlowSCS,versus those withhighSCS(median OSlowSCS17.9
months (95%CI15.7to20.1) versus highSCS23.1months (95%CI
19.0to27.2); P0.043) [339] .Median OSinintermediate SCS(Int
SCS)was22.0months (95%CI17.6to26.3) anddidnotdiffer signif-
icantly from high SCScentres. Treatment inalowSCScentre was
associated withahigher riskofdeath thanahighSCS(HRof1.21(95%
CI1.03to1.40)) when adjusted forageanddeprivation. Interestingly,
combined surgery andchemotherapy rates were 39.2%versus 51.8%
versus 38.3%inlowSCS,IntSCSandhighSCScentres, respectively (P
D0.0001). Thisdifference intreatment wasattributed todifferences in
rates ofsurgical treatment (surgery rates 43.2%versus 58.4%versus
60.9%inlowSCS,IntSCSandhighSCScentres, respectively (PD
0.001). Itistherefore difficult todetermine whether thedegree ofrad-
icality orrateofsurgery isthemostimportant, orwhether lowSCSisa
marker oflower overall quality ofcareandwillingness tooffersurgical
treatment; datafromtheOCAFP suggest thatratesofsurgical treatment
areassociated with survival outcomes [6].NICE guidance onhigh

Lymphadenectomy inadvanced EOC. TheLION study randomised 647
women with stage IIb-IV EOC intra-operatively toeither systematic
lymphadenectomy ornolymphadenectomy afterallother visible disease
hadbeen removed andlymph nodes were found tobenotclinically
enlarged [301] .There wasnosurvival benefit conferred (PFSorOS)to
women whounderwent systematic lymphadenectomy, despite micro-
scopic lymph nodemetastases being present in55.7%ofthepatients inthelymphadenectomy group. Women inthelymphadenectomy group
hadmore repeat laparotomies forcomplications (12.4 %versus 6.5%;P
0.01) andanincrease in60-day mortality (3.1%versus 0.9%;P
0.049). Addition ofsystematic lymphadenectomy increased peri-opera-
tivecomplications (duration ofsurgery (340minsversus 280mins; PD
0.001), median blood loss(650 mlversus 500ml;PD0.001), and
requirement forblood transfusion (63.7 %versus 56%;P0.005);
increased admission ratestoanintermediate orintensive careunit(77.6
%versus 69%;P0.01)). Anobservational study of381patients found
nobenefit tosystemic lymphaedenctomy inpatients withrarer epithe-
lialhistological subtypes (OS,HR0.96, 95%CI0.69to1.35) [341] .
Inasystematic review, 82%ofenlarged cardiophrenic nodes were
involved withmetastatic disease, andareassociated withpoorer sur-
vival outcomes (PFS, HR2.14, 95%CI1.82to2.52) [342] .However,
non-randomised evidence isinconclusive anddoesnotdemonstrate any
significant impact onsurvival inthose whohave cardiophrenic lymph
node resection [342 –345].

ofEOC should becombination treatment with surgery andchemo-
therapy toachieve NMRD, some patients maydobetter withsurgery

Anupdated Cochrane systematic meta-analysis offour RCTs
[268,346 –349],comparing PCRS (alsoreferred toasupfront debulking
orprimary debulking surgery) followed byadjuvant chemotherapy with
NACT before ICRS inadvanced EOC(Stage III-IV), found little tono
difference interms ofOS(HR0.96, 95%CI0.86to1.08; high-certainty
evidence) orPFS(HR0.98, 95%CI0.88to1.08; moderate-certainty
evidence) [350] .Inaddition, NACT likely decreased peri-operative
mortality (0.6%inNACT group, versus 3.6%inPCRS group (riskratio
(RR)0.16, 95%CI0.06to0.46; high-certainty evidence), andtheriskof
grade≽3serious adverse events (RR0.22, 95%CI0.13 to0.38;
moderate-certainty evidence). NACT probably hadalarge reduction in
theneedforastoma (5.9%versus 20.4; RR0.29, 95%CI0.12to0.74;
moderate-certainty evidence), andprobably reduced theriskofbowel
resection atthetimeofCRS(13.0 %versus 26.6%;RR0.49, 95%CI
0.30to0.79; moderate-certainty evidence) [350] .
Arecent retrospective North American cohort study, ofover39,000
women, compared those treated incentres witheither low(22.5 %of
patients) orhighuseofNACT (42.2 %)aftertheresults ofthefirstRCT
demonstrating non-inferiority ofNACT in2010 [349,351] .HighNACT-
usecentres, compared tothose thatdidnotchange practice from
routinely offering PCRS, hadgreater improvements inOS(6.3-month
improvement, 95%CI4.2to8.3months), aswellas6-month (2.3%,
95%CI3.2to1.3%)and12-month mortality (2.1%,95%CI3.7
%to0.5%).TheFalconer study results alsosuggest thatreducing
NACT/ICRS ratestoofar,maybedetrimental [336] .
Thisremains ahighly contentious area, andtheapplicability ofthe
previous RCTs, tomore modern surgical approaches, iscontested [352] .
While itisevident thatpatients withextensive andinoperable disease
patterns, those withhighfrailty/ poorperformance status orsignificant
comorbidities willbenefit from NACT; thequestion regarding the
oncologic non-inferiority ofNACinfitandotherwise healthy patients
withoperable disease isthesubject ofcurrently ongoing clinical trials

suitably fitpatients [355] .Patients with seemingly operable disease
should beoffered therisksandbenefits ofbothapproaches, sothatthey
canmake aninformed decision about their treatment pathways. Deci-
sionaids,based onpredictive factors, mayhelpwithshared decision-
making [356] .E.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
87Delayedprimarysurgery/timing ofICRS. AspertheNational Compre-
hensive Cancer Network guidelines, ICRS after three tofourcycles is
preferred [153] .However, ifpatients aren ’tfitenough toconsider sur-
geryatthree cycles, anddelay maybeinthepatient ’sbestinterest (e.g.,
acute venous thrombolic event), surgery maybereconsidered afterfour
tosixcycles. Studies comparing different timings ofICRS areongoing
[357] .
Second-attempt atcytoreductive surgeryinfirst-linetreatment. The1995
EORTC trial,byvanderBurgetal.randomised 319patients tofurther
surgery versus nofurther surgery afterthree cycles ofplatinum-based
chemotherapy afterinitial surgery byanon-gynaecological oncologist
ordiagnostic surgery only [358,359] .ACochrane review, which
included thisandtwoother RCTs, found thatrepeat CRSinfirst-line
treatment lengthened PFSandOSonly inthose whohadnothad
maximal surgical effort atinitial surgery byasubspecialist gynaeco-
logical oncologist; theriskofdeath wasreduced byonethird inthis
subgroup (HR0.68, 95%CI0.53to0.87) [360] .However, those who
hadhadLVRD following initial CRS,despite maximal surgical effort, did
notbenefit fromarepeat cytoreductive surgical procedure inthefirst-
linetreatment setting.
Governance. When maximal cytoreductive surgery isundertaken it
should onlybeundertaken incentres witharegular practice ofthistype
ofsurgery withappropriate governance, andaudit oftheservice pro-
vision should takeplace [361] .Twomodels ofdelivery ofmaximum
cytoreduction surgery existwithonemodel where thegynaecological
oncologists perform allmaximum cytoreduction surgery procedures and
theother whether thegynaecological oncologist delivers thisasthe
leader ofamulti-surgeon team; bothmodels aresafe[362,363] .Asper
thejointstatement ofTheAssociation ofColoproctology ofGreat Britain
andIreland (ACPGBI), Association ofSurgeons ofGreat Britain and
Ireland (ASGBI), Association ofUpper Gastrointestinal Surgery ofGreat
Britain andIreland (AUGIS) andBGCS, collaboration between surgeons
ofappropriate expertise, suchascolorectal, upper gastrointestinal (GI)
andhepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB), should beformally recognised in
jobplans, andattendance ofother specialities should ideally beplanned
inadvance [364] .Thisjoint statement recommends thatthespecific

Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy hasbeen shown tosignifi-
cantly prolong overall survival (OS)andprogression freesurvival (PFS)
inwomen with early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) intwo
randomised, prospective trials, theACTION andICON1 trials. These
trials included early-stage patients withgrade 2/3stage IA/B andall
stage IC/IIA. Theprimary analysis ofICON1, withamedian follow-up of
four-years, demonstrated asignificant improvement inbothrelapse-free
survival (RFS) (HR0.65, 95%CI0.46to0.91, P0.01) andOS(HR
0.66, 95%CI0.45to0.97; P0.03) infavour ofadjuvant chemo-
therapy withsixcycles ofsingle agent carboplatin (AUC 5/6)[366] .
Similar findings werereported intheACTION trialinwhich themajority
ofpatients received platinum-based combination chemotherapy [367] .
Recent ESGO guidelines recommend sixcycles ofcarboplatin-paclitaxel
chemotherapy, orcarboplatin alone, forthose withstage I-IIBHGSC and
high-grade epithelial cancer [292] .
ACochrane meta-analysis offivelarge prospective clinical trials
concluded thatchemotherapy ismore beneficial thanobservation in
patients withearly stage ovarian cancer [368] .Patients whoreceived
platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy hadabetter OS(HR0.71, 95%
CI0.53to0.93] andPFS(HR0.67, 95%CI0.53to0.84) thanpatients
whodidnotreceive adjuvant treatment. However, approximately two
thirds ofthecases were sub-optimally staged and30%ofwomen with
presumed stage Idisease mayhavehadundetected stage IIIdisease, and
itmaybethatchemotherapy compensated foralackofcomplete sur-
gical staging. ACochrane analysis of10-year datafrom ACTION and
ICON1 suggested thatthedifference between optimally andsub-
optimally staged subgroups, interms ofdeaths from ovarian cancer,
wasnotsignificant (Test forsubgroup differences: Chi2test2.75, df
1,P0.10). Benefit forchemotherapy, even inoptimally staged pa-
tients, could notbeexcluded. Adjuvant chemotherapy should therefore
bediscussed withallpatients withhigh-risk, early-stage ovarian cancer
[298] .
Histological subtype maydetermine benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy. Theresponse ratetochemotherapy inpatients withnon-serous
epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including clear cellandmucinous tu-
mours, ispoorandtheeffectiveness ofadjuvant chemotherapy inearly-
stage disease inthese groups maybelessthanhigh-grade serous cancers.

therapy inearly-stage disease (stage IAtoIC1)[370] ;andinexpansile or
grade Iinfiltrative mucinous cancer adjuvant chemotherapy could be
avoided duetotheirexcellent outcomes fromsurgery alone [371] .
Patients with early-stage disease requiring chemotherapy, canbe
considered foreither platinum alone orcombination therapy withcar-
boplatin andpaclitaxel [372] .Thestandard recommendation isfor6
cycles ofplatinum-based chemotherapy. Shorter regimens ofthree cy-
clesofcarboplatin andpaclitaxel chemotherapy maybeappropriate for

PARPinhibitor maintenance therapyafterfirst-line chemotherapy. Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) exploit theDNA
repair vulnerabilities ofovarian cancer cellsduetodeficient homolo-
gous recombination repair (HRR) pathways. Hereditary mutations in
BRCA 1/2genes (BRCA mut) arepresent inapproximately 20%ofpa-
tients. Inaddition tissueBRCA mut,mutations ingenes suchasRAD51C,
RAD51D ,andPALB2 ,epigenetic silencing viahypermethylation of
BRCA1 promoter anddeficiency inother proteins andHRpathways lead
todeficient HRRinupto50%ofhighgrade serous ovarian cancers [32].
Inpatients with stage III–IVhigh-grade ovarian cancer, PARPi are
routinely considered asmaintenance treatment following chemo-
therapy. Thestudies havedemonstrated aspectrum ofbenefit based on
theBRCA mutandhomologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status
ofpatients. PARPi currently licensed intheUKinclude: olaparib in
women withBRCA mutcancer; andniraparib inwomen regardless of
theirBRCA mut/HRD status. Inaddition, rucaparib wasgranted afirst-
linemaintenance licence bytheUK’sMedicines andHealthcare prod-
uctsRegulatory Agency (MHRA) on15January 2024.
TheSOLO1 trial[392] evaluated theroleof2years ofmaintenance

benefit intheriskofrelapse ordeath (HR0.3,CI95%0.23to0.41) in
thewomen treated witholaparib compared toplacebo. Mature results
afteralonger follow-up haveconfirmed asustained benefit with48%of

withhigher-risk highgrade EOCregardless oftheirBRCA mutstatus.
There wasanimprovement inPFSintheoverall patient population

inwomen withHRdeficient disease.
Arecent Cochrane review included 15studies ofPARPi inEOC(6109
participants); four(3070 participants) withnewly-diagnosed, advanced
EOCand11(3039 participants) withrecurrent EOC[396] .Most par-
ticipants hadBRCA mutations, either intheirtumour (sBRCA mut)and/
orgermline (gBRCA mut), ortumour HRD. Twostudies compared PARPi
maintenance with placebo after first-line chemotherapy inEOC. The
datademonstrated thatPARPi mayincrease PFS(HR0.42, 95%CI0.19
to0.92; low-certainty evidence), butthere maybeanincrease intherisk
ofexperiencing anygrade≽3adverse events (PARPi (54%)versus
placebo (19%)(RR 2.87, 95%CI1.65to4.99; verylow-certainty evi-
dence. There isprobably aslight reduction inQoLwithPARPi, although
thismaynotbeclinically significant (MD3.00, 95%CI4.48 to
1.52; moderate-certainty evidence). TheCochrane review found that
PARPi probably resulted inlittle tonodifference inOS(twostudies,
1124 participants; HR0.81, 95%CI0.59to1.13; moderate-certainty
evidence) (alive at12months 68%withPARPi versus 62%forpla-
cebo). More mature OSdataforolaparib have become available since
theCochrane review waspublished, demonstrating improved OSinthe
PARPi arm(HR0.55, 95%CI0.40to0.76; P0.0004) [397] ,although
these datadidnotmeettheprespecified criteria forsignificance. There is
aconcern thatPARPi mayincrease theriskofsecondary cancers,
especially myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/
AML) fromobservational studies [398] .Thelonger termSOLO1 data(7-
yearfollow-up) found four(1.5%)cases ofMDS/AML intheolaparib
group andone(0.8%)intheplacebo group. Newprimary cancers were
reported in14(5.4%)participants intheolaparib armversus andeight
(6.2%)intheplacebo arm[397] .However, relatively small single RCTs
areunlikely tobethebesttrialdesign todetermine relatively rare
harms. Ameta-analysis ofRCTs ofPARPi foravariety ofcancers found
18placebo-controlled RCTs (n7307 patients) withadverse event data
[398] .Theirmeta-analysis concluded thatPARP inhibitors significantly
increased theriskofMDS/AML compared withplacebo treatment (OR
2.63, 95%CI1.13 –6.14; P0.026). Potential adverse events andpo-
tential fornegative effects onQoLtherefore should bediscussed with
andbalanced against benefits onOSandPFS.

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)couldbe

Direct administration ofchemotherapy within theperitoneal cavity
results inasignificant increase intumour exposure tohighconcentra-
tions ofcytotoxic drugs compared tothei.v.route (toarelatively
shallow depth oftumour nodule penetration), while reducing systemic
side-effects [399 –401].Several randomised trials found thattheuseof
intraperitoneal (i.p.) cisplatin following primary cytoreductive surgery
foradvanced ovarian cancer wasassociated withlonger OS[402 –404].
Ameta-analysis ofthedatafromrandomised trials found thatuseofi.p.
chemotherapy improved PFS(HR0.78, 95%CI0.70to0.86) andOS
(HR0.81, 95%CI0.72to0.90) compared withi.v.chemotherapy [405]andanothermeta-analysis offiveRCTs showed OSandPFSbenefit in
patients withNMRD/SVRD aftersurgery [406] .
However, asubsequent RCT (GOG252) comparing dose-dense
weekly paclitaxel andcarboplatin with twoi.p.regimens, where all
three arms received bevacizumab, showed nodifference inPFSorOS
between i.v.andi.p.chemotherapy [407,408] .Patients receiving i.p.
chemotherapy aremore likely toexperience morbidity frominfections,
catheter-related painandgastrointestinal toxicity [405] .Intraperitoneal
(i.p)administration ofchemotherapy istherefore notcurrently recom-
mended outside ofclinical trials duetothenegative results ofthe
GOG252 [407] .
Hyperthermic i.p.chemotherapy (HIPEC) involves administration of
asingle treatment ofheated chemotherapy atthetimeofcompletion of
cytoreductive surgery. HIPEC hasbeenevaluated inthefirst-line setting
inthephase IIIOVHIPEC trialthatevaluated theroleofHIPEC (cisplatin
100mg/m2)aftersurgery forpatients withstage IIIovarian cancer who
inwhom cytoreduction tolessthan10mmresidual disease following
three cycles ofNACT wasthought feasible [409] .Patients undergoing
surgery plusHIPEC hadimprovements inPFS(HR0.66, 95%CI0.50to
0.87; P0.003; 14.2months versus 10.7months, respectively) andOS
(HR0.67, 95%CI0.48to0.94; P0.02; 45.7months versus 33.9
months, respectively) compared tothose whohadsurgery only. There
wasnodifference between thetwogroups inthepercentage ofpatients
experiencing grade≽3adverse events, although median length ofsur-
gerywassignificantly increased (surgery alone192min(interquartile
range (IQR), 153to251min); surgeryHIPEC338min(IQR299to
426min). Inasecond RCT,women withstage IIIandIVovarian cancer
whohadatmost SVRD after PCRS orICRS, were assigned toreceive
either HIPEC withcisplatin atadoseof75mg/m2ornointervention
(control group) [410] .There wasnodifference inmedian PFS(19.8
months versus 18.8months, respectively) andOS(69.5 months versus
61.3months, respectively) between women receiving HIPEC andthe
control group. Inthesubgroup ofwomen thatunderwent ICRS,
administration ofHIPEC wasassociated withanimprovement inPFS
(17.4 months versus 15.4months, respectively) andOS(61.8 months
versus 48.2months, respectively) compared tothecontrol group.
HIPEC isnotcurrently regarded asastandard first-line therapy op-
tionatthetimeofPCRS andtheresults ofongoing trials areawaited
[292,411] .NICE guidelines support controlled useofHIPEC atICRS,
recognising the “frequent andserious butwell-recognised complica-
tions ”and “vidence onitsefficacy islimited inquality ”.They recom-
mend HIPEC “should onlybeusedwithspecial arrangements forclinical
governance, consent, andaudit orresearch ”[412] .Further recom-
mendations arethatitshould belimited to“highly specialised centres by
clinicians withspecialist expertise andspecific training in[CRS] and
[HIPEC] ”.National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines fromthe
USAstatethat “HIPEC withcisplatin (100mg/m2)canbeconsidered ”at
ICRSforthose withstage IIIdisease [153] .ThejointEuropean Society of
Gynaecological Oncology (EGGO), European Society forMedical
Oncology (ESMO) andEuropean Society ofPathology consensus
guidelines were unable tocome toaconsensus ontheuseofHIPEC
during ICRS[355] .
Thevalue ofHIPEC inrelapsed ovarian cancer hasbeenassessed in
anRCTandHIPEC with carboplatin waswelltolerated, butdidnot
improve survival [413] .Thisstudy doesnotsupport theuseofHIPEC
withcarboplatin during secondary cytoreductive surgery forplatinum-
sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer andforthatreason HIPEC isnot
partoftheinternational treatment guidelines forrelapsed disease [292] .

temicpostoperative treatment.(GradeA)
Theroleofsurgery atrelapse haslongbeen under debate. Retro-
spective datademonstrated thatachieving NMRD atSCRS wasassoci-
atedwithimproved OSandPFS[414,415] .However, itwasunclear
whether thiswascorrelation orcausation andwhether thiswasdueto
NMRD being associated withfavourable tumour biology. Ameta-anal-
ysis[416] of36studies from 80,largely retrospective andsingle-arm,
included studies demonstrated that surgery was correlated with
improvement inOSinparticipants with platinum-sensitive relapse.
Heterogeneity between thestudies washigh, reflecting thediffering
designs andpatients included inthestudies.
However, three prospective RCTs (GOG 213[417] ,SOC-1 [418] ,and
DESKTOP III[419] )assessed thevalue ofSCRS, comparing chemo-
therapy alone versus surgery andchemotherapy. These studies enrolled
highly selected patients, with varying criteria, sotheresults arenot
applicable toallthose withrelapsed disease [420] .Thedevelopment of
validtoolsandalgorithms toaccurately predict operability isessential to
avoid unnecessary morbidity andmortality. TheEuropean/British
DESKTOP IIItrialbased selected participants based ontheAGO-score,
based on:performance status; residual disease atprimary surgery; and
presence ofascites atrelapse [421,422] .TheSOC-1 study usedthei-
model forparticipant selection, which combines FIGO stage, residual
disease atprimary debulking, length ofplatinum-free interval, ECOG
performance status, CA125 levelatrecurrence, andpresence ofascites
[418,419] .GOG213 study didnothave selection criteria fortheiden-
tification oftheideal surgical candidates andselection wasbased each
investigator believing thatdisease wasoperable [417] ,although the
inclusion ofpatients withperitoneal carcinomatosis wasdiscouraged.
Only 5%oftheGOG213 patients hadperitoneal carcinosis, asignifi-
cantly lower number compared totheother twostudies (~40 %)
[417 –419].
TheGOG213 andtheDESKTOP IIIstudy demonstrated opposing
results. InDESKTOP III,themedian OSwas53.7months inthesurgery/
chemotherapy group and46.0months inthechemotherapy-only group
(HR0.75, 95%CI0.59to0.96; P0.02). Patients inwhom NMRD was
achieved after SCRS hadamedian OSof61.9months. Quality-of-life
measures didnotdiffer between thetwogroups [419] .
Incontrast, GOG213 didnotdemonstrate animprovement inOS(HR
1.29, 95%CI0.97to1.72; P0.08) withamedian OSof50.6months
(surgery/chemotherapy) and 64.7 months (chemotherapy only),
respectively [417] .Thiswastrueevenforthesubgroup inwhom NMRD
wasachieved. PFSwasalsonotimproved significantly (HR0.82, 95%
CI,0.66to1.01) with median PFSof18.9months (surgery/chemo-
therapy) and16.2months (chemotherapy only), respectively). Impor-
tantly, therateofsurgical morbidity was9%,andoneof240(0.4%)
participants inthesurgery armdiedfrompostoperative complications.
After aperiod ofrecovery fromSCRS, there wasnosignificant decrease
inquality-of-life outcomes.
Mature OSdatafromtheSOC-1 study areawaited [418] ,although
interim OSdatademonstrated median OSof58⋅1months (95%CInot
estimable) inthesurgery armand53⋅9months (95%CI42⋅2to65⋅5)in
thenosurgery arm(HR0⋅82,95%CI0⋅57to1⋅19)[418] .Nineofthe
172participants (5%)hadgrade 3–4surgical morbidity by30dayspost-
surgery, withnodeaths by60dayspost-surgery ineither group. Eleven
of175participants (6%)inthenosurgery armhadSCRS during second-
linetreatment, and48of130participants (37%)whohaddisease
progression hadsurgery atasubsequent recurrence.
Ameta-analysis ofpatients inthese studies found thatsecondary
cytoreductive surgery, resulting inNMRD, prolongs OSinplatinum-
sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer withthemedian OStimeincreasedby9%and7%when theNMRD andSVRD proportion increased by10
%,respectively, after adjusting forother variables, although achieve-
ment ofNMRD ispost-treatment prognostic indicator [416] .Thedif-
ferences between thestudies emphasise theneed forrobust selection
algorithms andstratification criteria atrelapse toidentify those most
likely tobenefit fromSCRS. Ofnote, PETCTwasnotroutinely usedto
determine operability, relying onconventional imaging, suchasCTor
MRI[417] .
Themajor challenge ishowtoincorporate surgical effort atrelapse
withallnovel systemic approaches. Many studies thataddress thevalue
ofSCRS havebeenpriortotheroutine useofanti-angiogenic agents and
PARP-inhibitors, although maintenance bevacizumab wasgiven to84%
oftheparticipants inGOG213. InGOG213 those whoreceived bev-
acizumab hadsimilar survival inthesurgery/no surgery groups,
whereas those whohadsurgery andopted nottohavebevacizumab had
reduced OScompared tothose receiving chemotherapy alone [417] .

There arenoprospective datatoassess thevalue oftertiary CRSfor

multicentre andmonocentric analyses haveshown thatachievement of

[423 –429].However, these dataareretrospective, atcritical riskofbias,
based onpost-surgical, posthocsubgroup analyses, andhavenodirect
comparison tochemotherapy alone. Thelargest retrospective study for
tertiary debulking evaluating 406patients from multinational centres,
demonstrated thateven inthetertiary setting achievement ofNMRD
wasassociated withimproved OSandPFS[430] .Presence ofperitoneal
carcinomatosis didnotretain anyprognostic significance aftercontrol-
lingforresidual disease status, although itshould berecognised that
residual disease isanoutcome ofsurgery andnotapre-surgical prog-
nostic indicator. Postoperative systemic chemotherapy wasassociated
withasignificant improvement inOS,emphasizing theimportance of
combination modality treatment intheadvanced setting. Thechallenge
withalltheabove trials isthattheyareallretrospective andhave no
control armofnosurgery, involving alltheinherited biasofsuch
studies.
Afollow upstudy ofparticipants whowere randomized tothe
chemotherapy-only armoftheDESKTOP IIItriallooked atoutcomes of
32of171participants whounderwent cytoreductive surgery atasub-
sequent relapse [431] .NMRD wasachieved in19participants (60%);
fivehadSVRD orLVRD andforeight patients, datawere missing.
Interestingly, only16(50%)started chemotherapy within 90daysof
surgery. Median OSwas54.0months (95%CI39.8tonotestimable) and
one-andtwo-year OSrateswere91%(95%CI81%to100%)and84%
(95%CI72%to98%),respectively. Thissuggesting thatCRSin
selected patients atthird relapse canbeconsidered inhighly selected

Patients with relapsed EOCfrequently present with symptoms of
acute orsub-acute bowel obstruction atrelapse, often attributable toE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
91diffuse peritoneal dissemination ofrecurrent tumour, rather than a
single point ofobstruction. Theimplementation ofnovel targeted ther-
apies withanti-angiogenic potential mayfavour fistula formation, or
intestinal perforation, andsorecurrent EOC, withthepotential tobe
complicated bysuchsevere andacute events, constitutes atherapeutic
dilemma [432] .Asystematic review identified noRCTs comparing
surgical andmedical management, andevidence thatshowed abenefit
tosurgery overoctreotide wasoflowquality [433] .Inaretrospective
study of90patients withbowel obstruction duetorelapsed EOC, suc-
cessful palliation (adequate oralintake atleast60dayspostoperative)
wasachieved intwothirds, andabsence ofascites wasapredictor for
successful palliation (p0.049) [434] .Themedian overall survival
(OS)was90.5days(range,D1dayto6years). Neither elective versus
emergency surgery, platinum-sensitivity norachievement ofoptimal
debulking (SVRD orNMRD) predicted OSorsuccessful palliation from
surgery (pF0.05). Anyperceived benefits should becarefully balanced
against therisks foreach individual patient andfactors, such asco-
morbidities, baseline quality oflife,previous response tochemo-
therapy, length oftreatment intervals, subsequent systemic options, and
patient wishes, arelikely tobecrucial. Themanagement ofthese cases
should beledbyspecialist gynaecological multidisciplinary teams,
including palliative careinput atanearly stage. Ifsurgery isplanned,
intra-operative input from gynaecological oncologists isimportant,
since theycanevaluate theentire journey ofthepatient andhowthis
impacts intraoperative decisions.
Endoscopic techniques, suchasplacement ofintestinal stents and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, may allow thepalliation of
gastrointestinal symptoms withreduced procedure-related morbidity in
selected patients.
Surgical intervention should berestricted tocases where there isa
distal mechanical bowel obstruction andwhere theformation ofa
proximal highoutput small bowel stoma isnotlikely tobenecessary, as
suchhighoutput stomas significantly reduce quality oflifeandrequire
permanent total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pre-operative imaging
demonstrating themostproximal point ofbowel obstruction should be
usedtoidentify patients withalevelofobstruction athighriskofiat-
rogenic short bowel syndrome.
Incases where surgical intervention isnotlikely torelieve bowel
obstruction, further chemotherapy, typically asaninpatient, canbe
considered ifthepatient has(partially) platinum sensitive disease. This
canbesupported withi.v.nutrition forthree tosixweeks, afterwhich
resolution ofongoing bowel obstruction isnolonger likely. Management
ofpatients withbowel obstruction should ideally happen within multi-
disciplinary teams withexperience inmanaging suchcases [435] .

Theconventional definition of‘platinum sensitivity ’isaPFIofgreater
thansixmonths aftercessation ofthelastplatinum-based chemotherapycourse, andwasbased onthelikelihood ofdisease response toplatinum
re-treatment inolder studies [375,436] .However, inaneraofmore
accurate imaging techniques andmaintenance regimens, thedefinition
ofplatinum sensitivity ismore complex andintheabsence ofvalidated
predictive biomarkers, should belessrigidfordetermining thenextline

While theduration ofresponse toplatinum isimportant, retrospec-
tivedataalsosuggest thatseeking toextend theplatinum-free interval
itself mayalsohelpimprove thepatient ’ssubsequent response toplat-
inum re-treatment andthere arenowseveral studies supporting this
concept [438,439] .
Platinum-sensitive relapsedEOC. Inpatients withplatinum-sensitive (PS)
orpartially platinum-sensitive (pPS) EOCrecurrence (6–12months PFI)
published clinical evidence reports response ratestosecond-line therapy
ranging between 27%and33%,regardless ofwhether platinum-based

Theaddition ofbevacizumab tochemotherapy forwomen withPS

withcombination carboplatin/gemcitabine alone [377,444] .However,
noOSadvantage hasbeendemonstrated asyet,possibly duetoahigh

bevacizumab isnotroutinely funded inthissetting intheUK.Arecent

notrequiring arapid response tochemotherapy, thenhormonal treat-
ment could beanalternative, although evidence forbenefit islimited
[462,463] .Palliative radiotherapy mayhave aroleinhighly selected
situations (seebelow).
Radiotherapy forEOC
Recommendations
Thereisnoroleforwholeabdominalradiotherapy asadjuvant/
consolidation treatmentofEOC.(GradeA)
Definitivetreatmentusingintensity-modulated radiotherapy or
stereotactic radiotherapy maybeconsidered forloco-regional
recurrence oroligometastatic diseasewheresurgeryisnotanop-
tion.(GradeD)
Palliativeradiotherapy shouldbeconsidered forsymptomatic
diseaseincludingvaginalbleeding,localisedpainandbrainme-
tastases.(GradeD)
Prior toplatinum-based chemotherapy, whole abdominal radio-
therapy (WAR) wasused asadjuvant orconsolidation treatment
following surgery forEOC. However, thetoxicity ofWAR andthe
development ofnewsystemic therapies have limited theuseofradio-
therapy inthissituation. Nowadays theroleofradiotherapy inEOCis
largely restricted tothetreatment ofselected patients withlocalised or
oligometastatic recurrent disease andpatients requiring palliation of
specific symptoms where surgical resection isnotanoption. Forrecur-
rent EOC, theindications fordefinitive radiotherapy have been
expanded byadvanced radiotherapy techniques such asintensity
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) andstereotactic radiotherapy.
Adjuvant orconsolidation radiotherapy
Whole abdomino-pelvic radiotherapy wasreplaced byadjuvant
chemotherapy duetothehigher toxicity profile with radiotherapy,
although survival outcomes were similar [464 –466];intheSwedish-
Norwegian Ovarian Cancer Study Group 10%ofpatients receiving
radiotherapy hadsevere lateintestinal radiation reactions [465] .
There maybeanoption foradjuvant pelvic radiotherapy when pa-
tients areunable toreceive chemotherapy, orforhistological subtypes
forwhich adjuvant chemotherapy islesseffective.

Theroleofadjuvant radiotherapy forclear cellcarcinoma remains
uncertain, butitmaybeofbenefit forselected patients withStage ICand
Stage IIdisease. Retrospective analysis oflarge cohort studies with
whole abdominal pelvic radiotherapy have reported improved overall
anddisease-free survival compared tochemotherapy-only groups
[467,468] .
Inamore recent retrospective study of163patients withstage Iand
IIclear cellcarcinoma, adjuvant radiotherapy wasnotsignificantly
associated withincreased progression-free oroverall survival, although
there mayhave been more treatment selection based onpatient risk
factors inthislaterstudy [469] .
Smallcelloftheovaryofhypercalcaemic type
Theprognosis forpatients with small celloftheovary ofhyper-
calcaemic typeispoor, andmulti-modality treatment isrecommended.
InaGCIG cohort study of17patients, themajority oflong-term survi-
vors received whole abdominal-pelvic orpelvic radiotherapy. This
included fiveofthesixpatients withstage onedisease whoreceived
radiotherapy achieving longtermcontrol, compared toonlyoneoffour
whodidnotreceive radiotherapy [470] .Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy
maybeconsidered forovarian small cellcarcinoma ofhypercalcaemic
typeandforselected patients when systemic therapy isnotfeasible or
lesseffective.
Radiotherapy forrecurrent disease
Although chemotherapy isthemainstay oftreatment forrecurrent
ovarian cancer, patients with limited recurrent disease mayachieve
long-term disease control withradiotherapy where surgery isnotan
option. Newer targeted radiotherapy approaches including intensity
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) andstereotactic radiotherapy can
achieve ahigher radiotherapy dosetothetarget volume whilst sparing
organs atriskcompared tomore conventional radiotherapy techniques.
There arenopublished randomised trials comparing radiotherapy to
chemotherapy inrecurrent ovarian cancer [471 –475].
Involvedfieldradiotherapy
Radical radiotherapy maybeaneffective treatment forlocalised
disease, withbetter outcomes reported inselected patients withsmall
volume pelvic ornodal recurrence, platinum-sensitive disease andgood
performance status, although data arelimited tonon-randomised
studies [471,472,476] .Fujiwara etal.prospectively evaluated theef-
fectsoflocalradiation therapy onpatients withrelapsed ovarian cancer
afteramedian oftwoprevious chemotherapy treatment. Thepatients
received 52.3/-8.3Gy.Theauthors observed thatsmaller lesions and
lymph nodes demonstrated thebestresponses, andtheyconcluded that
local radiation therapy maybeatreatment option forrelapsed orre-
fractory butlocalised ovarian cancer, particularly when thetumour is
small and/or located inthelymph nodes [473] .
Two groups assessed predictive factors ofdisease control with
radiotherapy forlocalised disease; oneof33patients andfound that
cytoreductive surgery prior toradiotherapy wasassociated with
recurrence-free survival, whereas BRCA1 status andbeing ofAfrican
American racewere negatively correlated with local control [474] .
Another study, of48patients found noprognostic factors onmultivar-
iateanalysis, however univariate analysis showed tumour sizeofless
than3cmandobjective tumour response were associated withoverall
anddisease-free survival [475] .
Stereotactic radiotherapy
Forpatients withbrain metastases, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is
aneffective treatment [477] .Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT),
which isalsoreferred toasstereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), is
increasingly being used foroligometastatic extra-cranial disease
including lung, liver andlymph node metastases. Several caseserieshavedemonstrated thatSBRT iswelltolerated withgood localcontrol
forpatients witholigo-metastatic andoligo-progressive ovarian cancer
[478 –481].Pooled datafrom15centres, including 449treated lesions in
261patients, reported 65%complete response and82%two-year local
control. There wasnograde 3–4latetoxicity andonly5%grade one
toxicity [480] .Theradical treatment ofoligo-metastases could poten-
tially defer theneedtocommence orchange systemic therapy.
Palliative radiotherapy
Short-course radiotherapy canprovide useful palliation forpatients
withrecurrent ormetastatic ovarian cancer [482,483] .Indications for
treatment include vaginal bleeding, localised painandbrain metastases.
Typical dose-fractionation regimens forextra-cranial sitesinclude 8–10
Gyinasingle fraction, 20Gyin5fractions or30Gyin10–15fractions.
Patients withbrain metastases thatarenotsuitable forSRSmayreceive
whole brain radiotherapy with20Gyin5fractions or25–30Gyin10
fractions.

between follow-up visits varyaccording tolocalpractice, butcommonly
consists offollow-up every 3months forthefirst2years andthenevery
6months upto5years afterendoftreatment, despite alackofrando-
mised trialdataillustrating abenefit ofstrictfollow-up protocols overan
individualized patient- andsymptom-led approach. However, datashow
thattelephone follow-up isacceptable topatients [484] ,andpatient-
initiated follow upcould alsobeconsidered, inlinewithBGCS guide-
lines[485] .
Increases inCA125 mayherald progressive disease inpatients who
achieve anormal CA125. Aprospectively randomised MRC/EORTC trial
demonstrated nodifference inoverall survival afteramedian follow-up
of56.9months (HR0.98, 95%CI0.80to1.20; P0.85) between pa-
tients whoreceived chemotherapy based onarising CA125 andthose
whodidnotreceive chemotherapy untiltheyweresymptomatic [486] .
Treatment based onanabnormal CA125 ledtoearly treatment bya
median of4.8months [486,487] .Interestingly, those inthearmwhere
treatment wasinitiated onCA125 risehadashorter interval todeteri-
oration inglobal health score ordeath (HR0.71, 95%CI0.58to0.88; P

LGSCpathology
LGSC isthecommonest ofthe‘rare ’ovarian tumours. Itconstitutes
about 5%ofallovarian tumours. Patients withLGSOC areusually a
decade younger than those with adiagnosis ofahigh-grade serous
carcinoma. They often present withadvanced stage disease andhavea
protracted clinical course. Architecturally, papillae andglands are
frequently seen. Thecellular morphology (mild tomoderate atypia, less
thanthree-fold variation innuclear size,lowmitotic activity [492] )is
thekeymorphological feature thatsetsLGSC apart from highgrade
serous carcinoma. OnIHCthecellsarePAX8, CK7,WT1andERpositive.
They show wildtypep53expression [493,494] .LGSC hasahighprev-
alence ofactivating somatic mutations inmitogen-activated protein
kinase pathway genes. Themost commonly mutated genes areKRAS ,
BRAF andNRAS [495] .Although standard ofcareisstillcytoreductive
surgery with platinum-based chemotherapy, targeted treatment with
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase enzyme (MEK) inhibitors is
under thespotlight.
LGSCtreatment
Themanagement ofLGSOC ispredominantly surgical. Primary
cytoreductive surgery aimstoleave NMRD andmaybeconsidered again
atrelapse. Alargemeta-analysis showed aresponse ratetoplatinum-
based chemotherapy ofapproximately 24%inpatients withadvanced
primary lowgrade advanced ovarian cancer after primary CRS, and
hence lower thanfortheir high-grade serous counterparts [496] .The
authors concluded thatHGSC andLGSOC differ withrespect toche-
mosensitivity, chemotherapy being ofconsiderably lessbenefit inpa-
tients with LGSOC than patients with HGSC, growth pattern and
outcome following surgery. Hormonal maintenance strategies inLGSOCaftercompletion ofplatinum-based chemotherapy seem tohaveasur-
vival benefit inretrospective series [497] .
Recent studies have focused oninhibitors ofMEK orRAF/MEK, as
these pathways areactive inmany LGSOC. Astudy oftrametinib inthe
relapsed/metastatic setting, withobjective response ratesof26%,and
prolonged stable disease ratesofafurther 59%[498] .Thiscompared to
standard ofcarechemotherapy orendocrine treatment, with ORR
ranging from0%to11%forthecontrol arms. Thiscould beconsidered
forpatients withrelapsed/metastatic disease whohave hadplatinum-
based chemotherapy.
International multicentre studies arecurrently ongoing withcom-
bined RAF/MEK inhibitors butfurther trials areurgently needed to
assess other biomarkers. Recruitment tothese isimportant, asisregis-

Mucinous adenocarcinoma pathology
Mucinous histology accounts for3–5%ofallovarian carcinomas.
Primary mucinous ovarian cancers aretypically confined totheovary at
presentation, arelarge andshow acontinuum ofarchitectural features
including benign, borderline andmalignant areas. Confluent and
expansile patterns ofinvasion areoften seen, butwhen aninfiltrative
pattern ispresent, thepathologist must bealerttothepossibility ofa
metastatic carcinoma from another site.Invasive mucinous carcinoma
withaninfiltrative pattern hasamore aggressive course thanmucinous
carcinoma withanexpansile pattern. Mucinous carcinomas oftheovary
usually exhibit aCK7/CK20-/CDX2- immunohistochemistry profile.
Advanced mucinous tumours, with intra-peritoneal involvement, are
unlikely tobeofovarian origin asthese arerare[500] .Many ofthese are
Krukenberg tumours orarise from other organs, suchastheappendix
andgastro-intestinal (GI)tract origin, should beexcluded, withbidi-
rectional GIendoscopy, andreferral toaGIMDT considered. Ovarian
tumours metastatic from appendiceal primaries mayhave morpholog-
icalfeatures ofmucinous borderline tumours andthepresence ofdis-
secting mucin intheperitoneal cavity (pseudomyxoma peritonei)
favours thisdiagnosis. Rarely advanced mucinous tumours canarise
fromanovarian teratoma.
Mucinous ovariancancertreatment
Ifappendiceal pseudomyxoma isfound atstaging laparotomy, sur-
geryshould belimited toappendicetomy (/-partial caecectomy) and
BSO.Acolonoscopy should bearranged urgently postoperatively, ifnot
performed prior tosurgery, inparallel withreferral toanational pseu-
domyxoma centre. More extensive surgery with peritoneal stripping
should beavoided, ifpossible, since thiscancompromise subsequent
surgical treatment andHIPEC.
Forprimary ovarian malignancies where aGIprimary isexcluded,
surgery withadequate peritoneal staging isthestandard treatment for
themajority ofprimary mucinous ovarian tumours. Fertility-sparing
surgery should beconsidered inyoung women withunilateral disease.E.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
95Themanagement ofadvanced trueprimary ovarian mucinous tumours
ischallenging, asthey arenotparticularly chemo-responsive. The
collection ofpathological andclinical datafrompatients withthese rare
tumours isvitaltoallow progress tobemade indetermining appropriate
therapeutic strategies [501] .Patients withadvanced disease areusually
treated withcarboplatin andpaclitaxel, although these tumours respond
lesswelltothiscombination thanthemore common non-mucinous tu-
mours. mEOC (NCT01081262), arandomised trialcomparing carbo-
platin andpaclitaxel, oxaliplatin andcapecitabine/-bevacizumab (a
regimen usedingastrointestinal tractcancers) closed early duetopoor
recruitment withoneconclusion being thatprimary ovarian mucinous
tumours were rarer thanpreviously thought [502] .
Published evidence suggested equivalence between thecarboplatin
andoxaliplatin based arms [503] .Further work onmolecular profiling
hasshown anumber ofpatients have over-expression ofHER2, and
small series haveshown goodresponses toHER-2 directed therapy, with
regimens including weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab/-pertuzumab,
although thishasnotbeenassessed informal trials todate. Around half
ofpatients withmucinous ovarian cancer haveKRAS mutations, and
trials areinsetuptoassessKRAS -directed targeted treatments inthese
patients. Further studies ofmolecular drivers andtargeted treatments
areurgently needed inthese patients.
Where metastasis from thegastro-intestinal (GI)tract must be
excluded, bidirectional GIendoscopy should beperformed andreferral
toaGIMDT should beconsidered.

Ovarian epithelial tumour classification ischaracterised byits
unique category ofborderline tumours. Although themorphology of
these tumours includes noinvasive characteristics, clinically their
behaviour isnotalways entirely benign.
Pathology
Borderline ovarian tumours (BOTs), despite varying grades of
architectural complexity andcytological atypia, donotshow features of
frankly invasive malignancy. BOTs arestaged according totheFIGO
staging system ofovarian, fallopian tubeandprimary peritoneal carci-
noma. Most BOTs tendtopresent asstage Idisease andshow benign
behaviour, with onlyasmall percentage ofsome subtypes showing
extra-ovarian spread atpresentation, recurrence and/or progression to
invasive malignancy [504] .
Assome ovarian tumours may show thespectrum ofbenign,
borderline andmalignant features inthesame tumour, BOTs should be
sampled thoroughly at1block percmoftumour maximum dimension.
Intumours showing features raising thesuspicion ofinvasive malig-
nancy (e.g., marked cytological atypia) andinlarge tumours (e.g.,
mucinous tumours more than10cm),extra blocks should betaken, upto
2blocks percmoftumour maximum dimension [504] .Serous and
mucinous BOTs represent thecommonest types ofBOTs andshare some
features/principles.
Intumours showing aspectrum ofbenign andborderline changes,
thetumour isclassified asBOTiftheborderline features areseeninmore
than 10%oftheepithelial volume foratumour. Otherwise the
consensus isthatitshould beclassified asbenign cystadenoma /cys-
tadenofibroma withfocalepithelial proliferation [505] .Fociofstromal
invasionD5mmingreatest dimension inanysingle focus areclassified
asmicroinvasion, andintheirpresence thetumour would stillbeclas-
sified asBOT[506,507] .
Patients with stage Idisease have anOSthatisnotsignificantly
different fromthegeneral population, butpatients withadvanced stage
disease have higher likelihood oftumour recurrence/progression and
lower OS[508,509] .E.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
96Serousborderline ovariantumour(SBOT)
SBOTs histologically show hierarchical papillary architecture with
thepapillae having stromal cores andcovered byepithelium showing
stratification, andadegree ofcytological atypia. Some tumours include
amicropapillary /cribriform component, where themicro papillae arise
directly from large papillae, lackstromal cores, areatleast 5times
longer thanwide, and/orinterlink forming acribriform pattern. Ifsuch
acomponent measures more than orequal to5mm, thetumour is
classified asSBOT ofthemicropapillary /cribriform subtype, which is
more likely tobeassociated withaggressive behaviour [508] .
Inmost studies, stromal microinvasion hasnotbeen shown to
negatively affect outcome. However, ifthemorphology resembles low
grade serous carcinoma (LGSC), thetumour istobeclassified as
microinvasive LGSC [510] .
Extra-ovarian tumour deposits ofSBOTs maybenon-invasive to
underlying tissue, andareclassified asimplants orshowing invasion and
hence classified asextraovarian LGSC, where thelatter isasignificantly
adverse prognostic factor. Some implants maybedifficult toclassify and
these aredesignated asindeterminate [508] .
Lymph node deposits ofSBOT canbefound insome cases, butare
rareandroutine lymph node staging isnotrecommended [504] .
Mucinous borderline ovariantumour(MBOT)
MBOT isanon-invasive mucinous neoplasm ofgastrointestinal type
differentiation showing architectural complexity andvarying degrees of
cellular crowding /stratification, cytological atypia andmitotic activity
[504] .Thepresence offocal marked cytological atypia andmitotic ac-
tivity, warrants adiagnosis ofintraepithelial carcinoma, which doesnot
adversely affect overall survival. However, ifthese features are
encountered infociofmicroinvasion thetumour isbestclassified as
microinvasive carcinoma [511] .Mural nodules maybepresent and
show features ofsarcoma /sarcoma likefoci,anaplastic carcinoma, or
show mixed features. Cases withanaplastic carcinoma, maybeassoci-
atedwithaggressive behaviour [512] .MBOTs maydevelop inassocia-
tionwithBrenner tumour orteratomas. Tumours arising interatomas
show significant morphological andimmunophenotypic similarities to
lower gastrointestinal tractmucinous tumours andmaybeassociated
withpseudomyxoma peritonei andextraovarian spread [513] .
Raretypesofborderline ovariantumours
These include seromucinous, endometrioid andclear cellBOTs,
which areusually associated withendometriosis. Endometrioid BOTs
show crowded endometrioid glands, butlackconfluent growth patterns
anddestructive invasion. Clear cellBOTs areextremely rareandthor-
ough sampling isessential toexclude thisbeing partofaclear cell
carcinoma (which isthemuch commoner scenario), anddensely crow-
dedglands, andtypically tubulocystic andpapillary growth patterns
should notbepresent inaclear cellBOT. Seromucinous BOTs are
composed ofanadmixture ofMullerian-type epithelia, showing complex
architecture, butnoconfluent orinvasive growth patterns. Another
uncommon typeisborderline Brenner tumour, which resembles low
grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, andareas ofbenign Brenner
tumour arealways present [504] .
Clinicalmanagement
Patients withBOTs areyounger andfuture fertility maybeaconcern;
inaprospective study of339women, themedian agewas39years
[514] .Notallhadearly-stage disease and83.4%were diagnosed with
stage Idisease, 7.9%stage II,and8.5%stage III.Inthepresence of
peritoneal implants, excision ofinvolved peritoneum, withpreservation
ofatleastoneovary andtubeanduterus, canbeperformed. Higher
stage, incomplete staging, residual tumour andfertility-sparing surgery
wereindependent prognostic factors forrecurrence intworetrospective
studies [515 –517].Surgery, evenfertility-sparing, should include peri-
toneal staging (inspection, washings forcytology, peritoneal biopsies,omental biopsy/omentectomy, visualisation oftheappendix and
removal ifmacroscopically abnormal). However, thediagnosis isoften
made retrospectively following surgery byanon-gynaecological oncol-
ogist. InaFrench multi-centre retrospective study, 54of360women
withBOTs underwent arestaging operation, asdisease wasnotexpected
atthetimeofinitial surgery [518] .With adjustment forriskfactors,
recurrence rates were compared between those restaged (n54)and
those whodidnot(n244). Eight (14.8 %)women hadtheirdisease
upstaged, ofwhich fourhadovarian disease andfourwomen haddisease
beyond theovary. Thiswasmore common inthose withserous BOTs (P
0.06) andinthose withacystectomy atinitial surgery (P0.008).
These wasnodifference inrecurrence ratebetween those restaged and
those whowere not.Patients should therefore beinformed about the
risksandbenefits ofcompletion staging aftersimple cystectomy orUSO
with anincidental finding ofBOT. Those who might benefit most
include: those whohadacystectomy (forcompletion oophorectomy),
especially withamucinous tumour; patients withmucinous tumours in
whom theappendix wasnotinspected (ifnotalready removed); those
with serous tumours with micropapillary changes ordidnothave
adequate peritoneal inspection, asperevidence andrecommendations
intheFrench national guidelines (seeFig.2)[519 –521].
Overall, prognosis isgood, withdisease-free survival of99.6%in
stage Ipatients, 95.8%instage II,and89%instage IIIoveramedian 70
month follow up[514] .Simple cystectomy inanovary withBOTcarries

sparing reasons andafter thorough informed consent [522] .Longer-
term, theriskofmalignant transformation waslowoverall (~2%), but

lessfrequent inwomen under 40years ofageatoriginal diagnosis,

[523] .Riskwasassociated withageD45years, preoperative CA125F

have finished their families. Astheriskofrecurrence isseveral-fold
higher instudies where USO(11%)isperformed, compared toBSO
(1.7%),BSOshould berecommended forpostmenopausal women

recurrence didnotdiffer, despite lower rates ofsurgical radicality and
staging inthelaparoscopic group, overamedian follow upof41.8
months [525] .However, recurrence isassociated withperi-operative
cystrupture, withonestudy demonstrating increased recurrence rates
forthose withintra-operative rupture (P0.04) [524] .InaNorwegian
retrospective study, those whohadstage IBOTmeasuring F10cmin
diameter hadanincreased riskofintra-operative rupture during lapa-
roscopic surgery compared with laparotomy (5/8 versus 9/44, P
0.014) [528] .
Hysterectomy hasnovalue incomplete staging ofapatient with
BOT,although hysterectomy should beconsidered, ifthepatient wishes,
orforcytoreduction, iftheuterus isinvolved with invasive disease
[515] .There isnovalue inlymph node sampling ordissection inBOT
andthisshould therefore notberoutinely performed, although, ifbulky
lymph nodes arepresent, theyshould beremoved. Frozen section ofan
ovarian masscanhelpdetermine theextent ofsurgery; adiagnostic test
accuracy systematic review found that, iffrozen section wasused to
differentiate between cancer andbenign/borderline, sensitivity was
90.0%(95%CI87.6%to92.0%),andspecificity was99.5%(95%CI
99.2%to99.7%)[318] .
There isnoproven value ofcytotoxic chemotherapy inpatients with
BOT[515,529] .
BOTs canrelapse decades aftertheinitial diagnosis, andisuncom-
moninthose whohavehadbothovaries removed. Follow-up withul-
trasound scaninpatients afterfertility-sparing surgery isadvisable. In
anobservational study of164women whohadfertility-sparing surgery
forBOT,28(17%)women hadrecurrence ofaBOT(14%)orcarcinoma
(3%),overamedian follow upperiod of71months [530] .USSdetected

34patients whohadasuspicious recurrent lesion [531] .There maybe
lessvalue inroutine serum tumour marker measurement infollow upfor
BOTpatients, although itmaybeuseful ifCA125 orCA19-9 wereraised

found thatthree-quarters (48/68; 74%)hadCA125 within thenormal
range (D35IU/L) atrecurrence [532] .
IntheSwedish Observational study ofHRTandovarian cancer, there
were150women whohadbeentreated forBOT[533] .Withamedian 5-
yearfollow-up, 51%ofthewomen withBOTusedHRTafterdiagnosis.
There were onlythree deaths duetoovarian cancer andnone ofthese
women hadusedHRTbefore orafter diagnosis. TheFrench national
guidelines concluded thatneither assisted reproduction techniques nor
HRTwere contraindicated inBOTandactively encouraged theusein
those withmucinous BOTs under theageof45toprevent theadverse
health effects ofpremature menopause [519] .
Recurrent BOT should betreated surgically, iffeasible, since
response tochemotherapy ispoor.

Clinicalpresentation ofmalignant ovariangermcelltumours
These usually present inyoung females, mostareunder theageof30
years [535] .Thecommonest presenting symptoms areabdominal pain
andapalpable pelvic orabdominal mass(85%),while afew(10%)may
present withacute symptoms duetoovarian torsion, haemorrhage, or
rupture. Asmall proportion mayexhibit isosexual precocity orfalse
positive pregnancy test,duetohuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
production bythetumour. These tumours maydemonstrate biologic
activity with theproduction ofexcess endogenous hormones, most
common being LDH, AFPandhCG[536] .Other uncommon serum
markers include CA19-9, CA125 andSCCantigen. These canbehelpful
from adiagnostic standpoint, butalsohelpmonitor response andfor
post-treatment surveillance.
Macroscopic examination andhistological sampling ofMOGCT
Malignant ovarian germ celltumours (MOGCT) areusually large
tumours (average diameter 15cm)andmaybecompletely solidormay
have cystic component/variegated appearance. These tumours should
beextensively sampled (1block/10 mm) andallthedifferent areas,
including necrotic areas need sampling. Most areunilateral, butdys-
germinomas andteratomas maybebilateral.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofdysgerminoma
Dysgerminomas, inaddition toabove clinical findings maypresents
withelevated serum LDHorhCGlevels. Rarely paraneoplastic hyper-
calcemia maybeseen. Mosttumours areunilateral, but5–15%maybe
bilateral andthepossibility ofgonadal dysgenesis needs tobeexcluded
[537] .Histology ischaracteristic withlarge andmonotonous tumour
cells, separated byfibrous septae showing infiltration bychronic in-
flammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes. Thetumour cellsareseenin
sheets and nests, pseudoglandular orcorded/trabecular pattern
(mimicking carcinoid). These have well-defined cellborders, large
‘squared-off ’nuclei with prominent nucleoli andnumerous mitoses.
Variations inmorphology mayinclude extensive granulomatous septal
inflammation, presence ofhCGpositive syncytiotrophoblasts among thetumour cellsorscant inflammation.
OnIHC,tumour ispositive forOCT-3/4, SALL-4, NANOG, PLAP, CD-
117,LIN28 andD2-40. Focal cytokeratin expression maybeseenbut
EMAisnegative. Itisnegative forglypican-3, CD30 andAFP[538 –541].
C-KIT mutation ispresent inathird tohalfofdysgerminomas and
chromosome 12abnormalities maybeseeninupto80%ofthecases.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofEmbryonal carcinoma
ECisextremely rareasapureMOGCT andisuncommon component
ofmixed GCT. Most frequently itisseeninassociation withYSTor
gonadoblastoma butcanbeseenwithother components. Thisoccurs
mainly inchildren andyoung females (average age14years) andpre-
sents aspalpable mass orpain, precocious puberty, menstrual abnor-
malities orfalse-positive pregnancy test.Serum AFPandhCGlevels may
beraised.
Onmicroscopy, thetumour cellsarearranged insolid sheets, nest,
pseudoglandular/ papillary arrangements andcleftlikespaces lined by
undifferentiated polygonal tocuboidal cells. Loose myxoid, fibrous or
cellular spindle stroma with prominent blood vessels maybeseen
around thetumour cells. Syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells(STGC) may
beseenassociated totumour cellsorisolated inthestroma. Necrosis and
haemorrhage areusually seen. IHCispositive forAE1/3,CD30, OCT-3/
4,SALL-4 andLIN28, andmayshow positive staining withSOX2, hCG
(inSTGC) andAFP.IHCisnegative forEMA, CD117 andD2-40; i(12)p
or12pamplification arecommonly seeninEC.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofyolksactumour(YST)
Yolksactumours (YST) occur mainly inchildren andyoung females.
Most patients areintheirsecond tothird decade andisrareinwomen
over 40years. Presentation iscommonly with abdominal pain,
abdominal/pelvic mass orwith symptoms ofanacute abdomen sec-
ondary totorsion. Serum AFPandCA-125 levels areraised inmost
patients.
YSTarecharacterized bywide multitude ofhistological patterns
(Microcystic/reticular, endodermal sinus/ festoon, solid, alveolar-
glandular, parietal, papillary, polyvesicular vitelline, hepatoid, myxo-
matous) within thesame tumour, causing potential diagnostic diffi-
culties. Tumour cellsarecuboidal withclearoramphophilic cytoplasm,
hyperchromatic small- tomedium-sized primitive appearing nuclei,
usually prominent nucleoli andabundant mitotic activity. Eosinophilic
PASpositive, diastase resistant hyaline globules andSchiller-Duval
Bodies (glomeruloid structures) areprominent, although notcharac-
teristic, findings inYST.
OnIHC,YSTarepositive withbroad spectrum cytokeratin andare
usually negative withCK7andEMA. YSTareusually diffusely positive
forGlypican-3 andSALL-4 andfocally withAFP.Lin28, CD117 andIMP-
3areexpressed invarying percentages. Endodermal (somatic) differ-
entiation mayshow CDX-2 (intestinal), TTF-1 (respiratory/ foregut) and
Hepar-1 (hepatoid) positivity. Endometrioid glandular differentiation,
however, isnegative forERandPR.CD30, NANOG andOCT-3/4 are
usually negative.
Rarely, inolder women, YSTcanbeseeninassociation withsomatic
malignancies, mainly endometrioid, clear cellormucinous neoplasms
[542,543] .Inthissetting theYSTisusually somatic andnotgerm cellin
origin.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofimmature teratoma (IT)
ITusually present infirstthree decades oflifeandrarely occur in
postmenopausal women. Mostareunilateral andpresent aspelvic mass.
10–15%maycoexist withacontralateral mature cystic teratoma. Serum
AFPmaybeelevated intumours withahepatoid component. These may
produce LDHandrarely steroid hormones.
Thetumour isusually large (average diameter 18cm)andpredom-
inantly solidandfleshy, withvariable cystic, necrotic andhaemorrhagic
component. Fociofcartilage, bone, hairandcysts filled withseromu-
cinous, colloid orfattymaterial maybeseeninthebackground. TheseE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
99tumours areprone toperforate through thecapsule.
Histology shows haphazard admixture ofmature andimmature el-
ements, withtheformer usually predominating. Amongst theimmature
elements, neuroectodermal tissue (tubules, trabeculae, rosettes orsheets
andnestsofneuroblasts) isessential fordiagnosis andgrading, although
immature mesodermal, andlesscommonly ectodermal, tissue may
accompany. Two methods ofgrading exist based ontheaggregate
amount oftheimmature neuroectoderm inanygiven slide. Thegrading
system alsoapplies tometastatic sites. These canbegraded asGrade
1–3,oraslowgrade (G1)andhighgrade (G2andG3)[544] .
Diagnosis ofITismainly morphological andthere isnospecific IHC
marker. However, neuroectoderm maystainpositive forSOX-2, SALL-4,
glypican andCD99. SALL-4 andAFPstaining canbeseenin‘entero-
blastic ’glands. Glial differentiation canbehighlighted byGFAP and
immature cartilage usually stains withCD34 andbcl-2 [538,539,545] .
Molecular genetic: most pureITtypically donotexhibit i(12p) or
gainof12pwhile thisisoften present inITcomponent ofmixed GCT
[546] .
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofnon-gestational
choriocarcinoma
NG-CC isseenmainly inchildren andyoung adults whopresent with
symptoms similar toEmbryonal carcinoma. Clinically, ectopic preg-
nancy maybeaconsideration inview ofhCGproduction, positive
pregnancy testandabsence ofintra-uterine conceptus.
NG-CC isahaemorrhagic andnecrotic tumour composed oftwocell
population. These include mononuclear (cyto and intermediate
trophoblast) andmultinucleate syncytiotrophoblast giant cells(STGC)
withIHCpositive forcytokeratin, inhibin, GATA-3, CD10 andhCG. In-
termediate cytotrophoblast mayexpress Mel-CAM (CD146), hPLand
lesscommonly p63andPLAP [547] .
Molecular genetics: molecular genotyping ofshort tandem repeat
(STR) DNA sequences isthegoldstandard fordifferentiating NG-CC
from gestational choriocarcinoma, asthegenome inNG-CC reflects
thatofthehostandnonon-maternal/paternal component isidentified.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofmixedgermcelltumours
Most mixed tumours (80%)contain twomalignant germ cellcom-
ponents, while therestmayshow three ormore. There isnominimum
amount orcut-off percentage forsecond component. Themostfrequent
components ofmixed GCTinclude dysgerminoma andYSTfollowed by
IT,choriocarcinoma andembryonal carcinoma. Itisimportant to
mention anymixed components andestimate theirrelative percentages,
asthepresence ofmore malignant components affects thetherapeutic
approach andtheprognosis. Adetailed andthorough examination ofall
GCTs should beperformed andtherightpanel ofimmunocytochemistry
isdirected onareas withdifferent morphological appearances. Asig-
nificant proportion ofmixed GCTshow abnormalities ofchromosome 12
ormayariseindysgenetic gonads withabnormal karyotype.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofmatureteratoma
Mature teratoma account for20%ofallovarian neoplasms
encountered inpathology andmostly occur inwomen ofreproductive
age.These areessentially benign andinrarecases maybeassociated
withmalignant transformation.
Mostarecystic although rarely these maybesolid. Solid areas must
bethoroughly sampled toexclude malignant transformation. Histolog-
ically, these show derivatives ofectoderm, mesoderm andendoderm.
Some mature teratomas withprominent glialcomponent maybeasso-
ciated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, which should besurgically
removed fortreatment.
Morphology andimmunohistochemical featuresofMonodermal teratoma
andsomatictypetumourarisingfromadermoidcyst
Monodermal teratomas aresolely orpredominantly (F50%ofthe
teratoma) composed ofonesingle typeoftissue. Thevarious types ofmonodermal teratomas include:
1.Strumaovarii: composed entirely/ predominantly ofthyroid tissue.
Thisisthemost common typeofmonodermal teratoma. Most are
clinically benign butrarely these mayundergo malignant trans-
formation (papillary, follicular oranaplastic thyroid carcinoma) or
maybeassociated withcarcinoid tumour.
2.OvarianCarcinoid: these arewell-differentiated neuroendocrine tu-
mours andhaveanuncertain malignant potential. Most areseenin
post-menopausal women [548] .Mostaresolid, butsome mayappear
asasolidnodule within acystic teratoma. Histology shows mainly
foursubtypes: insular, trabecular, stromal, andmucinous carcinoid.
Thecells have salt-and-pepper chromatin, with orwithout cyto-
plasmic granules andstromal hyalinisation. These characteristically
express neuroendocrine markers. Theprognosis isusually excellent
except forpoorly differentiated mucinous andinsular carcinoids.
3.Neuroectodermal typetumours: these aremalignant tumours, typically
seen inyounger patients (median age23years), arefrequently
associated with ateratoma [549] .Histologically thetumours are
characterised byproliferation ofsmall blueround cellswithvariable
neural/ glialdifferentiation. Some tumours maybedifferentiated
(central-type tumours) while others arelessdifferentiated. Differ-
entiated tumours (e.g. ependymoma, astrocytoma, oligoden-
droglioma, orneurocytoma) have abetter prognosis than less
differentiated (medulloblastoma, ependymoblastoma, medulloepi-
thelioma, orglioblastoma) tumours.
4.Monodermal cysticteratomas: These arecomposed ofeither ecto-
dermal orendodermal derivatives excluding theabove three andare
usually benign.
5.Somaticneoplasms arisingfromteratoma: These aremalignant tu-
mours andtypically occur inolder women (average age55years).
Anysomatic tumour (benign ormalignant) mayoriginate inamature
teratoma. Amongst themalignant transformations seen, cutaneous
tumours (squamous cellcarcinoma, melanoma, basal cellcarcinoma,
adnexal tumours etc)arethemost frequent, followed byadenocar-
cinomas andsarcomas [550 –554]
Primarytreatment ofGCT
Prior tosurgery, patients should undergo aCTscan ofthorax,
abdomen, andpelvis, ifGCTissuspected onmarkers orother imaging.
GCTsurgery
Primary cytoreductive surgery isthemainstay ofdiagnosis and
treatment ofearly-stage disease; forhigher stage disease, delayed pri-
mary surgery hasnotbeen evaluated andshould notbeconsidered
unless thedisease isunresectable atdiagnosis (seebelow). Given theage
distribution ofGCT,mostpatients arelikely tonothavecompleted their
family, andFSSshould beoffered. Thisincludes USO, omentectomy,
peritoneal sampling (orexcision ofallvisible disease) [555] .Retroper-
itoneal lymph nodes should only bedissected ifmacroscopically
abnormal [556] .Forpatients whose family iscomplete, contra-lateral
salpingo-oophorectomy andhysterectomy canbeoffered inaddition.
Given thehighchemo-sensitivity ofGCT,where thecontra-lateral ovary
isinvolved, butthepatient wishes toretain fertility, acareful discussion
offertility options should behad;thisshould include leaving atleastpart
oftheaffected ovary.
GCTsystemictherapy
Patients withstage IAdysgerminoma andstage I,grade 1immature
teratoma haveanexcellent prognosis without adjuvant chemotherapy,
andsurgery asthesolemodality hasbeenthestandard ofcareformany
years [557] .Theriskofrecurrence is15%forstage IAdysgerminoma
and17%forstage Igrade 1immature teratoma, these patients are
typically cured atrecurrence [558] .Theprognosis ofmostother stage I
GCTisalsoexcellent, andcureratesatrecurrence during surveillance isE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
100high. Inaddition, immature teratoma does notappear particularly
chemosensitive andoutcomes arenotinfluenced bygrade [558,559] .
Datafrompaediatric patients withfemale GCTalsosuggest thatstage I
GCTcanbemanaged withsurgery andactive surveillance, reserving
chemotherapy fordisease recurrence [560] .Therefore, withtheexcep-
tionofnon-gestational choriocarcinoma, adiscussion about thebenefits
andtoxicities of3cycles ofadjuvant BEPcompared tosurveillance is
warranted inallpatients withstage IGCT.
Ifpatients optforactive surveillance, thisrequires frequent atten-
dances andtests(seebelow). Patients whomight struggle toadhere to
thisintensive active surveillance strategy maybebetter served by
treatment withadjuvant BEP.
BEPhasbeen themainstay oftherapy inthese patients formany
years, many cohort studies demonstrating highactivity [557] ,although
randomised dataarelacking. Theoptimal number ofcycles hasnotbeen
established, butthree cycles ofadjuvant therapy arerecommended,
where NMRD remains aftersurgery, forthose withstage IIdisease, and
lowriskstage IIIandIVdisease defined bytheInternational Germ Cell
Cancer Collaborative Group prognostic model, modified forovarian GCT
[561] .
Typically, BEPisgiven over 5days; a3-day version hasbeen
described [562] ,butshould onlybegiven ifcompliance isthought tobe
anissue asithasnotbeendirectly compared tostandard BEP.Patients
over40years orthose withpre-existing lungdisease should beoffered
fourcycles ofEPduetotheknown pulmonary toxicity ofbleomycin.
Patients withdysgerminoma whoarenotsuitable forcisplatin could
receive carboplatin etoposide [563] .
Thestandard ofcarechemotherapy forpatients withunresectable
disease atdiagnosis remains BEPforfourcycles. Based ondatafrom
male germ cellcancers, theaddition ofhigh-dose chemotherapy and
autologous hematopoietic stem-cell rescue isnotrecommended inthis
setting [564] .Patients with resectable residual disease postchemo-
therapy should beoffered resection, especially ifmarkers have nor-
malised onchemotherapy. Given thehighchemosensitivity ofovarian
GCT, inpatients withpotentially resectable advanced disease canbe
considered forprimary chemotherapy ifprimary surgery hasahigh
chance ofremoving fertility andwhere thepatient wishes toretain this.
Firmdataforthisapproach arelacking anddecisions about sequencing
oftherapy inanysetting should bemade inconjunction withagerm cell
MDT.
GCTfollow-up
Duetothepotential forcureeveninrecurrent ovarian GCT, allpa-
tients should beclosely monitored fordisease recurrence. Inthelackofa
robust evidence basetosupport anyparticular schedule, patients should
befollowed clinically, supported byAFP,hCGandLDHmeasurements
withatraditional follow-up schedule (every three months fortwoyears,
every sixmonths forthree years, andthenannually fortenyears). Notall
GCTproduce allmarkers, testing allinevery GCTpatients ensures the
appropriate testisalways performed.
Additional imaging canaidthedetection ofrecurrence, particularly
inpatients withnormal markers atdiagnosis, buttheriskofionising
radiation toayoung, likely cured patient needs tobeconsidered.
Forpatients treated withadjuvant BEP:
≡CTscanofabdomen andpelvis at12and24months. Afurther CT
scanatsixmonths forpatients whohadahighburden ofdisease at
presentation canbeconsidered.
≡Nodataexist tosupport theutility ofroutine chest radiographs
(CXR) ininthesurveillance ofGCTinwomen. Inmen, thedetection
ofrecurrent GCTbyCXRalone when itwasnotobvious clinically,
frommarkers orroutine surveillance scanning, islowatbest[565]
andCXRshould notberoutinely performed infemale GCT.
≡Patients treated withfertility sparing surgery should alsobeoffered a
pelvic ultrasound six-monthly forthree years forsurveillance ofthe
remaining ovary.Forstage Ipatients nottreated withadjuvant therapy:
≡These patients should beseenmore frequently inthe1styear, we
recommend two-monthly withtumour markers.
≡Patients with marker negative disease, should have aCTscanof
abdomen andpelvis atthree months inaddition totheCTscanof
abdomen andpelvis at12and24months.
≡Noroutine CXRasabove.
≡Patients aretypically treated with fertility sparing surgery and
should beoffered apelvic ultrasound six-monthly forthree years.
Patients treated withFSSandadjuvant BEPhave ahighchance of
returning thesame pre-chemotherapy menstrual pattern (above 90%)
[566] andtherateofpregnancy is75%inthose attempting conception
[567] .Despite this, where time allows, patients should beoffered
referral toafertility service todiscuss options. Theriskofrecurrence
appears highest inthefirst2years [555,568] andpatients should be
counselled against falling pregnant inthistime.
Treatment ofrecurrent GCT
There isnostandard therapy forrelapsed disease, andentry intoa
clinical trialshould beoffered ifappropriate. Those with platinum
sensitive disease should bere-challenged with platinum containing
chemotherapy, options include TIP(paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin),
VIP(etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin), although many regimens are
recognised [569] .High-dose therapy withstem cellrescue mayoffer
improved outcomes overstandard chemotherapy atfirstrelapse [536] ;a
re-challenge withBEPorEPseems tobelesseffective atachieving cure
inthissetting [561] .Inplatinum-resistant disease, therapy withVAC
(vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) [570] orgemcitabine
andoxaliplatin [571] canbeconsidered.

Sexcordstromal tumours (SCST) represent arelatively uncommon
group ofovarian tumours which spanthespectrum fromindolent benign
lesions tohighly malignant neoplasms. They tend topresent ina
younger agegroup thanother ovarian tumours andareoften charac-
terised bysymptoms related toexcessive hormonal production.
Themajority oftheevidence available relates tothecommonest
subtype ofSCST, granulosa celltumours, andcareshould therefore be
taken when extrapolating guidance toother rarer subtypes.
Although SCST canaffect women under theageof18,thisguidance
relates specifically towomen overtheageof18.Young women (aged 18
to25years) should ideally bemanaged withthesupport ofthetumour of
young adult (TYA) MDT.
Sex-cord stromaltumourpathology
Sexcord-stromal tumours constitute aheterogeneous group of
benign andmalignant neoplasms [572,573] .Sexcord-stromal tumours
represent approximately 7%ofallprimary malignant ovarian tumours
[574] ,which areusually diagnosed atanearly stage, andmayhave
laterecurrence, aslateas30years, after theinitial diagnosis and
treatment. Themost important prognostic factor forsexcord-stromal
tumours areTheInternational Federation ofGynecology andObstet-
rics(FIGO) stage, andtumour rupture [575] .
According totheWHO classification [576] ,these tumours areclas-
sified intothree main groups; purestromal tumours, puresexcordtu-
mours, andmixed sexcord-stromal tumours. Pure stromal tumours
include fibromas, thecomas, sclerosing stromal tumours, microcystic
stromal tumours, Leydig celltumours, andsteroid celltumours. Puresex
cordtumours, include granulosa celltumours, Sertoli celltumours, and
sexcordtumours withannular tubules [572] .Mixed-sex cord-stromal
tumours include Sertoli-Leydig celltumours andsexcord-stromal tu-
mours thathave nototherwise been specified [504] .Some sexcord-
stromal tumours may have clinical signs ofhormone production,
including menstrual changes, precocious puberty, hirsutism, and/or
virilisation [577] .
Purestromaltumours
Fibromaandfibrosarcoma. Fibromas aretypically benign tumours, and
thisincludes cellular fibromas andmitotically active cellular fibromas
thatmayshow brisk mitotic activity, butnonotable cytological atypia.
Some fibromas thatshow rupture orsurface adhesions maybeassoci-
atedwithlocalrecurrence [578] .
Ovarian fibrosarcoma isanextremely rareandaggressive neoplasm
withpoorprognosis [578] .Ovarian fibrosarcomas maybeassociated
withnaevoid basal cellnaevus syndrome orMaffuci syndrome [579] .
Onecasewasreported tobeassociated withDICER1 syndrome [580] .
Luteinised thecoma associated withsclerosing peritonitis. Luteinised the-
coma withsclerosing peritonitis usually leads tomorbidity andmor-
tality caused byintestinal obstruction duetothesclerosing peritonitis,
andnotduetotheovarian tumour [581] .
Sclerosing stromaltumour. Sclerosing stromal tumours represent less
thanapproximately 5%ofallsexcord-stromal tumours, [572] and70%
arediagnosed inyoung women of14–29years [582] .There isonereport
ofasclerosing stromal tumour thatshowed recurrence. Thistumour was
reported tohave capsular breach andsignificant mitotic activity andnecrosis [583] .
Microcystic stromaltumour. Microcystic stromal tumours areveryrare
andpresent inpatients between theagesof20and60years [584] .There
isonecasereport oftumour recurrence [585] .
Onimmunostaining, microcystic stromal tumours arenegative for
sex-cord stromal markers (α-inhibin andcalretinin) [586] ,butcharac-
teristically show nuclear expression ofβ-catenin, reflecting somatic exon
3missense CTNNB1 mutation, which isahallmark ofmost ovarian
microcystic stromal tumours [587] .Microcystic stromal tumours may
alsobeassociated withfamilial adenomatous polyposis [582] .
Steroidcelltumour. These aretumours composed ofsteroid cellswhich
show malignant behaviour inapproximately onethird ofcases. Factors
predicting malignant behaviour include sizeF7cm,significant mitotic
activity, necrosis, haemorrhage, andsignificant nuclear atypia [588] .
Thecoma, signetringstromaltumourandLeydigcelltumour. Thecoma,
signet ringstromal tumour andLeydig celltumour arealmost always
benign tumours [504] .
Puresexcordtumours
Granulosa celltumours. Granulosa celltumours account for2–5%ofall
ovarian tumours [589,590] .There aretwoclinically andhistologically
distinct types ofgranulosa celltumours, which areadult granulosa cell
tumours andjuvenile granulosa celltumours [591] .
Adultgranulosa celltumours. Adult granulosa celltumours account
forapproximately 95%ofallgranulosa celltumours, with apeak
incidence inwomen aged 50–55years [592] .Adult granulosa celltu-
mours arethemost common malignant ovarian tumours thatsecrete
hormones, mainly oestrogen, thatmayresult inendometrial hyperplasia
andendometrial carcinoma [593,594] .These tumours areusually con-
sidered low-grade malignant tumours with anindolent clinical cour-
seandpossibility oflaterelapse [595] .Approximately 70–97%ofadult
granulosa celltumours have asomatic c.402CFGmissense point mu-
tation intheFOXL2 gene[596,597] ,andwhich israther specific marker
foradult granulosa celltumours, thathelps inthedistinction fromother
sexcord-stromal tumours [598] .
Juvenilegranulosa celltumours. Juvenile granulosa celltumour rep-
resents about 5%ofallgranulosa celltumours [599,600] ,andusually
present inwomen younger thanage30(mean ageof13years) [601] .
Clinical presentations ofjuvenile granulosa celltumours include pre-
cocious pseudopuberty, irregular menstruation, andrarely virilisation
[600] .Juvenile granulosa celltumours have arelatively favourable
prognosis [602] .
SexCord-Stromal tumours withannulartubules. Sexcord-stromal tu-
mours with annular tubules represent 1.4%ofallsexcord-stromal
tumour [603] ,andmaybesporadic orassociated withPeutz-Jeghers
syndrome [604] .Sexcord-stromal tumours withannular tubules asso-
ciated withPeutz-Jeghers syndrome aremostly benign, while sporadic
sexcord-stromal tumours with annular tubules mayhave malignant
potential [605] .
Sertolicelltumours. These areusually benign tumours [504] .
MixedsexCord-Stromal tumours
Sertoli-Leydig celltumour. Sertoli –Leydig celltumours represent less
than0.5%ofallovarian tumours, [606] andusually present inwomen
under 30years ofage[607] .Sertoli –Leydig celltumours areassocia-
tedwith both somatic andgermline DICER1 mutations [587] .These
tumours maybewell, moderately orpoorly differentiated. ModeratelyE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
102andpoorly differentiated tumours show malignant behaviour in10%
and60%ofcases respectively [608] .
SexcordstromaltumourNOS. Sexcordstromal tumour NOSisatumour
thatshow nofeatures ofoneofthedefinitive tumour types. Some of
these tumours arereported toshow malignant behaviour [609] .
Gynandroblastoma. Thisisatumour thatshows components offemale
andmaledifferentiation, mostcommonly juvenile granulosa celltumour
andSertoli-Leydig celltumour. Most arebenign, withrarely reported
recurrences havebeenreported [610] .
Presentation anddiagnosis
Abnormal vaginal bleeding isthecommonest single symptom of
SCST, often associated withpain, andapalpable abdominal mass[611] .
Hirsutism isalesscommon symptom butshould alsoraisethepossibility
ofSCST, particularly inpre-menopausal women. Asignificant propor-
tionofcases willbeasymptomatic andonlydiagnosed asanincidental
finding.
CA125 israised inaproportion ofcases, mostcommonly injuvenile
typegranulosa celltumours [611] .Despite thistheRMImaynotbe
elevated inmany cases ofSCST andclinical suspicion should override
RMIinthissituation indetermining management.
Studies toassess theperformance ofimaging modalities forSCST are
limited bynumbers andthewidevariety oftumours seen. There areno
head-to-head comparisons ofimaging modalities. Theaddition ofcolour
Doppler appears toimprove diagnostic accuracy forultrasound [612] ,
whilst thecombination ofT2,DCE andDWimaging provides the
greatest MRIresolution [613] .
SCST commonly secrete hormones, including oestrogen, which can
leadtoatypical endometrial hyperplasia andendometrial cancer. Im-
aging orsampling oftheendometrium should beconsidered ifthe
diagnosis ofSCST issuspected andparticularly inthose women whoare
considering fertility preserving surgery withconservation oftheuterus
[614] .
Somatic andgermline DICER mutations arepresent inupto60%of
Sertoli Leydig celltumours [615] .Although reflexive testing isnot
currently available through theGenomics Test Directory, genetic
referral tolookforthefamilial DICER1 cancer predisposition syndrome
isrecommended [616] .
Management ofsuspected early-stage disease
Surgical staging forSCST should include peritoneal washings,
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy andinfra
colicomentectomy; retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy isnotindicated,
asthere isalowincidence ofnodal involvement [617] .Consideration of
fertility preservation should begiven toalljuveniles andwomen of
child-bearing age.Preservation oftheuterus andcontralateral ovary is
considered safeincases ofstage IAdisease however cystectomy should
beavoided asitappears tobeassociated withworse outcome thanoo-
phorectomy [618] .Fertility-preserving surgery (FSS) forstage IC2and
IC3disease remains controversial. However, datafrom theNational
Cancer Institute ’sSurveillance, Epidemiology, andEndResults (SEER)
database identified 255adult women withstage Imalignant SCST be-
tween 1984 and2013, ofwhom 161(63.1 %)underwent FSS,whereas
94(36.9 %)haddefinitive surgery (BSO andhysterectomy). Cancer-
specific survival (P0.015), butnotoverall survival (P0.76) was
superior forwomen whohaddefinite surgery overamedian follow-up
period of104months [619] .FSSistherefore anoption with appro-
priate counselling andclose follow-up. NoRCTs haveexamined therole
ofminimal invasive surgery, butretrospective series suggest comparable
outcomes between alaparoscopic andanopen approach [620] .
Dataarelimited, butretrospective series appear toshow nobenefittotheuseofchemotherapy intheadjuvant setting, including stage IC
disease [621,622] .Exceptions mayinclude grade 2–3Sertoli-Leydig cell
tumours where limited datasuggest there maybebenefit tochemo-
therapy [623] andstage IC2juvenile granulosa celltumours. Nostudies
haveaddressed theroleofendocrine therapy asanadjuvant treatment
andthiscantherefore notberecommended.
Asingle retrospective study suggests asurvival benefit associated
withtheuseofadjuvant radiotherapy forpatients withgranulosa cell
tumours [624] .Thepotential riskofbiasforthisstudy ishigh[625] and
further studies arerequired toconfirm thisfinding andassess toxicity
before radiotherapy canberecommended.
Management ofadvanced-stage andrecurrent SCST
Given therelative indolent nature ofmany SCST, secondary cytore-
ductive surgery, withtheaimofremoving allmacroscopic disease, re-
mains themosteffective management ofadvanced orrecurrent disease.
Surgery mayneedtoberepeated onmultiple occasions. Nobenefit has
beendemonstrated intheuseofpostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy
forgranulosa celltumours [626] .
Bothpaclitaxel/carboplatin (CP)andbleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin
(BEP) regimens havebeenusedforthetreatment ofSCST withevidence
ofactivity foreachregimen. Publication oftheresults ofarandomised
comparison ofthetworegimens isawaited, although dataforthe63
participants areavailable onclinicaltrials.gov [627] .These demonstrate
median PFSofCPwas27.7months (95%CI11.2to41.0months)
compared withBEPof19.7months (95%CI10.4to52.7months),
although serious adverse events weremore common intheBEParm(CP
34.38 %versus BEP19.35 %).Asingle, phase IIstudy, which recruited
36patients, reported aresponse rateof16.7%andastable disease rate
of77.8 %totreatment with bevacizumab with acceptable toxicity
[628] .
Many SCST express hormone receptors andmultiple caseseries have
described activity ofhormonal agents, specifically aromatase inhibitors
(AI).However, theonlyprospective phase IItrialtodatereported ahigh
rateofclinical benefit (79%),butlowrateofobjective response, sug-
gesting hormonal therapy isacytostatic agent [629] .
Casereports [630] andsmall caseseries [631] describe response to
radiotherapy foradvanced orrecurrent disease, which cannot betreated
surgically, butnoprospective series havebeendescribed.
Follow-up ofSCST
Given thewiderange ofclinical manifestations ofSCST, variability in
malignant potential, andthevariety oftreatment options, follow up
schedules should bepersonalised, butcould range from regular
consultant-led hospital follow-up, through nurse-led follow-up, patient-
initiated follow-up todischarge. SCST arenotcurrently included inthe
UK(BGCS) guidance forpatient-initiated follow-up [485] ,butthis
regimen could beconsidered fortumours withlowriskofrecurrence.
Factors which should beused todetermine thefollow-up schedule
include grade andstage oftheprimary tumour, extent ofinitial surgery,
likelihood oftreatment related sideeffects, andpatient wishes. Patients
whohave undergone FSSwith conservation ofoneovary could be
considered forannual transvaginal ultrasound tomonitor theremaining
ovary. Follow-up caninclude theuseofinhibin B,andAMH (ifavail-
able), particularly ifthese were raised preoperatively [632] .European
Society ofMedical Oncology Guidelines suggests follow upwithtumour
markers (e.g., inhibin B,AMH) every 6months starting fromthethird
year, maintained indefinitely, although recognises thattheevidence for
efficacy islimited [633] .They alsogenerally recommend pelvic ultra-
sound every 6months inthose patients whohave undergone fertility-
sparing surgery andnotethatmore complex cross sectional imaging
(CTorMRI) should becarried outifclinically indicated, based on
symptoms orincrease intumour markers.

Frailty
Theterm frailty describes adistinctive health state which results
from ageing associated withadecline inthebody ’sphysical andpsy-
chological reserves across multiple systems. Around 10%ofpeople aged
over65years havefrailty, rising tobetween aquarter andahalfofthose
agedover85years [635] .Older people living withfrailty areatriskof
decompensation andadverse outcomes affecting their physical and
mental wellbeing afterastressor event which challenges their health.
Thisisofparticular relevance following adiagnosis ofcancer andwhen
considering treatment options. Frailty, although distinct, mayoverlap
withdisability andco-morbidity.
Multiple tools andindices have been studied tomeasure frailty in
clinical trials [636] .Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) isa
multi-system review offrailty, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes,
mental health, functional difficulties andsocial circumstances. Itisa
four-part clinical process ofscreening, assessment, intervention and
follow-through which hasbeenshown todetect more co-morbidities and
functional issues thanthestandard oncological assessment ofperfor-
mance status.
Thetime taken toperform ageriatric assessment (GA) inthe
oncology clinic setting isapractical issue andhence there hasbeen
much interest inthedevelopment ofabbreviated andscreening tools.
TheSIOG consensus onGAstates thatthekeydomains inaGA
considered tobeimportant are:functional status, fatigue, comorbidities,
cognitive impairment andmental health status, social support, nutrition
andthepresence ofgeriatric syndromes suchasfalls.Todate,there isno
oneGAtoolthathasbeenrecommended overanother toreliably predict
tolerance tocancer therapy orclinical outcomes. Assessment tools
available include patient-completed questionnaires, healthcare
professional-led questionnaires andbiological factors suchasalbumin,
haemoglobin levels andrenal function.
Examples oftools used tomeasure frailty include thePhenotype
Frailty Index, Rockwood Frailty Index andtheClinical Frailty Scale.
Abbreviated toolsmore commonly usedinolder cancer patients include
G8,VES13 andtheEdmonton Frailty Scale. Patient self-completed tools
include CGA-GOLD [637] andCARG [638] .Further toolsthatcangive
more in-depth assessment ofspecific issues include Charlson Comor-
bidity Index, Timed upandgotest(TUG), mininutritional assessment,
cognitive tests(e.g.clock drawing test,MMSE), mood assessment (e.g.
Hospital Anxiety andDepression Scale).
Thefindings fromfrailty assessment tools areimportant toidentify
patients inneed ofinterventions. Interventions canbeintroduced by
oncology, including review ofmedication, anaemia treatment, physio-
therapy, occupational therapy, dietician referrals. Ongoing clinical trials
(NCT04300699; NCT06298877) aimtoevaluate frailty assessments in
patients withovarian cancer [639,640] .
Thegeriatric vulnerability score (GVS), validated inaninternational
population, hasbeenshown tobeprognostic foroverall survival inpa-
tients withadvanced ovarian cancer [641] .TheEWOC-1 randomised
trial(80participants) shows thatcompared withthree-weekly orweekly
carboplatin-paclitaxel combination regimens, single-agent carboplatinhadpoorer survival outcomes invulnerable (GVS score 3orhigher)
older patients (≽70years) withovarian cancer [642] .Themedian PFS
was12.5(95%CI,10.3to15.3) months inthecarboplatin-paclitaxel
three-weekly arm,4.8(95%CI3.6to15.3) months withsingle-agent
carboplatin, and8.3(95%CI6.6to15.3) months withweekly carbo-
platin –paclitaxel. Median OSwasnotreached (95%CI21.0. to32.2
months) inthecarboplatin-paclitaxel three-weekly arm,7.4(95%CI5.3
to32.2) months withsingle-agent carboplatin, and17.3(95%CI10.8to
32.2) months withweekly combination therapy. However, thisisasmall
study andshould notbeoverinterpreted.
Survivorship
Survivorship hasbeendefined byas“living withandbeyond cancer ”
[643] .Women areconsidered ovarian cancer survivors fromthetimeof
diagnosis totheendoflife[644] .Ithaslongbeen recognised that
Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs) have apivotal roleinsupporting pa-
tients withmany aspects ofliving withtheirdisease from diagnosis to
bestsupportive careandendoflife.
According toCancer Research UKdata, 35%ofwomen diagnosed
withovarian cancer between 2013 and2017 areexpected tosurvive 10
years ormore [645] .However, themajority ofclinical andresearch
focus isonearly diagnosis andtreatment, notonsupportive careand
survivorship. Ovarian cancer patients often donotfitneatly intothe
traditional definition ofsurvivorship. Equally, there hasbeen little
distinction astowhat survivorship maymean, andthedifferences in
needbetween patients atdifferent agesandstages oflife.Consideration
should alsobegiven toindividuals from different ethnic andsocio-
economic backgrounds.
Since ovarian cancer isnotasingle disease entity, people alsomay
have different supportive careneeds depending ontheir tumour type.
Those withadvanced stage cancers mayneeddiffering support tothose
withmore indolent tumours, suchaslow-grade cancers orthose with
borderline ovarian tumours.
Those under 18years should bemanaged bypaediatric oncology
teams, with gynaecological oncology surgeons providing surgical
expertise. Close working between MDTs allows personalisation ofcare
andaccess toallrelevant expertise, including support services where
necessary.
Determining appropriate strategies forsupporting cancer survivor-
shipshould bebased onthree keyelements: physical, psycho-social and
psychosexual. Evidence suggests, cancer survivorship programmes have
proven effective inimproving physical function, fatigue, anxiety and
depression [646] .Thechallenge remains toimplement thiseffectively in
ovarian cancer where thedisease isoften multi-faceted. Missing cancer
survivorship caredialogues withanunclear purpose ofthecancer sur-
vivorship careneeds assessment canleadtolackofaclear pathway for
women whohavecompleted treatment forovarian cancer.
Itisrecognised thatthere arepotential costsavings ifsurvivors are
effectively abletoself-manage, reducing theoverall burden onthe
healthcare system [647] .
Since longer-term survivorship care isbecoming increasingly
important intheoverall well-being ofpeople withovarian cancer, effort
should bemade tointroduce nurse-led survivorship clinics tosupport
holistic andindividualised approaches [648] .
Lack ofaninteractive survivorship discussion allows those with
ovarian cancer todecide howmuch theywishtoparticipate withregard
toongoing communication andinteractions. Without thisdialogue any
approach willremain unclear withpatients unfamiliar withwhat sup-
port(however, thismeets theirneeds) exists.
Physicalimpacts
Impact ofdisease andtreatment canhaveprofound andlong-lasting
effects onwomen withovarian cancer. Thisrequires adjustment andon-
going re-adjustment. Physical effects caninclude bowel andbladderE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123
104issues, pelvic painandmenopausal symptoms amongst many. Successful
survivorship programs should have apro-active andpatient guided
approach toimproving quality oflife(QoL) withwomen having guid-
ance torecognise concerning symptoms, supported byaresponsive
healthcare practitioner, allowing andenabling women tobemore active
participants intheircareandmanagement rather thanpassive recipients
ofatraditional clinical follow-up onlyapproach [649] .
Treatment-induced menopause mayhave asignificant impact on
women withovarian cancer, notonlyataphysical levelbutmenopause
should beconsidered atthepsychological andpsycho-sexual levels
when managing ovarian cancer survivors.
Abrupt onset ofmenopausal symptoms consequent tohypo-
estrogenemia aftercytoreductive surgery orgonadotoxic chemotherapy
caninduce hotflashes, mood changes, andvaginal dryness oratrophy
[650] .While systemic hormone therapy mayimprove many oftheis-
sues,thistreatment isnotappropriate forallpatients given theiraction
onoestrogen receptors. However, other non-hormonal treatments exist,
including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptics, natural
remedies, andpelvic floorphysical therapy [651] .
Itisrecommended thatallovarian cancer patients should undergo a
Health Needs Assessment andEndofTreatment summary ateachstage
oftheirovarian cancer treatment. Survivorship should beseenaspro-
active assessment andmanagement byfollow-up care providers,
including primary care. Inorder forthistobemeaningful, thisassess-
ment should notbeseenastokenistic formfilling, butpartofaliving,
active plantosupport individual needs [652] .
Many women willexperience lateeffects oftheir cancer treatment
which willrequire continuous andnewinformation about howtobest
manage them. Thechallenge isforproviders toofferinnovative ways of
offering suchservices tothose withovarian cancer, whilst meeting in-
formation needs forthewhole population, notjustEnglish-speaking,
computer literate patients. Consideration should begiven toonline
clinics, webinars andface-to-face clinics delivered byCNSs andCancer
Support Workers.
Psycho-Social impact
Asfarbackas1999, theNHSExecutive recognised thatthere were
twokeyelements tomanaging individuals withovarian cancer [168] .
Thiscomprised theearly detection ofrecurrent disease, butequally the
management ofphysical andpsychological morbidity.
There aremany ways inwhich cancer centres andunits should look
tomeet these needs. There isanincreasing emphasis onself-
management, butformany people withovarian cancer thismayoften
feeltooremote.
Ovarian cancer survivors often have highlevels ofdepression and
anxiety, commonly identifying fearofcancer recurrence (FCR) among
theirtopconcerns [653 –661].Ovarian cancer patients havehistorically
beenconcerned about taking uptoomuch timeatclinic appointments
withemotional concerns andtheliterature supports theviewthatCNSs
aresupportive with appropriate skills, knowledge andtime tohelp
address theirneeds [657] .
Consideration should begiven toimplementing telephone clinics to
support psychological management, although face-to-face appointments
may bepreferred, especially forthose from hardly-reached groups
(language andsocial barriers). Evidence hassuggested thisshould be
undertaken byanexperienced clinician [484] soastobegin theprocess
ofoffering personalised, tailored careasistheambition ofthecallfor
evidence inthe2022 NHSCancer Plan[658] .
Cancer unitsandhubsshould seektoimplement CNSreview (face-to-
faceandtelephone), tailored topatients ’individual needs [659] .CNSs
withlevel2counselling skills areideally placed tosupport patients for
assessment andinitial management ofpsychological morbidity [660] .
Evidence from breast cancer studies show thatintraditional clinical
follow-up there isoften littletimetomeetinformation andpsychosocial
needs [661] .Nurse-led review canform partoftheon-going, iterativeprocess ofHNAbetween bothCNSandCancer Support Worker.
Consideration should begiven toaligning withthird sector organi-
sations tohelpsupport survivorship programmes.
Sexuality/Sexual morbidity impact
Psychosexual issues following ovarian cancer areacommon side
effect, including increased vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, reduced
arousal anddesire, altered orgasm andsexual satisfaction, andreduced
pleasure [662,663] .Women alsocanexperience psychological chal-
lenges around their sexuality inrelation toaltered body image, femi-
ninity, lossofroleandinfertility [651,664] .
Information onpossible physical/psychological changes duetosur-
geryandchemotherapy should begiven tothepatient prior totreat-
ment, andthisshould include thesubject ofsexuality, withdetails of
further information resources should thepatients need toseekfurther
information ifdifficulties occur [665,666] .
Assexual difficulties mayhavemultifaceted causes including phys-
iological/biological, psychological, interpersonal andsocio-cultural
factors ajoint approach toaddressing problems should beadopted,
having amulti-disciplinary approach willhopefully allow clinicians the
safety toaddress thistopic andrefertooniftheissues arebeyond their
comfort orexpertise [663,667] .
Assessment andidentification ofsexual issues byclinicians canbe
performed efficiently andeasily withshort validated toolsusing astyle
ofinquiry which starts byacknowledging how common sexual
dysfunction isamongst cancer survivors rather than asking direct
questions [667] .Assessment tools/patient reported outcome measures
(PROMS) canhelptoidentify sexual difficulties, promote discussions
andmanagement ofsexual issues [668 –675].
Ifsexual difficulties arepresent these should beaddressed andwhere
possible specific suggestions given, e.g.psychosexual education, useof
lubrication during intercourse or vaginal moisturiser
[662,663,671 –673].Where available, patients withongoing difficulties
should bereferred topsychosexual services especially inwomen when
sexual difficulties arepersistent despite appropriate interventions and
where there arehighlevels ofindividual/couple distress, pre-existing
sexual problems andpsychological vulnerability prior todiagnosis.
Researchpriorities
Theformer NCRI Gynaecological group updated itspriorities for
gynaecological cancer: https://www.ncri.org.uk/wp-content/uploads
/NCRI-Gynaecological-Group-strategic-priorities_FINAL.pdf .
Keyareas ofinterest include:
≡Early detection andprevention ofovarian cancer inthegeneral
population
≡Improved biomarker ledtreatment options, particularly forthe
cohort ofpatients who donothave homologous recombination
deficiency andhave poorer overall outcomes andreduced respon-
siveness toPARP inhibitors.
≡Therapy options following prior treatment/ progression onaPARP
inhibitor.
≡Theroleofimmunotherapy inthetreatment ofovarian cancer also
remains tobeclearly defined, andalternative strategies, such as
vaccines, arebeing trialled.
≡Platinum resistant ovarian cancer remains anareawhere improved,

Research questions inprehabilitation andrehabillitation
Anexpert consensus group [674] recommended thefollowing areas
toadvance research insurgical prehabilitation byidentifying theroleof
exercise, nutritional optimization, andpsychological stress reduction inE.Mossetal.European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 300 (2024) 69–123

1.Determine theimpact ofprehabilitation onphysical andpsycho-
logical health inpatients withcancer
a.which patients aremostlikely tobenefit.
b.whether prehabilitation canincrease surgical candidacy inhigh-
riskpatients.
2.Determine theimpact ofprehabilitation on
a.health careutilization
b.perioperative complications.
c.themetabolic response tosurgery.
d.physical functioning.
e.timing ofrecommended oncologic treatment.
f.adherence torecommended oncologic treatment.
3.Characterize theperformance ofmeasures toassess baseline status
andevaluate effectiveness ofprehabilitation.
4.Identify procedure-specific prehabilitation assessments andin-
terventions forspecific patient populations.
TheWorld Health Organization (WHO) defines rehabilitation asaset
ofmeasures thatassist individuals, whoexperience orarelikely to
experience disability, toachieve andmaintain optimum functioning in
interaction withtheirenvironments [675] .
Recent research hasdemonstrated thatthere isahuge unmet need
forrehabilitation programs along thecontinuum ofthecancer trajectory
[676] .
