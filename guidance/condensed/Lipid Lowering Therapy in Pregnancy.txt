Table 2: Summary recommendations on use of lipid lowering therapies in Pregnancy.

Recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy in pregnancy include continuation of icosapent ethyl if already on it and consideration for starting in eligible individuals. Fibrates like fenofibrate are recommended for hypertriglyceridemia in pregnancy, especially in those with a history of pancreatitis or genetic issues causing high triglycerides. Omega-3 fish oils, such as OMACOR, can also be used for hypertriglyceridemia in pregnancy, particularly in those with a history of pancreatitis or genetic issues. High doses may be needed, but caution is advised due to safety concerns.
