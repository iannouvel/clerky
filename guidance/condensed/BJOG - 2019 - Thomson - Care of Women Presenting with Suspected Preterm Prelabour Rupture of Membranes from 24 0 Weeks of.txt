Key Recommendations:
- Diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of membranes made by maternal history followed by sterile speculum examination
- Consider IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test if no amniotic fluid observed on speculum examination
- Antibiotic (preferably erythromycin) given for 10 days or until established labor in PPROM
- Offer corticosteroids to women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestation
- Use clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis
- Offer expectant management until 37+0 weeks in women with no contraindications to continuing pregnancy
- Offer intravenous magnesium sulfate to women with PPROM in established labor between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks gestation

Background:
- PPROM complicates up to 3% of pregnancies and is associated with 30-40% of preterm births
- Median latency after PPROM is 7 days and shortens with advancing gestational age

Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis made by maternal history and sterile speculum examination
- Consider IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 test if no amniotic fluid observed
- Ultrasound for amniotic fluid volume unclear
- Testing for nitrazine not recommended
- Routine vaginal swab for microbiological testing

Assessment:
- Use clinical assessment, maternal blood tests, and fetal heart rate to diagnose chorioamnionitis
- Women advised and observed for symptoms of chorioamnionitis
- White cell count and C-reactive protein used to identify infection
- Vital signs recorded for inpatients, regular monitoring for outpatients

Involvement of Neonatologists:
- Neonatologists informed when PPROM diagnosis confirmed and delivery anticipated
- Women offered opportunity to meet with neonatologist antenatally

Management:
- Erythromycin given for 10 days following PPROM diagnosis
- Antenatal corticosteroids offered from 24+0 to 35+6 weeks gestation
- Consideration of individual basis for administration due to potential side effects

NG25 recommends that corticosteroids should be considered between 24+0 and 25+6 weeks’ gestation. Corticosteroids should be offered from at least 24+0 weeks’ gestation. In women with PPROM and planned preterm birth within 24 hours, magnesium sulfate should be offered between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation. Tocolysis is not recommended for patients with PPROM. Outpatient care for women with PPROM should be considered on an individual basis. Amnioinfusion is not recommended as routine practice for PPROM. Emotional support should be offered to women with PPROM and their partners. Expectant management until 37+0 weeks should be offered to women with PPROM after 24+0 weeks’ gestation. In subsequent pregnancies following PPROM, women should be cared for by an obstetrician with an interest in preterm birth. Further research is needed on various aspects of PPROM management. Auditable topics include offering antibiotics, corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and discussions with a neonatologist to women with PPROM.
