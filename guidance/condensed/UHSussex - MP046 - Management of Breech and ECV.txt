Management of Breech Presentation and ECV (RSCH PRH only) MP046

Breech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with the buttocks, legs, or feet in the lower uterine segment closest to the cervix. The incidence of breech presentation decreases with advancing gestational age. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are increased with breech presentation compared with cephalic presentation.

Types of breech presentation include frank or extended breech, complete or flexed breech, footling breech, and kneeling breech.

Pregnant individuals with suspected breech presentation should be monitored, and those with confirmed breech presentation should be offered external cephalic version (ECV). ECV should be booked at 36-37 weeks of gestation. The success rate of ECV is approximately 50%. Complementary therapies like moxibustion may be considered for breech presentation.

Absolute contraindications for ECV include conditions like placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, and abnormal fetal dopplers. ECV should be performed by trained obstetricians and monitored for complications.

Those declining ECV or with persistent breech presentation should be informed of their birth options, including planned caesarean section or vaginal breech birth. Risks to both the baby and the mother should be discussed, and individualized care plans should be developed.

Pregnant individuals choosing elective LSCS for breech presentation should be informed about the timing and potential risks. Those opting for vaginal breech birth should undergo antenatal assessment and be referred to appropriate clinics for care.

7.1.2 Thorough assessment for risk factors in planned vaginal breech birth is essential. Higher risk factors include hyperextended neck on ultrasound, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise. 
7.1.3 If any risk factor is identified, pregnant individuals should be counseled that planned vaginal birth is associated with increased perinatal risk and caesarean section is recommended. 
7.1.4 All information, discussions, decisions, and referrals should be documented clearly in the notes by the clinician providing care.
7.2 A detailed birth plan should be made with the pregnant individual following discussion with a consultant midwife and consultant obstetrician. 
7.3 Pregnant individuals should be recommended to have their labor and birth in an obstetric unit with access to theaters for immediate caesarean section and neonatal support. 
7.4 Pregnant individuals should be advised to phone the maternity unit immediately if they have spontaneous rupture of membranes or are concerned about fetal movements. 
7.5 Induction of labor is not recommended for babies in the breech position unless certain criteria are met. 
8.1 It is recommended to have a multidisciplinary team approach to labor and birth care for planned vaginal breech birth. 
8.2 Once labor is established, it is recommended to inform the necessary medical professionals and ensure plans of care are made with the mother, midwife, and obstetric team. 
8.3 All birthing individuals should be offered continuous CTG monitoring in established labor. 
8.4 Passage of fresh meconium during labor with a breech presentation may not require intervention if the CTG is normal. 
8.5 Maternal observations should be performed regularly throughout labor. 
8.6 An intravenous cannula is recommended on admission in labor for individuals with anticipated difficulty with IV access. 
8.7 Birthing individuals should be encouraged to adopt an upright position and be mobile in labor. 
8.8 All birthing individuals have the full range of pain relief options available to them. 
8.9 Birthing individuals should feel calm, in control, and supported during labor and birth. 
9 Management of undiagnosed breech presentation in labor should depend on various factors and informed consent. 
10 Progress in labor should be monitored closely, and slow progress in breech labors may require a low threshold for advising LSCS. 
11 General principles for care during the second stage of labor should include informing the full MDT, preparing for birth, and monitoring descent of the breech. 
12 Progressive descent of the breech in the second stage of labor is crucial, and interventions may be required if there is poor progress. 
13 Active second stage and assisted vaginal breech maneuvers may be necessary to expedite breech birth if there is evidence of poor fetal condition or delay in delivery.

The choice of manoeuvres used for delivery of the breech should depend on the experience and preference of the attending doctor or midwife. A semirecumbent or all-fours position may be adopted for delivery based on maternal preference and experience of the attendant. Involuntary pushing should not start until the breech is visible. Cord compression is common once the buttocks have passed the perineum. Traction should never be applied to the breech. Selective episiotomy is recommended. Signs of assistance during delivery include lack of tone or color. Delay with the body of the baby should be managed with gentle pressure on the legs. Delay with the arms may require Lovset's manoeuvre. Delay in delivery of the after-coming head may require the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre. Physiological breech birth is usually performed in the all-fours position. Planned caesarean section is recommended for preterm breech presentation. Caesarean section is recommended for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech. Organizational support for vaginal breech delivery should include skills and drills training. All doctors and midwives should attend skills and drills training in vaginal breech birth at least once per year.

- If opting for vaginal breech, please be aware that in some circumstances it will not be appropriate and you will be advised to have an emergency caesarean.
- Individual risk assessment must be quickly undertaken.
- We have discussed the risks of vaginal breech birth and caesarean section.
- Caesarean should be recommended for an unplanned vaginal breech presenting in the first stage of labor.
- Factors such as fetal hyperextended neck, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of fetal compromise may require a caesarean section.
- Maternal factors such as previous LSCS, raised BMI, maternal age >40 years, and other obstetric complications may also require a caesarean section.
