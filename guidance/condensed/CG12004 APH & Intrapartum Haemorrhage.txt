Antepartum & Intrapartum Haemorrhage Guideline, including antenatal management of placenta praevia & placenta accreta. Aim: Provide evidence-based guidance for pregnant women with various types of bleeding. Scope: For use by obstetricians, anaesthetists, midwives, and sonographers. Responsibilities: Clinicians to follow the guidance, management to ensure accessibility. Abbreviations used within this guidance: APH, EPAC, A&E, TVS, PAS, IR, PPH, BMI, CTG, DIC, HELLP, CS, IV, MEOWS, Us&Es, CCU, USS, FH, P, T, BP. Introduction: APH complicates 3-5% of pregnancies, major causes are placenta praevia and placental abruption. Definition: Bleeding from the genital tract between 24 weeks gestation and delivery. Causes: Placenta praevia, placental abruption, vasa praevia, local causes, undiagnosed, uterine rupture. Complications of APH & intrapartum haemorrhage: Maternal - anaemia, infection, shock, fetal death. Placenta praevia: Defined as bleeding from a placenta implanted in the lower uterine segment. Risk factors: Previous caesarean section, termination of pregnancy, smoking, multiple pregnancy. Diagnosis: Usually made at the routine anomaly ultrasound examination. Antenatal screening and management of placenta praevia: Diagnosis confirmed by transvaginal scan, patient information leaflet given.

Follow-up is necessary for individuals with placenta concerns. Asymptomatic individuals with suspected low-lying placenta should be rescanned at 32 weeks. Outpatient management for those with placenta praevia should consider various factors. Signs of placenta praevia include painless bleeding and a soft uterus. Acute management depends on bleeding amount, maternal and fetal condition, placenta location, and pregnancy stage. Corticosteroid therapy is recommended for those at risk of preterm birth. Morbidly adherent placenta risk factors include placenta praevia and previous Caesarean birth. Screening and management recommendations are provided for suspected cases. Placental abruption risk factors and signs are outlined, along with management strategies for minor and major cases. Vasa praevia diagnosis and management are discussed, emphasizing timely delivery in confirmed cases. Local causes of bleeding may include cervical issues.

- Pregnant women/people with recurrent bleeding should be referred to a senior obstetrician.
- Speculum examination should be performed for pregnant women/people with recurrent admissions for persistent bleeding of unknown origin to exclude cervical cancer.
- Pregnancies complicated by unexplained antepartum hemorrhage are at increased risk of adverse outcomes.
- In cases of intrapartum hemorrhage, possible causes should be considered and a physical examination should be carried out.
- Emergency management of acute antepartum and intrapartum hemorrhage should include early involvement of an anaesthetist if resuscitation is required.
- Patients with major antepartum or intrapartum hemorrhage are at increased risk of postpartum complications and should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
- Audit standards include evidence of consultant attendance at all cesarean sections for placenta previa and documented management plans for suspected or confirmed placenta previa or placenta accreta.
