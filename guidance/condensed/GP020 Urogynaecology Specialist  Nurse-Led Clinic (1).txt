Urogynaecology Specialist Nurse-Led Clinics GP020

Key Principles:
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope:
This guideline applies to the setup and carrying out of Urogynaecology Specialist Nurse-Led Clinics, including consent, confidentiality, documentation, communication, audit, research, team working, support, training, and care quality.

Responsibilities:
Urogynaecology Specialist Nurse and Urogynaecologists are responsible for following this guidance and using their professional judgement. Managers are responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to relevant staff.

Objective Standards/Introduction:
Nurse-led clinics improve patient care quality and efficiency. The role of the Urogynaecology Specialist Nurse is essential for Urogynaecology Unit Certification. Various clinics are provided, including Urinary Incontinence Triage Clinic, Free Flowmetry and Residual Volume Clinic, Telephone Urinary Incontinence Follow Up Clinic, Pessary Replacement Clinic, Post-operative Follow Up Clinic, Trial Without Catheter Clinic, Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation Clinic, and Intra-vesical Instillation Clinic.

Urinary Incontinence Triage Clinic:
Patients with specific features should be seen in the clinic. Patients with stress incontinence or overactive bladder are seen in the Nurse-led clinic, where they receive counseling and conservative measures.

Free Flowmetry and Residual Volume Clinic:
Some patients may require free flowmetry and residual urine volume estimation, which can be done by the Nurse. Tests are carried out to confirm normalcy or abnormality.

Telephone Urinary Incontinence Follow Up Clinic:
Patients on conservative measures can be followed up via phone. Follow-up intervals vary, and consultations should be conducted with patient confidentiality.

Pessary Replacement Clinic:
Pessary replacements can be done in the clinic, with patient symptoms and satisfaction documented. Changes in pessary size or type may be necessary over time.

Post-operative Follow Up Clinic:
Post-operative follow-up is essential for surgery safety and effectiveness. Patients should be provided with quality of life questionnaires and examined for complications.

Trial Without Catheter Clinic:
Patients who fail their Trial Without Catheter are discharged home with a catheter for a fresh attempt.
