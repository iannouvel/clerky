This guideline provides guidance on the OASI care bundle, perineal warming, recognition, classification, repair of perineal trauma, and wound infection/dehiscence. It covers assessing trauma, training, principles of repair, suture material, technique, analgesia, aftercare, referral pathways, record keeping, and perineal wound infection. Risk factors for OASI include Asian ethnicity, nulliparity, birth weight over 4kg, shoulder dystocia, and prolonged second stage of labor. The OASI care bundle includes informing pregnant women, episiotomy when indicated, manual perineal protection, and perineal warming. Episiotomy should be performed mediolaterally at a 60-degree angle at crowning. Manual perineal protection is a bimanual technique to prevent deep tears.

During birth, ensure no undue downward traction during the birth of the shoulders and support the perineum. Care should be taken during the birth of the shoulders, with the baby's body following the curve of Carus. Perineal examination should be carried out following all vaginal births, including a rectal examination. Tears should be classified according to RCOG guidelines and documented. Women with OASI-type tears in previous pregnancies should be supported by experienced staff during birth. Perineal repair should be performed by qualified midwives and obstetric medical staff. Assessment of perineal trauma should be immediate after the third stage of labor. Repair of third and fourth-degree tears should be done promptly to minimize the risk of infection and bleeding. Tears actively bleeding in water births should be sutured immediately. Only skin tears may be left unsutured, and labial tears should be repaired if deep or bleeding. Third and fourth-degree tears should be repaired in theatre under regional or general anesthesia. Management of labial and clitoral tears should involve good analgesia and consideration of aesthetic results. Repair of third and fourth-degree tears should be carefully documented and involve the obstetric consultant. Knots should be buried beneath superficial perineal muscles to prevent migration. Rectal and vaginal examinations should be performed post-repair to ensure integrity. Medications should be administered as necessary post-repair. Repair details should be clearly documented in the patient's records.

An Incident reporting form must be completed and the reference number documented on the OASI proforma on BadgerNet Maternity. Antibiotics should be administered at the time of the procedure, with specific dosages and options provided. Post-repair for 3rd- and 4th-degree tears involves specific recommendations for care and follow-up. Regular analgesia, high fiber diet, and pelvic floor exercises are also recommended. Referral and follow-up procedures are outlined for healthcare professionals. Prognosis and future births following repair are discussed, along with monitoring and incident reporting guidelines. Perineal wound dehiscence management and documentation requirements are detailed. Laxatives and analgesia options are provided for post-repair care. Record-keeping procedures for consent, repair, and post-care are outlined. Monitoring and audit recommendations are provided for OASI recognition and follow-up.
