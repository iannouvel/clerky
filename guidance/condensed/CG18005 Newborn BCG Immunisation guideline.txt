Newborn BCG Immunisation Guideline: This guideline provides evidence-based guidance for staff involved in the BCG Immunisation Programme for newborn babies. It aims to standardize the procedure for identifying neonates at risk of TB, referral, documentation, and vaccination. The selective neonatal BCG immunization program targets infants at increased risk of TB exposure and aims to reduce infections and transmission. Key responsibilities include accessing and following the guidance for healthcare professionals and ensuring the guideline is reviewed and accessible. The program aims to deliver safe, effective, and high-quality immunization, monitored by NHS England. The BCG vaccine is 70-80% effective against severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis in children. Infants in high-risk groups, such as those living in high TB incidence areas or with family members from high TB incidence countries, are eligible for BCG vaccination. The guideline outlines responsibilities for midwives, pediatricians, and management, as well as the process for BCG referral and administration. Staff should ensure timely vaccination, accurate documentation, and monitoring of outcomes.

Ensure all referrals are made and actioned. If no referral is received within 3 days of birth, check NIPE for BCG referral history. Run a report from NIPE per site of all BCG referrals for the month. BCG Vaccination is to be given to infants only by a nurse/midwife trained and competent in the administration of BCG immunisation. The baby must be identified by name, date of birth, and NHS number checked with the parent/carer and against PCHR red book and referral form. The nurse/midwife must ensure that the baby has been correctly identified as needing BCG vaccination using the definitions above. The nurse/midwife must check the result of SCID screening has been received. Check the exclusions and document consent from the parent/carer on the referral form. Post vaccination, the nurse/midwife must complete EPMA including batch number, product name, expiry, site & route of vaccine. The nurse/midwife must complete the referral form, the appropriate PCHR pages, and return them to the administrator. Post-vaccine advice leaflet should be discussed with the parent and given for reference. If there is no referral made present, reprint and complete relevant sections. Feedback is given to NIPE practitioner to avoid reoccurrence. Check each baby against Medway spreadsheet to ensure all referral and babies are accounted for. If no NBBS result received or baby is SCID detected, ensure an appointment for BCG is canceled. BCG not to be given if no SCID result available. All SCID suspected/detected results will be seen by an immunologist within 24 hrs in a specialist center for confirmatory testing. Contact baby's GP to establish the outcome of the immunologist appointment. Report data to PHE monthly, report any delays and mitigations. The injection should not be given or should be delayed if the baby has a high fever, is having treatment for cancer or other serious conditions that weaken the immune system, is HIV positive, is suffering from a generalized skin condition, is in receipt of passive antibodies, is currently receiving a course of steroids, no NBBS result received, SCID detected, or exposure to immunosuppression treatment in pregnancy or mother is breastfeeding. Infants considered at very low or low risk of HIV transmission may be given BCG following birth if indicated according to UK guidelines for HIV-unexposed infants. BCG vaccine dose for infants under 12 months of age is 0.05ml of the reconstituted vaccine strictly by intradermal injection. Infants and children over 12 months of age is 0.1ml of the reconstituted vaccine strictly by intradermal injection. The vaccine should be injected strictly intradermal normally into the lateral aspect of the left upper arm at the level of the insertion of the deltoid muscle. The parents/carers should be advised that a sore area may form, it may burst and leak fluid/blood; this is an expected reaction and should not cause alarm. BCG vaccine may be given concurrently with inactivated or live vaccines. No other vaccination should be given for at least three months in the arm used for BCG vaccination because of the risk of regional lymphadenitis. The number of babies vaccinated by 28 days and after 28 days will be monitored by key performance indicator statistics sent to Public Health England.

The BCG vaccine is a live vaccine that helps develop immunity against TB. It is given under the skin and should not make your baby feel unwell. Changes in advice allow the BCG vaccine to be given at any time, and further vaccinations should not be given in the same arm for three months. The injection leaves a white mark that will disappear, and a lump may appear later. Keep the area clean and do not use creams or lotions. Contact the TB Nursing Team if you have concerns.
