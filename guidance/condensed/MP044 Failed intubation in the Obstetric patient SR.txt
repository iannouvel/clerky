Failed Intubation in the Obstetric Patient (RSCH PRH only) MP044

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all people requiring general anesthesia in the peri-partum period.

Responsibilities: Anaesthetists, Midwives & Obstetricians are responsible for accessing, reading, understanding, and following this guidance, as well as using their professional judgment in the application of this protocol. Management Team is responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations, and ensuring the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff.

Background: Pregnant patients have unique physiological changes that require special considerations during general anesthesia, including rapid oxygen desaturation, increased risk of aspiration, increased risk of a difficult airway, and the need to consider both maternal and fetal status. The management of a difficult airway for anesthesia in pregnant patients requires an algorithmic approach. The OAA/DAS Guidelines provide algorithms for the management of the unanticipated difficult airway for pregnant patients.
