In the event of a maternal or birthing parent death, it is important to involve the coroner for death certification and release of the body. The family should be provided with support and information regarding funeral arrangements. For cases involving a surviving baby, the neonatal team must be informed urgently. It is crucial to establish legal parental responsibility for the baby and involve the father or person with parental responsibility in decision-making. Bereavement care should be provided for both the family and staff involved. Organ donation may be considered, and media involvement should be managed by the trust's communications team. Staff support and follow-up care for the partner and family are essential, including access to counseling services. Reflection, feedback, and shared learning should be encouraged among staff to improve future care. All maternal or birthing parent deaths are investigated locally and nationally for monitoring and audit purposes.
