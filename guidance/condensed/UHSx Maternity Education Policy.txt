The policy will be reviewed in line with national recommendations, service user input, and local learning. Compliance with core competency training and fetal monitoring assessment will be monitored regularly. Results will be analyzed, and action plans will be developed collaboratively by the maternity education team. The policy also includes a Due Regard Assessment Screening to ensure that planning, policies, and processes do not discriminate against service users, staff, or stakeholders. If potential discrimination is identified, it should be referred for further review. Staff are required to confirm their compliance with training, attendance at education days, and annual appraisal. A template dissemination, implementation, and access plan is provided to ensure staff awareness and compliance with the policy. Version control and additional guidance and information are also included in the policy.
