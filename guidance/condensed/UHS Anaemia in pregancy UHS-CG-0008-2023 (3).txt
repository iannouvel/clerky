Management of iron deficiency in pregnancy includes dietary advice, oral iron replacement, and intravenous iron therapy. Anaemia in pregnancy is diagnosed based on hemoglobin levels. 

Causes of anaemia in pregnancy include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and other inflammatory disorders. Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. 

Consequences of anaemia in pregnancy include higher risk of perinatal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and preterm birth. 

Screening for anaemia should be done at booking and 28 weeks, with treatment initiated if hemoglobin levels are below certain thresholds. 

Women and people at high risk for iron deficiency should receive prophylactic iron or have serum ferritin checked. Red cell indices and ferritin levels are used to diagnose iron deficiency. 

Dietary advice should be given to all pregnant women and people to meet increased iron requirements during pregnancy.

Daily intake of iron during pregnancy is 27 mg, twice that of a non-pregnant person. Iron-rich foods include meat, nuts, beans, dried fruit, whole grains, fortified cereals, soybean flour, and dark green leafy vegetables. Oral iron supplementation is needed once iron deficiency occurs. Oral iron replacement therapy should be recommended if anemia is diagnosed, with a recommended elemental iron dose of 40-80 mg each morning or alternate day. Side effects of oral iron include gastric irritation, nausea, and disturbed bowel function. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, with further checks depending on the degree of anemia and gestational period. Intravenous iron therapy can be considered in cases of non-compliance, intolerance to oral preparations, malabsorption, GI diseases, or poor response to oral iron. IV iron therapy should not be administered out of hours to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Contraindications include a history of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, first trimester of pregnancy, acute or chronic bacteremia, and decompensated liver disease. Ferric Derisomaltose Pharmacosmos is the preparation used for IV iron therapy. Techniques to minimize the risk of iron staining during infusion should be followed. Management of hypersensitivity reactions and iron extravasation is important. Efforts should be made to maximize management at birth.

Prioritize iron infusion for pregnant individuals with Hb <100 approaching term to reduce the risk of postpartum complications. Consider IV iron therapy or blood transfusion for those with moderate symptoms of anaemia. Monitor Hb levels postpartum and offer oral iron replacement if needed. Consider blood transfusion only after careful evaluation and explore alternative treatments. Ensure patients are informed of the risks and benefits of transfusion and document discussions and consent.
