Epidurals in Labour MP042

Key Principles:
- A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action.
- Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope:
- Applies to women and people having epidurals in labour and those with complications from epidurals during childbirth.

Responsibilities:
- Midwives, Anaesthetists & Obstetricians are responsible for following the guidance and using professional judgment.
- Management is responsible for reviewing the protocol as required and ensuring accessibility to relevant staff.

Indications for Epidural Analgesia:
- Maternal or parental request for analgesia.
- Obstetric or foetal indications that may increase the need for regional analgesic block.
- Medical indications in the mother or birthing parent where reduced stress may be beneficial.

Contraindications to Epidural Analgesia:
- Local or systemic sepsis, clotting disturbances, hypovolemia, etc.
- Allergy to amide local anaesthetics.

Responsibilities:
- Midwives must provide unbiased information, check platelet count, ensure correct equipment, and request anaesthetist review.
- Anaesthetists explain the procedure, gain consent, establish analgesia, and prescribe drugs.

Equipment:
- Working IV access, dedicated epidural pump, oxygen, resuscitation trolley, etc.

Eating and Drinking:
- Clear fluids and light carbohydrate foods are acceptable for most, with restrictions in some cases.

On-going Management of Epidurals:
- Analgesia is maintained using PCEA mode, with self-administration encouraged.
- Bolus top-up may be considered if pain persists.

Maternal or parental and fetal monitoring:
- Pulse, blood pressure, block distribution, and motor function should be monitored regularly.
- Continuous fetal heart monitoring and palpation of contractions are essential.

- If unable to void, catheter should be sited to prevent urinary retention  
- Consider re-catheterisation post-delivery for 6 hours  
- Complications of epidural analgesia may include hypotension, bradycardia, local anaesthetic toxicity, accidental dural puncture, intrathecal catheter, and neurological injury  
- Immediate emergency resuscitative management for hypotension or bradycardia includes oxygen, IV fluids, and stopping epidural infusion  
- High block symptoms require stopping epidural pump and urgent anaesthetic review  
- Local anaesthetic toxicity symptoms include metallic taste, confusion, and respiratory muscle paralysis  
- Accidental dural puncture management includes re-siting epidural or giving intrathecal dose of local anaesthetic  
- Post-dural puncture headache may require blood patch for treatment  
- Post-partum headache may be due to fatigue, dehydration, or dural puncture  
- All women with suspected dural puncture should have this communicated to their GP  
- Post-natal review for headache after regional anaesthesia should include details of procedure and blood patch date  
- Contact hospital if further problems arise  
- Further discharge summary will be provided by obstetricians
