Triage of Maternity Patients Guideline

Aims of this guideline:
- Facilitate service for urgent non-scheduled obstetric assessment
- Standardize care using BSOTS system
- Ensure appropriate escalation if needed
- Discharge women/individuals appropriately

Scope: Midwives, Obstetricians, Maternity and Health Care Assistants

Responsibilities:
- Staff to access, understand, and apply guidance
- Division to review guideline as required
- Division to ensure accessibility to all relevant staff

Abbreviations: BSOTS, MEOWS, TAC, MIS, ADAU, APH, SROM, ANC, IOL, CMW

Introduction and key points:
- Maternity Triage prioritizes care based on clinical needs
- Uses BSOTS system for standardized assessment and prioritization

Telephone Triage:
- Women/people advised to attend Triage with recommended timeframe
- Telephone assessment using BSOTS standard form
- Referral criteria for Maternity Calls used for appropriate area referral

BSOTS Process:
- Standardized Initial Triage Assessment within 15 minutes
- Use of symptom-specific algorithms for clinical priority
- Recommended timeframes for treatment based on urgency

Antenatal Triage:
- Initial assessment in Labour Ward Triage Room
- Assessment by BSOTS Midwife using standard protocol
- Follow-up care and investigations done promptly

This condensed version focuses on the key points of the guideline without the extraneous details.

Assessment Card

The Antenatal Triage Assessment Card (TAC card) provides a concise summary of the triage assessment and should include:

- Maternal/Birthing Parent name, DOB, and Hospital number
- Date and time of arrival and initial assessment in triage, along with the midwife's name and PIN/stamp
- Gestation, gravity/parity, and blood group
- Summary of symptoms on arrival, relevant medical, obstetric, social, and lifestyle history, current pregnancy, medications, and allergies
- Assessment including temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, urinalysis, and pain levels
- Assessment of the fetus, including lie, presentation, pattern of fetal movements, and fetal heart rate
- Using symptom-specific algorithms to determine the category of urgency (red, orange, yellow, green)
- Immediate plan of care

BSOTs Algorithms

Based on presenting symptoms and observations, each algorithm provides the category of urgency for each reason for attendance (red/orange/yellow/green).

Clinical staff can use their clinical judgment to decide on the category of urgency, but it should only be used to increase the category, not lower it.

Subsequent immediate care (in the main Triage area/Labour Ward) details the care required based on the category of urgency and presenting problem.

Communication, Handover, and Escalation

Handover and transfer of care should be direct from one healthcare professional to another, ideally in person or by telephone if not possible.

Effective communication is essential for promoting maternity safety, with structured handover based on the SBAR tool.

Any delays or breaches in initial assessments should be escalated to the Labour Ward Co-ordinator.

Communication with the woman

Midwives and obstetricians should reassure the woman that information has been passed on and consider re-capping the history if needed.

An appropriate translation service should be used for non-English speaking patients.

BSOTs Staffing requirements

Staffing numbers and skill mix should be adjusted based on the workload in the maternity triage department to ensure initial triage is done within 15 minutes of arrival.

Antenatal Day Assessment Unit (ADAU)

Assessment of women requiring review in ADAU should be documented in the handheld Antenatal record and MIS, with medical obstetric review requested if indicated.

Neonatal referrals from the community

Babies requiring hospital review/admission should follow the referral pathway from the community.

Audit

Monitoring includes the number of women seen within certain timeframes and red flags for delays in triage.

- High temperature
- Extreme fatigue
- If persistently over 37.8, advise to call 111 or attend A+E
- Call 111 if symptoms are getting worse
- Observations: Ask them to take their pulse and check their saturations when sitting and standing
- Decision for admission to labour ward should be made as an MDT
- VTE RISK ASSESSMENT: All COVID+ pregnant people must be assessed for thromboprophylaxis
- RED FLAG SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS THAT REQUIRE PATIENT TO BE REVIEWED: Being unable to complete a sentence at rest, blue lips, audible wheeze, needing to lean forward to breathe, O2 saturations <93%, chest pain
- Ensure pregnant people stay hydrated and mobile if self-isolating at home
- Pregnant people hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 should be offered thromboprophylaxis for 10 days following discharge
- GROWTH SCAN AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT IN ANC: Timing based on symptoms started or positive swab
- Escalation pathway when women/people raise concerns with their care: Contact appropriate healthcare professional based on concern
- Telephone triage of early pregnancy vaginal bleeding: Referral to EPAC based on symptoms and severity
