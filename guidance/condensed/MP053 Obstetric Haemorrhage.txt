Agreed Definitions of Obstetric Hemorrhage:
- Minor Antepartum Hemorrhage: Episode of bleeding of less than 50mls from the genital tract during pregnancy (after 24 weeks gestation) and prior to birth of the baby
- Major Antepartum Hemorrhage: Episode of bleeding of more than 50mls from the genital tract during pregnancy (after 24 weeks gestation) and prior to birth of the baby or when clinical signs are suggestive of significant concealed bleeding
- Minor Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage: The loss of 500-1000mls of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birth of a baby
- Major Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage: The loss of over 1000mls of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birth of a baby
- Massive Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage: The sudden and continuing blood loss of 2 liters or more

Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH):
Causes include normal physiological changes to the cervix, local conditions of the cervix, mild trauma, placental abruption, placenta praevia, and vasa praevia. Management involves clinical review, maternal observations, fetal heart auscultation, and assessment of vaginal loss.

Placenta Praevia:
Antenatal care includes referral to a Consultant Obstetrician, documentation of placenta praevia grade, counseling on risks, and elective caesarean for asymptomatic cases. Emergency delivery protocols involve Consultant Obstetrician presence, oxytocin administration, and neonatology support.

Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH):
Risk assessment and care planning should consider antenatal and intrapartum factors, with individualized care plans for women with risk factors. Effective communication and responsibilities are essential for managing obstetric hemorrhage.

Clear communication between healthcare professionals is essential in managing obstetric hemorrhage. The labor ward coordinator should ensure important information is communicated to the team. Immediate resuscitative management should be initiated by the obstetric and anesthetic teams. In cases of massive hemorrhage, a specific protocol should be followed to achieve resuscitation and hemostasis. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and coagulation parameters is crucial. Blood products should be requested urgently as needed. Women who decline blood products should be managed according to trust policy, with careful consideration of potential risks. Antenatal care should involve discussions with women who may refuse blood transfusion to develop individualized care plans. Regular monitoring of blood parameters and iron stores is important during pregnancy.

- An FBC should be performed prior to discharge home
- Thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is arrested and coagulopathy is corrected
- Debriefing should be performed by a senior member of the team involved
- A datix needs to be completed for all obstetric haemorrhages over 1500ml
