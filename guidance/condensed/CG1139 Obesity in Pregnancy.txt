This guideline provides clear guidance for staff in the management of obesity during pregnancy, labor, and postnatal periods to minimize complications associated with obesity. It is intended for use by midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and support staff. Obesity in pregnancy is associated with increased risks, including miscarriage, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia. Recommendations in this guideline are based on BMI classifications, with specific care pathways outlined for different BMI levels. Pregnant women and birthing people with obesity should be monitored closely for complications and offered appropriate care. Thromboembolism risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis are also important considerations. Manual handling requirements and tissue viability assessments should be conducted for pregnant women and birthing people with obesity to ensure appropriate equipment and care are provided.
