Cervical Cerclage
Green-top Guideline No. 75
June 2022
1. Key recommendations
- Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage.
- Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth may be offered cerclage if the cervix is 25mm or less at gestations less than 24 weeks.
- For women with a singleton pregnancy and no other risk factors for preterm birth, insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women who have a short cervix incidentally identified on a late second trimester ultrasound scan.
- In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be considered.
- In women with a singleton pregnancy, insertion of an emergency cerclage may delay birth and reduce the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation.
- The choice of transvaginal cerclage technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon, but the cerclage should be placed as high as possible.
2. Background and scope
Cerclage remains a standard option for prophylactic intervention in women at risk of preterm birth and second trimester fetal loss.
3. Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.
4. Definitions
- History-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth.
- Ultrasound-indicated cerclage: Insertion of a cerclage in cases of cervical length shortening seen on transvaginal ultrasound.
- Emergency cerclage: Insertion of cerclage in the case of premature cervical dilatation with exposed fetal membranes.
- Transvaginal cerclage: A purse-string suture at the cervical isthmus junction.
- Transabdominal cerclage: A suture placed via laparotomy or laparoscopy at the cervicoisthmic junction.
- Occlusion cerclage: Occlusion of the external os by placement of a continuous non-absorbable suture.
5. History-indicated cerclage
- Women with three or more previous preterm births should be offered history-indicated cerclage.
- History-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with less than three previous preterm births without additional risk factors.
6. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage
- Insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women with a short cervix incidentally identified on ultrasound.

An ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical shortening in women with a history of second trimester loss or preterm birth reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks gestation. Cerclage is not recommended for funnelling of the cervix without cervical shortening. Serial sonographic surveillance may help identify women who may benefit from cerclage. Cerclage is not recommended for multiple pregnancies or in women with Mullerian anomalies or previous cervical surgery. Further research is needed in these areas.

Cerclage is effective in women with a raised BMI. In women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be discussed and considered. Laparoscopic and open abdominal cerclage have similar efficacy. Decisions on care and treatment in cases of delayed miscarriage or fetal death in women with an abdominal cerclage can be difficult and should be aided by a senior obstetrician. The decision to place an emergency suture should be individualized, taking the parents' views carefully into account. The contraindications to cerclage insertion are active preterm labor, clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, continuing vaginal bleeding, PPROM, evidence of fetal compromise, lethal fetal defect, and fetal death. Before cerclage insertion, women should be informed of potential complications.

Women should be informed of potential complications associated with cerclage insertion, including PPROM, second trimester loss, preterm labour, infection, bleeding, and bladder or cervical damage. Complications such as bladder damage, cervical trauma, membrane rupture, and bleeding are rare. Cerclage insertion is associated with an increased risk of maternal pyrexia but not chorioamnionitis, PPROM, or induction of labour. Women should receive appropriate information before cerclage insertion. Investigations before insertion should include a first-trimester ultrasound and screening for aneuploidy. Amniocentesis before rescue or ultrasound-indicated cerclage is not routinely recommended. Perioperative tocolysis is not recommended, and the choice of anaesthesia should be made on a case-by-case basis. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of cerclage placement should be at the discretion of the operating team. Cerclage can be performed as a day-case procedure. The choice of suture material and technique should be at the discretion of the surgeon. Additional cervical occlusion suture is not routinely recommended.

Pregnancy and cervical length less than 25mm between 16 and 23 weeks were randomized to McDonald cerclage or no cerclage. Outcomes of women who underwent cerclage were analyzed by the type of suture material comparing polyester braided thread to mersilene tape. Rates of preterm birth less than 35 weeks were similar between polyester braided thread and mersilene tape. An RCT is currently ongoing assessing the type of suture material. Two RCTs have been performed comparing the efficacy of single versus double cerclage. Limited data exist on the role of cervical occlusion at the time of cerclage. Adjuvant management such as bed rest, sexual intercourse, serial sonographic surveillance of cervical length, fetal fibronectin testing, and progesterone supplementation following cerclage should be individualized based on clinical circumstances. There is no evidence to recommend abstinence from sexual intercourse following cerclage insertion. Routine fetal fibronectin testing post-cerclage is not recommended. Routine use of progesterone supplementation following cerclage is not recommended. There is no evidence that progesterone or Arabin pessary alone are more or less effective than cervical cerclage. A transvaginal cervical cerclage should be removed before labor, usually between 36+1 and 37+0 weeks of gestation. In women with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks, the cerclage should be removed.

Delayed removal of cerclage until labor or birth is indicated is not recommended due to increased risk of maternal/fetal sepsis. Data from a study suggest that leaving the cerclage in place may lead to higher rates of chorioamnionitis. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes before 23 or after 34 weeks of gestation, delayed removal of cerclage is unlikely to be beneficial.
