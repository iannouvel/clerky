Maternal & In Utero Transfers

Key Principles:
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action.

Scope:
This protocol applies to all members of staff dealing with women being transferred during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods.

Responsibilities:
Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations.

Maternal Transfer by Ambulance:
Formal local multidisciplinary arrangements are essential to ensure the safe transfer of women in the antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods.

In Utero/Maternal Transfer:
Indications for transfer include symptoms and/or signs of pre-term labor and specific risk factors. A thorough clinical assessment should be performed before deciding on in utero transfer.

Transfer Site to Site:
Communication between sites is vital in the management planning for transferring women. The decision to transfer should be well-documented in the maternal notes.

Transfer Off site:
For transfers to another Trust, agreements should be sought from accepting units. Maternity notes should accompany the woman on the transfer.

Agreed Process for Contacting the Ambulance Service:
Midwives should dial 999 in emergencies and inform the woman of the need for transfer. Immediate emergency or urgent treatment should be instigated as required.

Transfer to ITU/HDU:
The decision to transfer a woman to HDU or ITU is made jointly by Obstetric and Anaesthetic Consultants. Handover of care should be documented using the SBAR systematic tool.

Transferring Women in the Postnatal Period:
Unwell women should be advised to call an ambulance for transfer to delivery suite. Documentation of the transfer process is essential.

Labour ward transfer procedures include completion of paperwork, documentation of care given, and referrals made to appropriate staff. Situations requiring emergency transfer include delays in labor progress, fetal compromise, maternal collapse, and specific medical conditions. Transfer procedures involve obtaining consent, coordinating with the neonatal unit, and ensuring documentation is complete. Staff must be prepared for transfer and follow specific documentation requirements.
