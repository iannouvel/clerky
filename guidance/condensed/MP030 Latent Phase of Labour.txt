Latent Phase of Labour Protocol MP030 at Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals applies to those in latent phase in all care settings. Responsibilities include midwives and obstetricians following the guidance. Key principles include respecting women's wishes and involvement in decision making. Care in the latent phase involves early assessment, telephone advice, and encouraging normal activities. Monitoring fetal movements and administering analgesia options are also important. Prolonged latent phase may require interventions and monitoring. Fetal heart monitoring is crucial, especially for those requiring analgesia. Morphine sulfate may be used in the latent phase for pain relief. Side effects and contraindications of opiate use should be considered.

Consult an obstetrician as required. Morphine sulphate 10mg/5mL (Oramorph) should be the option of choice as much as possible. Morphine sulphate 10mg/5mL (Oramorph) must not be used for women with Opiate or Morphine allergies or sensitivities. Morphine sulphate 10mg/5mL (Oramorph) must not be used on women whose babies have IUGR (intra-uterine growth restriction).
