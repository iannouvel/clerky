Laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer is safe and effective, provided proper arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent, and audit. Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary gynaecological oncology team. Advanced laparoscopic skills are required, with additional training recommended. The procedure aims to provide a less invasive option with shorter recovery times compared to open surgery. Conversion to laparotomy rates vary but postoperative complications are fewer with laparoscopic hysterectomy. Further data on long-term outcomes would be beneficial for future reviews.
