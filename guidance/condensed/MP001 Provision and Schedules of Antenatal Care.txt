7.3 The referral will be reviewed by the A/N lead midwife who will identify risk factors and offer service users appointments in antenatal clinic to meet with the obstetric team, or specialist midwife as appropriate. An appointment will be generated by the ward clerks, put on the maternity computer system and sent to service users by post with an appointment time, date and location.

7.4 The process for arranging the availability of health notes from previous pregnancies that are required for review by clinicians: all service users notes from previous pregnancies are requested from the main medical library and sent to the maternity unit storage for easy access.

7.6 If service users have identified neonatal risk factors, a referral to a Neonatal Consultant should be generated for care planning and discussion regarding the implications of this risk factor.

7.10 Risk assessment for pre-eclampsia should be undertaken by midwives at booking. Service users will be deemed to be high, moderate, or low risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

9 The first antenatal contact or 'booking' visit is the most important and detailed of all visits and gives an opportunity to assess general health and to start making forward-looking plans for pregnancy, birth, and parenthood. It is considered to be part of the clinical risk assessment process. 

11 It is the responsibility of the midwife undertaking the booking assessment to ensure that the midwife completes antenatal booking form on BadgerNet, an accurate history is taken and documented, a full risk assessment must be recorded and referrals made appropriately, and give the pregnant person an overview of the antenatal schedule and how the information & notes are intended to be used.
