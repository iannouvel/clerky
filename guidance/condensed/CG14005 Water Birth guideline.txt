Water Birth Guideline: To provide guidance for staff supporting pregnant women/people choosing water birth. Immersion in water can provide effective pain relief during labor. Pregnant women/people who choose water birth experience benefits such as shorter labors and less pain relief. Criteria for using a pool include low-risk pregnancy, singleton pregnancy, and spontaneous onset of labor. Management of labor in water includes maintaining pool temperature and monitoring maternal and fetal observations. Delivery in water should be hands-off, with no need to feel for the cord. Post-delivery care includes monitoring maternal and baby's temperature and examining the perineum.

Indications to leave the pool during labor include maternal pyrexia, hypertension, meconium-stained liquor, maternal request, significant blood loss, concerns regarding fetal heart rate, opioid analgesia or epidural, prolonged first or second stage, and excessive contamination. In the event of an obstetric emergency resulting in maternal collapse, steps for emergency evacuation from the pool should be followed. Audit suggestions include documenting antenatal discussions for those wishing to use the birthing pool, monitoring pool water temperature, and ensuring delayed perineal suturing if required.
