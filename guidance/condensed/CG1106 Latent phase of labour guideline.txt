Summary: This guideline provides clear guidance for midwives on caring for women in the latent phase of labor, focusing on emotional and physical support. It includes definitions of the latent and established first stages of labor, responsibilities of staff, and criteria for clinical assessment. Antenatal education, telephone advice, and fetal heart rate auscultation are also covered. Considerations include the importance of listening to and responding sensitively to women's experiences during this phase.

During the latent phase of labor, women should be encouraged to stay at home and carry on with normal activities for as long as they can. The midwife should advise on pain management techniques such as breathing exercises, immersion in water, and massage. Women can also use aromatherapy, yoga, or acupressure for pain relief. While at home, women should stay active, use distractions like music or TV, and consider using a TENS machine for discomfort. They can also try different positions, use hot water bottles, and focus on breathing techniques. If further analgesia is needed, options like Paracetamol, codeine-based tablets, or opiates may be offered in a hospital setting. Women should be informed of the potential side effects of opioids. Sedatives like Temazepam may be considered for lack of sleep. All women should be advised of symptoms requiring immediate contact with healthcare providers.
