Management of Suspected Ovarian Masses in Premenopausal Women
This guideline provides information for clinicians on the initial assessment and management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women. It clarifies when referral to a gynaecological oncologist is necessary and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and referral for improved outcomes. Conservative management and laparoscopic techniques are recommended for benign ovarian masses, with referral to a gynaecological oncologist for suspicious cases. Serum CA-125 levels and ultrasound findings are key factors in assessing the risk of malignancy. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and ultrasound rules can aid in estimating the risk of malignancy without relying solely on CA-125 levels. Women with specific ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy should be referred to a gynaecological oncology service. Other guidelines from the USA and Canada also provide recommendations for managing premenopausal women with pelvic masses. Asymptomatic women with small simple ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly.

Women with simple ovarian cysts of 50â€“70 mm in diameter should have yearly ultrasound follow-up, and those with larger simple cysts should be considered for further imaging or surgical intervention. Persistent or increasing ovarian cysts may warrant surgical management, especially in cases of mature cystic teratomas. Combined oral contraceptives do not help in the treatment of functional ovarian cysts. The laparoscopic approach is preferred for elective surgical management of ovarian masses, with lower morbidity and quicker recovery time. Laparoscopic management of presumed benign ovarian cysts should be done by experienced surgeons. Aspiration of ovarian cysts is less effective and has a high rate of recurrence. Spillage of cyst contents should be avoided to prevent potential malignancy. The possibility of removing an ovary should be discussed preoperatively. Removal of benign ovarian masses should be done via the umbilical port for better outcomes. Audit topics include unexpected malignancy after laparoscopic surgery and complications following surgery for ovarian cysts.
