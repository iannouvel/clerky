Small risk of neoplastic change. Recommended Regimen: Ultrapotent topical steroids like Clobetasol proprionate. Maintenance treatment may be required with weaker steroid preparations. Vaginal corticosteroids may be used in more severe cases. Alternative regimens may include ultra-potent topical steroids with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Topical steroids are safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Referral to a vulval clinic is recommended for erosive disease or recalcitrant cases. Follow-up at 2-3 months is advised. Biopsy should be performed in non-responsive cases. 

Vulval eczema: Avoidance of precipitating factors is recommended. Use of emollient soap substitute and topical corticosteroids are advised. Follow-up as clinically required. 

Lichen simplex: Avoidance of precipitating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and anxiolytic antihistamines may be used. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful. Follow-up as clinically required. 

Vulval psoriasis: Avoidance of irritating factors and use of emollient soap substitute are recommended. Topical corticosteroids and coal-tar preparations may be used. Follow-up as clinically required. 

Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN): Referral for colposcopy is recommended. Treatment options include local excision, imiquimod cream, or vulvectomy. Follow-up is mandatory. 

Vulval pain: Vulvodynia is defined as vulvar discomfort without visible findings. Treatment depends on the type of vulvodynia.

Aetiology: Likely multifactorial, with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis as a common feature.

Clinical Features: Vulval pain, focal tenderness, no signs of acute inflammation.

Complications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.

Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis based on history and examination.

Management: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.

Follow-up: As clinically required, long-term follow-up and psychological support may be necessary.

Unprovoked Vulvodynia: Aetiology unknown, managed as a chronic pain syndrome.

Clinical Features: Longstanding unexplained pain, may be associated with urinary symptoms.

Complications: Sexual dysfunction, psychological morbidity.

Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis after excluding other causes.

Management: Exclude other treatable causes before further investigation. Multidisciplinary approach to patient care recommended.
