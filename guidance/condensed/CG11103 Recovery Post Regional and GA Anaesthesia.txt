Recovery following Regional and General Anaesthesia Guideline (Maternity)
Summary statement: The purpose of this guideline is to provide good practice evidence for staff recovering women following all types of anaesthetic.

Purpose: To provide evidence-based guidance on the post anaesthetic care of women following caesarean section (CS) and other obstetric procedures.

Scope: This guideline applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, maternity recovery staff, operating department practitioners, and maternity assistants.

Responsibilities: Midwives, obstetricians, and management are responsible for accessing, understanding, and following this guidance.

Equipment: Minimum equipment required includes a blood pressure monitor, oxygen saturation monitor, thermometer, oxygen and breathing system, suction equipment, and infusion devices.

Monitoring and observations: Continuous observation and recording of vital signs are necessary following general or regional anaesthesia until the woman is stable and conscious. Specific observations and monitoring protocols are outlined for each type of anaesthesia.

Ongoing care in the recovery area: Care must be taken to ensure intravenous cannulas are patent, medications are administered as prescribed, and the woman is not left unattended.

Discharge and subsequent transfer to postnatal ward: Criteria for discharge from the recovery area must be met before transferring the woman to the postnatal ward. 

Pressure area care, further postnatal care, training, and audit/monitoring are also addressed in the guideline.

• Recovery care should be continued until full care is handed over to the midwife.
• Discharge criteria include consciousness, clear airway, stable cardiovascular system, adequate analgesia, and removal of pressure dressings.
• Postnatal care should include monitoring temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, as well as offering support for breastfeeding and care of the baby.
• Refer complications of anesthesia to obstetric anaesthetist.
• Training for recovery care is evidenced in the Maternity Training Needs Analysis.
• Audit points include completion of vital signs and MEOWS chart documentation during recovery care.
