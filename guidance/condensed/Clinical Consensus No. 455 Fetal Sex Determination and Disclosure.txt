Abstract:
This guideline provides guidance on ultrasound review of the fetal perineum, fetal sex determination, and disclosure for all individuals with ongoing pregnancies. It emphasizes the importance of prenatal diagnosis of fetal genital anomalies, knowledge of fetal sex, and adherence to parental wishes.

Good Practice Statements:
1. Health care providers should respect parental wishes regarding fetal sex disclosure.
2. Efforts should be made to determine fetal sex during obstetric ultrasound examinations.
3. Re-examination or referral is recommended if fetal sex cannot be determined.
4. Reports should contain a visible alert regarding the presence of information on fetal sex.

Conclusion:
Fetal genitalia assessment is crucial in the routine second-trimester obstetric ultrasound, and determination of fetal sex should be respected and communicated directly to patients. A bolded alert in reports indicates the inclusion of fetal sex information. Re-examination or referral is recommended if fetal sex cannot be determined.
