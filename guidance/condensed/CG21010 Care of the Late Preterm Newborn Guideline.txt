Late preterm infants require additional support during their transition to the extra-uterine environment. Skin-to-skin contact after birth is crucial for stabilizing vital signs and promoting breastfeeding. It is important to monitor blood glucose levels and weight, and to follow guidelines for admission to transitional care. Parents should be encouraged to actively participate in their baby's care during this time.

Breastfeeding guidelines emphasize feeding within the first hour after birth, with skin-to-skin contact. If the baby does not feed, hand express and give colostrum. Minimum of 3 hourly feeds are recommended. Late preterm babies require extra care and monitoring due to their susceptibility to complications. Observations and thermal care are essential. Blood glucose monitoring, jaundice checks, and weighing are important. Specific breastfeeding support is needed for late preterm infants, with emphasis on frequent feeding and proper positioning. Inefficient feeding and insufficient milk intake should be addressed promptly.

Late preterm babies may require additional milk supplementation if they are showing signs of inadequate feeding (e.g. reduced wet and/or dirty nappies). Observing breastfeeding for latch, suck, and swallow is important. Increasing the frequency of breastfeeds and supplementing with expressed breast milk can help improve weight gain. It is essential to ensure the baby is feeding effectively and to increase expressing frequency if needed. Triple feeding regimens may be effective but may not be sustainable for all mothers. Babies should be reviewed after 24-48 hours of a new feeding plan to monitor weight loss and output. Paced bottle feeding is recommended for late preterm babies to prevent overfeeding. Discharge criteria include successful feeding, temperature stability, and weight gain. Community midwifery care should include a feeding assessment and support for parents. Neonatal outreach care may be necessary for babies with specific criteria. Parents should be informed about the unique needs of late preterm babies and provided with resources for ongoing support.

Appendix 1: Referral Pathway from Community <28 Days (readmission)
If observations normal and issues are feeding or weight loss related admit to TANGMERE or BRAMBER Ward. Babies over 72 hrs of age with jaundice, feeding concerns, or excessive weight loss should be directed to TANGMERE or BRAMBER Ward. Follow jaundice/weight loss guidance and liaise with the Infant Feeding Team. Regular pediatric review is required, with admission to Howard or Bluefin Ward if unwell. In cases of jaundice within 24 hrs of age, immediate referral to NNU - SRH/Bluefin - WH is necessary. If the baby is unwell with floppy, unresponsive, hypothermic, or respiratory concerns, call 999 and inform a pediatrician for referral readmission. Pediatrician should be informed of any readmission. 

Appendix 2: Observations and Feeding Plan from Birth of Late Preterm Infant
Late Preterm Birth 35-36+6 weeks gestation should include feeding within the first hour in skin contact, uninterrupted skin-to-skin, and assessment of the newborn every 30 minutes for 2 hours until stable. Observations should be carried out once per shift and every 4 hours for 24 hours. Pulse oximetry is required after 4 hours of age at NIPE only if there are concerns. If the baby does not feed, hand express and give colostrum via syringe. Blood glucose should be measured at 2 hours of age before transfer to the ward. Feeding should occur 3 hourly from the start of each feed, with 3x Pre Feed BMs.

Appendix 3: Late Preterm Hypoglycemia Pathway
For BG ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, give 3 hourly feeds and breast compressions during feed. If the BG is ≥ 1.4 mmol/L and < 2.6 mmol/L, give 2 hourly feeds and support breastfeeding with breast compressions. Once 3x Pre-Feed BG ≥ 2.6 mmol/L, no further BG monitoring is needed unless there are abnormal clinical signs. For BG < 1.4 mmol/L, urgent pediatric review is required, with possible admission to NNU if necessary. If symptomatic at any time, treat as a medical emergency with buccal dextrose and immediate neonatal team notification.

Appendix 4: Inefficient Feeding (Sleepy or Reluctant to Feed) - Late Preterm
To support feeding, safe skin-to-skin contact, breast compressions, feeding positions, and switch feeding are recommended. If the baby is sleepy or reluctant to feed, giving a drop or two of colostrum, hand expressing colostrum, and offering a supplement if needed are suggested measures.

Appendix 5: Insufficient Milk Intake (Weight Loss or Reduced Output) of Late Preterm
Weight loss of ≥ 7% of birth weight at 72 hours and Day 5 requires urgent evaluation and adjustment of the care plan. Normal output in terms of urine and stool should correspond to the baby's age, with any deviations requiring urgent evaluation and care plan adjustments.

Appendix 6: Discharge Risk Assessment & Follow-Up
The discharge risk assessment for late-preterm infants includes evaluation of feeding, temperature control, jaundice assessment, outreach plan, and follow-up community care plan. Parent education on preterm care, safer sleeping, responsive parenting, signs of illness in babies, and feeding plan attachment and positioning is essential for safe discharge and follow-up care.

Increasing Intake:  
Protecting Breastmilk Supply:  
Discussed plan with parent and agreed  

Identification:  
- 'Red Hats' placed on cots of all Neonatal Transitional Care (NTC) babies  
- Ensure 'Ward Board' highlights NTC babies  
- Handover sheets have gestation at birth of all babies on Postnatal Wards  
- Complete NTC Status Link between NNU and Postnatal Ward twice a day

Considerations of Care:  
- Follow NEWTT for required observations  
- Hypoglycaemia Pathway - 3x Pre Feed Blood Glucose levels  
- Feeding - 3 hourly feeds, give parent feed chart  
- Weighing - 72 hours, Day 5, and Discharge from Community

Parent Information:  
- Information required prior to birth, during inpatient stay, and in community  
- Give out Patient Info Pack for the Late Preterm after birth

Discharge Planning:  
- Discharge before 72 hours of age has been shown to increase the risk of readmission and complications  
- Risk assess for possible discharge  
- Community care planning  
- Follow guidelines for readmission under 28 days
