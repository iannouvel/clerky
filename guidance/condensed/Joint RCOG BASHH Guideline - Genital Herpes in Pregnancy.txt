Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy
Objective and scope
This guideline provides recommendations for the management of genital herpes simplex virus infection in pregnant women. It covers inpatient and outpatient care during the antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. The target population includes pregnant women with suspected or confirmed genital herpes infection. Healthcare professionals in maternity units and level 3 care services are the intended audience.
Stakeholder involvement
Clinicians from BASHH and RCOG, along with patient input from the Herpes Viruses Association, were involved in developing this guideline. External peer review was conducted by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using various databases and guidelines to inform the recommendations in this guideline.
Background
Neonatal herpes is a rare but serious viral infection with varying presentations and outcomes. It is primarily caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The incidence of neonatal herpes is low in the UK compared to other countries. Transmission risk factors include maternal infection type, duration of rupture of membranes, and mode of delivery.
Management of pregnant women with first episode genital herpes
Treatment with aciclovir is recommended for pregnant women with first episode genital herpes, with no evidence of increased risk of birth defects. Symptomatic relief options like paracetamol and lidocaine gel can be considered. Vaginal delivery is generally safe, and suppressive aciclovir therapy from 36 weeks gestation can reduce HSV lesions and viral shedding. Caesarean section is advised for women with third trimester acquisition to prevent neonatal transmission.
Third trimester acquisition
For women acquiring genital herpes in the third trimester, daily suppressive aciclovir until delivery is recommended. Caesarean section is the preferred delivery mode to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. Type-specific HSV antibody testing can help differentiate between primary and recurrent infections, influencing management decisions.

It is recommended that an initial plan of delivery should be based on the assumption that all first episode lesions are primary genital herpes. Women with recurrent genital herpes should be informed that the risk of neonatal herpes is low, even if lesions are present at the time of delivery. Vaginal delivery should be anticipated in the absence of other obstetric indications for caesarean section. Daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered from 36 weeks of gestation. Management of pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes should be based on clinical assessment. Caesarean section should be recommended to all women presenting with primary episode genital herpes lesions at the time of delivery. In cases of recurrent genital herpes lesions at the onset of labor, vaginal delivery should be offered. In cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, management should be guided by a multidisciplinary team discussion. For HIV-positive women with HSV infection, daily suppressive aciclovir should be considered. Management of the neonate born to mothers with HSV infection should involve informing the neonatal team and considering appropriate testing and treatment. Efforts to prevent postnatal transmission of HSV are important.

Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy
Treat episodes with standard doses of aciclovir if necessary. Treat primary episode with standard doses of aciclovir. Consider aciclovir 400 mg tds from 36/40 gestation. Offer vaginal delivery. Perform lumbar puncture for HSV PCR if necessary. Recommend planned CS especially if within 6 weeks of delivery. Start aciclovir 20 mg/kg tds for 10 days while awaiting results.
