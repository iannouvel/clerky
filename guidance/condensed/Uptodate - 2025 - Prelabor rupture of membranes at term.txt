Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term refers to the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of regular contractions. The key decision in managing term PROM is whether to induce labor or wait for spontaneous labor to begin. Inducing labor reduces the risk of maternal and newborn infection. Oxytocin induction is the preferred approach for patients with no contraindications to labor and vaginal birth. Expectant management may be considered for patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who prefer to wait for labor to begin. Hospitalization is recommended for patients with PROM to reduce the risk of complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used when indicated, but prophylactic antibiotics for PROM at term should be avoided unless certain criteria are met. Group B streptococcus colonization does not necessarily preclude expectant management.

Major organizations recommend induction for patients with term PROM. Induction with oxytocin reduces neonatal infection rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term PROM shows no significant reductions in complications. In patients with ruptured membranes and positive GBS culture, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Expectant management should include monitoring for signs of infection and fetal well-being. Indications for delivery in expectant management include specific clinical scenarios. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated for patients with negative GBS culture. Patients with unknown GBS status should be managed based on standard risk assessment. Maternal and fetal monitoring should be performed in expectantly managed term PROM.
