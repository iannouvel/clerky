Shoulder Dystocia  
Shoulder dystocia (SD) is defined as vaginal cephalic birth that requires additional obstetric manoeuvres to release the babyâ€™s shoulders after gentle downward traction has been unsuccessful. The incidence of SD is approximately 0.6% of all vaginal births in the UK and North America. Perinatal mortality and morbidity is high in cases of shoulder dystocia. Maternal morbidity risks from SD include postpartum haemorrhage and maternal trauma. 

Risk factors associated with shoulder dystocia include fetal macrosomia, diabetes mellitus, and maternal obesity. Antenatal management of previous shoulder dystocia is important for assessing the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Intrapartum management of shoulder dystocia requires prompt recognition and systematic care to reduce hypoxic acidosis and minimize trauma to the baby. 

Emergency management of shoulder dystocia should involve an experienced obstetrician and systematic techniques to facilitate birth. Post-birth management includes monitoring for complications such as haemorrhage and perineal tears. Paediatric management is necessary if brachial plexus injury is suspected. Follow-up care and counselling should be offered to women who have experienced shoulder dystocia. Training in the management of shoulder dystocia is recommended for all birth attendants. Record keeping and reporting are essential for monitoring cases of shoulder dystocia.
