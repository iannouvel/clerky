Care of Women in Labour MP035
University Sussex Hospital NHS Trust East

Key Principles:
- A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action.
- Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope:
- This protocol applies to the care of healthy pregnant women/people and their babies during labour and immediately after birth, in all care settings.
- Focusing on pregnant women/people who give birth between 37/42 weeks of pregnancy (‘term’).

Responsibilities:
- Midwives & Obstetricians: To access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. To use their professional judgment in the application of this protocol.
- Management: To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations. To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff. To ensure the protocol is available to service users on request.

Objective Standards:
- To ensure all stages of labour are managed correctly as per national guidance to achieve optimal outcomes for low-risk pregnant women and people in labour.

Definition of the stages of labour:
- 1st stage of labour: Latent stage of labour/Early labour, Established labour.
- 2nd stage of labour: Passive second stage, Active second stage.
- 3rd stage of labour: From the birth of the baby to the expulsion of the placenta and membranes.

Care of Women on Admission to Unit/Initial Assessment at Home:
- Use MP026 BSOTS protocol and document on the BSOTS triage tab on BadgerNet.
- If in the latent phase of labour, refer to MP030 Latent Phase of Labour.
- If labour is confirmed, offer vaginal examination and formulate a plan of care.

Pre-labour spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) at term >37 weeks:
- Assess pregnant women/people with SROM >37 weeks as soon as possible.

Care in Established Labour:
- Provide supportive one-to-one care in established labour.
- Conduct initial assessments including listening, observations, contractions, abdominal palpation, vaginal loss, pain assessment, fetal heart monitoring, and vaginal examination.

Observations during the established first stage of labour:
- Use a partogram for labour progress.
- Conduct regular observations including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, contractions, bladder care, vaginal examination, liquor assessment, emotional and psychological needs, and pain relief options.

Identification of delay in the first stage of labour:
- Consider factors such as parity, cervical dilation, uterine contractions, and emotional state when suspecting delay.

Observations of women and babies during the second stage of labour:
- Confirm the second stage by full dilatation of the cervix or a visible presenting part at the perineum.

In the second stage of labor, midwives should document observations on the partogram. This includes monitoring blood pressure, pulse, temperature, contractions, bladder care, liquor assessment, and fetal heart rate. Throughout this stage, consideration should be given to the woman's position, hydration, coping strategies, and pain relief. Progress should be assessed based on maternal behavior, pushing effectiveness, and fetal wellbeing. If there is a delay in progress, interventions such as amniotomy, bladder emptying, and obstetric team referral may be necessary. It is important to encourage the woman to adopt comfortable positions and offer support during pushing. In the third stage, delayed cord clamping can be beneficial for the baby's iron stores. Physiological management involves no routine use of uterotonic drugs and delivery of the placenta by maternal effort. Referral to an obstetrician may be needed in case of abnormal bleeding or non-reassuring CTG trace. Care for the newborn baby includes recording Apgar score, promoting skin-to-skin contact, and initiating breastfeeding soon after birth. Observations of the woman after birth should include temperature, pulse, blood pressure, uterine contractions, and emotional well-being. Placenta examination is also important to ensure completeness.

Care of Women in Labour: 

In case of identified risk factors or obstetric/anaesthetic emergencies, take emergency measures, inform relevant personnel, and document decisions and actions promptly. Consider the need for urgent transfer to hospital if necessary. 

At home or in a community setting, discuss the need for transfer to hospital with the woman and notify relevant personnel. In case of obstetric/anaesthetic emergencies, call 999 for immediate response, inform the relevant personnel, and consider the need for urgent transfer to hospital. Monitor the woman's condition en route to the hospital and continue emergency measures as appropriate. Arrange appropriate transfer by ambulance or own transport if the woman agrees.
