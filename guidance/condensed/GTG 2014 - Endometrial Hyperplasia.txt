Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia
Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia should be identified and monitored. The WHO classification should be used for classification. Diagnosis and surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and hysteroscopy. Progestogens are effective in managing hyperplasia without atypia, with LNG-IUS being the first-line treatment. Treatment should last at least 6 months with follow-up biopsies. Surgical management may be considered in certain cases. Atypical hyperplasia should be managed with total hysterectomy. Women wishing to preserve fertility should be counseled about risks. HRT should be used cautiously. Women on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer should be monitored for hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasia confined to a polyp should be managed with complete removal. Regular surveillance is recommended. Management in women wishing to conceive should focus on achieving disease regression before attempting conception.

The 2014 WHO classification separates endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based on cytological atypia. Diagnosis requires histological examination. Surveillance methods include endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound. Hysteroscopy may be necessary for further assessment. CT or MRI are not routinely recommended. Biomarkers have not been found to be clinically useful. Management of hyperplasia without atypia includes addressing reversible risk factors and considering progestogen treatment if regression does not occur. Weight loss and hormone therapy should be reviewed. Anovulatory cycles may regress with ovulation. Progestogen treatment may reduce the risk of progression to cancer. More evidence is needed to determine the appropriate management approach.

Many women with endometrial hyperplasia may require treatment due to the risk of progression to cancer. The first-line medical treatment for hyperplasia without atypia is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) due to its higher regression rate and fewer adverse effects compared to oral progestogens. Treatment should last for a minimum of 6 months to induce regression. Endometrial surveillance should be done every 6 months, with at least two consecutive negative biopsies before discharge. Surgical management, such as hysterectomy, should be considered if there is no regression after 12 months of treatment or if there is relapse. A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is preferred. Endometrial ablation is not recommended. Annual endometrial biopsies can be considered for high-risk women. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be based on individual factors and patient preferences.

Endometrial ablation is not recommended for atypical hyperplasia, as complete endometrial destruction cannot be guaranteed, and there is a risk of tissue regeneration. Total hysterectomy is advised for women with atypical hyperplasia to reduce the risk of underlying malignancy or cancer progression. In cases where fertility preservation is desired or surgery is not suitable, first-line treatment with LNG-IUS is recommended, with oral progestogens as an alternative. Women should be counselled about the risks of fertility-sparing therapy, including the potential for cancer progression. Follow-up for women not undergoing hysterectomy should include routine endometrial surveillance with biopsies every 3 months until negative results are obtained. Women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to conceive should achieve disease regression before attempting to conceive and may consider assisted reproduction for higher live birth rates and to prevent relapse. It is important to monitor disease regression and consider referral to a fertility specialist for further assessment and treatment options.

- A small trial showed that LNG-IUS treatment was more effective than observation alone in regressing simple hyperplasia and improving pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.
- Hysterectomy is recommended for women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia once fertility is no longer required.
- Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in women with a uterus.
- Women with endometrial hyperplasia on HRT should consider switching to continuous progestogen intake using LNG-IUS or continuous combined HRT.
- Tamoxifen users should be aware of the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.
- Aromatase inhibitors do not increase the risk of endometrial pathology or vaginal bleeding.
- LNG-IUS may reduce the incidence of endometrial polyps and hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen.
- Women with endometrial hyperplasia while on tamoxifen should reassess the need for tamoxifen with their oncologist.
- Complete removal of endometrial polyps is recommended for management.
- Recommendations for future research include evaluating the role of biomarkers in diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia and studying the effect of weight loss on regression of the condition.
- Auditable topics include advising weight loss for obese women with endometrial hyperplasia and ensuring appropriate follow-up biopsies.
