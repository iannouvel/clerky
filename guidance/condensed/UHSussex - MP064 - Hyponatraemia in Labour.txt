Hyponatraemia in Labour 
Key Principles: Measurable standards for action 
Scope: Applies to all women in labour 
Responsibilities: Midwives and obstetricians to follow guidance 

Background: Hyponatraemia is common in pregnant individuals 
Prevention: Encourage oral intake, monitor fluid balance 
Low-risk Care: Monitor fluid balance every 4 hours 
High-risk Care: Detailed fluid balance chart, monitor IV fluids 
Oxytocin Use: Specific dosing regimes 
Management Flowchart: Guidelines for sodium levels and treatment

mls/hr  
•Repeat sodium within 4 
hours  
•Observe for any symptoms  
•Continue accurate fluid 
balance monitoring  
•Inform obstetric and 
anaesthetic teams  
•Treat as shown below if 
symptomatic  
 
≥130 mmol/L  
125-129 mmol/L &

Severe hyponatraemia (sodium < 125mmol/L + symptoms) is a medical emergency. 
The aim of treatment is to improve symptoms and not to correct the sodium to normal.  
 
 
•Urgent senior obstetric and anaesthetic 
review  
•Inform ITU/Critical Care Outreach team  
•Consider transfer to Level 2 care in ITU if 
possible  
•Check sodium concentration  
•Continue strict fluid restriction of 30mls/hr  
•Continue accurate fluid balance monitoring  
•Repeat sodium hourly  
•Request 1.8% Sodium Chloride bags from 
ITU 
•1.8% Sodium Chloride given in 150ml bolus 
ONLY under instruction or supervision 
from ITU  
•If no improvement consider 2nd bolus 
150mls 1.8% Sodium Chloride ONLY under 
instruction or supervision from ITU  
•Continue fluid restriction and fluid balance 
monitoring until asymptomatic  
•Aim to increase sodium by no greater than 
10mmol/L in 24 hours  Hyponatraemia in Labour  (RSCH PRH  only )     MP064
