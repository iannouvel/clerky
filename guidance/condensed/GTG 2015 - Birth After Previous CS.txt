Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth
Recommended antenatal care includes implementing a checklist for VBAC or ERCS to facilitate counselling and decision-making. Planned VBAC is suitable for most women with a singleton pregnancy and previous lower segment caesarean delivery. Contraindications to VBAC include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar. Women with complicated uterine scars should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Labour for women with two or more prior caesareans should be in a center with expertise and immediate surgical delivery. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery increasing the likelihood of success. VBAC should be conducted in a well-equipped delivery suite with continuous monitoring. Induction or augmentation of labour increases the risk of uterine rupture. ERCS should be performed after 39+0 weeks of gestation, with antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis administered. VBAC may not be suitable in certain circumstances like post-dates, twin gestation, or antepartum stillbirth. Overall, planned VBAC is considered safe for most women with a single previous lower segment caesarean delivery.

Women with two or more prior caesarean deliveries may be offered VBAC after counselling by a senior obstetrician. Labour should be conducted in a centre with suitable expertise and recourse to immediate surgical delivery. A multivariate analysis showed no significant difference in uterine rupture rates between VBAC with two or more previous caesarean births compared to a single prior caesarean birth. Women considering VBAC should be counselled about success rates, uterine rupture rates, and maternal morbidity. Antenatal counselling should consider factors that increase the risk of uterine rupture, such as short inter-delivery interval, maternal age, obesity, and myometrial thickness. VBAC success rates with two previous caesarean births are similar to those with a single prior caesarean birth. Women seeking multiple future pregnancies should be counselled about the risks associated with repeated caesarean deliveries and the benefits of attempting VBAC. Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of planned VBAC versus ERCS from 39+0 weeks of gestation, including the risks of uterine rupture, perinatal death, and maternal and fetal outcomes. VBAC has a lower risk of adverse outcomes compared to ERCS, but both options have associated risks. Women should be provided with a patient information leaflet and the decision for mode of birth should be agreed upon before the expected delivery date.

The NICHD observational study showed a three-fold increase for serious adverse perinatal outcomes for planned VBAC compared with ERCS. A review of outcomes suggests a very low additional risk for perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity with VBAC. The success rate of planned VBAC is 72-75%, with previous vaginal delivery being the best predictor of success. Factors such as maternal height, age, BMI, gestation, and birthweight also influence VBAC success. Induction and augmentation of labour in VBAC are associated with increased risks of uterine rupture and caesarean delivery. ERCS should be conducted after 39+0 weeks of gestation with appropriate perioperative care. Antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should be administered, and placenta praevia should be managed multidisciplinarily. Practice guidelines for ERCS are provided in the NICE caesarean section guideline.

Women considering ERCS should be counselled that delaying delivery by 1 week from 38+0 to 39+0 weeks enables around a 5% reduction in the risk of respiratory morbidity, but may be associated with a 5 per 10,000 increase in the risk of antepartum stillbirth. Consideration should be given to administering maternal corticosteroids if ERCS is performed prior to 39 weeks. Perioperative preincision antibiotics achieve a greater reduction in the risk of maternal infection than prophylactic antibiotics administered after making the skin incision. The choice of method of thromboprophylaxis should be as per RCOG guidance. Women in special circumstances, such as post-dates, twin gestation, fetal macrosomia, antepartum stillbirth, or maternal age of 40 years or more, should be approached cautiously when considering VBAC. The NICE induction of labor guideline recommends induction of labor from 41+0 weeks to reduce perinatal mortality. VBAC success rates for preterm and term pregnancies are similar, but the rates of uterine rupture and dehiscence are significantly lower in preterm compared with term VBAC. Future research should focus on identifying high or low-risk women for unsuccessful VBAC, predicting successful VBAC or uterine rupture using ultrasound, investigating the etiology and prevention of stillbirth in women with previous caesarean delivery, and factors impacting the uptake of VBAC.

This clinical guideline provides information on various factors affecting pregnancy outcomes, including uterine rupture, mode of delivery after previous cesarean section, and risks associated with different delivery methods. It also discusses the use of decision aids for pregnant women and the impact of previous cesarean deliveries on subsequent pregnancies. The guideline emphasizes the importance of patient preferences and personalized decision-making in childbirth.

Planned VBAC refers to the intended mode of delivery for women with prior cesarean births who plan to deliver vaginally. Successful VBAC is defined as a vaginal delivery, while unsuccessful VBAC involves emergency cesarean delivery during labor. Uterine rupture is a disruption of the uterine muscle, while uterine dehiscence is a disruption with intact uterine serosa. Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Term delivery-related perinatal death occurs at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Neonatal respiratory morbidity includes transient tachypnea of the newborn and respiratory distress syndrome. Antenatal care includes counseling on delivery options and routine screenings. VBAC success rates and risks of uterine rupture are discussed based on various studies. The guidelines are intended to assist clinicians in decision-making but do not dictate exclusive management.
