committ ee's discussion. 
Assessmen t of protein uria 
Recommendations 1 .2.1 to 1.2.7 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee w ere awar e that t here is oft en over-reliance on a pr oteinuria r esult in t he 
diagnosis of pr e-eclampsia, and agr eed t hat healt hcare professionals should use t he 
result s of a full clinical r eview , including se verity of h yper tension and ot her signs and 
sympt oms, bef ore making a diagnosis of pr e-eclampsia. 
The committ ee amended t he recommendation on aut omat ed dipstick t ests from t he 2010 
guideline t o emphasise t hat t his should be used as a scr eening t ool for pr oteinuria. The 
committ ee highlight ed the impor tance of using aut omat ed dipstick analysis in secondar y 
care rat her t han visual analysis, which t hey were awar e from t heir e xperience has a higher 
error rat e. 
Protein:cr eatinine ratio (PCR) and albumin:cr eatinine ratio (A CR) w ere bot h sho wn to have 
high specificity and high sensitivity at t he chosen t hresholds (30 mg/mmol and 8 mg/mmol 
respectiv ely), and t herefore either could be used depending on local a vailability . The 
committ ee agr eed t hat using bot h tests toget her did not ha ve any additional diagnostic 
benefit. 
Ther e was some e vidence t hat using t he first morning urine v oid in assessment of 
proteinuria can lead t o lower diagnostic accuracy , and so t he committ ee recommended 
against using t his. 
As PCR and A CR sho w very high diagnostic accuracy , they should be used in place of 
24-hour urine collection, which is awkwar d for women and could dela y identification of 
proteinuria. Ho wever, there are rar e occasions when it might be mor e appr opriat e to use Hyper tension in pr egnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
© NICE 2025 . All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 47
of 6124-hour collection (f or example, w omen wit h renal complications), and so t he committ ee 
agreed it should not be ruled out entir ely. 
Ther e was good e vidence t hat a PCR of 30 mg/mmol had good diagnostic accuracy , 
showing high sensitivity and specificity and should be used as t he threshold f or significant 
proteinuria. Ho wever, the committ ee recommended r etesting f or result s abo ve 30 mg/
mmol if t here is still diagnostic uncer tainty (f or example, t he w oman has no ot her clinical 
signs or sympt oms of pr e-eclampsia) because t here is lar ge variation in pr otein e xcretion 
during t he da y and fr om da y to day. The committ ee agr eed t hat t his w ould pr event w omen 
being diagnosed wit h pre-eclampsia on t he basis of a single raised PCR r esult. 
Evidence fr om a single study sho wed high sensitivity and specificity f or an A CR result of 
8 mg/mmol t o diagnose pr oteinuria. Ho wever, the committ ee w ere also awar e of fur ther 
result s from a lar ge, UK -based study , which pr ovided fur ther e vidence f or the efficacy of a 
threshold of 8 mg/mmol in t he diagnosis of se vere pre-eclampsia. The committ ee w ere 
awar e that t his threshold is diff erent t o that used f or det ection of micr oalbuminuria in t he 
non-pr egnant population. Ho wever, they agr eed t hat, on t he basis of t he evidence 
review ed, it was appr opriat e to use a t hreshold of 8 mg/mmol f or pr egnant w omen. 
As wit h PCR, t he committ ee w ere awar e that w omen ar e sometimes diagnosed wit h pre-
eclampsia on t he basis of a single raised A CR, and t hat t his ma y lead t o over-diagnosis. 
Ther efore, they made a r ecommendation t o consider r epeating t he ACR measur ement if 
there was ongoing clinical uncer tainty about t he diagnosis. 
No e vidence was r eview ed that e xamined t he timing of r epeat t esting f or eit her A CR or 
PCR, and so no r ecommendations could be made r egar ding t his. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendation t o tak e account of ot her clinical f eatur es when assessing w omen f or 
suspect ed pr e-eclampsia might lead t o an incr eased need f or follow-up and sur veillance. 
However, this will also r educe t he chance t hat a diagnosis of pr e-eclampsia is missed b y 
raising awar eness of t he multi-syst em natur e of t he disease, and so could r educe t he 
number of w omen who go on t o develop complications fr om undiagnosed pr e-eclampsia. 
Not all secondar y car e unit s curr ently use aut omat ed dipstick analysis t o scr een f or 
proteinuria, so t he recommendations might incr ease t he need f or aut omat ed reagent -strip 
reading de vices. Ho wever, the accuracy and r eliability of scr eening will be impr oved, Hyper tension in pr egnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)

of 61reducing t he need f or fur ther in vestigations f or some w omen and corr ectly identifying 
more women who need fur ther t esting or in vestigations. 
Moving fr om 2 4-hour urine collection t o spot urine A CR or PCR will sa ve time, wit h 
potential f or faster diagnosis, and a r eduction in inaccuracies because of incomplet e 
samples. It is also lik ely to impr ove quality of lif e, as t he pr ocess of completing a 2 4-hour 
urine collection is time-consuming and awkwar d. 
A PCR of 30 mg/mmol is alr eady used r outinely as a diagnostic t hreshold and t herefore 
should not change practice. Curr ently unit s ma y use diff erent A CR le vels for diagnosis and 
so the recommendation t o use 8 mg/mmol will standar dise practice. 
Recommendations ha ve been made f or the use of eit her A CR or PCR allo wing local 
decisions t o use whiche ver test is a vailable, so t his should not aff ect practice. 
Repeating t he PCR or A CR test ma y incur a small additional cost. Ho wever, this should 
reduce t he false positiv e rat e, and mean some w omen will a void unnecessar y follow-up or 
intensiv e monit oring (such as hospital admission) if t heir pr oteinuria r esolv es and is sho wn 
to be transient.

Treatmen t of chr onic h yper tension 
Recommendations 1 .3.6 to 1.3.12 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions

the pr evious guideline (f or gestational h yper tension and pr e-eclampsia), and t hese 
medicines had been used f or man y years in pr egnancy , the committ ee agr eed t hey should

specifically licensed f or use in pr egnancy and so is suggest ed as t he first -line option, wit h 
nifedipine as t he ne xt alt ernativ e, and met hyldopa as t he third option (as it ma y lead t o 
more side eff ects and be t he least eff ectiv e option of t he 3). 
Ther e was some v ery limit ed evidence f or the benefit s of aspirin in r educing pr eterm bir ths 
and neonatal unit admissions, so t he committ ee retained t he recommendation on aspirin 
from t he pr evious guideline, but incorporat ed it int o the section on t he tr eatment of 
chronic h yper tension in pr egnancy . The committ ee not ed that t he studies used diff erent 
doses of aspirin (ranging fr om 50 mg t o 150 mg daily), and t hat common practice in t he UK 
was t o off er 75 mg t o 150 mg, t herefore this dose range was r ecommended. 
The committ ee w ere awar e of t he link betw een chr onic h yper tension and bot h pre-existing 
and gestational diabet es, therefore they made an o verarching r ecommendation at t he 
beginning of t he guideline t o cross-r efer to the existing NICE guideline on diabet es in

The committ ee made a new r ecommendation r eferring t o the NICE diagnostics guidance

As there is curr ently a lack of e vidence on t he diff erence in out comes betw een diff erent

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee agr eed, based on t heir clinical e xper tise, t hat w omen wit h pre-eclampsia

Ther e was some e vidence t hat t he fullPIERS and PREP -S models can help identify w omen 
at diff erent risks of adv erse out comes because of pr e-eclampsia. Ther e was mor e 
extensiv e validation of t he fullPIERS model, and t he validation studies w ere conduct ed in 
populations fr om a range of healt hcare settings. The PREP -S model had been de veloped 
using a UK population, and v alidat ed using data fr om similar multinational settings. It was 
noted that fur ther v alidation of PREP -S was unlik ely to be conduct ed, because of t he cost 
of conducting t hese studies. The committ ee therefore agr eed t hat bot h models could be 
consider ed as options, in addition t o a full clinical assessment, t o help guide decisions 
relating t o interventions and place of car e.

Hyper tensiv e disor ders during pr egnancy aff ect ar ound 8% t o 10% of all pr egnant w omen 
and can be associat ed wit h substantial complications f or the w oman and t he bab y. Women 
can ha ve hyper tension bef ore pregnancy or it can be diagnosed in t he first 20 weeks 
(known as chr onic h yper tension), new onset of h yper tension occurring in t he second half 
of pr egnancy ( gestational h yper tension) or new h yper tension wit h featur es of multi-or gan 
involvement (pr e-eclampsia). 
Although t he pr opor tion of w omen wit h pregnancy h yper tensiv e disor ders o verall appears 
to have sta yed reasonably stable, mat ernal mor tality fr om h yper tensiv e causes has f allen 
dramatically: less t han 1 woman in e very million who giv es bir th now dies fr om pr e-
eclampsia. Ther e is consensus t hat intr oduction of t he 2010 NICE e vidence-based 
guidelines, t oget her wit h the findings fr om t he confidential enquir y into mat ernal deat hs, 
has made a piv otal contribution t o this fall in mat ernal mor tality . However, hyper tension in 
pregnancy continues t o cause substantial mat ernal morbidity , stillbir ths and neonatal 
deat hs, and perinatal morbidity . Women wit h hyper tension in pr egnancy ar e also at 
increased risk of car diovascular disease lat er in lif e. 
Variations in car e contribut e to inequity in adv erse out comes. Adoption and 
implementation of e vidence-based national guidelines ha ve a central r ole in r educing t his 
variance and impr oving car e and out comes acr oss t he mat ernity ser vice. R esear ch that 
has been done since publication of t he pr evious guideline has addr essed ar eas of 
uncer tainty and highlight ed wher e the recommendations can be updat ed. A sur veillance 
repor t from 2017 identified new studies in t he following ar eas: 
• management of pr egnancy wit h chr onic h yper tension 
• management of pr egnancy wit h gestational h yper tension 
• management of pr egnancy wit h pre-eclampsia 
• breastf eeding 
• advice and f ollow-up car e at transf er to community car e.

looked at b y other gr oups (f or example, scr eening strat egies f or pr e-eclampsia, which is Hyper tension in pr egnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)

looking at tr eatment f or all types of pr egnancy h yper tension t oget her, rather t han wit hin 
the subdivisions of chr onic h yper tension, gestational h yper tension and pr e-eclampsia). 
This updat e has also clarified t he basis f or the curr ent definition of pr e-eclampsia, in or der 
to bett er align wit h the stat ed aims of t he 2010 guideline t o be consist ent wit h those 
agreed b y the Int ernational Society f or the Study of Hyper tension in Pr egnancy (ISSHP). 
The aim of t he 2019 guideline is t o present updat ed evidence-based r ecommendations, 
relevant t o practising clinicians, while identifying out standing ar eas of uncer tainty t hat 
need fur ther r esear ch. Ther e is a str ong ar gument f or uptak e of t hese new guidelines int o 
clinical practice, in or der t o minimise unnecessar y variance and pr ovide optimal car e for 
women and t heir babies. In doing t his, lo w rat es of mat ernal mor tality should be 
maintained, and pr ogress on r eduction of mat ernal morbidity and perinatal morbidity and 
mortality can be pursued. Hyper tension in pr egnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
