Management of pregnant women/people who have undergone previous bariatric surgery aims to minimize complications and ensure optimal care. The guideline provides clear guidance for staff involved in the care of these individuals, including referral to antenatal and anaesthetic clinics, supplementation, and screening for nutritional deficiencies. It is recommended to postpone pregnancy until stable weight is achieved after bariatric surgery. Antenatal care includes booking appointments, blood tests for nutritional deficiencies, and supplementation with specific vitamins and minerals. Additional screening and growth scans are also necessary to monitor the health of both the mother and the baby.

It is recommended that all pregnant women take a pregnancy specific multivitamin. The retinol form of Vitamin A should be avoided during pregnancy due to teratogenicity risk. Women who have undergone any form of bariatric surgery should take pregnancy multivitamins. Pregnacare OD, Seven seas Pregnancy OD, and Forceval Capsule OD are recommended multivitamin preparations for pregnancy after bariatric surgery. Women taking calcium/vitamin D/iron/B12 supplements prior to pregnancy should continue them. Folate 5mg daily is recommended for women with a history of bariatric surgery and BMI>30 or T2DM. Ultrasound surveillance is recommended for pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery. Gestational weight gain guidelines based on BMI are provided. Referral for anaesthetic assessment in the third trimester is recommended for all women who have undergone bariatric surgery. Screening for gestational diabetes is required for women with a history of bariatric surgery. Internal hernia risk and hyperemesis/vomiting considerations are highlighted. Labor, birth, and postnatal care recommendations are provided. Audit points for antenatal care are listed.
