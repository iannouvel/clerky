Key Principles:
- A handover involves the transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some or all aspects of care for a patient.
- Effective communication is crucial for patient safety and reducing clinical incidents.

Purpose:
- To give and receive information effectively and document all discussions, decisions, and plans of care.
- Good documentation and communication ensure safe and consistent care for patients.

Documentation:
- All care, advice, and medication should be documented using the SBAR format.
- Handover communication at shift changes should be documented to ensure continuity of care.

Handover at the change of shift:
- Midwives and medical staff should provide personal handovers at shift changes.
- A structured handover tool, such as SBAR, should be used for effective communication.

Handover for Transfer between Care Settings:
- Transfer to ITU/HDU should involve joint decision-making and full verbal handover of care.
- Personal handovers should occur when transferring women between wards.

Overall, effective communication and documentation are essential for ensuring patient safety and quality care.
