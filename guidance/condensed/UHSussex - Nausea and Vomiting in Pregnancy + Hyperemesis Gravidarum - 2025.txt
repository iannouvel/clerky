Management of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum

This guideline supports the management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in General Practice and specialist care settings in Sussex. NVP affects up to 90% of pregnant people and can be successfully managed in General Practice. HG is a severe form of NVP that may require specialist support. Prompt effective management improves quality of life and pregnancy outcomes.

Medication to manage symptoms of NVP and HG:
- Antiemetic medications can be taken in all trimesters of pregnancy.
- Use pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate or cyclizine for first-time pregnancies.
- Consider combinations of antiemetics for non-responders.
- Consider thiamine for patients with severe symptoms.
- Use the PUQE scoring system to assess severity.

Practice points for General Practitioners:
- Consider alternative causes if symptoms start after 16 weeks of pregnancy.
- Regularly monitor renal function, weight, hydration, and vitamin levels.
- Assess mental health and consider referral if necessary.
- Offer counselling and validate the severity of symptoms.
- Prescribe antiemetics as needed and refer for specialist support if required.

Practice points for Secondary Care (Inpatient Management):
- Review risks and consider LMWH as per local guidelines.
- Use antiemetic medication guidance and consider corticosteroids if needed.
- Ensure appropriate nutrition, hydration, and management of concurrent conditions.
- Offer serial scans for people with continued symptoms in late pregnancy.
- Provide support groups information and advise on future pregnancies.

How to refer for specialist support/ambulatory care:
- Contact specialist centers for support and referrals.
- Consider termination of pregnancy only after exploring all treatment options.
- Offer counselling before and after any decision regarding termination.
