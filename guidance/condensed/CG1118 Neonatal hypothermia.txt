- Midwife responsibilities: Be aware of risk factors, maintain warm environment, encourage skin-to-skin contact 
- Immediately after birth: Dry and provide skin-to-skin contact, encourage feeding 
- Procedure for low temperatures: Skin-to-skin contact, monitoring, and use of hot cot 
- Skin-to-skin contact: Stabilizes heart rate and temperature, facilitates feeding 
- Correct use of hot cot: Keep switched on, monitor temperature, gradually reduce temperature 
- Continuing care: Discontinue monitoring if temperature stable, focus on feeding 
- Patient information: Explain monitoring and management to parents
