Failed Intubation in the Obstetric Patient (RSCH PRH only) MP044

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all people requiring general anesthesia in the peri-partum period.

Responsibilities: Anaesthetists, Midwives & Obstetricians are responsible for accessing, reading, understanding, and following this guidance and using their professional judgment in its application. Management Team is responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Background: Differences between pregnant patients and other patient populations include pregnancy-related changes in maternal physiology, the need to consider both maternal and fetal status, and human factors influencing practice. Management of the difficult airway for anesthesia requires an algorithmic approach. The OAA/DAS have created algorithms for managing the unanticipated difficult airway for pregnant patients.
