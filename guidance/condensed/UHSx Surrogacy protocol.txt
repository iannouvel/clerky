The purpose of this guideline is to ensure good planning for surrogate parents and the children of surrogate parents and to ensure there is a robust sensitive plan in place for antenatal planning, labour and postnatal period. All healthcare professionals involved in caring for patients where a surrogacy is planned should follow this guidance. Offer care in a non-judgmental and supportive manner, maintain accurate records, and prioritize the needs of the surrogate person. Surrogacy is the practice whereby one woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child for another person or couple. There are two types of surrogacy: Straight Surrogacy and Full Surrogacy. The legal framework for surrogacy is the Surrogacy Arrangements Act of 1985, amended in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill of 2007. The legal mother is always the surrogate mother until a parental order is sought by the intended parents. Parental responsibility may be transferred through a parental order or adoption. Same-sex couples can apply for a parental order. Foreign commissioning parents may need to consider adoption as a legal option. The immediate postnatal period in a surrogacy arrangement requires great sensitivity in handling both the surrogate and commissioning parents. A child born to a surrogate must be registered as her child until a parental order is made.

Appendix 3: Surrogacy inclusive language in perinatal services

Purpose of the Language Guide
This guide has been developed to accompany the trust policy for management of surrogacy. The guide seeks to clarify the dynamics between a surrogate and intended parents, so that perinatal care is inclusive for all, and acknowledges each person’s position with regards to any child/children born through surrogacy under the trust.

Significance of the Different Pathways to Parenthood
Childbirth is a period of significant vulnerability and growth, and we value all the intersecting identities that contribute to a person’s experience of this, including but not limited to race, gender identity, sexuality, age, religion and ability. The people experiencing childbirth and the transition into parenthood, either as the birthing person, or as an intended parent, require care from midwives and fellow health professionals that is both inclusive and individualized, reflecting the pathway they have followed to this point.

A key legal aspect of surrogacy is the application to the courts for a parental order, completed by the intended parents of any child/children born. The parental order transfers the legal parenthood for the child from the surrogate (and her spouse if married) to the intended parents.

Parental order applications are one of the most reliable ways to track surrogacy births, both in the UK and internationally. The data is managed by Cafcass (Child and Family Court Advisory and Support Service), who are an independent advisory organization that works with families and courts to ensure the safety and well-being of children in the UK on a range of cases, including surrogacy.

Since the Cafcass case management system was introduced in 2008, the number of parental orders, for both domestic and international surrogacy has continued to increase. During the first year of using the management system to record data, there were just 67 applications made. By 2018 this number had risen by four times the amount to around 280, with the majority of them relating to domestic surrogacy within the UK (England having the highest number of cases). Additionally, recent data shows that parental order numbers have continued to grow to above 300 applications in 2020, including 100 applications from same-sex couples and more than 20 from single parents who have pursued surrogacy as a route to parenthood.

Until 2018 Surrey and Sussex recorded the third highest number of surrogacies, exceeded only by London and the Avon, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Thames Valley service area group (both of which have higher population figures). For the past three years, Surrey and Sussex have exceeded Surrogacy Inclusive Language in Perinatal Services the Avon, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Thames Valley service area group in the number of parental order applications granted by the courts.

Legal Frameworks in Relation to Perinatal Care
Equality Act
The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination, harassment and victimization of in the workplace and in wider society. It is designed to ensure people with certain ‘protected characteristics’ are not disadvantaged or subjected to unwanted conduct because of that characteristic. Public bodies (such as local authorities and NHS trusts) have an active duty to eliminate discrimination, harassment, and victimization of anyone who is protected under the Act, and foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.

One of the characteristics protected by the Equality Act is pregnancy and maternity. The care of any pregnant or birthing person should, at all times, meet standards as set out by wider Government and internal guidance and should seek to acknowledge the individual circumstances of the person being cared for.
