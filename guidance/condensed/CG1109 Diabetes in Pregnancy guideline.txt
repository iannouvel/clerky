Diabetes in Pregnancy Guideline

Aim: To ensure optimal outcomes for pregnant women/people with diabetes and act as a resource for staff caring for them.

Scope: Applies to all medical, obstetric, and midwifery staff caring for pregnant women/people with pre-existing and gestational diabetes.

Responsibilities: Staff must access, understand, and apply this guidance. The division must ensure the guideline is reviewed as required and accessible to relevant staff.

Abbreviations used within this guideline: Various medical terms and abbreviations are used throughout the document.

Antenatal care pathway at booking: Guidelines for screening and care for pregnant women/people with diabetes at booking.

Pre-pregnancy counseling for women/people with pre-existing diabetes: Discuss risks and how diabetes affects pregnancies, offer blood glucose monitoring, review medications, and screen for complications.

Screening for gestational diabetes (GDM): Criteria for screening and diagnosing GDM, offer review with the Diabetes Pregnancy Team for those diagnosed.

After 34 weeks, a GTT or blood glucose monitoring is rarely indicated. If the pregnant woman/person has had a previous normal OGTT in this pregnancy, they will not have significant gestational diabetes and treatment at this late stage is unlikely to have a significant effect. A repeat OGTT is unlikely to be helpful and is often misleading. Please discuss with the Diabetes Team.

No previous GTT but concerns about new diabetes â€“ check random blood glucose. If less than 7mmol/L no significant diabetes (gestational or other), and no further action or tests are required. If 7mmol/L or more, please discuss the result with Diabetes Pregnancy Team.

For pregnant women/people with gestational diabetes who have a fasting plasma glucose level below 7mmol/L at diagnosis, offer a trial of diet and exercise changes.

Diagnosis of GDM without a GTT: Any glucose (fasting or non-fasting) more than 11.0mmol/L, or fasting (true fasting i.e. overnight) glucose 5.6mmol/L or more requires urgent referral to the Diabetes Pregnancy Team.

Pregnant women on corticosteroids may need to stay in the hospital for 24 hours after the last dose or until their blood glucose is stable. Insulin doses should be adjusted accordingly. Monitoring of blood glucose is essential, and IV fluids may be necessary to prevent complications. In cases of hyperemesis, hospital admission may be needed for insulin management. During labor, insulin should be continued, and VRIII may be necessary. After birth, insulin doses should be adjusted, and blood glucose monitored regularly. Breastfeeding individuals should monitor their blood glucose levels frequently. In cases of diabetic emergencies, immediate medical attention is required. Regular audits should be conducted for pregnant women with diabetes to ensure proper care.

Diabetes in pregnancy should include ultrasound scanning and fetal heart examination at 20 weeks. Pregnant individuals with diabetes should self-monitor blood glucose levels and discuss antenatal corticosteroid risks. Pregnant women with diabetes should be offered COVID-19 vaccination as per JCVI guidance.

Patients with Gestational Diabetes are at increased risk and should be offered a vaccination as soon as possible.
