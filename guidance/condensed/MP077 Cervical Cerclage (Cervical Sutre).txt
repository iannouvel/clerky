Cervical Cerclage (Cervical Suture) is a protocol for the management of women at high risk of mid-trimester losses and premature labor. The types of cervical sutures include history indicated, USS indicated, and rescue suture. Referral to a hospital antenatal clinic is necessary for assessment and counseling before suture insertion. Pre-operative management, operative issues, and post-suture insertion care are outlined. Suture removal and management in cases of PPROM are also discussed. Documentation and consent procedures are detailed in the protocol.

For funnelling of the cervix in the absence of a short cervix of 25mm or less, cervical cerclage (cervical suture) may be considered. There is no evidence to support routine insertion of suture in multiple pregnancies or uterine abnormalities. In cases of previous radical trachelectomies, the decision must be individualized. Rescue cerclage is a salvage method for premature dilatation with exposed fetal membranes, but should not be offered if signs of infection, active bleeding, or uterine contractions are present. It should only be offered between 16+0 and 27+6 weeks of pregnancy. Insertion of the suture may be associated with a prolongation of 4-5 weeks, with most deliveries occurring around 24 weeks. Immediate insertion is recommended, but better long-term outcomes were seen if inserted after 48 hours.
