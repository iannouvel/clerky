The guideline focuses on laparoscopic management of non-obstetric, abdominal conditions in pregnancy, such as acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and benign adnexal tumors. It emphasizes the importance of experienced laparoscopists performing these procedures to ensure maternal and fetal safety. Studies have shown that laparoscopy is safe for both mother and fetus, with no increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to open surgery. The incidence of non-obstetric abdominal surgical emergencies in pregnancy is low, and hormonal changes may affect the risk of certain conditions like gallbladder disease. Overall, laparoscopy is considered a viable surgical option in pregnancy when performed by skilled professionals.

Laparoscopic appendectomy in pregnancy has been associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous miscarriage compared to open appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is more common in the first trimester, which may contribute to the increased risk of miscarriage. However, laparoscopic surgery offers benefits such as faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower rates of wound infection for pregnant women. When considering the type of surgery, factors such as expertise, infrastructure, gestation, and patient preference should be taken into account. Maternal risks of laparoscopy include potential vascular and organ trauma, while anaesthetic risks should be carefully managed with early involvement of an obstetric anaesthetist and consideration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. General anaesthesia is typically recommended for non-obstetric laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy to ensure optimal safety for both the mother and fetus.

Pregnant women requiring laparoscopy for non-obstetric conditions should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Surgery should be postponed if non-urgent, but if necessary, can be performed up to 34 weeks gestation. Maternal and fetal outcomes are generally good for laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy. Surgeons with experience in laparoscopy have better outcomes. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed by skilled surgeons to reduce complications. Urgent surgery should not be delayed in pregnancy. Both laparoscopic and open surgery are acceptable options. Intraoperative monitoring may be needed in selected cases. Antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium may be used if preterm delivery is a risk. Routine tocolysis is not recommended. Laparoscopic surgery should be performed in facilities with appropriate expertise and monitoring. Fetal monitoring may be done before and after surgery. Caution is needed in steroid administration for maternal sepsis. Routine intraoperative fetal monitoring is not always necessary. Ports should be placed based on uterine size and location of pathology. The Hasson technique may reduce the risk of uterine trauma. Secondary port placement should consider uterine size and pathology. Pneumoperitoneum pressures below 12 mmHg are safe for the fetus.

Insufflation pressures of 20-25 mmHg are recommended for gas insufflation in laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy. Operating pressures of 12 mmHg are supported by current evidence. Both 5 and 10 mm diameter laparoscopes can be used, depending on surgical requirements. The choice of laparoscope degree depends on surgeon preference. Ultrasound, bipolar, and monopolar energy sources are safe to use during laparoscopy in pregnancy. The choice of extraction method for surgical specimens should be based on surgeon preference. Antibiotics should be used if there is an infective process. Timely surgical intervention is preferable in suspected appendicitis in pregnancy to avoid adverse outcomes. Delay in surgery for appendicitis can lead to increased complications.

Should the laparoscopic approach to appendicectomy be preferred over laparotomy in pregnancy? There is controversy regarding the association of laparoscopic appendicectomy and miscarriage, and further research is needed to distinguish between association and causality. In the case of cholecystectomy, laparoscopic approach is associated with better outcomes than open approach, with fewer complications and shorter hospital stay. When surgery is indicated for ovarian cysts, laparoscopic cystectomy is associated with better maternal outcomes than laparotomy. The choice of approach should be based on local circumstances and expertise.

Adnexal masses in pregnancy can be safely managed laparoscopically, especially for appendicitis, gallbladder disease, and symptomatic adnexal cysts. Adequately trained laparoscopists should perform these procedures with proper peri-operative preparations. More high-grade evidence is needed, and national large databases may be beneficial due to the difficulty in conducting randomized controlled trials for these conditions.
