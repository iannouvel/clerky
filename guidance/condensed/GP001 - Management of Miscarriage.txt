Management of Miscarriage

Key Principles: These guidelines are aimed to assist in decision making and have been reviewed by clinicians involved in early pregnancy care. A protocol is a set of measurable standards, and professional judgment may be used.

Scope: These guidelines apply to women with a confirmed diagnosis of miscarriage.

Responsibilities: Nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, and obstetricians are responsible for following the guidance. The management team is responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all staff.

Introduction: Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 22 weeks gestation, with common symptoms of bleeding and pelvic pain.

Threatened Miscarriage: Women with worsening or persistent bleeding should return for assessment.

Using Ultrasound for Diagnosis: Offer trans-vaginal ultrasound to identify pregnancy location and fetal pole and heartbeat presence.

Management of a confirmed miscarriage pregnancy: Provide verbal and written information to patients and send blood tests.

Conservative Management: Offered as a first-line option in early first-trimester miscarriage, with follow-up scans if needed.

Medical Management: Offered when conservative management is not suitable, with instructions on what to expect and when to seek help.

Surgical Management: Provide information about treatment options and complete necessary consent forms.

Anti-D rhesus prophylaxis: Offered to rhesus negative women undergoing surgical management.

Follow-up: Offer follow-up appointments for women after miscarriage.

Terminology: Use sensitive language when discussing pregnancy loss with parents.

Paperwork to be completed: Forms and information on handling products of conception.

Appendix A: Patient Information Leaflet 'Your Baby' for those who have lost a baby during 12 to 23 weeks of pregnancy.

There is one in the chapel at both the Royal Sussex County Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital. Please ask a member of staff about how to make an entry, or contact the chaplaincy office at the hospital. There is no charge for making an entry. 

Annual Memorial Service 

There is also a memorial service held every year for families to remember their babys who have died. You will be sent information about this nearer the time, unless you ask us not to do this. 

Can we arrange a funeral? 

You will need to arrange a funeral with a Funeral Director of your choice. The Bereavement office will have a list of local funeral directors to help you if you wish. The funeral can take the form of a cremation or of a burial. The funeral director you approach will be able to help you with all the arrangements. Most funeral directors will not charge for a funeral, if you decide on a cremation, you will need to check before you go ahead. However if you are wanting a buriel and headstone you will need to discuss this with the funeral director. The funeral does not need to be a religious service – you can say goodbye in whatever way feels best for you. There may be certain pieces of music, poems or other readings that are special to you. The funeral director will be able to help. You may also find it helpful to talk to the hospital chaplain or to a minister you know. 

If you or your funeral director have not contacted the bereavement office/mortuary within 30 days of signing the P2 form the hospital will arrange a cremation. 

What will happen if we do not wish to organise a private funeral? 

The hospital will arrange a cremation of your baby but there will be no service for you or others to attend and no ashes to collect.
