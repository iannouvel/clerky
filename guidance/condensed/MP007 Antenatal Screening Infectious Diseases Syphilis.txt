Antenatal Screening for Syphilis aims to identify and manage the infection early in pregnancy to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby. Screening should be offered to all pregnant women, with pre-screening information provided to enable informed choice. Women booking late or arriving unbooked should be offered screening promptly. Declining screening is optional, but follow-up discussions are recommended. Blood samples should be taken at booking, with clear labeling and documentation. Unacceptable samples should be repeated within 10 working days.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can be passed from an infected mother to her unborn child, resulting in congenital syphilis. Maternal syphilis infection can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term consequences if left untreated. Screening for syphilis in pregnancy is important for identifying and treating infected women to reduce the risk of congenital syphilis in the baby. Treatment with penicillin is beneficial for both mother and baby. Pregnant women with positive syphilis serology should be referred for further management. Consultation with specialists is recommended for treatment decisions, especially in cases of penicillin allergy. Cases of suspected congenital syphilis should be managed jointly with the pediatric team.
