Obesity in Pregnancy Maternity Protocol: MP011

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable standards for action. Professional judgment may be used.

Scope: This protocol applies to obese women in pregnancy.

Responsibilities: Midwives and obstetricians must follow this guidance and use professional judgment.

1 Obesity in Pregnancy: Obesity is a growing issue in the UK.

2 Potential Clinical Complications Related to Obesity: Includes diabetes, hypertension, increased hospital attendance, difficulties with clinical procedures, and more.

3 Calculating and Documenting the Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI should be accurately calculated and documented in maternal notes.

4 Management of Obesity in Pregnancy: Includes first trimester care and evaluation for nutritional deficiencies post-bariatric surgery.

5 For all pregnant people with booking BMI ≥30: Counseling on risks, antenatal thromboprophylaxis, and multidisciplinary care should be provided.

6 For all pregnant people with BMI ≥ 35: Additional care includes referrals to obstetric care, scanning, and antenatal consultations.

7 For all pregnant people with BMI ≥ 40: Additional care includes scanning, obstetric anesthetic management plan, and tissue viability assessments.

8 For all pregnant people with BMI ≥ 50: Referral to an anesthetist, high-risk anaesthetic clinic appointment, and specialist equipment considerations.

9 Delivery referral from PRH to RSCH: Factors impacting safe care delivery and recommendations for referral to RSCH.

10 Labour & Birth: Recommendations for obstetric unit birth, continuous CTG monitoring, and suturing during caesarean section.

11 Postnatal Care: Risk assessment for VTE, breastfeeding support, and continued weight management.

12 Specialist Equipment: Use of appropriate equipment for blood pressure readings, weight measurements, and examination couches.

12.7 For woman / pregnant person choosing a home birth, discussion regarding:
• Access to the flat/house
• Evacuation in case transfer to hospital is required
• the safety of using a birthing pool and the difficulties associated with leaving the pool in an emergency

12.8 All discussion and agreed plans should be clearly documented in their maternity notes on Badgernet. Those women / pregnant people who would like a home birth out of guidelines will need to be referred to the Consultant midwives antenatally.

13 Pregnancy following Bariatric surgery
13.1 Preconception
• Postpone pregnancy during the period of rapid weight loss (at least the first year).
• Ensure safe and effective contraception advice is given. COC may be less reliable following surgery due to gut shortening and reduced absorption.
• LARC (long-acting reversible contraception) eg: IUD (copper / mirena) or progesterone depot.

13.2 Nutrition
• Refer to a dietician
• Supplements: Multivitamins such as Folic acid 5mg, Vitamin B12 (1mg every 3 months IM), Vitamin D and Vitamin A (convert to beta -carotene form when pregnant)

13.3 Antenatal management
• MDT
• Blood tests to check nutritional state in each trimester (FBC, LFTS, Ca, Folate, B12, Ferritin and Vitamin D)
• Inform their bariatric surgeon that they are pregnant.
• Monitor weight (gestational weight gain should ideally be 7 -11kg).
• Active band management with those who have LAGB (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding)
• GDM screening. They are unable to have a OGTT performed due to dumping syndrome, therefore BM monitoring should be recommended for one week between 24 -28/40.
• Serial growth scans at 32 and 34 weeks
• Anaesthetic referral if BMI > 50 and VTE prophylaxis if relevant.
• Low threshold to investigate pain if they present with abdominal pain, as this may be secondary to intestinal obstruction or gastric band slippage if vomiting.

13.4 Surgical complications
• Internal hernias. Most common location is Petersen’s space (defect between the small bowel limbs, transverse mesocolon and the retroperitoneum). This has a high incidence of maternal and fetal death if left untreated after 48 hours of symptoms.
• Gastric band slippage. This may be increased due to vomiting and increased abdominal pressure. This is also more likely to occur if the interval between surgery and pregnancy is short.

13.5 Intrapartum management
• There is no evidence for an earlier induction or timing of delivery
• There is no evidence that a caesarean section is more beneficial than a vaginal delivery.

13.6 Postnatal
• Encourage breast feeding
• VTE assessment
• Follow up with bariatric surgeon if there was band adjustment in the pregnancy.
• If the woman / pregnant person wants body contouring – advise them to wait till they have completed their family.
