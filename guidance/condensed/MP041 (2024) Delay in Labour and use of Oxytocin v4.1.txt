Delay in Labour and Use of Oxytocin
Maternity Protocol: MP041
Date agreed: February 2022
Amended December 2024

Key principles: A protocol is a set of measurable standards for determining a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in its application.

Scope: This protocol applies to pregnant women with delay in labor potentially requiring oxytocin. It covers recognition of delay, assessment before oxytocin use, monitoring arrangements, documentation, and management of care planning.

Responsibilities: Midwives and obstetricians must follow this guidance and use professional judgment. Management must ensure the protocol is reviewed as needed and accessible to staff and service users.

Delay in First Stage: Diagnosis of delay includes factors like cervical dilation and fetal head position. Women with confirmed delay should be transferred to obstetric-led care for review and management decisions, including oxytocin use.

Assessment Before Oxytocin: Pregnant women needing oxytocin should be assessed by an obstetrician before starting treatment, considering individual clinical situations and fetal well-being.

Midwifery Care and Oxytocin Use: Women on oxytocin need one-to-one care at all times. Contraindications, dose adjustments, and management of hyperstimulation should be carefully monitored.

Oxytocin Regime: The infusion should start at a low dose and gradually increase to achieve appropriate uterine contractions. Monitoring and adjustments should be made every 30 minutes.

Document commencement, dosages, and increments in the maternal BadgerNet record and on the CTG tracing. Oxytocin should not be continued for longer than six hours with inadequate progress unless discussed with a Consultant. Monitoring for water intoxication and electrolyte imbalance is important with high doses of oxytocin. Continuous monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine activity is necessary. Documentation of assessments, dose schedules, and monitoring arrangements is crucial. In cases of delay in the second stage, interventions should be considered based on specific timeframes. Management plans should be individualized and documented. Contraindications to oxytocin use in the second stage of labor should be carefully considered. Oxytocin should only be started after a full clinical examination. Augmentation in the second stage should aim for specific contractions and should not exceed the recommended infusion rate. Instrumental birth may be necessary in cases of concern for fetal wellbeing or prolonged second stage. Active management of the third stage is recommended for all individuals who have had an oxytocin infusion. Discontinuation of oxytocin should occur immediately following completion of the third stage of labor.
