CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Due for review:  21st August 2027  
Name of Protocol : Retained Placenta  v1.0  
For use at:  PRH, RSCH, SRH, WH  

1.0 Introduction  
This protocol provides evidence based guidance for all staff on the diagnosis and safe management 
of retained placenta. It applies to obstetric, medical and midwifery staff.  
A retained placenta is diagnosed when delivery of the placenta is not completed within 30 minutes 
of the birth with active management or within 60 minutes of the birth with physiological 
management.  
• Incidence: 1:100 - 200 births.  
• Recurrence rate of about 8 -10% 
• Persistence atony is often caused by retained placental tissue or blood clots.  

2.0 Responsibilities  
It is the responsibility of all midwifery and medical staff to:  
• Access, read, understand and follow this guidance.  

It is the responsibility of the division to:  
• Ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations.  
• Ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff.  

5.0 Causes  
• Trapped separated or partially separated placenta .  
• A full bladder  
• Uterine atony  
• A constriction ring  
• A uterine abnormality  
• A morbidly adherent placenta - in this relatively uncommon condition (1 in 1500 births), 
the trophoblast has invaded the decidua and myometrium to varying degrees (placenta 
accrete / increta) or has penetrated to the serosal coat (placenta percreta).  

6.0 Management  
6.1 Immediate management if NOT bleeding  
• Inform the labour ward coordinator.  
• If the mother or birthing parent has opted for physiological management  active 
management is recommended when there is a failure to deliver the placenta within 60 
minutes.  
• Consent for the commencement of active management should be obtained.  
• Catheterise the bladder with an indwelling catheter and leave in situ to monitor output.  
• Advise the mother or birthing person to latch the baby on to the breast to encourage a 
uterine contraction. If the mother or birthing person has chosen not to breastfeed explain 
the benefits of breastfeeding for the mother or birthing person and baby in this situation 
(uterine contraction). Respect the mother or birthing person’s wishes ensuring provision of 
informed choice.  
• Support the mother or birthing person to sit upright (possibly on top of a bed pan or a walk 
to the toilet)  
• Unclamp the umbilical cord and allow blood to drain from the maternal birthing person 
end. 
• Once retained placenta is diagnosed at a homebirth, consider transfer via ambulance into 
a hospital setting for further management.  
• Inform the obstetric registrar of the situation.  
• Site a 16G wide-bore venflon and take blood for group and save, full blood count and 
U&Es.   
• Consider IV infusion of crystalloid (Hartmann’s or sodium chloride 0.9%).   
• Monitor the pulse and BP every 15 minutes .  
• Observe closely for bleeding.  
• Keep the mother or birthing person nil by mouth.  
• Intravenous oxytocin infusion should not be used if there is no active bleeding.  

If the placenta remains undelivered 30 minutes after active management or 1 hour following 
physiological management (or sooner if there is concern about the woman or birthing person’s 
condition) an assessment of the need to remove the placenta should be offered.  
NB: Do not pull on the cord if the placenta fails to descend with gentle traction.  
If manual removal of the placenta is required, this must be carried out under effective 
regional anaesthesia (or general anaesthesia when necessary).  

6.2 Immediate management if actively bleeding  
Follow the procedures outlined above and:  
• Commence an oxytocin infusion 40 units in 50mls of sodium chloride 0.9% at 
12.5mls/hour via a syringe driver.  
• Prepare for manual removal of placenta in theatre.  
• Obstetric registrar/SHO to obtain consent for procedure.  
• Request crossmatch of 2 units of blood.  
• Obstetric registrar to inform anaesthetist.  
• Commence PPH proforma. See Maternity obstetric haemorrhage guidance.  
• Labour ward coordinator to inform theatre team.  
• Maintain an accurate fluid balance on MIS (including a running blood loss total).  
• Give one dose of prophylactic intravenous Cefuroxime
