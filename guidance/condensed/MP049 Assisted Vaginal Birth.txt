Assisted Vaginal Birth (RSCH PRH only) MP049

Key Principles:
- Protocol is a set of standards for action
- Professional judgement may be used

Scope:
- Applies to any woman or pregnant person in labor needing assistance

Responsibilities:
- Midwives & Obstetricians: Follow guidance and use professional judgement
- Management: Ensure protocol is reviewed and accessible

Assisted Instrumental Vaginal Birth:
- Goal is to mimic spontaneous birth with minimal morbidity
- Rates are stable at 10-15%
- Interventions to reduce need for operative birth include support, positions, and delayed pushing

Indications for offering operative vaginal birth:
- No indication is absolute, each case considered individually
- Indications include fetal compromise, malposition, and inadequate progress

Contraindications to Operative Vaginal Birth:
- Ventouse contraindicated in face presentation or <34 weeks gestation
- Forceps used in these cases
- Other contraindications include bony fracture history and certain medical conditions

Conditions and Pre-requisites for Safe Operative Vaginal Birth:
- Clinicians who can perform procedure listed
- Assessment and choice of instrument important
- Rotational births should be done by experienced operators

Risks of Instrumental Delivery:
- Risks of Ventouse and forceps delivery for both maternal and fetal
- Vacuum extraction more likely to fail delivery but less likely for maternal trauma compared to forceps

Preparation for Operative Vaginal Delivery:
- Clear communication with pregnant woman and healthcare professionals
- Explanation of procedure and risks to be documented

Informed Consent: Verbal consent should be obtained prior to operative deliveries in the delivery room, with written consent obtained for deliveries in theatre. Discussion of the conversation should be documented. 

Location: Operative vaginal births can be performed in the birth room if deemed appropriate. Adequate pain relief should be ensured, with higher risk deliveries conducted in theatre for immediate recourse to cesarean birth. 

Analgesia: Appropriate analgesia options should be in place, including epidural/spinal analgesia and pudendal block with local anesthetic. 

Bladder Care: An in-out catheter should be recommended prior to the procedure, with proper hygiene and aseptic techniques employed. 

Neonatal Resuscitation: Personnel trained in neonatal resuscitation should be present. 

Ventouse/Kiwi Assisted Delivery: Proper application of ventouse and indications for abandoning the procedure should be followed. 

Non-Rotational Forceps Assisted Delivery: Proper application and indications for abandoning the procedure should be followed. 

Rotational Forceps Delivery: Proper application of Keilland forceps and indications for abandoning the procedure should be followed. 

Episiotomy/Perineal Care: Mediolateral episiotomy should be discussed and performed as needed with effective analgesia. 

Aftercare Following Operative Vaginal Birth: Thorough inspection of perineal and vaginal trauma should be completed, antibiotics should be given, and regular analgesia provided. 

Care of the Bladder After Birth: Timing and volume of first void should be recorded, education on risk of urinary retention should be provided, and strategies to reduce risk of urinary incontinence should be offered.

16 Post-Delivery Documentation: 
- Document benefits, risks, and informed consent pre-delivery 
- Indicate reason for operative vaginal birth and procedure performed 
- Ensure mother has adequate analgesia 
- Document swab and instrument count 
- Document sequential instruments used or reason for procedure abandonment 
- Complete perineal repair documentation 
- Record decision to birth time interval 

17 Debriefing: 
- Review indication for assisted vaginal birth, complications, and advice for future births 
- Encourage spontaneous vaginal birth in subsequent pregnancies 
- Individualize care for perineal tear or ongoing pelvic floor issues 
- Allow woman to ask questions during postnatal period 
- Offer advice and support for traumatic birth experiences 
- Offer debriefing service before discharge
