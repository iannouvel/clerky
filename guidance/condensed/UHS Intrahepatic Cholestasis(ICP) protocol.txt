Introduction: ICP affects pregnancies, likely multifactorial, with characteristics of pruritus and deranged liver function tests.

Diagnosis: Consider ICP in pregnant individuals with itching and raised bile acids, confirm postnatally.

History and examination: Structured assessment to exclude other causes of itching and liver dysfunction.

Investigations: Bile acid measurement indicative of ICP, consider additional investigations for atypical cases.

Discussion of risks: Maternal and perinatal risks associated with ICP.

Management: Antenatal care includes monitoring and consultant-led care, drug treatments for symptom relief.

- Consider 10mg water soluble vitamin K if prothrombin time is elevated or evidence of reduced absorption of dietary fats
- Pregnant women and people with total bile acids >100 micromol/l should have an urgent consultant review
- Timing of birth should be planned by a consultant obstetrician based on co-morbidities and peak bile acid concentration
- Consider planned birth at 38-39 weeks for moderate ICP, and 35-36 weeks for severe ICP
- Offer continuous electronic fetal monitoring to pregnant women with peak bile acids â‰¥100 micromol/L
- Inform women with ICP that the itch usually stops after birth and LFTs should return to normal within a few weeks
- BAs and LFTs should be checked at 4 weeks post birth
- Pregnant women with on-going abnormalities should be investigated for other causes of abnormal liver function
- Pregnant women with previous ICP should consider progesterone-only or non-hormonal contraception
- Pregnant women should be advised about the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies and referred for consultant-led care if symptoms develop
- Audit suggested questions include proportion of pregnant women offered timing of birth in line with guidelines and proportion offered continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labor.
