Referral for Low Platelets in Pregnancy Protocol: Aimed at providing a clear process for referral of pregnant women/people with low platelet counts. Thrombocytopenia can occur in 8-10% of pregnancies, usually mild but can have severe complications. This protocol outlines the referral pathway for managing new onset thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Includes responsibilities for midwives, obstetricians, and management to ensure compliance and accessibility. Referral process involves various steps based on platelet count levels, with urgent referrals for platelets below 50. All referrals to be made through the Joint Haematology and Obstetric Clinic.
