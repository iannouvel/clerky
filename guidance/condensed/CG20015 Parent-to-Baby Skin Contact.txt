Skin-to-skin contact is the practice where a baby is dried and laid directly on their mother's bare chest after birth, covered in a warm blanket. This contact can take place anytime a baby needs comforting or calming and has many benefits for both the mother and baby. It helps regulate the baby's heart rate, breathing, digestion, and temperature, and stimulates bonding and breastfeeding. In neonatal units, it is known as 'kangaroo care' and can improve oxygen saturation, reduce stress levels, and support growth. All mothers should have uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with their baby after birth, and discussions should take place antenatally to promote this practice. During birth, it is important to facilitate immediate skin-to-skin contact, even after caesarean births, to support the baby's instinctive behaviors and breastfeeding.

Babies will naturally move towards the breast, rest before feeding, and self-attach. Skin-to-skin contact is important for establishing breastfeeding and calming the baby. Hospitals must support skin-to-skin contact after birth. Observations of the mother and baby should be documented. Safety considerations include monitoring the baby's well-being and ensuring a clear airway during skin-to-skin contact. Partners should be supported in caring for the baby.
