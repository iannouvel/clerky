Email: clinicaleffectiveness@rcog.org.ukKey recommendations
• In this guideline, recurrent miscarriage has been defined as three or more first 
trimester miscarriages. However, clinicians are encouraged to use their clinical 
discretion to recommend extensive evaluation after two first trimester miscar -
riages, if there is a suspicion that the miscarriages are of pathological and not of 
sporadic nature.
• Women with recurrent miscarriage should be offered testing for acquired 
thrombophilia, particularly for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin anti -
bodies, prior to pregnancy. [Grade C]
• Women with second trimester miscarriage may be offered testing for Factor V 
Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation and protein S deficiency, ideally within a 
research context. [Grade C]
• Inherited thrombophilias have a weak association with recurrent miscarriage. 
Routine testing for protein C, antithrombin deficiency and methylenetetrahy -
drofolate reductase mutation is not recommended. [Grade C]
• Cytogenetic analysis should be offered on pregnancy tissue of the third and 
subsequent miscarriage(s) and in any second trimester miscarriage. [Grade D]
• Parental peripheral blood karyotyping should be offered for couples in whom 
testing of pregnancy tissue reports an unbalanced structural chromosomal ab -
normality [Grade D] or there is unsuccessful or no pregnancy tissue available 
for testing. [GPP]
• Women with recurrent miscarriage should be offered assessment for congenital 
uterine anomalies, ideally with 3D ultrasound. [Grade B]
• Women with recurrent miscarriage should be offered thyroid function tests 
and assessment for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. [Grade C]
• Women with recurrent miscarriage should not be routinely offered immuno -
logical screening (such as HLA, cytokine and natural killer cell tests), infection 
screening or sperm DNA testing outside a research context. [Grade C]
• Women with recurrent miscarriage should be advised to maintain a BMI be -
tween 19 and 25 kg/m2, smoking cessation, limit alcohol consumption and 
limit caffeine to less than 200 mg/day. [Grade D]
• For women diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome, aspirin and heparin 
should be offered from a positive test until at least 34 weeks of gestation, fol -
lowing discussion of potential benefits versus risks. [Grade B] Aspirin and/or 
heparin should not be given to women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage.

GREEN- TOP GUIDELINE NO. 17
1 | PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance on the 
investigation and care of women and people with recurrent 
miscarriage.
Within this document we use the terms woman and 
women's health. However, it is important to acknowledge 
that it is not only women for whom it is necessary to access 
women's health and reproductive services in order to main -
tain their gynaecological health and reproductive wellbeing. 
Gynaecological and obstetric services and delivery of care 
must therefore be appropriate, inclusive and sensitive to the 
needs of those individuals whose gender identity does not 
align with the sex they were assigned at birth. The term cou -
ple is used to describe two individuals trying to conceive, 
recognising that in some instances these individuals may 
not be in a relationship. While every effort is made to ensure 
the RCOG uses inclusive language there are instances where 
we have been unable to adhere to this, for example where 
original research is being referenced the language within the 
publication is used for accuracy.
2 | INTRODUCTION AND 
BACKGROUND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Miscarriage is defined as the spontaneous loss of pregnancy 
before the fetus reaches viability. The term therefore in -
cludes all pregnancy losses from the time of conception until 
24 weeks of gestation. It should be noted that advances in 
neonatal care have resulted in more babies surviving birth 
before 24 weeks of gestation.
There are two types of miscarriage: sporadic and recur -
rent. Sporadic miscarriage (occurring most commonly in the 
first trimester) is often the result of random fetal chromo -
somal anomalies.1,2 Its incidence increases with age and may 
affect between 10% and 50% of women aged 20 to 45 years 
respectively.3 By contrast, recurrent miscarriage has tradi -
tionally been defined as three or more miscarriages affecting approximately only 1% of women.4,5 A similar incidence of 
approximately 1% is also the case for women experiencing a 
second trimester miscarriage, where random fetal chromo -
somal anomalies are significantly lower.6
Several features suggest that recurrent miscarriage is a 
distinct clinical entity rather than just three incidental spo -
radic miscarriages occurring by chance: i) a woman's risk of 
miscarriage is directly related to the outcomes of previous 
pregnancies, ii) the average observed incidence of recur -
rent miscarriage is higher than what would be expected by 
chance alone, and iii) unlike sporadic miscarriage, recurrent 
miscarriage tends to occur even if the fetus has no chromo -
somal anomalies.5
Overall, the greatest determinant of the incidence of re -
current miscarriage is age,7 while the number of previous 
miscarriages affects the chance of a live birth across all age 
groups.8
The incidence of recurrent miscarriage would more than 
double if two miscarriages were used for the definition, as 
the pooled risk has been shown to be 1.9% (1.8– 2.1%) for two 
miscarriages and 0.7% (0.5– 0.8%) for three miscarriages.9
It is worth noting that at the time of writing these guide -
lines a Lancet Series of three articles dedicated to miscarriage 
was published, which challenged the traditional approach 
and distinction of care between sporadic and recurrent mis -
carriage. It criticised any pervasive attitude of acceptance to -
wards sporadic miscarriage and called for worldwide reform 
that would improve the support and care of women and their 
partners after one miscarriage (not just after three).9– 12
In the Series, the authors proposed a graded model of 
care, where after one miscarriage women would have their 
health needs evaluated and would be provided with infor -
mation and guidance to support future pregnancies. If a 
second miscarriage were to occur, they would be offered an 
appointment at a miscarriage clinic for initial investigations, 
extra support and early reassurance scans for subsequent 
pregnancies. Finally, after three miscarriages they would 
be offered a full series of evidence- based investigations and 
care, as described in guidelines such as these.9– 12• There are currently insufficient data to support the routine use of PGT- A for 
couples with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, while the treatment may carry 
a significant cost and potential risk. [Grade C]
• Resection of a uterine septum should be considered for women with recurrent 
first or second trimester miscarriage, ideally within an appropriate audit or 
research context. [Grade C]
• Thyroxine supplementation is not routinely recommended for euthyroid 
women with TPO who have a history of miscarriage. [Grade A]
• Progestogen supplementation should be considered in women with recurrent 
miscarriage who present with bleeding in early pregnancy (for example 400 mg 
micronised vaginal progesterone twice daily at the time of bleeding until 16 
weeks of gestation). [Grade B]
• Women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage should be offered supportive 
care, ideally in the setting of a dedicated recurrent miscarriage clinic. [Grade C]

RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE
Although the care of women and couples after sporadic 
miscarriages is outside of the remit of this guideline, the 
model should be encouraged as it appears to bridge the gap 
between sporadic and recurrent miscarriage care, encourag -
ing a systematic graded approach rather than a fragmented 
one. It also addresses the balance between the need for 
evidence- based and supportive care, while targeting health -
care resources effectively.
3 | DEFINITIONS AND 
TERMINOLOGY
The terminology and definitions used in reference to recur -
rent miscarriage vary considerably. The American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) have used the term recur -
rent pregnancy loss13 and have recommended clinical evalu -
ation after two first trimester clinical pregnancy losses (i.e. 
those documented by ultrasonography or histopathological 
examination). However, they have recommended a threshold 
of three or more losses for epidemiological studies.14
The European Society for Human Reproduction and 
Embryology (ESHRE) have described, in their 2017 guide -
line, a discrepancy in opinions among their guideline group 
members and concluded with a definition of two or more 
pregnancy losses.15
In this guideline, recurrent miscarriage has been defined 
as three or more first trimester miscarriages, in keeping with 
the previous RCOG guidelines. However, clinicians are en -
couraged to use their clinical discretion to recommend ex -
tensive evaluation after two first trimester miscarriages, if 
there is a suspicion that the miscarriages are of pathological 
and not of sporadic nature (for example if a woman has had 
a pregnancy loss with a normal non- invasive prenatal test or 
karyotype). Owing to the fact that the incidence of certain 
diagnoses does not appear to differ between women with 
consecutive versus non- consecutive losses, the definition 
in the present guideline has not been restricted to women suffering with consecutive miscarriages only.16,17 In addi -
tion, it is not restricted to miscarriages suffered with the 
same partner, as certain maternal pathologies would be un -
affected by the partner.
4 | IDENTIFICATION AND 
ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE
The Cochrane Library and electronic databases (DARE, 
EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed) were searched 
looking for the following terms in the title or abstract 
‘spontaneous abortion’, ‘miscarriage’, ‘pregnancy loss’, 
‘consecutive miscarriage’, ‘risk factors’, ‘prenatal care’, and 
‘pregnancy care’. The search was restricted to articles pub -
lished until November 2021, while additional key references 
were added during the review process. The full search strat -
egy is available to view online as supporting information 
(Appendix S1 and S2).
This guideline was developed using the methodology 
described in the RCOG handbook Developing a Green- top 
Guideline: Guidance for developers .
5 | RISK FACTORS FOR 
RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE
A list of risk factors where the chance of miscarriage has 
been quantified by studies is shown in Appendix 2. These 
are further described below.
5.1 | Epidemiological factors
Advancing maternal age is associated with a decline in both 
the number and quality of the remaining oocytes, resulting 
in higher rates of aneuploidy in the fertilised embryos. A large 
prospective register linkage study estimated the age- related

risk of miscarriage to be: 12– 19 years, 13%; 20– 24 years, 11%; 
25– 29 years, 12%; 30– 34 years, 15%; 35– 39 years, 25%; 40– 44 
years, 51%; and 45 or more years, 93%.3 [Evidence level 2++]
A meta- analysis has also reported increased miscarriage 
rates for men aged over 40 years, although far less pro -
nounced when compared with the effect of increased mater -
nal age.18 [Evidence level 2++]
A systematic review has reported the miscarriage rates to 
be 11.3%, 17.0%, 28.0%, 39.6%, 47.2% and 63.9% for women 
with no, one, two or three, four, five and six previous miscar -
riages respectively.19 [Evidence level 2++]
In two studies, primary versus secondary (those with a pre-
vious live birth) recurrent miscarriage did not result in a signifi-
cantly different future prognosis.20,21 [Evidence level 2+]
A large observational study found that compared with 
white Europeans, the odds of a sporadic miscarriage were 
increased in Black African and Black Caribbean women.22 
[Evidence level 2+]
Observational studies have not demonstrated an associa -
tion between consanguinity and recurrent miscarriage.23,24 
[Evidence level 2– ]
Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of sporadic 
miscarriage.25 [Evidence level 2+]
An observational database study found an increased risk 
of spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester for women 
consuming five or more alcoholic drinks/week (approxi -
mately 10 units/week).26 [Evidence level 2+]
Similarly, there is some evidence for an association be -
tween increased caffeine intake and sporadic miscarriage.27 
[Evidence level 2++]
Observational studies have reported that obesity increases 
the risk of sporadic miscarriage.28– 30 In the meta- analysis 
of Ng et al. (2021) women with a BMI below 19 and above 
25 kg/m2 were at higher odds of recurrent miscarriage.31 
[Evidence level 1+]
The association between environmental risk factors (such 
as air pollution and household chemicals) and pregnancy 
loss is based mainly on women with sporadic rather than re -
current miscarriage.32 The results are limited by difficulties 
in controlling for confounding factors, reporting of data on 
exposure and the measurement of toxin dose. Nevertheless, 
awareness of a potential adverse association should be raised 
and future well conducted studies should be encouraged. 
[Evidence level 2– ]
A number of small studies have assessed dietary variables 
such as selenium,33,34 vitamin D35 and vitamin B1236 specifi -
cally in the population with recurrent miscarriage, although 
no definitive or clinically altering conclusions can be drawn. 
[Evidence level 2– ]
5.2 | Thrombophilia
5.2.1 | Acquired
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined as the asso -
ciation between antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin [aCL] antibodies and anti- 
beta- 2- glycoprotein- I antibodies) and adverse pregnancy 
outcome or vascular thrombosis.37,38
Adverse pregnancy outcomes include:
• three or more consecutive miscarriages before 10 weeks of 
gestation;
• one or more morphologically normal fetal losses after the 
tenth week of gestation;
• one or more preterm births before 34+0 weeks of gestation 
because of placental disease.
In a meta- analysis including a total of 25 studies exam -
ining the association between the various aPL and recurrent 
miscarriage39: [Evidence level 2++] 
• Lupus anticoagulant was found to have the strongest as -
sociation with recurrent miscarriage (OR 7.79; 95% CI 
2.30– 26.45).
• IgG and IgM aCL antibodies were found to have the sec -
ond strongest association with recurrent miscarriage, 
with odds ratios of 3.57 (95% CI 2.26– 5.65) and 5.61 (95% 
CI 1.26– 25.03) respectively.
• Anti- beta- 2- glycoprotein- I antibodies showed a trend to -
wards a positive association, but this did not reach statis -
tical significance (OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.69– 6.53) prompting 
the authors to recommend further studies to clarify the 
role of anti- beta- 2- glycoprotein- I antibodies in recurrent 
miscarriage.
There are limited data on using clinical assays of 
other aPL (such as phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl cho -
line, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, 
phosphatidyl inositol and phosphatidyl serine) and pre -
liminary studies do not suggest an additional value or 
sensitivity in diagnosis associated with their use.40 In 
addition, the lack of laboratory standardisation of these 
clinical assays may lead to confusion and overdiagnosis 
of APS. [Evidence level 3]
5.2.2 | Inherited

tion, protein C and S deficiencies, antithrombin deficiency 
and prothrombin gene mutation, are established causes of TABLE 2 Risk table acquired thrombophilia.

RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE
systemic thrombosis. However, inherited thrombophilias 
have also been implicated as a possible cause in recurrent 
miscarriage and late pregnancy complications with the pre -
sumed mechanism being thrombosis of the uteroplacental 
circulation.
Meta- analyses of pooled data suggest that the magni -
tude of the association between inherited thrombophilias 
and fetal loss varies according to the type of thrombo -
philia, timing of fetal loss, maternal ethnicity and mater -
nal age. It is generally recognised that there is a stronger 
and more consistent association between second trimester 
miscarriages and inherited thrombophilias.41,42 [Evidence 
level 2++]
To date, the following associations have been shown 
through systematic reviews and meta- analyses: [Evidence 
level 2++] 
• Factor V Leiden appears to be associated with first and 
particularly second trimester recurrent miscarriages.41,43
• Prothrombin gene mutation is associated with recurrent 
miscarriage.41– 43
• Protein S deficiency has not demonstrated a consis -
tent association with recurrent first trimester mis -
carriage, but has shown an association with second 
trimester.41,44,45
• Protein C deficiency has not shown a consistent associa -
tion with recurrent miscarriage.41,44
• Methylenetatrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) muta -
tion (heterozygous and homozygous) has been found to 
have a significant association with recurrent miscarriage 
in one meta- analysis from China.46 However other meta- 
analyses did not find an association and advise against 
testing for this mutation.41,47
• Antithrombin deficiency is the rarer yet most thrombo -
genic mutation; however, the European prospective cohort 
study on thrombophilia (EPCOT) found only a possible 
association with sporadic miscarriage44 while a subse -
quent meta- analysis did not.41
5.3 | Genetic factors
5.3.1 | Parental chromosomal rearrangements
The incidence of parental chromosomal rearrangements 
appears to be associated with recurrent miscarriage, with 
one large database study estimating that a translocation is present in 2.2% of parents after one miscarriage, 4.8% 
after two miscarriages, and 5.7% after three miscarriages.48 
Studies, however, have reported a low risk of parents with 
balanced translocations having a pregnancy with an unbal -
anced karyotype surviving into the second trimester (0.8%) 
or a disabled child born with an unbalanced chromosome 
abnormality (0.02%).49,50 [Evidence level 2+]
In a study by Franssen et al.,49 although overall the 
chances of parents with a balanced structural chromosome 
abnormality having a healthy child was found to be 83%, 
which was similar to the control couples (84%), the former 
had a higher chance of a subsequent miscarriage compared 
with the latter group (49% versus 30%; P < 0.01), something 
which has also been supported by other more recent stud -
ies.51 The association between the type of parental chromo -
somal rearrangement and risk of subsequent miscarriage 
also appear dependent on the type of rearrangement, as 
miscarriage rates for parents with reciprocal translocations, 
inversions, Robertsonian translocations, and other types of 
chromosomal anomalies have been shown to be 54%, 49%, 
34% and 27% respectively.49 [Evidence level 2+]
5.3.2 | Fetal chromosomal anomalies
Chromosome anomalies of the pregnancy are the com-
monest cause of both sporadic miscarriage and recurrent 
miscarriage. A review reported that approximately 50% 
of sporadic miscarriages are a result of fetal chromosome 
anomalies (pooled prevalence 49.7%; 95% CI 34.9– 64.6%). 
Among those with anomalies, in descending order of fre -
quency were: trisomy (51.9%); polyploidy (18.8%); mono -
somy (15.2%); structural anomalies (6.5%); and others 
(7.6%).52 [Evidence level 2– ]TABLE 3 Risk table inherited thrombophilia.

GREEN- TOP GUIDELINE NO. 17
The incidence of aneuploidy in recurrent miscarriage was 
found to be approximately 40% (40.4%; 95% CI 25.2– 55.7%), 
suggesting that non- genetic factors may play a more import -
ant role in recurrent miscarriage.53 A study has shown that 
miscarriages following assisted reproductive treatment have 
rates of cytogenetic anomalies similar to sporadic miscar -
riages (56.8% versus 53.6%; OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71– 1.73).52 
[Evidence level 2++]
It is worth noting that with newer molecular techniques 
a further 5– 7% submicroscopic variants may also be de -
tected.52,54 This may be reflected by the fact that newer 
studies using microarray techniques have been reporting 
even higher number of cytogenetic anomalies in women 
with sporadic miscarriages of up to 59.4% (1106/2389).55 
[Evidence level 2++]
When examining missed miscarriages with a normal 
karyotype, embryoscopic studies have also shown a further 
18% of fetuses to have morphological defects,56 although it 
cannot be ascertained whether this is a result of maternal 
factors or fetal genetic anomalies not evident on traditional 
karyotyping. [Evidence level 2+]
Studies have shown that the higher the number of eu -
ploid miscarriages, the higher the chance of a subsequent 
miscarriage,57 presumably owing to the higher chance of 
a persistent maternal pathology rather than a sporadic 
aneuploidy. Equally, a finding of an aneuploid embryo 
has been found to confer an improved prognosis in the 
subsequent pregnancy.58,59 This is assuming that the 
women are age adjusted, as an older woman with an an -
euploid loss may still have a worse prognosis compared 
with a younger woman with a euploid loss. It may also 
not be the case with parental chromosome anomalies, as 
the embryonic aneuploidy in these cases is secondary to 
parental pathology and not sporadic in nature. [Evidence 
level 2+]
5.4 | Anatomical factors
5.4.1 | Congenital uterine anomalies
Incidence
The incidence of congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) ap -
pears to be higher than previously thought, owing to im -
proved diagnostic imaging modalities.60 A systematic review and meta- analysis has estimated the prevalence to be 5.5% 
(95% CI 3.5– 8.5%) in unselected women, 8.0% (95% CI 
5.3– 12%) in infertile women, 13.3% (95% CI 8.9– 20.0%) in 
women with recurrent miscarriage and 24.5% (95% CI 18.3– 
32.8) in women with infertility and miscarriage. The com -
monest anomalies across all populations appear to be the 
canalisation defects (i.e. the septate variety) followed by the 
unification defects (i.e. the bicornuate and unicornuate vari -
ety).61 [Evidence level 2++]
First trimester miscarriage
In terms of reproductive outcomes, a meta- analysis has 
shown that the risk of sporadic first trimester miscarriage 
was not significantly increased in women with arcuate (RR 
1.22, 95% CI 0.87– 1.72; six studies), didelphys (RR 1.13, 95% 
CI 0.45– 2.86; four studies) and unicornuate uteri (RR 1.38, 
95% CI 0.83– 2.28; five studies) versus normal controls.62 
[Evidence level 2++]
However, women with septate (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.39– 
5.06; six studies) and bicornuate uteri (RR 2.32, 95% CI 
1.05– 5.13; four studies) had a significantly increased risk 
of sporadic first trimester miscarriage versus normal con -
trols.62 [Evidence level 2++]
Second trimester miscarriage
The risk of sporadic second trimester miscarriage was not 
significantly increased in women with didelphys (RR 1.71, 
95% CI 0.63– 4.59; four studies) and unicornuate uteri (RR 
2.27, 95% CI 0.64– 7.96; four studies) versus normal con -
trols.62 [Evidence level 2++]
However, women with arcuate (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.06– 
3.69; five studies), septate (RR 2.95, 95% CI 1.51– 5.77; five 
studies) and bicornuate uteri (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.56– 5.41; 
four studies) had a significantly increased risk of sporadic 
second trimester miscarriage versus controls.62 [Evidence 
level 2++]
When assessing a population with recurrent miscarriage, 
there were not enough studies in the literature to perform 
a meta- analysis in terms of subtypes of anomalies or first 
versus second trimester miscarriages; however, the overall 
rate of subsequent miscarriage (first or second trimester) 
remained significantly increased 1.13 (1.06– 1.22) compared 
with women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage.62 
[Evidence level 2++]
It is worth noting that since this meta- analysis, a large pro-
spective study by Prior et al. (2018), using gold standard 3D 
ultrasound solely to diagnose the arcuate uterus (in contrast 
to the varying diagnostic modalities included in the studies 
of the meta- analysis), reported similar clinical pregnancy and 
live birth rates between arcuate and normal uteri.63 Moreover, 
all the latest classifications on uterine anomalies (ESHRE/
European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy [ESGE], 
Congenital Uterine Malformation by Experts [CUME] and 
ASRM) consider the arcuate uterus to be a normal variant 
with no clinical implications, something which should be re -
assuring to both clinicians and patients.64– 66TABLE 6 Risk table anatomical factors.

There are limited prospective case– control data evaluating 
the association between acquired uterine anomalies and 
sporadic or recurrent miscarriage.
Myomas
In a large meta- analysis of a general obstetric population, 
including 1394 women with myomas and 20 435 without, 
no increase in risk of miscarriage was found (11.5% versus 
8.0%; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.80– 1.52).67 However, the distinction 
between submucosal, intramural and subserosal myomas, 
which are known to affect fertility in varying degrees, was 
limited.68 The authors concluded that failure of prior studies 
to adjust for confounders may have led to the common clini -
cal belief that leiomyomas are a risk factor for miscarriage. 
[Evidence level 2++]
An analysis from prospectively collected data in a re -
current miscarriage population found a similar incidence 
of myomas to that reported in the general population (8.2% 
versus 10.4%).69,70 However, in the recurrent miscarriage 
study, women with submucosal and intramural/subserosal 
myomas were found to have a higher proportion of second 
trimester miscarriages compared with women with unex -
plained recurrent miscarriage (21.7% and 17.6% versus 8.0% 
respectively; P < 0.01). Women with submucosal myomas 
undergoing resection had a significant reduction in second 
trimester miscarriage rates (21.7% to 0%; P < 0.01), although 
there was a lack of a case– control group to compare what the 
outcome would have been if women with submucosal myo -
mas had not undergone resection. In the same study, women 
with intramural/subserosal myomas did not undergo sur -
gery and experienced similar live birth rate compared with 
the unexplained recurrent miscarriage group in the subse -
quent pregnancy.70 [Evidence level 3]
Endometrial polyps
There are no data to our knowledge specifically examining 
the effect of polyps on sporadic or recurrent miscarriage. 
Therefore, it seems reasonable to recommend management 
similar to that of the general population.71
Intrauterine adhesions
There is a plausible link between intrauterine adhesions and 
miscarriage, although this currently remains unsubstan -
tiated. These include: i) constriction of the uterine cavity 
caused by adhesions, ii) lack of a sufficient amount of normal endometrial tissue to support implantation and develop -
ment of the placenta, and iii) defective vascularisation of the 
residual endometrial tissue consequent upon fibrosis of en -
dometrium.72 [Evidence level 3]
A systematic review and meta- analysis has demonstrated 
that the incidence of intrauterine adhesions increases with 
the number of previous miscarriages experienced (OR 1.99, 
95% CI 1.32– 3.00; seven studies) and the number of previous 
dilatation and curettage procedures (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.35– 
3.12; seven studies).73 [Evidence level 2++]
This has major implications for women with recurrent 
miscarriage who are at risk of undergoing surgical manage -
ment of miscarriage. In the meta- analysis by Hooker et al.63 
similar pregnancy outcomes were reported subsequent to 
conservative, medical and surgical treatment of miscarriage, 
although the number of studies evaluating the long- term 
reproductive outcome was limited and different time scales 
were used. Owing to a large variation in primary outcomes, 
methodology and populations, they were unable to perform 
meta- analyses on reproductive outcome after miscarriage. 
[Evidence level 3]
Small cohort studies have, however, suggested that women 
with intrauterine adhesions and endometrial thickness less 
than 5 mm have higher sporadic miscarriage rates versus 
women with endometrial thickness of more than 5 mm (50% 
versus 8.3%; P < 0.001).74 [Evidence level 3]
5.4.3 | Cervical integrity
Causes of second trimester miscarriage appear to overlap 
with the causes of first trimester miscarriage on one end 
of the spectrum and causes of preterm birth on the other 
end of the spectrum. Cervical insufficiency, along with in -
fection and congenital uterine anomalies appear to be main 
contributors of second trimester miscarriage.75 Although in -
vestigations have been reported to reveal a diagnosis in only 
approximately 50% of cases in dedicated clinics,76 future 
developments, such as in the field of the maternal microbi -
ome may shed more light in these so far unexplained cases.77 
[Evidence level 2– ]
The true incidence of cervical insufficiency remains un -
known, since the diagnosis is clinical. There is currently no 
satisfactory objective test that can identify women with cer -
vical insufficiency in the non- pregnant state. The diagnosis 
is usually based on a history of second trimester miscarriage, 
where commonly there has been painless cervical dilatation, 
with often intact membranes until the expulsion of the sac 
and a live fetus.76 By extrapolation from data on extreme TABLE 7 Risk table anatomical factors.

preterm birth, a previous cervical cone biopsy78 or an ultra -
sonographically short cervix79 appear to significantly pre -
dispose to second trimester miscarriage. [Evidence level 2– ]
5.5 | Endocrine
Systemic maternal endocrine disorders such as diabetes mel -
litus and thyroid disease have been associated with miscar -
riage. Women with diabetes who have high haemoglobin 
A1c levels in the first trimester are at risk of miscarriage 
and fetal malformation.80 However, well- controlled diabetes 
mellitus is not a risk factor for recurrent miscarriage, nor 
is treated thyroid dysfunction.81,82 The incidence of diabetes 
mellitus and thyroid dysfunction in women who suffer re -
current miscarriage appears similar to that reported in the 
general population.83,84 [Evidence level 2+]
However, the incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism 
(SCH) (on this occasion defined as TSH more than 2.5 
mIU/l) has been reported to be raised in a small observa -
tional study of women with recurrent miscarriage,85 while 
data from a meta- analysis on sporadic miscarriages also sug -
gests an association.86 [Evidence level 2– ]
The case appears to be the same for subclinical thyroid 
dysfunction associated with thyroid autoimmunity. Two 
systematic reviews and meta- analyses reported that the pres -
ence of thyroid antibodies was associated with an increased 
risk of recurrent miscarriage.87,88 [Evidence level 2++]
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been linked to 
an increased risk of miscarriage but the exact mechanism 
remains unclear.89 Polycystic ovarian morphology, elevated 
serum luteinising hormone levels or elevated serum testos -
terone levels do not appear to predict an increased risk of fu -
ture pregnancy loss among ovulatory women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who conceive spontaneously.90 The 
increased risk of miscarriage in women with PCOS has nev -
ertheless been attributed to insulin resistance, hyperinsuli -
naemia and hyperandrogenaemia. The prevalence of insulin 
resistance91 and abnormal glucose tolerance test92 appears 
to be increased in women with recurrent miscarriage com -
pared with controls. An elevated free androgen index ap -
pears to be a prognostic factor for a subsequent miscarriage 
in women with recurrent miscarriage.89 [Evidence level 2+]
Prolactin imbalances have been implicated in recur -
rent miscarriage. One study reported an increased level 
of prolactin in women with recurrent miscarriage versus 
controls,83 while another study reported marginally lower 
prolactin levels in women with recurrent miscarriage who 
experienced a live birth versus those who miscarried.93 A 
small randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 48 women with 
recurrent miscarriage and hyperprolactinaemia were ran -
domised into bromocriptine versus no bromocriptine, show -
ing significant differences in live birth (85.7% versus 52.4% 
respectively, P < 0.05).94 Overall it appears that maintaining 
a normal level of prolactin may be beneficial in this context. 
[Evidence level 2– ]
The diagnosis of a luteal phase defect varies significantly in 
the literature, making it difficult to assess. One study found a 
higher incidence of a luteal phase defect (midluteal progester -
one less than 30 nmol/l) in women with recurrent miscarriage 
versus fertile controls (27% versus 11%),84 whereas another 
study found no correlation between the presence of a luteal 
phase defect (midluteal progesterone less than 10 ng/ml) and 
the chance of subsequent miscarriage in 197 women with 
recurrent miscarriage.95 Given the limited and inconsistent 
data from histological and serological examinations during 
the midluteal phase, molecular studies of the endometrium 
may prove to be more insightful. [Evidence level 2– ]
5.6 | Immune factors
5.6.1 | Peripheral
HLA
A systematic review and meta- analysis including 41 stud -
ies (of which selection bias was present in 40 studies and 
information bias in all studies) showed an increased risk of 
recurrent miscarriage in mothers carrying a HLA- DRB1*4 
(OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05– 1.90), HLA- DRB1*15 (OR 1.57, 95% 
CI 1.15– 2.14), or a HLA- E*01:01 allele (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.20–

0.94). However, although associations between specific HLA 
alleles and HLA sharing with recurrent miscarriage were 
identified, the authors suggested that no consistent conclu -
sions can be drawn since the observed ORs were relatively 
small and there was a high risk of selection and information 
bias present in the studies available.96 [Evidence level 2++]
Cytokines
An imbalance in Th1/Th2 cytokines has been implicated 
in adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent mis -
carriage.97 However, research into the role of cytokines in 
recurrent miscarriage is hampered by a number of factors 
including fluctuating levels, discordance between blood and 
endometrial levels and laboratory variability in measure -
ment.98 [Evidence level 2+]
A meta- analysis in 2008 concluded that the available data 
are not consistent with more than modest associations be -
tween cytokine polymorphisms and recurrent miscarriage. 
More recent meta- analyses have shown an association be -
tween some cytokine gene promoter polymorphisms and re -
current miscarriage but not for others.99 Further research is 
required to assess the contribution that disordered cytokines 
make to recurrent miscarriage before routine cytokine tests 
can be introduced to clinical practice. [Evidence level 2+]
Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells
A meta- analysis of studies found that women with recurrent 
miscarriage versus controls had higher peripheral NK cell 
percentages (standardised mean difference [SMD] 1.36; 95% 
CI 0.04– 2.69; P = 0.04) and higher peripheral NK cell num-
bers (SMD 0.81; 95% CI 0.47– 1.16; P < 0.00001).100 [Evidence 
level 2+]
However, the significance of increased peripheral NK 
cells remains debatable,101 as they do not appear to reflect 
the levels in the endometrium,102 show an intracycle, hor -
monal and ethnic variability,103 and appear not to predict 
subsequent miscarriage in a population of women with re -
current miscarriage.104 [Evidence level 2+]
5.6.2 | Uterine
Several studies reported that uterine NK cell density in 
the endometrium around the time of implantation was 
increased.105– 107 A meta- analysis in 2014 showed no signifi -
cant difference between women with recurrent miscarriage 
and controls (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 1.24– 2.04; P = 0.63)100; how -
ever, an inherent difficulty in performing systematic analysis 
was the lack of standardised laboratory protocol and agreed reference range. A multicentre working party later met 
and agreed on the standardisation of laboratory methods 
to measure and report uterine NK cell density,108 based on 
which Chen et al. established a control reference range from 
fertile women and found that women with recurrent miscar -
riage did have significant increase of uterine NK cell density 
in precisely timed endometrial specimens.109 Nevertheless, 
the prognostic value of uterine NK cell measurement re -
mains unconfirmed.106 [Evidence level 2– ]
5.7 | Infective factors
A whole range of organisms have been implicated in first 
and second trimester miscarriage, including ureaplasma/
mycoplasma, organisms causing bacterial vaginosis and 
chlamydia trachomatis.110 For an infective agent to be impli -
cated in the aetiology of recurrent miscarriage, it must be ca -
pable of persisting in the genital tract and avoiding detection 
or must cause insufficient symptoms to disturb the woman. 
Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex 
(TORCH) and listeria infections do not fulfil these criteria 
and therefore routine TORCH screening should not be un -
dertaken.111 [Evidence level 2+]
The presence of bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester 
of pregnancy has been reported as a risk factor for miscar -
riage and preterm birth.112 A meta- analysis showed a statis -
tically significant increase in second trimester miscarriages 
(OR 6.32, 95% CI 3.65– 10.94).113 However, the evidence for 
an association with first trimester miscarriage is inconsis -
tent.114,115 There are also a lack of data regarding the recur -
rent miscarriage population. [Evidence level 2+]
Chronic endometritis has also been implicated in recur -
rent miscarriage, although the diagnostic criteria remain 
controversial.116 Using morphometric analysis to mea -
sure plasma cell count, a study found that the incidence of 
chronic endometritis in women with recurrent miscarriage 
was 10.8%, twice higher than that of fertile women (5.0%).117 
Future molecular studies on the microbiome of the uterine 
cavity will hopefully shed more light into the role of infec -
tions in recurrent miscarriage.118 [Evidence level 2+]

decondensation) to be lower in men experiencing recurrent 
miscarriage versus controls.119– 121 However, this has not been 
reproduced in other studies.122,123 [Evidence level 2+]
The rates of anti- sperm antibodies have not been consis -
tently shown to be increased in women and men with re -
current miscarriage, with some studies showing a higher 
incidence,124 while others have not.125 [Evidence level 2+]
The data are more consistent with regard to the association 
between abnormal sperm DNA parameters such as sperm 
DNA fragmentation, nuclear chromatin decondensation, 
and sperm aneuploidy and miscarriage. A meta- analysis in 
couples undergoing assisted reproduction treatment showed 
a significant increase in miscarriage where high sperm DNA 
damage was identified compared with those with low DNA 
damage (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.54– 3.03, P < 0.00001).126 This was 
confirmed in a meta- analysis 2 years later.127 This associa -
tion has also been shown for the recurrent miscarriage pop -
ulation.128– 131 [Evidence level 2++]
To date, however, limited studies are available evaluating 
interventions that may affect sperm DNA fragmentation 
such as lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, weight 
loss/exercise, reduction in pollutant exposure), treatment of 
infections, control of diabetes, treatment of varicocele, anti -
oxidant therapy, sperm selection and others.132

Women with 
recurrent 
miscarriage should 
be offered testing 
for acquired 
thrombophilia, 
particularly for 
lupus anticoagulant 
and anticardiolipin 
antibodies, prior to 
pregnancy.2++ C Given the 
association 
with recurrent 
miscarriage and 
the evidence of 
potential benefit 
from treatment.
To diagnose APS it is recommended that the woman 
should have two positive tests at least 12 weeks apart (and at least 6 weeks post miscarriage) for either lupus antico -
agulant or aCL antibodies of IgG and/or IgM class present 
in medium or high titre (i.e. more than 40 GPL or MPL, or 
more than 99th percentile). For anti- beta- 2- glycoprotein- I 
antibody, for which the evidence is less conclusive, IgG and/
or IgM class in high titre (i.e. more than 99th percentile) can 
be used, within the appropriate audit or research context.38 
[Evidence level 2++]
In detection of lupus anticoagulant, the dilute Russell's 
viper venom time (dRVVT) test together with a plate -
let neutralisation procedure is more sensitive and spe -
cific than either the activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) or the kaolin clotting time (KCT) tests.133 
[Evidence level 2++]
Anticardiolipin antibodies are detected using a stan -
dardised enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 
detection of aPL is subject to considerable inter- laboratory 
variation.134 This is because of temporal fluctuation of aPL 
titres in individuals, transient positivity secondary to infec -
tions, suboptimal sample collection and preparation, and 
lack of standardisation of laboratory tests for their detection.

Prior to testing for thrombophilia, women and people 
should be counselled regarding the implications for them -

The results should be interpreted by clinicians with specific

6.2 | Genetic
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
Cytogenetic analysis 
should be offered 
on pregnancy 
tissue of the third 
and subsequent 
miscarriage(s) and in 
any second trimester 
miscarriage.2– D This confers 
significant 
diagnostic, 
psychological and 
auditing/research 
advantages.
In recurrent 
miscarriage, 
parental peripheral 
blood karyotyping 
should be performed 
for couples in whom 
testing of pregnancy 
tissue reports 
an unbalanced 
structural 
chromosomal 
abnormality. 
The finding of 
a subsequent 
abnormal parental 
karyotype should 
prompt referral to a 
clinical geneticist.3 D Retrospective 
studies have 
shown that 
blanket testing 
for parental 
karyotyping 
reveals an 
abnormality in 
less than 2%, 
while genetic 
analysis of 
pregnancy tissue 
may point towards 
the diagnosis.
When cytogenetic 
analysis is indicated 
but testing of the 
pregnancy tissue is 
unsuccessful or there 
is no pregnancy 
tissue available for 
testing, parental 
karyotyping should 
be offered.4 GPP With a view 
to achieve a 
diagnosis even 
in the absence of 
pregnancy tissue 
analysis.
Other than the prognostic advantages, when used in 
combination with routine investigations into recurrent mis -
carriage, cytogenetic analysis of the pregnancy tissue have 
shown to provide a diagnosis in over 90% of couples.137 This 
increase in diagnoses could potentially lead to a number of 
advantages, such as:
• Identifying those with balanced chromosome rearrange -
ments, who may benefit from genetic counselling and po -
tential targeted therapies. [Evidence level 2– ]
• Providing an answer. Not having a diagnosis has been 
associated with feelings of uncertainty, frustration and isolation in other fields of medicine.138 Such adverse emo -
tions may also be present in those who experience recur -
rent miscarriage. [Evidence level 2– ]
• Reducing the chance of women and people pursuing non- 
evidenced based therapies (in cases where no diagnosis 
has been reached). [Evidence level 4]
• Allowing better stratification, selection and control of 
confounding variables for prospective research trials. 
[Evidence level 4]
• Providing further insight into the causes of miscarriage 
through assessing pregnancy tissue with advanced molec -
ular studies. [Evidence level 4]
Techniques for analysis of pregnancy tissue
Several different techniques may apply to assess for genetic 
anomalies of the pregnancy, namely: conventional karyotyp -
ing via tissue culture, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), 
array comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH), single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and next generation se -
quencing (NGS). These are described in Appendix 3. [Evidence 
level 4]
A retrospective audit of four UK centres over periods of 
5– 30 years, reported that balanced translocations were found 
in 1.9% (406 out of 20 432) of parents with recurrent mis-
carriage, but only four unbalanced translocations were found 
after referral for prenatal diagnosis because of balanced pa-
rental translocation ascertained for recurrent miscarriage.50 
[Evidence level 3]
Although screening women (and their male partners if 
applicable) for parental chromosome rearrangements does 
not appear to be cost- effective,50 peripheral blood karyo -
typing of both parents should be offered in cases where 
the pregnancy tissue report an unbalanced structural 
chromosomal abnormality. In the case where an abnor -
mal parental karyotype is identified, genetic counselling 
offers the couple a prognosis for the risk of future preg -
nancies with an unbalanced chromosome complement 
and the opportunity for familial chromosome studies. 
[Evidence level 4]
Parental karyotyping may be offered when testing of the 
pregnancy tissue is unsuccessful or when there is no preg -
nancy tissue available for testing.

GREEN- TOP GUIDELINE NO. 17
An RCOG Scientific Impact Paper has been published 
on Reproductive implications and management of congenital 
uterine anomalies .139 The key findings and recommenda -
tions are summarised below.
Diagnosis
A systematic review and international consensus has re-
ported that the most accurate methodologies for diagnos-
ing congenital uterine anomalies in descending order of 
overall accuracy are: 3D ultrasound (97.6%, 95% CI 94.3– 
100), saline- infusion ultrasound (96.5%, 95% CI 93.4– 
99.5), hysterosalpingography (86.9%, 95% CI 79.8– 94.0) 
and 2D ultrasound (86.6%, 95% CI 81.3– 91.8).140 There 
were no studies reporting on the use of magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) as a screening tool, however comparative 
studies have shown MRI to be at least similar in accuracy 
compared with 3D ultrasound when expert examiners are 
used (i.e. a radiologist with an interest/expertise in gynae-
cological imaging).141 [Evidence level 2++]
Based on these findings, acceptability and relative low cost, 
3D ultrasound is recommended as the first line for the diag-
nosis of congenital anomalies, reserving MRI and endoscopic 
evaluation for complex anomalies when a diagnosis cannot be 
reached with 3D ultrasound.140 [Evidence level 2++]
Classifications
Several classifications have been published in order to 
diagnose and categorise these anomalies, including the 
American Fertility Society (now ASRM) classification 
(1988),142 the Vagina Cervix Uterus Adnexa and Associated 
Malformation (VCUAM) classification,143 the embryolog -
ical classification of Acien and Acien (2011),144 the ESHRE 
and the ESGE classification (2013),64 and most recently the 
ASRM classification (2021).66 [Evidence level 2++]
Controversy regarding the septate uterus
The different classifications have been a point of contention 
in the literature, particularly with regards to the diagnosis of 
the septate uterus, the anomaly most amenable to surgical 
treatment. As a result, different criteria have been made for 
the diagnosis of the septate uterus, including a percentage 
of fundal cavity indentation of more than 50%,145 a depth 
of fundal cavity indentation of more than 15 mm with an 
indentation angle of less than 90° (ASRM definition of 
2016),146 a depth of fundal cavity indentation of more than 
10 mm (CUME classification),65 and most recently a depth 
of fundal cavity indentation of more than 10 mm with a 
septum angle of less than 90o (ASRM 2021 classification).66 
[Evidence level 2+]
When comparing different criteria for the diagnosis of 
the septate uterus it is clear that the incidence changes ac-
cording to criteria used,147 with the highest incidences in de -
scending order being from the ESHRE– ESGE to the CUME 
and ASRM classifications.65 Although there are concerns of 
potential over- diagnosis and treatment of septate uteri by 
using the ESHRE– ESGE classification, there are still a lack of prospective data to determine the use of which classification 
would lead to the most favourable reproductive outcomes (i.e. 
increase in live birth rate). Therefore, which criteria should be 
used for the diagnosis of a septate uterus remains a matter of 
ongoing debate. [Evidence level 2++]
There is less of a debate regarding the diagnosis of other 
anomalies, which are more pronounced and for which there is 
a less variability between different classifications.
Although there is a lack of studies demonstrating a clear link 
between acquired uterine anomalies and recurrent miscarriage, 
these can be opportunistically diagnosed during the assessment 
for congenital uterine anomalies and treated accordingly on an 
individual basis (e.g. if there is associated symptomatology). 
The inclusion of saline infusion with the 3D ultrasound assess-
ment may be particularly useful for the diagnosis of intrauterine 
adhesions if these are suspected based on the clinical history 
(e.g. prior surgical management of miscarriage with subsequent 
oligomenorrhoea).148 [Evidence level 4]

be offered thyroid 
function tests and

tween TPO antibodies, thyroid dysfunction and recurrent 
miscarriage.87,88 [Evidence level 1– ]
Although the presence of TPO antibodies in euthyroid 
women may not warrant treatment, knowing the antibody sta-
tus allows for the stratification of women and people who will 
require thyroid function monitoring during pregnancy.149 It is 
interesting to note that for women with previous miscarriages, 
the American Thyroid Association has given different recom -
mendations for treatment according to the TSH levels and 
presence or not of autoimmunity,150,151 while RCOG Scientific 
Impact Paper No. 70 on Subclinical hypothyroidism and anti-
thyroid autoantibodies in women with subfertility or recurrent 
pregnancy loss has not.149 The RCOG Scientific Impact Paper 
has also noted that performing routine preconception TPO 
antibody testing (alongside thyroid function tests) for women 
with recurrent miscarriage versus regular thyroid function 
tests starting in early pregnancy, are both acceptable strategies 
until clinical and cost- effectiveness analyses are available.149 
[Evidence level 2++]
Other endocrine assessments are not routinely indicated 
unless there is a clinical suspicion of pathology e.g. diabetes 
and hyperprolactinaemia.

Aspirin and heparin 
(unfractionated

offered to women 
with APS (e.g. 75 mg 
aspirin orally and 
40 mg subcutaneously 
enoxaparin from a 
positive pregnancy test 
until at least 34 weeks 
of gestation). Clinicians 
and women should be 
aware that treatment 
with heparin, 
particularly UFH, is 
not without some risk.1+ B Meta- 
analyses have 
demonstrated 
that treatment 
of APS with 
aspirin and 
heparin confers 
a significant 
benefit.
Aspirin and/or 
heparin should not be 
given to women with 
unexplained recurrent 
miscarriage1+ B Meta- analyses 
have shown it 
does not improve 
outcomes and 
may be associated 
with adverse 
effects.
A high quality meta- analysis of RCTs assessed pregnancy 
outcomes for women with recurrent miscarriage and APS who 
were treated with aspirin, steroids, intravenous globulin and hep -
arin. It showed that the only treatment or treatment combination 
that lead to a significant increase in the live birth rate was aspirin 
with unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusion.163 This treatment 
combination significantly reduced the miscarriage rate by 54% 
(aspirin plus UFH versus aspirin alone RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29– 
0.71). Two further meta- analyses showed similar reduction in 
recurrent miscarriage for the aspirin and UFH group (OR 0.26, 
95% CI 0.14– 0.48).164 The meta- analysis did not show a signifi -
cant reduction in miscarriage rates in aspirin plus low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) group, but commented that further in -
vestigation is required. A 2015 Bayesian network meta- analysis 
also confirmed the above findings.165 [Evidence level 1+]
Two prospective studies and one RCT, however, reported no 
difference in efficacy and safety between UFH or LMWH when 
combined with aspirin in the treatment of women with recurrent 
miscarriage associated with aPL.166,167 In addition, a 2020 meta- 
analysis reported improvements in live birth with both UFH and 
LMWH in combination with aspirin.168 [Evidence level 1+]
There are no adverse fetal outcomes reported in the meta- 
analysis of RCTs of low dose aspirin for the prevention of 
pre- eclampsia in pregnancy.169 Heparin does not cross the 
placenta and hence there is no potential to cause fetal haem -
orrhage or teratogenicity.170 UFH can, however, be associated 
with maternal complications including bleeding, hypersen -
sitivity reactions, and heparin- induced thrombocytopenia 
and when used long term, osteopenia and vertebral fractures. 
Two prospective studies have shown, however, that the loss in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine associated with 
low- dose long- term heparin therapy is similar to that which 
occurs normally during pregnancy.171,172 [Evidence level 1+]
LMWH is as safe as UFH with potential advantages 
during pregnancy, since they cause less heparin- induced 
thrombocytopenia, can be administered once daily, and are 
associated with a lower risk of heparin- induced osteoporo -
sis.173 [Evidence level 1+]
Pregnancies associated with APS treated with aspirin and 
heparin remain at high risk of complications during all three 
trimesters.174,175 [Evidence level 1+]
It should be noted that a meta- analysis has shown that 
aspirin and/or LMWH does not increase the live birth rate 
in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, may be 
associated with adverse effects and should therefore not be 
used.176 [Evidence level 1+]

There is a lack of 
evidence to support 
routine treatment for 
women with Factor 
V Leiden, protein

thrombophilia, 
however the 
subgroups were 
underpowered for

A decision to treat 
women with recurrent 
miscarriage or second

individualised and should 
involve a discussion

into consideration 
additional risk factors, 
such as maternal risk of

to compare the thrombophilia versus no thrombophilia 
groups, they concluded that because of the lack of data, such 
an analysis was not possible. This means that the group of 
women with thrombophilias would have been underpow -
ered in these analyses. [Evidence level 2– ]
One prospective randomised trial demonstrated the effi -
cacy of LMWH for the treatment of women with a history of 
a single late miscarriage after 10 weeks of gestation who have 
the Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation or have 
protein S deficiency. The live birth rate in women treated 
with enoxaparin was 86% compared with 29% in women tak -
ing low dose aspirin alone (OR 15.5, 95% CI 7– 34).178 In a later 
RCT, subgroup analysis of women with recurrent miscar -
riage with and without thrombophilia did not demonstrate 
a significant difference in live birth rate when comparing 
enoxaparin alone, enoxaparin/aspirin combined, and aspirin 
alone.179 [Evidence level 2– ]
Owing to the lack of data, thromboprophylaxis could be 
considered for women with Factor V Leiden, protein S de -
ficiency and prothrombin G20210GA mutation, when there 
are risk factors for thrombosis (as per Green- top Guideline 
No. 37a Reducing the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism

Options for couples 
with chromosomal 
rearrangements 
include attempting 
a further natural 
conception, PGT- SR 
or gamete donation.2– C Live birth rates are 
similar following 
natural conception 
and PGD, and 
therefore PGD 
should not be 
routinely offered 
in this situation.
There are currently 
insufficient data 
to support the 
routine use of 
PGT- A for couples 
with unexplained 
recurrent miscarriage, 
while the treatment 
may carry a 
significant cost and 
potential risk.2– C Observational 
studies have not 
demonstrated 
improved 
outcomes to date, 
both in terms of 
live birth rate and 
time to pregnancy 
interval. RCTs are 
urgently required.
Reproductive options in couples with chromosomal re-
arrangements includes proceeding to a further natural preg-
nancy, undergoing assisted reproductive treatment with preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrange-
ments (PGT- SR), formerly known as pre- implantation ge-
netic diagnosis (PGD), or gamete donation.
Assisted reproduction (IVF/ICSI) combined with 
PGT- SR is gaining increased interest, with the aims of 
selecting embryos not affected by parental chromosomal 
rearrangement and proceeding with embryo transfer. A 
case– control trial involving 89 couples who underwent ge -
netic counselling (of which 52 elected to attempt natural 
conception and 37 chose to undergo IVF/ICSI and PGD) 
demonstrated similar cumulative live birth rates (67.6% 
and 65.4%, respectively) between the two groups. The time 
to pregnancy was similar in both groups, however they re -
ported a reduction in miscarriage rates with PGD and of 
course a significant financial burden of US$7956 per pa -
tient.182 [Evidence level 2– ]
A systematic review of non- RCTs reported similar live 
birth rates, time to conception rates and even miscarriage 
rates between natural conception and PGT- SR groups.183 
[Evidence level 2– ]
Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT- 
A), formerly known as preimplantation genetic screening 
(PGS), in conjunction with IVF/ICSI has also been ad-
vocated as a treatment option for women with recurrent 
unexplained miscarriage. Similar to the case of PGT- SR 
for parental chromosomal rearrangements, the rationale 
is that the identification and transfer of what are thought 
to be genetically normal embryos will lead to an increased 
likelihood of live birth.
A systematic review of non- RCTs found the live birth 
rates to be similar between expectant management groups 
and PGT- A groups, with a trend for lower miscarriage rates 
in the latter. However, it is worth noting that all studies per -
formed embryo biopsy on day 3 of development.184 [Evidence 
level 2– ]
An intention to treat retrospective analysis involving 
112 couples choosing PGT- A and 188 couples choosing 
expectant management found the pregnancy rate, miscar -
riage rate and live birth rate to be similar between the two 
groups. The median time to pregnancy was 6.5 months in 
the PGT- A group and 3.0 months in the expectant man -
agement group. Although the study is limited by its retro -
spective non- randomised nature, the embryo biopsies were 
performed on day 5 of development, which better reflects 
routine practice today.185 [Evidence level 2– ]
Overall, at present, couples should be informed of the 
risk and significant cost of undergoing PGT- SR and PGT- 
A, as well as the lack of evidence regarding any improve -
ment in reproductive outcomes; for the latest updates

Resection of a 
uterine septum 
should be 
considered for 
women with 
recurrent first or 
second trimester 
miscarriage, 
ideally within 
an appropriate 
audit or research 
context.2+ C While there is 
a lack of RCTs

with recurrent 
miscarriage, 
meta- analyses

studies have 
indicated that this 
treatment confers a 
significant benefit.
There are no published RCTs assessing the effectiveness 
and possible complications of hysteroscopic septum resec -
tion dedicated to women and people with recurrent miscar -
riage. There is, however, one RCT examining the effect of 
septum resection in women with a history of subfertility, 
pregnancy loss or preterm birth. It is worth noting that the 
initial ethical approval only included women with recurrent 
pregnancy loss (defined in the study as two or more mis -
carriages) but during the course of the trial, the eligibility 
criteria were extended to include women with a history of 
subfertility, one pregnancy loss or preterm birth. The trial 
found that hysteroscopic septum resection did not im -
prove the reproductive outcomes of women with a septate 
uterus.186
Although this is the first RCT of its kind in the world, 
which deserves significant praise, a number of limitations 
have been highlighted. These include the broad inclusion 
criteria and the low number of subjects recruited (n = 80), 
despite the long duration of the trial (almost 8 years) and 
multiple participating sites (10 centres).187 This may reflect 
the difficulty in recruiting patients to such a trial, as the only 
other RCT attempting to address this topic was stopped pre -
maturely because of poor recruitment after recruiting only 
six patients (ISRCTN2896).188
When looking at systematic reviews and meta- analyses of 
observational studies, the latest publication in 2023, includ -
ing 27 studies and 1506 patients, showed that hysteroscopic 
septum resection was associated with an increased live birth 
rate (RR 1.77, 95% Cl 1.26– 2.49), reduced miscarriage rate 
(RR 0.36, 95% Cl 0.20– 0.66) and reduced preterm birth rate 
(RR 0.15, 95% Cl 0.04– 0.53).189 [Evidence level 2+]
It is clear that further prospective RCTs are required to 
clarify the role of hysteroscopic resection in women with re -
current miscarriage. This is complicated not only by the po -
tentially difficulty of recruiting patients, but also by the fact 
that the degree of fundal indentation that actually consti -
tutes a septum remains to be determined. Therefore, for the 
time being, centres performing uterine septum resections are encouraged to do so within an appropriate audit or research 
context.

Recommendation Evidence

recommendation
There is a lack of

There is limited evidence regarding both the association 
and treatment of acquired uterine anomalies in women and 
people with recurrent miscarriage. Data from one retrospec -
tive analysis in a recurrent miscarriage population with no 
control group suggests a potential benefit from the resection 
of submucosal myomas.70 [Evidence level 3]
However, extrapolated data from the Cochrane review 
of women undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy prior to 
assisted reproduction did not find a significant reduction 
in miscarriage rates compared with expectant management 
(OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.47– 5.00; P = 0.47, 94 women; very low-

Progestogen 
supplementation 
should be considered in 
women with recurrent 
miscarriage who present 
with bleeding in early 
pregnancy (for example 
400 mg micronised 
vaginal progesterone 
twice daily at the time of 
bleeding until 16 weeks 
of gestation).1– B The PRISM trial 
reported no significant 
differences in live 
births in women 
presenting with 
bleeding in early 
pregnancy and 
receiving progesterone 
supplementation; 
however, in the 
subgroup analysis 
of women with 
recurrent miscarriage, 
a significant 
improvement in 
live birth rate was 
observed.
Routine 
supplementation should 
be used with caution in 
asymptomatic women 
with unexplained 
recurrent miscarriage.1– B Meta- analyses 
have reported a 
possible benefit 
from progestogen 
supplementation. 
However, there is a 
lack of consistently 
demonstrable benefit 
when used routinely 
in women with 
unexplained recurrent 
miscarriage, and there 
remains uncertainty 
about the optimal 
specific drug, route, 
timing and dose. The 
PROMISE trial, the 
largest multicentre 
RCT to date, which was 
adequately powered 
and with a very low risk 
of bias, showed that 
routine progesterone 
supplementation 
did not improve the 
outcome.
The TABLET study, which was a double- blind, 
placebo- controlled trial comparing live birth rates among 
euthyroid women with TPO antibodies and a history of 
miscarriage, treated with levothyroxine versus placebo, 
found no difference between the two groups, including 
subgroup analysis of women with recurrent miscarriage. 
However, there were insufficient data to perform a sub -
group analysis of women with recurrent miscarriage, 
TPO antibodies and SCH.192 However, the T4- LIFE study will hopefully shed some light on this exact question.193 
[Evidence level 1– ]
In the context of SCH, for women at high risk (including 
women with previous miscarriages), the American Thyroid 
Association give a strong recommendation for thyroxine 
use with a TSH more than 4 mIU/l and autoimmunity, a 
weak recommendation for thyroxine with a TSH more than 
2.5 mIU/l and autoimmunity and a weak recommendation 
for thyroxine in cases of TSH more than 4 mIU/l without 
autoimmunity.150,151 This is consistent with findings of a 
meta- analysis.76 [Evidence level 2++]
However, in terms of studies in the recurrent miscar -
riage population, the cohort study of Bernardi et al. (2013) 
in women with two or more miscarriages, found no statis -
tically significant difference in the subsequent live birth 
rate when comparing women with SCH versus euthyroid 
women, or treated and untreated women with SCH.85 
Another observational trial has shown miscarriage rates 
to be similar in hypothyroid women receiving thyroxine 
and euthyroid women with TPO antibodies receiving thy -
roxine.194 [Evidence level 2– ]
On assessing the data available to date, RCOG 
Scientific Impact Paper No. 70 Subclinical hypothyroid-
ism and antithyroid autoantibodies in women with subfer -
tility or recurrent pregnancy loss concluded that there is 
low quality evidence for treatment of women with mod -
erate SCH (TSH more than 4.0 mIU/l), but insufficient 
evidence to support treatment in mild SCH (TSH more 
than 2.5 mIU/l). They also recommended TSH measure -
ment at 7– 9 weeks of gestation and subsequent regular 
thyroid functions tests until 34 weeks of gestation. In 
cases of TPO euthyroid antibody status, they advise TSH 
measurement at 7– 9 weeks of gestation and in each sub -
sequent trimester because of the risk of progression to 
hypothyroidism.149
It should be mentioned that occult endocrinological 
anomalies (clinical hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, diabe -
tes, hyperprolactinaemia) should be treated in women with 
recurrent miscarriage as they would be treated preconcep -
tionally for any woman or person. [Evidence level 4]
A systematic review and meta- analysis of ten RCTs of 
women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage receiving 
progesterone versus placebo or no treatment showed a lower 
risk of miscarriage (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53– 0.97) and higher 
live birth rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02– 1.15) respectively. No 
statistically significant differences were found in the other

GREEN- TOP GUIDELINE NO. 17
a significantly more pronounced effect in women with three 
or more versus two or more prior miscarriages.196 However, 
this analysis was updated the following year after the 2017 
RCT by Ismail et al. became the subject of an investigation by 
the Journal of Maternal- Fetal & Neonatal Medicine and was 
eventually retracted because of concerns raised regarding 
the accuracy and reliability of the study data.197 The updated 
meta- analysis concluded that there may still be a reduction 
in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen 
supplementation compared with placebo/controls (RR 0.73, 
95% CI 0.54– 1.00, ten trials, 1684 women, moderate- quality 
evidence), while it is worth noting that on this occasion the 
95% CI approached 1.00. A subgroup analysis on this occa -
sion did not show significant differences between women 
with three or more versus two or more prior miscarriages.198 
[Evidence level 1+]
Caution should be exercised when interpreting the re -
sults of these meta- analyses due to differences in the RCTs 
included in the analyses.199,200 For example, in the trial by 
Kumar et al. women were recruited at a mean gestational 
age of approximately 6.5 weeks and randomised after the 
confirmation of a live pregnancy with fetal heart activity to 
receive either oral dydrogesterone or placebo. Consequently, 
in their healthy control group a miscarriage rate of only 3.5% 
was observed, reflecting a potential selection bias.200 In the 
PROMISE trial, 400 mg micronised vaginal progesterone 
twice daily was commenced as soon as there was a positive 
pregnancy test until 12 weeks of gestation.201 Significant dif -
ferences were observed in the former trial but not in the lat -
ter trial. [Evidence level 1+]
An RCT focusing on women with threatened miscar -
riage, the PRISM trial, compared the use of 400 mg mi -
cronised vaginal progesterone twice daily versus placebo 
at the time of bleeding until 16 weeks of gestation. The 
authors reported no significant differences in live births 
at more than 34 weeks (relative rate, 1.03, 95% CI 1.00– 
1.07; P = 0.08). However, on subgroup analysis of women 
with recurrent miscarriage, a significant improvement in 
live birth rate was observed (71.5% versus 57.4%; relative 
rate, 1.28, 95% CI 1.08– 1.51; P = 0.007).202 [Evidence level 
1– ]
A review and critical evaluation of the PROMISE and 
PRISM trials concluded that women with a history of mis -
carriage who present with bleeding in early pregnancy may 
benefit from the use of progesterone.19 [Evidence level 1– ]
However, it is not yet clear which formulations, routes 
and timings of administration of progesterone may con -
fer the most positive outcomes, and whether these fac -
tors may have an effect on the outcome of asymptomatic 
women and people with unexplained recurrent miscar -
riage. Future trials should aim to address these questions 
and control for aneuploid pregnancy losses were possible, 
as these miscarriages cannot be avoided with progesterone 
supplementation.7.6 | Immune factors
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
Immunotherapy 
(e.g. paternal cell 
immunisation, 
third- party 
donor leucocytes, 
trophoblast 
membranes and 
intravenous 
immunoglobulin 
[IVIg]) is not 
recommended for 
women with recurrent 
miscarriage.1++ B Meta- analyses 
have shown 
no significant 
benefit of 
treatment.
A Cochrane systematic review and meta- analysis has 
shown that the use of various forms of immunotherapy, in -
cluding paternal cell immunisation, third- party donor leu -
cocytes, trophoblast membranes and IVIg, in women with 
unexplained recurrent miscarriage provides no significant 
beneficial effect over placebo in preventing further miscar -
riage.203 Moreover, immunotherapy is expensive and has 
potentially serious adverse effects including transfusion 
reaction, anaphylactic shock and hepatitis. The use of im -
munotherapy should no longer be offered to women with 
unexplained recurrent miscarriage. [Evidence level 1++]
There are no published data on the use of anti- tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) agents to improve pregnancy outcome in 
women with recurrent miscarriage. Further, anti- TNF agents 
could potentially cause serious morbidity including lym -
phoma, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis, demyelin -
ating disease, congestive heart failure and syndromes similar to 
systemic lupus erythematosus.204
Immune treatments should not be offered routinely to 
women with recurrent miscarriage outside formal research 
studies.
7.7 | Male factors
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
There is no 
evidence to 
recommend 
treatments for 
male factors.3 D There is a 
lack of studies 
examining relevant 
interventions.
To date, there is a paucity of studies available evaluat -
ing interventions that may improve the outcome of couples 
with recurrent miscarriage, in particular through reduc -
ing sperm DNA fragmentation, which has been implicated

in miscarriage. Such interventions could include lifestyle 
modifications (i.e. smoking cessation, weight loss/exercise, 
reduction in pollutant exposure), treatment of infections, 
control of diabetes, treatment of varicocele, antioxidant 
therapy, sperm selection and others.132 [Evidence level 3]
7.8 | Unexplained recurrent miscarriage
7.8.1 | Endometrial scratch
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
Endometrial 
scratch is not 
recommended 
in women 
with recurrent 
miscarriage.2++ C There are no studies 
available for women 
with recurrent 
miscarriage but no 
benefit in miscarriage 
reduction has been 
shown within the 
infertility context.
Endometrial scratch or injury has been researched exten -
sively in the context of IVF/ICSI with a suggestion that it may 
improve the clinical pregnancy rates, although to date RCTs 
and meta- analyses in this patient group have failed to show a 
reduction in miscarriage rates.205,206 [Evidence level 2++]
A Cochrane review assessing women undergoing endome -
trial scratch/injury prior to intrauterine insemination or sexual 
intercourse found no evidence of a difference in miscarriage 
rate per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38– 1.39; six 
RCTs, 174 participants; I2 statistic = 0%;).207 [Evidence level 2++]
There is no evidence regarding women with recurrent 
miscarriage and therefore by extrapolation of the data above 
endometrial scratch should not be recommended for women 
and people with unexplained recurrent miscarriage.
7.8.2 | Psychological support
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
Women with 
unexplained 
recurrent 
miscarriage should 
be offered supportive 
care, ideally in 
the setting of a 
dedicated recurrent 
miscarriage clinic.2+ C Several 
observational 
studies have 
suggested a 
beneficial effect 
in pregnancy 
outcomes.
A significant proportion of cases of recurrent miscarriage 
remain unexplained, despite detailed investigation. These 
women and their partners can be reassured that the prognosis 
for a successful future pregnancy with supportive care alone is 
in the region of 75%.20,21 However, the prognosis worsens with increasing maternal age and the number of previous miscar -
riages. The value of psychological support in improving preg -
nancy outcome has not been tested in the form of an RCT. 
However, data from several non- randomised studies have sug -
gested that attendance at a dedicated early pregnancy clinic has a 
beneficial effect,20,21,208,209 although it has been recognised that 
a significant proportion of women with unexplained recurrent 
miscarriage may be healthy women with repeated sporadic mis -
carriages and no persisting pathology.2,7 [Evidence level 2+]
Further research is required to develop appropriate 
screening and management approaches for women and 
couples with mental health illness, as an association of mis -
carriage with anxiety, depression, post- traumatic stress dis -
order, and suicide has been shown.11
8 | MANAGEMENT OF 
SUBSEQUENT MISCARRIAGES
Recommendation Evidence 
qualityStrength Rationale for the 
recommendation
Provisions should 
be made for women 
and people to 
receive appropriate 
supportive care 
in terms of 
communication 
with healthcare 
professionals, 
ultrasound 
examinations and 
access to services in 
case of subsequent 
miscarriage(s).3 D It will enable 
appropriate 
psychological 
support, prompt 
diagnosis and 
may facilitate the 
investigation of 
the miscarriage, 
which may help 
with counselling 
and future 
management.
A proportion of women will experience further miscar -
riage(s) following referral. Provisions should be made to 
allow them to contact or access services,210 particularly if 
there have been plans in place regarding the management of 
possible future miscarriage, such as collection of pregnancy 
tissue for cytogenetic analyses. This can be organised for 
spontaneously miscarried pregnancies or those undergoing 
manual vacuum aspiration or surgical management of mis -
carriage. [Evidence level 4]
A questionnaire study in women with recurrent miscar -
riage reported that women preferred the following support -
ive care options for their next pregnancy:
• A plan with one doctor who shows understanding, takes 
them seriously, has knowledge of their obstetric history, 
listens to them, gives information about recurrent miscar -
riage, shows empathy, informs on progress and enquires 
about emotional needs.
• An ultrasound examination during symptoms, directly 
after a positive pregnancy test and every 2 weeks.
• If a miscarriage occurred, most women would prefer to 
talk to a medical or psychological professional afterwards.

• The majority of women expressed a low preference for ad -
mission to a hospital ward at the same gestational age as 
previous miscarriages and a low preference for bereave -
ment therapy.
Ethnicity, parity and pregnancy at the time of the survey 
were associated with different preferences, but female age, 
education level and time passed since the last miscarriage 
were not.211

RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE
APPENDIX 1
Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements 
which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about 
appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline 
is systematically developed using a standardised method -
ology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical 
Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG Green- top 
Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green - top- devel opment ). These recommendations are 
not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management 
or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to indi -
vidual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the 
institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that 
this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these 
guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of 
clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the 
scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a 
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classification of evidence levels
1++ High- quality meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a very low risk of bias
1+ Well- conducted meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a low risk of bias
1– Meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a high risk of bias
2++ High- quality systematic reviews of case– control or cohort studies or high- quality case– control or cohort studies with a very low 
risk of confounding, bias or chance and a high probability that the relationship is causal
2+ Well- conducted case– control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or chance and a moderate probability that the 
relationship is causal
2– Case– control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding, bias or chance and a significant risk that the relationship is not 
causal
3 Non- analytical studies, e.g. case reports, case series
4 Expert opinion
Grades of Recommendation
A At least one meta- analysis, systematic reviews or RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target population; or a systematic 
review of RCTs or a body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the target population and 
demonstrating overall consistency of results
B A body of evidence including studies rated as 2++ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall 
consistency of results; or Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++ or 1+
C A body of evidence including studies rated as 2+ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall 
consistency of results; or Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++
D Evidence level 3 or 4; or Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+

GREEN- TOP GUIDELINE NO. 17
APPENDIX 3
Techniques for genetic analysis of pregnancy tissue
CONVENTIONAL KARYOTYPING
Conventional karyotyping is limited by culture failure, with 
pooled rates of approximately 20% (756/3859) and maternal 
cell contamination rates of approximately 22% (269/1222) 
according to one study.53,212
Recommendations to avoid these issues have included: i) 
to obtain and dispatch to the cytogenetic lab the pregnancy 
tissue as soon possible following the diagnosis of a miscar -
riage (to avoid culture failure); ii) to gently wash the tissue 
with normal saline (to reduce maternal blood contamina -
tion); and iii) to store the remaining part of the specimen 
at – 80°C if traditional karyotyping is performed (to allow 
for the option of fluorescence in situ hybridisation [FISH] 
or molecular genetic testing in the case of culture failure).53
FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDISATION (FISH)
FISH uses fluorescent probes that bind to specific parts of a 
chromosome and is therefore limited to the specific probes 
utilised (e.g. 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y).213 Using this tech -
nique, up to 97% of culture failures have been shown to yield 
results,214 with chromosomal anomalies eventually detected 
in up to 53% of them.215
ARRAY COMPARATIVE GENOMIC 
HYBRIDIZATION (CGH)
Array CGH is a form of chromosomal microarray analysis 
based on the use of differentially labelled test and reference genomic DNA samples that are simultaneously hybridised 
to DNA targets arrayed on a glass slide or other solid plat -
form.216 It avoids the limitations of conventional karyotyping 
and FISH, such as culture failure and limited chromosome 
examination, and essentially scans the entire genome pro -
viding additional information such as DNA copy number 
variants. In the standard clinical setting most recent studies 
report virtually no failure rate in diagnosis.217
SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM (SNP)
SNP array is a form of chromosomal microarray analysis 
similar to array CGH. It can additionally detect the parental 
source of chromosomes and anomalies and can therefore be 
used to rule out maternal cell contamination.212
NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS)
NGS achieves single nucleotide resolution through a high- 
throughput platform. Its advantage is that it can scrutinise 
the entire genome through a tiny quantity of tissue. Its dis -
advantage is that it is currently expensive and requires data 
processing steps and bioinformatics because of its large data 
output.53

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 
produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clini -
cal practice. They present recognised methods and tech -
niques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, 
for consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and 
other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judge -
ment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treat -
ment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant 
in the light of clinical data presented by the patient and 
the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or 
guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to 
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of man-
agement. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols 
or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's 
case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
