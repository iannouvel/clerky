Management of Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL)

Key Principles:
- Guidelines are not prescriptive and should be used in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues.
- Guidelines are based on national/RCOG guidelines and have been reviewed by all clinicians involved in early pregnancy care.
- Nurses, Midwives, Gynaecologists, and Obstetricians have responsibilities to follow and apply the guidance.
- Management Team is responsible for reviewing the protocol as required and ensuring accessibility to relevant staff and service users.

Introduction:
- PUL is a term used when a woman has a positive pregnancy test but no pregnancy is seen on ultrasound.
- Management aims to find the location of the pregnancy and ensure resolution without complications.

Principles of Management:
- Consider ectopic pregnancy until location is determined.
- Conduct specific tests based on progesterone and hCG levels.
- Manage conservatively based on symptoms and hCG trends.
- Provide written information on emergency care for all PUL women.

Further Management:
- Individualized based on clinical signs and symptoms, may include additional scans or laparoscopy.
- Do not treat PUL with methotrexate.

All PUL Women:
- Advise to seek emergency care for severe pain or feeling unwell.
- Explain suspected diagnosis and avoid travel to areas without immediate medical care.
