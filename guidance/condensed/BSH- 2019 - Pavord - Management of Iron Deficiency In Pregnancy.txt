Iron deﬁciency remains a signiﬁcant problem for pregnant
women in the UK. The objective of these guidelines is to
provide healthcare professionals with recommendations for
the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of iron deﬁciency in
pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The guidelines
update and replace the previous ones (Pavord et al , 2012).
The prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy remains high. In
order to minimise adverse outcomes, including use of blood
transfusion, further research is required to deﬁne optimal
management, as many current recommendations are not
supported by high quality evidence.
Methods
This guideline was compiled according to the British Society
for Haematology (BSH) process at b-s-h.org.uk. GRADE cri-
teria were used to quote levels of recommendation and
grades of evidence (https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org).
Searches were performed using the online search engine
Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID) and CENTRAL (The
Cochrane Library). Search terms were: (“pregnancy” OR
“postpartum”) AND; “anaemia” AND “transfusion”; “anae-
mia” AND “iron”; “ferritin”; “intravenous iron”; “prevention
of iron deﬁciency”; “hepcidin; “transfusion AND red cells”;
“iron deﬁciency”; “iron deﬁcient”; “iron depletion”; “positive
predictive value”; “positive predictive value” AND (“true
positive” OR “true negative”); “negative predictive value”;
“negative predictive value” AND (“false positive” OR “false
negative”); “pregnancy outcome for mother and baby”;
“pregnancy outcome” AND; “birth weight”; AND“gestational age”; AND “admission to intensive care unit”;
AND “preterm delivery”.
Filters were applied to include only publications written in
English, studies carried out in humans, clinical trials, clinical
studies, comparative studies and systematic reviews published
between 1 February 2012 and 31 January 2018, inclusive.
Searches of individual journals were not implemented
because it was felt that publications not captured during
the database search process would have had limited availabil-
ity and would have had little impact on the scientiﬁc
community.
Opinions were also sought from practice development
midwives and obstetric anaesthetists.
Deﬁnition and prevalence of iron deﬁciency
anaemia in pregnancy
Deﬁnition
Anaemia is deﬁned as a low haemoglobin concentration
(Hb); the lower limit of current reference ranges is two stan-
dard deviations below the mean in a healthy population
[World Health Organization (WHO), 2011]. In pregnancy,
there is a physiological expansion of plasma volume begin-
ning in the ﬁrst trimester and plateauing by the third
(Costantine, 2014), which exceeds the increased production
of red blood cells and haemoglobin. The resulting haemodi-
lution contributes to the fall in Hb during pregnancy. Several
factors may restrict or curtail this expansion, including pre-
eclampsia and some medical comorbidities (Fisher &
Nemeth, 1567S). Anaemia in pregnancy can be caused by
numerous other factors, including vitamin B12 and folate
deﬁciency, the presence of a variant haemoglobin or thalas-
saemia, inﬂammatory disorders, haemolysis and blood loss,
and, most commonly, by deﬁciency of iron. This guideline
addresses iron deﬁciency, which is by far the most common
cause of anaemia in pregnancy.Correspondence: BSH Guidelines Administrator, British Society for

Iron deﬁciency is a progressive process, in which iron
stores fall, from being replete to deplete and ﬁnally absent,consequently resulting in iron deﬁciency anaemia. Progres-sive iron deﬁciency can be measured by a variety ofbiomarkers. In iron depletion, the body’s stored iron is
reduced and individuals are at greater risk of anaemia in sit-
uations of increased demand. Iron utilisation is increasedduring pregnancy, as iron is required for fetal growth anddevelopment (Scholl, 2005), as well as for increased mater-nal erythropoiesis (Bothwell, 2000; Fisher & Nemeth,1567S).
The current Hb thresholds deﬁning anaemia in preg-
nancy are based on historical normal values derived from
non-pregnant populations, which are not clearly linked to
clinical outcomes and there is ongoing debate as to theapplicability of these values (Pasricha et al , 2018). The
WHO is reviewing the evidence relating to the Hb belowwhich anaemia should be deﬁned (WHO, 2011; Pasrichaet al, 2018). Until then, the guideline group agreed that the
existing thresholds, being Hb <110 g/l in the ﬁrst trimester,
<105 g/l after 12 weeks and <100 g/l immediately postpar-
tum (Pavord et al, 2012) were most practical, but that fur-
ther work is needed to validate them.
Recommendation
Anaemia should be deﬁned as haemoglobin concentration(Hb) <110 g/l in ﬁrst trimester and <105 g/l in second and
third trimesters and <100 g/l postpartum (2D).
Prevalence
Iron deﬁciency is the most common nutritional deﬁciency
globally and is the leading cause of anaemia (Stevens et al,
2013; McLean et al, 2009; WHO, 2017). In pregnancy, iron
deﬁciency is usually due to an imbalance of demand andsupply, which worsens as pregnancy advances. The preva-
lence of maternal anaemia approaches 50% in low- and mid-
dle-income countries, largely due to a combination ofnutritional deﬁciency, infectious diseases and the presence ofa variant haemoglobin or a thalassaemic disorder (Balarajanet al, 2011). In the UK, the prevalence of anaemia was found
to be 24% in a multicentre national study (Barroso et al ,
2011) and a two-centre English study found 46% of womenhad anaemia at the booking or 28-week checks (Nair et al,
2017).
Clinical effects of iron deﬁciency anaemia in
pregnancy
Iron is an essential requirement for erythropoiesis and iron-
dependent enzymes are present in all cells, including pla-cental and fetal tissue. Iron deﬁciency anaemia has been
linked to poor health outcomes in the mother, fetus and
infant.Maternal morbidity and mortality
Iron deﬁciency with or without anaemia, is associated withmaternal fatigue (Lee & Zaffke, 1999; Pratt & Khan, 2016)and, potentially, poorer quality of life and increased risk ofpostpartum depression (Corwin et al , 2003). A recent sys-
tematic review of non-anaemic iron deﬁciency found thatfatigue improves with iron replacement (Pratt & Khan,2016), although there was only one randomised control trial
and one other relevant study. Altered thyroid metabolism
can also occur in iron deﬁciency anaemia (lower thyroid -stimulating hormone and T3 hormone) and contribute tofatigue (Beard et al, 1989, 1990).
Maternal anaemia may also increase the risk of postpar-
tum haemorrhage (PPH). A large prospective observationalstudy at 2 maternity services in the UK found that 60% ofwomen with Hb <85 g/l sustained PPH, with a quarter pro-
gressing to severe PPH (Briley et al, 2014). One explanation
is impaired uterine contractility due to reduced availabilityof oxygen.
An increased risk of puerperal sepsis has been suggested
by systematic reviews (Pe ~na-Rosas et al, 2012); however, the
number of studies that report on this outcome is small andfurther studies are needed to validate this ﬁnding.
Data from the WHO, derived mainly from low-income
countries, show that the risk of maternal mortality increases
with the severity of anaemia, although the multiple causes ofanaemia make it difﬁcult to determine the direct effects ofanaemia per se (Brabin et al, 2001) and at what Hb threshold
mortality is increased. A recent study adjusting for con-founding factors, such as PPH, massive transfusion andadmission to intensive care units, found that an Hb <70 g/l
antenatally or postpartum was associated with a two-fold
increase in mortality, in low- and middle-income countries
(Daru et al, 2018).
Pregnancy outcome
Maternal anaemia has been a ssociated with a signiﬁ-
cantly higher risk of perinatal and neonatal mortality,low birth weight and pre-term birth, in a systematic
review and meta-analysis of studies from low- and mid-
dle-income countries (Rahman et al , 2016). Recent stud-
ies in a multi-ethnic population in England (Nair et al ,
2017) and in northern India (Nair et al , 2016) support
this, ﬁnding an association between severe antenatalanaemia and stillbirth and perinatal death, and withsmall for gestational age infa nts, low birth weight infants
and maternal PPH. However, a meta-analysis of ran-
domised controlled trials on the effect of iron supple-
mentation showed only a modest effect on birth weightof 41 –69 g, with a small reduction in low birth weight
and uncertainty on the size of the effect on pretermb i r t h ,d u r a t i o no fg e s t a t i o no rs m a l lf o rg e s t a t i o n a la g einfants (Haider et al , 2013).Guideline

The fetus and infant
Most fetal iron is acquired in the third trimester, in prepara-
tion for the high growth rate in the ﬁrst 4 –6 months after
birth (Balesaria et al, 2012). Regulation of fetal iron levels is
a complex process and, in maternal iron deﬁciency anaemia,there is an increase in placental iron receptors and ironabsorption across the placenta to maximise fetal iron supply(Gambling et al, 2011).
Despite this, studies have found that maternal iron deﬁ-
ciency at delivery is associated with lower serum ferritin incord blood of neonates (Shao et al , 2012; Mireku et al ,
2016), suggesting that the prioritisation of fetal iron supplymust be compromised at some point. Shao et al (2012)
found that cord iron levels were reduced when mothers hadserum ferritin levels below 13 µg/l.
The late fetal and early postnatal period are recognised as a
critical period where there is rapid brain development, high
neural plasticity and high nutritional requirement (Gluckman& Hanson, 2004; Georgieff et al, 2015). Animal studies show
maternal iron deﬁciency late in pregnancy is associated withneurodevelopmental impairment. Observational studies inpregnant women have found that iron deﬁciency anaemia latein pregnancy is associated with premature birth and low Apgarscore ( <5 at 1 min) (Lone et al, 2004), and impaired motor,
cognition and language development in the neonate. However,
a systematic review found that the majority of studies areobservational and there is no consistent evidence that maternalanaemia affects infant cognition (Veena et al, 2016).
Recommendations
Healthcare professionals should be aware that iron deﬁ-
ciency anaemia in pregnancy is common and associated
with increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality(1B).
Healthcare professionals should be aware that iron deﬁ-
ciency anaemia in pregnancy is associated with increasedrisk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, and has impor-tant potential implications for the future neuro-develop-ment of the infant (2B).
Diagnosis
Clinical symptoms and signs
The clinical symptoms of iron deﬁciency anaemia in preg-
nancy are non-speciﬁc and cannot be relied on for diagnosticpurposes. Fatigue is the most common symptom but women
may also present with pallor, weakness, headache, palpita-
tions, dizziness, dyspnoea, irritability and restless legs. Pica, acraving for non-food items such as ice (pagophagia) and soil(geophagia), may develop (Lumish et al, 2014).
In early iron depletion, women may experience symptoms
of fatigue, irritability, poor concentration and hair loss(Holm et al, 2018; Lee & Zaffke, 1999). Information given to
women about these symptoms may facilitate earlier presenta-tion of iron depletion, before anaemia develops.
Laboratory testing
Whilst there is no evidence to determine the required fre-quency for checking Hb in pregnancy, current good practiceguidelines advise testing at the booking appointment and at28 weeks [Pavord et al, 2012; Royal College of Obstetricians
& Gynaecologists, 2015; White et al, 2016; National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2016]. New near-pa-tient test assays may allow more frequent testing in the
future.
Red cell indices. A low Hb, mean cell volume (MCV), mean
cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) are suggestive of iron deﬁciency, butneed to be interpreted with caution in view of the physiolog-ical increase of MCV in pregnancy, of around 6 ﬂ (Chanarinet al, 1977). Microcytic, hypochromic indices may also occur
in haemoglobinopathies.
One study in Sri Lanka found the MCHC to have the best
sensitivity for detection of iron deﬁciency, compared withHb and the other red cell indices (Rabindrakumar, et al ,
2018). This has not been supported by UK studies (Voraet al , 2019) but potential biomarkers need to be further
investigated to ﬁnd a practical, cost effective measure for theearly detection of iron depletion.
Serum ferritin. A low serum ferritin is diagnostic of iron
deﬁciency in pregnancy. However, a normal ferritin leveldoes not exclude iron deﬁciency, as pregnancy is associatedwith a physiological rise in acute phase proteins (Kaestelet al, 2015) and changes in iron utilisation and metabolism
(Costantine, 2014), both of which inﬂuence serum ferritinlevels. A recent systematic review showed there is marked
variation in the threshold of serum ferritin used to diagnose
iron deﬁciency, both in research studies and in national andinternational guidelines (Daru et al , 2017).The two bench-
mark studies that compared serum ferritin with iron storesin the bone marrow, and that have guided currently usedthresholds, have signiﬁcant limitations (Hallberg et al, 1993;
van den Broek et al , 1998). Research on pregnancy-speciﬁc
cut-offs of serum ferritin are lacking (Roy & Pavord, 2018)
and there is ongoing debate as to which serum ferritin level
to use as threshold to diagnose iron deﬁciency (Garcia-Casalet al, 2014). In the UK, the majority of clinicians are familiar
with using a serum ferritin level <30lg/l (Daru et al, 2017;
Pavord et al, 2012). It may be appropriate to use a higher
cut-off, but as of yet there are no data to support this inpregnancy and the guideline group encourage continued useof a serum ferritin level <30lg/l until good quality evidence
suggesting another cut-off emerges.guideline

Other biomarkers of iron deﬁciency. Transferrin saturation
has not been widely used in pregnancy, outside the contextof research but is useful in non-pregnancy settings andrequires further evaluation in pregnancy. It is howeverderived from serum iron and total iron binding capacity,
which are inﬂuenced by diurnal variation, infection and
inﬂammation (McSorley et al, 2019).
Other biomarkers may be promising but have not yet been
validated in pregnancy, such as soluble transferrin receptorlevels (sTfR) (Choi et al, 2000) and reticulocyte haemoglobin
content (a key test for diagnosis of iron deﬁciency in chronickidney disease). Data are emerging on the use of serum hep-cidin (Nemeth & Ganz, 2006), however, reference ranges and
the correlation of hepcidin levels with clinical outcomes are
unknown (Koenig et al, 2014) and there is insufﬁcient evi-
dence to support its use in pregnancy.
Trial of oral iron
Oral iron, if taken according to the recommendations indi-cated below (early morning, on an empty stomach), is effec-
tive at correcting iron deﬁciency anaemia (Haider et al ,
2013). In anaemic women, a trial of iron therapy for simulta-neous diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is helpful. A risein Hb should be demonstrable by 2 weeks and supports thediagnosis of iron deﬁciency (Pavord et al , 2012). Women
who are haemoglobinopathy carriers should have serum fer-ritin testing prior to iron administration, to conﬁrm con-comitant iron deﬁciency and exclude iron overload. If
haemoglobinopathy status is not yet known, a trial of iron
can be started at the same time as haemoglobinopathy test-ing.
An effective system for reviewing blood results is impera-
tive. If there has been no improvement in Hb following2 weeks of optimal therapy and compliance, more deﬁnitivetesting and treatment is required.
Non-anaemic women at risk of iron deﬁciency anaemia
Many iron-depleted women are not yet anaemic when theyﬁrst present in pregnancy, as erythropoiesis is usually pre-served until the advanced stages of iron deﬁciency. An obser-vational study of 102 non-anaemic women in the ﬁrsttrimester showed that 14% were iron depleted, deﬁned byferritin levels <30lg/l, and 37% had a low transferrin satura-
tion of <20% (Auerbach et al, 2019). Iron-deﬁcient women
are at high risk of anaemia and need to be identiﬁed by care-ful history at the booking clinic (Table I). There is no goodevidence to inform the management of these women, how-ever it is the opinion of the guideline group that they shouldeither be started on prophylactic iron empirically or havetheir serum ferritin checked ﬁrst. Routine screening withserum ferritin has been proposed (Crispin et al, 2018), but
given the associated costs, delays and limitations of the test,
a careful history to identify these patients may be preferred.Further research is needed to inform the optimal manage-
ment of non-anaemic women with iron deﬁciency.
Recommendations
Healthcare workers should be aware that iron deﬁciency isthe most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy and therisk of iron deﬁciency should be considered in all pregnantwomen (1B).
Haemoglobin concentration should be routinely mea-
sured at booking and at around 28 weeks’ gestation (1D).
Systems must be in place for timely review of blood test
results, including monitoring the response to therapy (1B).
If anaemia without an obvious other cause is detected, a
diagnostic trial of oral iron should be given without delay,with a repeat full blood count in 2 –3 weeks (1D).
The optimal diagnostic strategy for anaemia in preg-
nancy is unknown but unselected routine screening withserum ferritin outside the context of research is not cur-rently recommended (1D).
Serum ferritin should be measured in women with a
known haemoglobinopathy to identify concomitant iron
deﬁciency and exclude iron loading states (1D).
Non-anaemic women at risk of iron deﬁciency should
be identiﬁed and either started on prophylactic ironempirically or have serum ferritin checked ﬁrst (1D).
A serum ferritin level of <30µg/l in pregnancy is
indicative of iron deﬁciency. Levels higher than this do notrule out iron deﬁciency or depletion (2C).
Other biomarkers of iron status are not currently rec-
ommended for screening as there is insufﬁcient validationin pregnancy (2B).
Management of iron deﬁciency
Dietary advice
The average daily iron intake from food for women in Great
Britain is 10 mg, of which 10 –15% is absorbed. The capacity
for absorption is enhanced in pregnancy but physiologicaliron requirements increase from 1 –2 mg to 6 mg per day
(Bothwell, 2000), with increasing demand as pregnancyadvances. The recommended daily intake (RDA) of iron forthe latter half of pregnancy is 27 mg, twice that of a non-pregnant woman (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/
iron-deficiency-anemia).
The amount of iron absorption depends upon the amount
of iron in the diet, its bioavailability and physiologicalrequirements. Haem iron from meat, ﬁsh and poultry isabsorbed 2- to 3-times more readily than non-haem iron.Meat also contains organic compounds that promote theabsorption of iron from other less bioavailable non-haemiron sources (Skikne & Baynes, 1994). However, approxi-
mately 95% of dietary iron intake is from non-haem iron
sources. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) signiﬁcantly enhances ironGuideline

absorption from non-haem foods (Lynch, 1997), the size of
this effect increasing with the quantity of vitamin C in the
meal. Germination and fermentation of cereals and legumesimprove the bioavailability of non-haem iron by reducingthe content of phytate, a food substance that inhibits ironabsorption. Tannins in tea and coffee inhibit iron absorptionwhen consumed with a meal or shortly after.
Recommendations
All pregnant women should receive dietary advice (2B).
Once women become iron -deﬁcient in pregnancy it is
not possible to ensure repletion through diet alone andoral supplementation is needed (2B).
Education and counselling regarding diet may improve
iron intake and enhance absorption but the degree ofchange achievable remains in question (2B).
Oral iron preparations
Oral iron is an effective, cheap and safe way to replaceiron. Ferrous salts are preferred to ferric salts due to the
poorer absorption and bioavailability of the latter (Davidssonet al , 2000; Nagpal & Choudhury, 2004). Available ferrous
salts include ferrous fumarate, ferrous sulphate and ferrous
gluconate. It is the amount of elemental iron that is impor-
tant and this varies by preparation, as detailed in Table II.Multivitamins and ‘off the shelf’ preparations usually haveinsufﬁcient iron to correct anaemia and, furthermore, oftencontain other minerals that interfere with iron absorption.Combined iron and folic acid preparations are available buttheir efﬁcacy compared to oral iron alone is unknown. Dailyfolic acid (400 µg) is required before 12 weeks’ gestation to
reduce the incidence of neural tube defects.Until now, the recommended dose of elemental iron for
treatment of iron deﬁciency has been 100 –200 mg daily
(Joint Formulary Committee, 2017; Pavord et al , 2012).
However, more recent studies suggest that lower doses orintermittent supplementation may be advantageous (Pena-
Rosas et al, 2015). Moretti et al (2015) showed that fractional
absorption of iron in iron-depleted young non-pregnantwomen is maximised by taking elemental iron doses of 40 –
80 mg once per day or alternate days, avoiding twice dailydosing. Higher doses potentially increase side effects due tothe excess unabsorbed iron remaining in the gastrointestinaltract. Iron is known to cause gastric irritation, nausea anddisturbed bowel function, affecting compliance (Smith et al,
2014). Shinar et al (2017) showed that 68 mg daily, started
at 17 weeks’ gestation, did not result in a higher Hb by35 weeks than 34 mg daily. Data reported by Stoffel et al
(2017) suggest that optimal absorption occurs from alternateday dosing, due to higher hepcidin levels with consecutiveday dosing. However, a balance between optimal absorption,ease of compliance and need for rapid response may lead toa daily regime being preferred. Hepcidin levels are lowest in
the morning, suggesting that a morning dose is preferable
(Schapp et al , 2013). Oral iron supplementation should be
taken on an empty stomach, as absorption is reduced or pro-moted by the same factors that affect absorption of dietarynon-haem iron. It may be taken with water or a source ofvitamin C to enhance absorption.
Recommendations
Ferrous iron salts are the current preparation of choice fororal iron supplementation (1C).
Until further research determines the optimal dose of
elemental oral iron, 40 –80 mg every morning is suggested,
checking Hb at 2 –3 weeks to ensure an adequate response
(2C).
Women should be counselled as to how to take oral
iron supplements correctly. This should be on an empty
stomach, with water or a source of vitamin C. Other medi-cations, multivitamins and antacids should not be taken atthe same time (1B).
Treatment for anaemia should be started promptly by
the healthcare professional caring for the woman. Escala-tion to specialist medical care is required if anaemia is sev-ere (Hb <70 g/l) and/or associated with signiﬁcant
symptoms or advanced gestation ( >34 weeks) (2B), or if
the Hb is failing to respond after 2 –3 weeks of oral iron
correctly taken.
In non -anaemic women at increased risk of iron deple-
tion, 40 –80 mg elemental iron once a day should be
offered empirically, or serum ferritin should be checkedand iron offered if the ferritin is <30lg/l (1B).

and iron status at the start of supplementation, ongoing
losses, iron absorption and other factors contributing to
anaemia, such as other micronutrient deﬁciencies, infectionsand renal impairment. However, compliance and intoleranceof oral iron preparations are the usual factors limiting efﬁ-cacy. Iron salts may cause gastric irritation (Pereira et al ,
2014) and up to a third of patients may develop dose-limit-ing side effects (Breymann, 2002), including nausea and epi-gastric discomfort. This is minimised by correct
administration, which optimises absorption. It may be neces-
sary to titrate the dose down to a level where side effects areacceptable or try an alternative preparation. Enteric-coatedor sustained release preparations should be avoided, as themajority of the iron from such preparations is carried pastthe duodenum, limiting absorption (Tapiero et al , 2001).
The relationship between dose and altered bowel habit (diar-rhoea and constipation) is less clear (Tapiero et al , 2001),
and other strategies, such as use of laxatives are helpful.
A repeat Hb at 2 –3 weeks is required to assess response to
treatment. The timing of further checks will depend uponthe degree of anaemia and period of gestation. Once the Hbis in the normal range, treatment should be continued for afurther 3 months and until at least until 6 weeks postpartumto replenish iron stores.
Recommendations
For nausea and epigastric discomfort, alternate day dosingor preparations with lower iron content should be tried.Slow release and enteric -coated forms should be avoided
(1A).
Repeat Hb testing is required 2 –3 weeks after commenc-
ing treatment for established anaemia, to assess compli-
ance, correct administration and response to treatment
(1B).
Once the Hb is in the normal range, replacement should
continue for 3 months and until at least 6 weeks postpar-tum to replenish iron stores (1D).
If response to oral iron replacement is poor, compliance
should be conﬁrmed and concomitant causes that may becontributing to the anaemia considered, such as folate deﬁ-
ciency or malabsorption (1A).
Intravenous iron therapy
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses found that pregnant
women receiving intravenous (IV) iron, compared with oraliron, achieved the target Hb more often, had an increased
Hb after 4 weeks and had fewer side effects (Govindappagari
& Burwick, 2018; Govindappagari & Burwick, 2019; Qassimet al, 2018).
IV iron therapy is indicated when there is absolute non-
compliance with, or intolerance of, oral iron therapy or pro-ven malabsorption or when a rapid Hb response is required.Contraindications include a history of anaphylaxis or seriousreactions to parenteral iron therapy, ﬁrst trimester of preg-
nancy, active acute or chronic bacteraemia and decompen-
sated liver disease.
The intravenous iron preparations currently available in
the UK and their properties are summarized in Table III.Iron sucrose has a higher availability for erythropoiesis thaniron dextran and experience suggests a good safety proﬁle inpregnancy (Bayoumeu et al, 2005). Its use is limited by the
total dose that can be administered in one infusion, requiring
multiple infusions. Iron carboxymaltose and iron isomal-
toside overcome this problem, allowing single dose adminis-tration (Lyseng-Williamson & Keating, 2009; Gozzard, 2011;Qassim et al, 2018).
Fast-acting intravenous iron preparations. Iron III carboxy-
maltose (Ferrinject) is a ferric hydroxide carbohydrate com-plex and Iron III isomaltoside (Monofer) has strongly bound
iron in spheroid iron-carbohydrate particles. Both allow con-
trolled delivery of iron within the cells of the reticuloen-dothelial system (primarily bone marrow) and subsequentrelease of bioavailable iron to the iron binding proteins, fer-ritin and transferrin. The rapid uptake by the reticuloen-dothelial system minimises the risk of release of free iron.Randomised controlled trials have shown non-inferiority(Breymann et al , 2016; Van Wyk & Martens, 2007) and
superiority (Seid et al, 2008; Khalafallah et al, 2018) to oral
ferrous sulphate in the treatment of iron deﬁciency anaemiain pregnancy and postpartum, with rapid and sustainedincreases in Hb. It should be noted that many studies on theeffects of IV iron are powered on haematological outcomes,not clinical ones.
Dosing. Traditionally the Ganzoni formula (Ganzoni, 1970)
has been used for estimation of iron dose. However this is
cumbersome, prone to error and can underestimate ironrequirements (Dignass et al , 2015); use of a simpliﬁed
approach to dosing has been recommended (Dignass et al ,
2015).Table II. Recommended daily dose and elemental iron content of oral iron preparations.

Adverse effects and cost effectiveness. Genuine hypersensitivity
is rare and no difference between the risk for hypersensitivityreactions has been identiﬁed among IV iron products avail-able in the UK. In rare cases, fetal bradycardia has beenobserved in pregnant women with hypersensitivity reactions
to parenteral iron (https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/produc
t/5676/smpc). The European Medicines Agency (EMA, 2013)concluded that the beneﬁt-risk balance of intravenous iron-containing medicinal products is favourable, as the beneﬁtscontinue to outweigh the risks in the treatment of iron deﬁ-ciency when the oral route is insufﬁcient or poorly tolerated.Facilities and staff trained in management of anaphylaxisshould be available.
Hypophosphataemia can occur after administration of IV
iron, particularly ferric carboxymaltose. Case reports in non-pregnant patients have shown associated clinical conse-quences (Zoller et al, 2017). The drop in phosphate may be
greater in pregnant than non-pregnant women (Huang et al,
2018) but the signiﬁcance of this is not known.
Haemosiderin skin staining can result from extravasation,
particularly if the cannula is incorrectly placed. Women
should be advised of this and should be requested to report
any pain at the infusion site (Thompson et al, 2014).
IV iron is signiﬁcantly more costly than oral iron, with
costs covering not only the drug but also the support foradministration.
Breastfeeding after IV iron. A study of 65 patients who
received therapeutic dose IV iron isomaltoside, showed a
transient increase in iron in breast milk, 3 days after treat-
ment, compared with oral iron. However, the mean ironconcentration remained within the normal range and the dif-ference disappeared one week after treatment (Holm et al ,
2017a).
Recommendations
IV ron should be considered from the second trimesteronwards for women with conﬁrmed iron deﬁciency anae-mia who are intolerant of, or do not to respond to, oraliron (2B).
IV iron should be considered in women who present
after 34 weeks’ gestation with conﬁrmed iron deﬁciencyanaemia and an Hb of <100 g/l (1C).
Management of delivery in women with iron
deﬁciency anaemia
Whilst best practice includes prevention of anaemia or early
identiﬁcation and antenatal treatment, some women enterlabour with iron deﬁciency anaemia. As for all women, it isimportant that active measures to minimise blood loss atbirth are planned.
There is no place for offering routine induction of labour
based on isolated iron deﬁciency anaemia; efforts tomaximise pre-delivery Hb should be made and induction
planned according to usual obstetric indications.
Iron deﬁciency anaemia should not inﬂuence the planned
mode of birth, and decisions should be made according toobstetric indications.
The intended place of birth may be inﬂuenced by pre-
labour Hb, as anaemic women may have both a higher likeli-hood of PPH and lower iron stores for coping with haemor-rhage [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) 2014]. Other risk factors that might inﬂuence thelikelihood or impact of haemorrhage should also be takeninto consideration, including previous PPH, grandmultipar-ity, ﬁbroid uterus, multiple pregnancy, severity of anaemia
and whether blood components will be accepted or not.
Women with Hb <100 g/l approaching birth should have
an individualised plan, including the potential role of intra-venous access, ‘group and save’ in labour, birth in an obste-trician-led unit and active management of third stage oflabour (Rogers et al , 1998), discussed and documented
clearly in the birth plan or maternity notes.
Recommendations
Iron deﬁciency anaemia should not inﬂuence the modeand timing of delivery (2D).
Women with iron deﬁciency anaemia with an Hb of
<100 g/l should deliver in an obstetrician-led unit (1D).
Women with iron deﬁciency anaemia should have active
management of the third stage of labour (1D).
Postpartum anaemia
Postnatal anaemia is deﬁned as an Hb <100 g/l. The risk of
postnatal anaemia is reduced by identiﬁcation and manage-ment of iron deﬁciency in the antenatal period. Women withuncorrected anaemia antenatally should have a Hb checkwithin 48 h of birth, as should those who have had blood
loss>500 ml, or symptoms suggestive of postpartum anae-
mia. Blood loss at delivery is associated with fatigue (G €uven
et al, 2018) and clinical assessment is necessary to consider
the best method of iron replacement. Where there is noactive bleeding, or clinical requirement to increase Hburgently, oral iron should be sufﬁcient, provided it is sup-ported with information about the correct administration.Severe symptoms of anaemia may require IV iron for faster
beneﬁt (Holm et al , 2017b). A large retrospective study of
women with a postpartum Hb <80 g/l, conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy
of IV iron, with a mean increase in Hb of 19 g/l in 7 daysand 31 g/l in 14 days (Broche et al, 2005). This is supported
by a small randomized controlled trial of IV iron versusblood transfusion for postpartum Hb between 56 and 81 g/l(Holm et al, 2017c).
Use of IV iron undoubtedly allows some red cell transfu-
sions to be avoided. However transfusion may be needed if
there is continued bleeding or risk of further bleeding,Guideline

imminent cardiac compromise or signiﬁcant symptoms
requiring urgent correction. If, after careful consideration,elective transfusion is required, a single unit should be givenfollowed by clinical reassessment and repeat Hb. Womenshould be fully counselled about potential risks of transfusion
and alternative treatments and offered information; consent
should be obtained.
Recommendations
Prompt recognition of iron deﬁciency in the antenatal per-iod followed by iron therapy may reduce the risk of post-partum anaemia (1A).
After delivery, women with blood loss >500 ml, those
with uncorrected anaemia detected in the antenatal periodor those with symptoms suggestive of anaemia postnatallyshould have their Hb checked within 48 h of delivery (2A).
Women with Hb <100 g/l within 48 h of delivery, who
are haemodynamically stable, asymptomatic, or mildlysymptomatic, should be offered oral elemental iron 40 –
80 mg daily for at least 3 months (2A).
Use of IV iron postpartum should be considered in
women who are previously intolerant of, or do notrespond to, oral iron and/or where the severity of symp-toms of anaemia requires prompt management (2B).
Obstetric units should have guidelines for the criteria to
be used for postnatal red cell transfusion in anaemicwomen who are not actively bleeding (2A).
The decision to transfuse women in the postpartum per-
iod should be based on careful evaluation, including
whether or not there is risk of bleeding, cardiac compro-mise or symptoms requiring urgent attention, consideringoral or parenteral iron therapy as alternatives (1A).
Women receiving red cell transfusion should be given
full information regarding the indication for, and risks of,transfusion and alternative treatments. Consent should besought and documented in the clinical records (1A).
Prevention of iron deﬁciency
Prevention offers an alternative strategy to reduce the impactand prevalence of anaemia developing during pregnancy,although there are no clear data to inform the role of univer-sal iron supplementation. Although current guidelines arebased on prompt identiﬁcation and treatment of anaemia
and recognition of women at risk, practice audits indicate
limited effectiveness of this approach. For example, one studyof 14 001 pregnant women from two maternity hospitalsfound that 46% had an Hb <110 g/l at booking and/or at
28 weeks’ gestation and 64% of those with anaemia in theﬁrst trimester were still anaemic at 28 weeks (Nair et al ,2017). Additional beneﬁts to prevention may relate to cost-
effectiveness, including reducing the need for iron supple-mentation, transfusions, family and social care for pretermbirths and stillbirths and support for infant neurodevelop-ment. The US Preventive Services Task Force (2015) stated
that the current evidence is insufﬁcient to assess the full bal-
ance of beneﬁts and harms of routine iron supplementationduring pregnancy.
Regular antenatal iron supplementation will reduce the
risk of maternal anaemia, but there is less clarity on theimpact on maternal and infant clinical outcomes (Haideret al, 2013). In a Cochrane review on use of intermittent iron
(21 trials involving many developing countries) the quality of
evidence on maternal and infant outcomes was overall
assessed as low or very low (Pena-Rosas et al, 2015). A struc-
tured literature search against UK National Screening Com-mittee criteria also conﬁrmed uncertainty in the magnitudeof the adverse outcomes associated with maternal anaemiaand the need for research on the role of preventative strate-gies (Parker et al, 2012; Rukini et al, 2015).
Recommendations
There is insufﬁcient evidence to assess the beneﬁts and
potential hazards of, routine iron supplementation for allwomen in pregnancy (2C).
