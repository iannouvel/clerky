Diagnosis and management of Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)

Key Principles:
- Guidelines are not prescriptive and should be used in conjunction with discussions with senior colleagues.
- Guidelines are based on national/RCOG guidelines and have been reviewed by all clinicians involved in early pregnancy care.

Introduction:
- GTD is a group of pregnancy-related tumors characterized by trophoblastic tissue proliferation.
- Clinical features include irregular uterine bleeding, hyperemesis, early pregnancy failure, and excessive uterine enlargement.

Ultrasound examination:
- Helpful in making a pre-evacuation diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination.

Complete Moles:
- Diploid and androgenic in origin, with no evidence of fetal tissue.

Partial Moles:
- Usually triploid in origin, with two sets of paternal haploid genes and one set of maternal haploid genes.

Histology:
- Histological assessment of failed pregnancies is recommended to exclude trophoblastic disease.
- Persistent trophoblastic neoplasia may develop after any pregnancy.

Evacuation of molar pregnancy:
- Suction curettage is the method of choice for complete and partial molar pregnancies.
- Anti-D prophylaxis may be advised after evacuation of a partial molar pregnancy.

Follow up:
- Women diagnosed with GTD are informed about their diagnosis and referred to Charing Cross Hospital for follow-up testing.

Future Pregnancy and Contraceptive Advice:
- Women should not conceive until follow-up is complete.
- Barrier methods of contraception should be used until hCG levels revert to normal.

Future Pregnancies:
- Risk of further molar pregnancy is low.
- Women should contact the treatment center for follow-up arrangements.

Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN):
- Persistent elevation of Î²hCG indicates GTN.
- Urine pregnancy test should be offered in cases of persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event.

Twin Pregnancy:
- Seek advice from the regional Fetal Medicine Centre in cases of combined molar and viable twin pregnancy.
- Consider offering prenatal invasive testing for fetal karyotype in such cases.
