Induction of Labour (RSCH PRH only) MP033

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all pregnant women.

Responsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff and service users.

Information and decision-making: Women should be informed about the risks of pregnancies lasting longer than 42 weeks. Healthcare professionals should check for low-lying placenta before membrane sweeping and induction of labour.

Induction of labour in specific circumstances: Induction should be offered between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to prevent prolonged pregnancy. Decisions for preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes and term pre-labour rupture of membranes should be made based on specific factors.

Previous caesarean section: For VBAC induction of labour with Amniotomy, see protocol MP034 Vaginal Birth after Caesarean Section.

Maternal request: Induction should not be routinely offered on maternal request alone.

Breech presentation: Induction is not generally recommended for breech presentation, but may be offered if external cephalic version is unsuccessful.

Fetal growth restriction: Induction is not recommended for severe fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise.

History of precipitate labour: Induction to avoid unattended birth should not be routinely offered to women with a history of precipitate labour.

Intrauterine fetal death: Support should be offered to help cope with the emotional and physical consequences. Induction options depend on the clinical circumstances.

Suspected fetal macrosomia: Induction should not be carried out based solely on suspicion of macrosomia.

Diabetes and hypertension: Refer to specific protocols for management.

Membrane sweeping: Recommended as an adjunct to induction of labour.

Pharmacological methods: Vaginal PGE2 is the preferred method, with specific regimens outlined.

If Propess Comes Out: Instructions for reinsertion if necessary.

Overall, the protocol outlines guidelines for induction of labour in various circumstances, emphasizing informed decision-making and patient support.

Women should be advised to return to MAU/triage for assessment and reinsertion. If overnight, women should be asked to come to MAU/triage at 8am for assessment and reinsertion.

Healthcare professionals should inform women that the available evidence does not support the following methods for induction of labor: herbal supplements, acupuncture, homeopathy, castor oil, hot baths, enemas, and sexual intercourse.

Amniotomy alone or with oxytocin should not be used as a primary method of induction of labor unless there are specific clinical reasons for not using vaginal PGE2, particularly the risk of uterine hyperstimulation.

Mechanical procedures, such as balloon catheters and laminaria tents, should not be used routinely for induction of labor.

In the outpatient setting, induction of labor should only be carried out if safety and support procedures are in place. The practice of induction of labor in an outpatient setting should be audited continuously.

In the inpatient setting, induction of labor using vaginal PGE2 should be carried out at the earliest availability.

Monitoring during induction of labor should include continuous electronic fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring. Before induction of labor, the Bishop Score should be assessed and recorded, and fetal wellbeing should be confirmed using electronic fetal monitoring.

Women should be informed that induced labor is likely to be more painful than spontaneous labor and should be provided with appropriate pain relief options. Birth attendants should offer support and analgesia as required.

Prevention and management of complications during induction of labor should include monitoring for uterine hyperstimulation and failed induction, with subsequent management options discussed with the woman based on clinical circumstances.

To reduce the likelihood of cord prolapse, precautions should be taken before induction, and if uterine rupture is suspected, emergency caesarean section should be considered.
