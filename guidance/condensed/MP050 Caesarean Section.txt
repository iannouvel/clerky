Caesarean Section Protocol: MP050  
Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable standards for action.  
Scope: Applies to any woman/person requiring or requesting a caesarean section.  
Responsibilities: Midwives and obstetricians must follow the guidance.  
Classification of Caesarean Section: Categories 1-4 based on urgency.  
General Preparation and Management: Documentation and pre-operative brief.  
Responsibilities of Staff Group: Duties of attending obstetrician, midwife, and anaesthetist.  
Pre-Operative Brief and WHO Safety Surgical Checklist: Steps before surgery.  
Considerations for all caesarean births: Intra-operative cell salvage, blood transfusion, and surgical techniques.

- Do not routinely suture the visceral or the parietal peritoneum in caesarean birth 
- Do not routinely close the subcutaneous tissue space in caesarean unless the subcutaneous fat >2cm 
- Close the skin with sutures rather than staples to reduce the risk of superficial wound dehiscence 
- Do not routinely use superficial wound drains in caesarean birth 
- Consider negative pressure wound therapy after caesarean birth for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more 
- Only use forceps in caesarean birth if there is difficulty delivering the baby's head 
- Delayed cord clamping should be considered routine for deliveries by caesarean 
- Cord milking is beneficial in cases where delayed cord clamping is not appropriate 
- Oxytocin 5 units should be given as a slow intravenous injection after the cord is clamped 
- Oxytocin 40 units infusion should not be routinely used 
- Delay cord clamping in cases of emergency or where there are concerns for fetal wellbeing 
- Cord blood samples should be taken in any Category 1 or 2 LSCS 
- Cord blood samples are required where the pregnant woman/person has known abnormal antibodies, or Rh -ve 
- Antenatal corticosteroids should be given to all those for whom an elective caesarean section is planned prior to 38+6 weeks of gestation 
- All pregnant women/people should be given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss their options regarding their mode of delivery 
- Enhanced Recovery should be considered for all non-complex obstetric/surgical patients when booking an elective caesarean 
- All pregnant women/people having planned caesarean birth should have pre-op booked at the DAU/MAU in the preceding 24-48 hours 
- Regular post-operative analgesia is prescribed for all those having caesarean sections and should be given 
- Removal of the urinary bladder catheter should be carried out once a woman/person is mobile after a regional anaesthetic and not sooner than six hours after the last epidural 'top up' dose 
- When caring for post-natal women/people who have had a caesarean birth who have urinary symptoms, consider possible diagnoses of urinary tract infection, stress incontinence, urinary tract injury, urinary retention

9.5 Consider negative pressure wound therapy after caesarean birth for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more to reduce the risk of wound infections. 
9.6 When caring for women / people who have had a caesarean birth who have heavy and/or irregular vaginal bleeding, consider whether this is more likely to be because of endometritis than retained products of conception, and manage accordingly. 
9.7 All women / people should have VTE risk assessment and have be assessed and thromboprophylaxis prescribed appropriately. 
9.8 All mothers / parents should have a discussion about the implications for future pregnancies before they are discharged including suitability for VBAC. 
9.9 Ensure that the discharge summary is complete with relevant information about category of caesarean, any complications. 
9.9 Inform women / people who have had a caesarean birth that they can resume activities such as driving a vehicle, carrying heavy items, formal exercise and sexual intercourse when they feel they have fully recovered from the caesarean birth.
