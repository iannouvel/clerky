135This guideline r eplaces CG190 . 
This guideline is t he basis of QS105 . 
This guideline should be r ead in conjunction wit h NG137 . 
Overview 
This guideline co vers t he car e of w omen and t heir babies during labour and immediat ely 
after bir th. It f ocuses on w omen who giv e bir th betw een 37 and 42 w eeks of pr egnancy 
('term'). The guideline helps w omen t o mak e informed choices about wher e to have their 
baby and about t heir car e in labour . It also aims t o reduce v ariation in aspect s of car e. 
NICE has also pr oduced guidelines on intrapar tum car e for women wit h existing medical 
conditions or obst etric complications and t heir babies , fetal monit oring in labour and 
caesar ean bir th. For inf ormation on ot her r elated topics, see our women's and r eproductiv e 
healt h summar y page . 
Using inclusiv e language in healt hcare is impor tant f or saf ety, and t o promot e equity , 
respect and eff ectiv e communication wit h everyone. This guideline does not use inclusiv e 
language in whole or in par t because: 
• the evidence has not been r eview ed, and it is not cer tain fr om e xper t opinion which 
groups t he advice co vers, or 
• the evidence has been r eview ed, but t he inf ormation a vailable f or some gr oups was 
too limit ed to mak e specific r ecommendations, or 
• only a v ery limit ed number of r ecommendations ha ve been updat ed in dir ect r esponse 
to new e vidence or t o reflect a change in practice. 
Healt hcare professionals should use t heir clinical judgement when implementing 
recommendations, taking int o account t he individual's cir cumstances, needs and 
preferences, and ensuring all people ar e treated wit h dignity and r espect t hroughout t heir 
care. Intrapar tum car e (NG235)

135Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
1.1 Antena tal e ducation abou t labour 
1.1.1 Give all w omen inf ormation ant enatally about: 
• what t o expect in t he lat ent first stage of labour 
• how to work wit h any pain t hey experience 
• how to contact t heir midwif ery car e team and what t o do in an emer gency . 
[2014 , amended 2023] 
1.1.2 Offer all w omen ant enatal education about t he signs of labour , consisting of: 
• how to diff erentiat e betw een Braxt on Hicks contractions and activ e labour 
contractions 
• the expect ed fr equency of contractions and ho w long t hey last 
• recognition of amniotic fluid ('wat ers br eaking') 
• description of normal v aginal loss. [2014 , amended 2023] 
1.1.3 For all w omen, discuss t heir pr eferences and choices f or car e during labour and 
birth as early as possible in t heir pr egnancy , and r ecord these choices.

• they are free to mak e their decisions and change t heir mind at an y time, 
including during labour or while giving bir th 
• choices and decisions ma y need t o be discussed again if pr oblems or

6 Effect of informa tion g iving on p lace of bir th 
How does t he pr ovision of accurat e, evidence-based inf ormation aff ect w omen's decision-
making pr ocesses and choice of place of bir th? [2014] 
Why this is impor tant 
A longitudinal narrativ e repor t of pr egnant w omen in 3 mat ernity ser vices in t he UK 
identifies in detail wh y women mak e choices about wher e to giv e bir th and ho w these 
choices can be influenced. Influences ma y include writt en and v erbal inf ormation (bot h 
online and fr om midwiv es and doct ors), pr evious e xperience, and w ord-of-mout h advice 
from friends and f amily . The Birthplace study concluded t hat giving bir th out side an 
obstetric unit is t he optimal choice f or low-risk w omen. This finding should be used t o 
restructur e the wa y in which inf ormation is pr ovided, so t hat it is pr esent ed in a mor e 
accurat e, less risk -based wa y in or der t o suppor t women's choices. This change should be 
evaluat ed in a quantitativ e obser vational study and/or qualitativ e study t hat r ecords an y 
changes in w omen's choice-making about place of bir th. Out comes include understanding 
why and ho w women mak e choices about wher e to giv e bir th and ho w this can influence 
the pr ovision of appr opriat e and accessible inf ormation, a measur e of inf ormed decision 
making, and f earfulness and absence of f earfulness when choosing place of bir th. 
7 Long-term c onse quenc es of planning bir th in dif ferent settings 
What ar e the long-t erm consequences f or women and babies of planning bir th in diff erent 
settings? [2014] 
Why this is impor tant 
The long-t erm consequences of bir th experiences and bir th out comes ar e poorly 
underst ood, par ticularly in r elation t o place of bir th. A lar ge population-based 
obser vational study w ould compar e women's e xperiences and out comes in diff erent bir th 
settings (wit h subgr oup analysis b y mode of bir th) in r elation t o the w ellbeing of t he 
women and t heir childr en over diff erent periods of time (f or example, 2, 5 , 10, 15, 20 and 
30 years). A secondar y analysis could compar e diff erent pr oviders wher e bir th 
philosophies ar e diff erent. Out comes w ould be compar ed by accessing medical r ecords Intrapar tum car e (NG235)

135and t hrough qualitativ e interviews. Primar y out comes ar e long-t erm ph ysical morbidity , 
pain aft er bir th, readmission t o hospital, inf ection, psy chological morbidity (f or example, 
postnatal depr ession, bonding, r elationship br eakdown wit h par tner, fear of giving bir th in 
futur e) and br eastf eeding rat es. Secondar y out comes ar e impact on attachment betw een 
mother and child, obesity in childr en, aut oimmune disease, chr onic illness, educational 
achie vement and f amily functioning.

frequency of ut erine contractions? [2023]

resear ch, see t he rationale section on t he use of o xytocin in t he first or second stage 
of labour . 
Full details of t he evidence and t he committ ee's discussion ar e in evidence r eview F: 
oxytocin in t he first or second stage of labour . 
9 Postpar tum haemorr hage 
What is t he most eff ectiv e treatment f or primar y postpar tum haemorrhage? [2014] 
Why this is impor tant 
Ther e is uncer tainty about t he most eff ectiv e drug tr eatment s and dosage r egimes, and 
about which ot her tr eatment s should be used, f or women who de velop a postpar tum 
haemorrhage. The most eff ectiv e sequencing of int erventions is also uncer tain. The 
psychological impact of postpar tum haemorrhage f or women can be significant, and 
identifying t he appr oach t hat minimises t his impact is impor tant. Randomised contr olled 
trials comparing diff erent dosage r egimes f or oxytocin and misopr ostol, as w ell as 
comparisons wit h ergometrine and carbopr ost, ar e needed. T rials of mechanical measur es 
such as intraut erine balloons or int erventional radiology as early second-line tr eatment 
(rather t han an alt ernativ e drug tr eatment) ar e also needed. Alt ernativ ely, a trial comparing 
the eff ectiv eness of a comple x intervention (f or example, an educational component, 
sequence of int erventions, immediat e feedback and quality impr ovement s) compar ed wit h Intrapar tum car e (NG235)

Recommendation 1 .1.3 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The committ ee w ere awar e that t he incr eased f ocus on suppor ted decision making during 
labour meant t hat t here were a number of point s during labour wher e women w ere ask ed 
to mak e decisions on t heir car e (for example, type of analgesia, use of o xytocin, perineal 
care, and activ e or ph ysiological management of t he third stage). The committ ee agr eed 
that it w ould t herefore be helpful if discussions of some of t hese options could begin 
during pr egnancy , when w omen w ould ha ve mor e time t o think about t heir options.

135Fluid balanc e and h ypona traemia 
Recommendations 1 .8.26 t o 1.8.31 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Based on a Pr evention of F uture Deat hs repor t and ot her concerns about peripar tum 
hyponatraemia being under -recognised in practice and sometimes leading t o mat ernal or 
neonatal se vere morbidity or deat h, the committ ee w ere ask ed to mak e recommendations 
on fluid balance and h yponatraemia. No new e vidence was r eview ed, so t he committ ee 
made new r ecommendations and amended e xisting advice based on t heir e xper tise and 
experience. The committ ee ackno wledged t hat clinical consensus and practice ar ound t his 
issue has been influenced b y a former guideline which has been ar chived and no longer 
maintained: t he Guidelines and Audit Implementation Netw ork (G AIN)/R egulation and 
Quality Impr ovement Aut hority (RQIA) guideline f or the pr evention, diagnosis and 
management of h yponatraemia in labour and t he immediat e postpar tum period. 
Natural changes in wat er and sodium balance in t he body during pr egnancy mean t hat 
normal sodium le vels in t he blood during pr egnancy (130 t o 140 mmol/L) ar e slight ly lower 
than t he le vel in t he general population (135 t o 145 mmol/L). W omen and people in labour 
are at higher risk of h yponatraemia (sodium less t han 130 mmol/L) because of 
physiological changes in pr egnancy and in labour , including a lo wer blood osmolality , a 
lower sodium le vel and t he antidiur etic eff ect of bot h endogenous and e xogenous o xytocin 
in labour . The liberal use of intra venous fluids and e xcessiv e oral intak e fur ther incr eases 
the risk. Mat ernal h yponatraemia impact s the unborn bab y because wat er cr osses t he 
placenta fr eely, which can lead t o hyponatraemia in t he newborn. Mild h yponatraemia can 
be asympt omatic, but mor e severe hyponatraemia can cause mat ernal or neonatal 
neurological morbidity , including seizur es, coma and deat h. 
The best wa y to prevent h yponatraemia is t o monit or fluid balance b y recording t he 
volume of fluid intak e (oral and intra venous) and output (primarily urine) in a char t. Fluid 
balance monit oring ma y also be impor tant f or ot her clinical r easons, including t o prevent 
dehydration if t he person is v omiting or in t he cont ext of pr e-eclampsia, f or example. The 
committ ee agr eed t hat t he benefit s of monit oring fluid balance in all labours needs t o be 
balanced wit h the implications of it in t erms of , for example, midwif e time and t he bir th 
experience of t he w oman or pr egnant person. The committ ee discussed t hat, as standar d 
practice, t he midwif e would k eep an e ye on t he w oman's or pr egnant person's fluid intak e 
and output and if t here were any concerns or risks, t his w ould pr ompt a f ormal fluid Intrapar tum car e (NG235)

135balance monit oring. So t he committ ee did not r ecommend fluid balance monit oring in all 
labours as it ma y not alwa ys be clinically necessar y, but based on t heir e xper tise, t hey 
recommended indicat ors f or when it should be done. The committ ee agr eed t hat if 
healt hcare professionals (par ticularly midwiv es) ha ve any concerns about t he person's 
fluid intak e or output, fluid balance monit oring should be carried out. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat a positiv e fluid balance of 1500 ml is a r easonable cut -off f or 
prompting an obst etric r eview and a blood t est t o check f or sodium le vels. These should 
also happen when t here are clinical concerns, such as signs and sympt oms of 
hyponatraemia. F or women and pr egnant people giving bir th in a midwif ery-led setting, 
this will mean transf erring t o an obst etric unit. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat administ ering intra venous fluids or advising oral fluid intak e to 
treat k etosis in w omen and people in labour who ar e not diabetic was common practice, 
but oft en unnecessar y and pot entially harmful because of t he incr eased risk of 
hyponatraemia. 
The committ ee did not mak e recommendations about ho w to manage h yponatraemia and 
instead advised t he use of local pr otocols. Ho wever, they emphasised t he impor tance of 
informing t he consultant obst etrician, consultant anaest hetist and t he neonatal t eam so 
that appr opriat e oversight and car e plans ar e in place. The ur gency of t his depends on 
severity of h yponatraemia demonstrat ed by sympt oms or blood sodium le vel. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendations will impr ove awar eness of t he risk of e xcessiv e fluid intak e in 
labour , and t he subsequent risk of h yponatraemia. This will in some cases lead t o a change 
in practice wit h the incr eased use of fluid balance monit oring in labour . Incr eased use of 
fluid balance monit oring will ha ve a small impact on midwif e's time and t here ma y be a 
small incr ease in need f or blood t ests and transf ers t o obst etric unit s, but t he benefit s of 
preventing adv erse out comes fr om h yponatraemia should outw eigh t his. The 
recommendations ar e unlik ely to have any significant r esour ce impact.

committ ee consider ed the evidence stratified b y women who had a v aginal bir th and 
women who had a caesar ean bir th. For vaginal bir th, the most eff ectiv e uterotonics t hat 
the committ ee agr eed w ere suitable f or use in a wide v ariety of settings wit hout causing 
unacceptable side eff ects were oxytocin plus er gometrine or o xytocin alone. The cost -

as the clinical e vidence had sho wn it ma y be mor e eff ectiv e. The committ ee consider ed 
the use of carbet ocin but based on t he evidence, did not consider t hat carbet ocin was 
cost eff ectiv e for the pr evention of postpar tum haemorrhage f or women who had a v aginal

For women who had a caesar ean bir th, there was e vidence sho wing t hat t he most 
effectiv e uterotonics at r educing postpar tum haemorrhage w ere misopr ostol 600 to 
800 micrograms and intra venous carbet ocin. The committ ee consider ed that misopr ostol 
was not a suitable agent f or routine use because of t he high incidence of nausea and 
vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain it caused. The most cost -effectiv e option 
appear ed to be carbet ocin, and t he committ ee not ed that carbet ocin w ould be consider ed 
cost eff ectiv e compar ed wit h oxytocin if a person w ould be willing t o trade 17 days in full

modest quality of t he evidence and small sample siz es of t he studies, t he committ ee did 
not t hink t he evidence was sufficient t o justify t he off -label use of carbet ocin f or the 
treatment of postpar tum haemorrhage and agr eed t o remove it fr om t he table. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat some of t he ut erotonics list ed in t he table w ould not be

Giving bir th is a lif e-changing e vent. The car e that a w oman r eceiv es during labour has t he 
potential t o aff ect her – bot h physically and emotionally , in the shor t and longer t erm – and 
the healt h of her bab y. Good communication, suppor t and compassion fr om staff , and 
having her wishes r espect ed, can help her f eel in contr ol of what is happening and 
contribut e to making bir th a positiv e experience f or the w oman and her bir th 
companion(s). 
This guideline co vers t he car e of w omen who go int o labour at t erm (37+0 to 41+6 weeks). 
About 600 ,000 w omen giv e bir th in England and W ales each y ear, of whom about 40% ar e 
having t heir first bab y. Most of t hese w omen ar e healt hy and ha ve a straightf orward 
pregnancy . Almost 90% of w omen will giv e bir th to a single bab y aft er 37 weeks of 
pregnancy , with the bab y presenting head-first. About tw o-thirds of w omen go int o labour 
spontaneously . Ther efore, most w omen giving bir th in England and W ales ar e covered by 
this guideline. 
Since t he original guideline was published in 2014 , the number of w omen giving bir th in 
England and W ales each y ear has decr eased, but t he rat e of int ervention (bir ths wit h 
forceps or v entouse and caesar ean bir th) has incr eased slight ly, and t here has been some 
reconfiguration of ser vices. In 2019 t o 2020 , 57% of bir ths w ere spontaneous v aginal 
births, 12% needed t he use of f orceps or v entouse and 31% of w omen had a caesar ean 
birth (including planned and unplanned). 
It is impor tant t hat t he w oman is giv en inf ormation and advice about all a vailable settings 
when she is deciding wher e to have her bab y, so t hat she is able t o mak e a fully inf ormed 
decision. This includes inf ormation about out comes f or the diff erent settings. It is also vital 
to recognise when transf er of car e from midwif ery-led car e to obst etric-led car e is 
indicat ed because of incr eased risk t o the w oman and/or her bab y resulting fr om 
complications t hat ha ve developed during labour . 
Uncer tainty and inconsist ency of car e has been identified in a number of ar eas, such as 
choosing place of bir th, car e during t he lat ent first stage of labour , fetal assessment and 
monit oring during labour (par ticularly car diotocograph y compar ed wit h intermitt ent
