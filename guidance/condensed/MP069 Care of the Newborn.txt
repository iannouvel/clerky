Care of the newborn guideline provides evidence-based guidance on care for midwives, maternity support staff, paediatricians, and neonatal staff. Immediate care after birth includes ensuring warmth, preventing heat loss, and promoting skin-to-skin contact. Routine postnatal care involves monitoring general wellbeing, feeding, and development, as well as conducting examinations and screenings. Parents should be informed about bathing, umbilical stump care, feeding, bonding, recognizing illness, safer sleeping, smoke-free environments, vitamin D supplements, and immunizations.

Public Health England advises parents to seek advice from a healthcare professional if they think their baby is unwell. In cases of meconium-stained liquor at birth, a neonatologist or advanced neonatal nurse practitioner should be called. Immediate actions differ based on the baby's condition, with specific guidelines for well babies, babies with significant meconium staining, and babies with hypothermia. Jaundice is common in newborns, with risk factors and guidelines for assessment and treatment outlined. Visual inspection for jaundice is important, and measurement of bilirubin levels is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management. Treatment threshold graphs can help determine the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion.

Care of the neonate receiving phototherapy includes monitoring serum bilirubin levels, stopping phototherapy once levels are stable or falling, and providing information to parents or carers. General care during phototherapy involves ensuring the infant is in a supine position, monitoring temperature, and supporting hydration and interaction with parents. Monitoring the infant during phototherapy includes encouraging short breaks, lactation support, and not giving additional fluids to well breastfed babies. Hypoglycaemia in newborns is defined by low blood glucose levels and can have serious complications if not managed promptly. Prevention and detection of hypoglycaemia involve assessing risk factors and monitoring blood glucose levels. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia include irritability, poor feeding, and seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed through blood glucose measurements, and management may involve glucose gel administration. Early and late neonatal infections are managed by assessing risk factors, monitoring observations, and conducting investigations. Antibiotic treatment is based on the type of infection and may involve cefotaxime or other antibiotics as needed.

Baby is unwell (review need for antibiotics every 24h). For 7 days if blood culture positive. For >7-10 days if blood culture positive and baby unwell. For 14 days if GBS meningitis present. For 21 days if Gram-negative meningitis present. Discuss with Microbiology Consultant as needed. Management of a newborn where there is known GBS present in either parent or newborn: Parents should be informed about GBS, the risks, available evidence, and recommendations for observations and treatment. Parents should be supported to make an informed decision about care and treatment for their baby. Observations should be documented in the neonatal observations tab on BadgerNet Maternity. If observations are abnormal or the baby shows clinical signs of being unwell, it should be immediately reviewed by a member of the neonatal team. Late preterm babies should be weighed on Day 3 to monitor and address excessive weight loss or dehydration. Late preterm babies that are sent home before they are ready have an increased risk of readmission to the hospital. Full and contemporaneous records of any preventative measures, detection/testing, and management should be documented on BadgerNet Maternity by the staff providing care.
