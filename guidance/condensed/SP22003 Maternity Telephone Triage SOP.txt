Maternity Telephone Triage Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) aims to provide essential guidance on telephone management of women/people in Maternity Services at UH Sussex SRH & WH. It ensures consistency in care delivery and supports staff in their roles. The guideline applies to midwives and medical staff in Maternity Services. The SOP provides an efficient service to meet local needs while promoting quality, safety, and patient satisfaction. Responsibilities include following the SOP, using professional judgment, and ensuring accessibility of the document. Staffing involves triaging calls using NetCall or diverting calls to the labor ward. Assessments are made at the point of referral to determine the care pathway. Documentation of telephone advice is recorded on MIS. Patients must be advised to come in on the third call unless there are no further concerns. Escalation pathways are in place for concerns raised by women/people regarding their care. Appendices include a telephone triage assessment card and pathways for different concerns.
