The Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service (SPMHS) is a community-based service for pregnant women and people with severe mental health difficulties during pregnancy and up to a year after birth. Referrals are recommended for those prescribed mood stabilizing or antipsychotic medication, with primary tocophobia, a history of severe mental illness, current symptoms of severe mental illness, or a family history of certain mental health conditions. Referrals can be made online or by contacting specific numbers based on location. 

The Healthy Futures Team in Brighton and Hove provides early intervention services for families facing disadvantage, including antenatal mothers under 18, those subject to child protection conferences, parents with a history of being looked after, refugees, asylum seekers, and migrant families. 

The Perinatal Bereavement Service supports individuals who have experienced stillbirth or neonatal loss within the last year. Factors important for maintaining maternal emotional wellbeing include skin-to-skin contact, prevention of separation from the family unit, regular pain assessment, good diet and rest, awareness of support services, and appropriate communication with healthcare professionals. 

High-risk women should be referred to the local specialist perinatal mental health service in early pregnancy, with a pre-birth planning meeting at 32 weeks. Inpatient and outpatient psychiatric emergency protocols are outlined, emphasizing the need for detailed documentation, communication, and safeguarding the needs of the baby. 

Tocophobia, a pathological dread of childbirth, is addressed with referrals for assessment and support services. Postnatal care should involve informing all teams of discharge, and the use of interpreters is recommended. Mental capacity assessments should be conducted when necessary, and medication decisions in pregnancy should consider risks and benefits. Referral pathways for medication reviews are provided, along with resources for information on drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Advice on medicines in pregnancy, assessing risk and informing the risk versus benefit decision, principles of prescribing in pregnancy, formulating advice on medicine use in pregnancy. Managing pre-existing and new conditions during pregnancy is important for maternal and fetal health. Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine have specific cautions in pregnancy. Carbamazepine should not be routinely prescribed due to the risk of neural tube defects. Lamotrigine is not routinely prescribed during pregnancy due to the risk of oral cleft. Lithium should be avoided, especially in the first trimester. Paroxetine is contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal heart defects. Sodium Valproate is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to the high risk of neural tube defects and intellectual development issues. Olanzapine and Quetiapine are associated with weight gain and gestational diabetes. Venlafaxine is not recommended but can be used in treatment-resistant patients with close blood pressure monitoring. In the SSRI referral pathway, discuss the risks of treating mental health conditions in pregnancy and the risk of relapse. Encourage the use of Sertraline, Citalopram, and Fluoxetine as preferred antidepressants for pregnancy. Provide information on sources of evidence for medication use in pregnancy. Useful contacts for perinatal mental health support are also provided. Audit suggestions include appropriate action for positive mental health assessments and timely interventions for mental health concerns during pregnancy.
