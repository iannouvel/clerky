Epilepsy in Pregnancy Management Guideline

Aim: To ensure optimal outcomes for pregnant women or birthing people and babies in pregnancies complicated by epilepsy and to act as a resource for staff caring for women and birthing people.

Scope: Applies to all medical, obstetric, and midwifery staff caring for pregnant women and birthing people with known epilepsy.

Responsibilities: All staff must access, read, understand, and apply this guidance. The division must ensure the guideline is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Introduction: Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder to complicate pregnancy, characterized by recurrent seizures. Treatment involves antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Risks: Pregnant women and birthing people with epilepsy face increased mortality. AED exposure in utero is associated with congenital malformations. AED concentrations often decrease during pregnancy, affecting seizure control.

Pre-pregnancy: Women and birthing people should be counseled pre-pregnancy on the risks of epilepsy and drug therapy. Folic Acid intake is recommended. Valproate use is discouraged unless risks are understood.

Antenatal Monitoring: Pregnant women and birthing people with epilepsy should be referred to a maternal medicine clinic early. Those seizure-free for at least 10 years may be considered low-risk. Regular assessments and ultrasound scans are recommended for those on AEDs.

Pregnant women with epilepsy should have regular follow-up and planning of delivery. Fetal growth scans should be offered from 28 weeks due to the risk of fetal growth restriction. AED levels should be monitored in women taking certain medications. Enzyme-inducing AEDs may require Vitamin K supplementation. Women with epilepsy have a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and labor. Seizure management in labor includes one-to-one midwifery care and continuous fetal monitoring for high-risk individuals. Post-birth, children born to women on enzyme-inducing AEDs should receive Vitamin K. Breastfeeding is generally safe for women with epilepsy, but Lamotrigine should not be initiated during breastfeeding. Contraception advice should be tailored to the type of AED being taken. Regular monitoring and audit of practice are recommended. Patient information leaflets and support groups are available for additional resources.
