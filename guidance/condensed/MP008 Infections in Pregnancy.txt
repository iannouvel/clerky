1.3 Genital herpes at time of delivery  
1.3.1 Caesarean section should be recommended to all women presenting with a first episode of genital herpes within 6 weeks of delivery. Invasive procedures should be avoided if opting for vaginal delivery. IV acyclovir should be given to the mother during labor. Neonatal team should be informed as the baby may also require acyclovir and testing.  

1.4 Recurrent genital herpes  
1.4.1 Inform neonatology team if patient has recurrent herpes at the time of labor. Vaginal delivery should be recommended in the absence of other indications for cesarean section. Invasive procedures should be avoided if active lesions are present.  

1.5 Pre-labor preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM) - primary infection  
1.5.1 Women with active lesions of a primary infection of genital herpes should benefit from cesarean section to reduce neonatal transmission. Intravenous aciclovir should be given during conservative management of PPROM.  

1.7 Postnatal HSV transmission  
1.7.1 Women should wash hands thoroughly before touching the baby and avoid kissing if they have cold sore lesions. Breastfeeding is encouraged unless there are lesions around the nipples.
