Executive summary
Management of women with undiagnosed vasa praevia at delivery
Emergency caesarean delivery and neonatal resuscitation, including the use of blood transfusion
if required, are essential in the management of ruptured vasa praevia diagnosed during labour.B
Placental pathological examination should be performed to con ﬁrm the diagnosis of vasa
praevia, in particular when stillbirth has occurred or where there has been acute fetalcompromise during delivery. [ New 2018 ]P
Can vasa praevia be diagnosed antenatally?
The performance of ultrasound in diagnosing vasa praevia at the time of the routine fetal
anomaly scan has a high diagnostic accuracy with a low false-positive rate. [ New 2018 ]B
A combination of both transabdominal and transvaginal colour Doppler imaging (CDI)
ultrasonography provides the best diagnostic accuracy for vasa praevia.D
Should we screen for vasa praevia?
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to support universal screening for vasa praevia at the time of the
routine midpregnancy fetal anomaly scan in the general population.D
Although targeted midpregnancy ultrasound screening of pregnancies at higher risk of vasapraevia may reduce perinatal loss, the balance of bene ﬁt versus harm remains undetermined
and further research in this area is required. [ New 2018 ]P

How should women with vasa praevia be managed?
Because of the speed at which fetal exsanguination can occur and the high perinatal mortality
rate associated with ruptured vasa praevia, delivery should not be delayed while trying to con ﬁrm
the diagnosis, particularly if there is evidence that fetal wellbeing is compromised. [ New 2018 ]P
In the presence of con ﬁrmed vasa praevia in the third trimester, elective caesarean section
should ideally be carried out prior to the onset of labour.P
A decision for prophylactic hospitalisation from 30 –32 weeks of gestation in women with
conﬁrmed vasa praevia should be individualised and based on a combination of factors,
including multiple pregnancy, antenatal bleeding and threatened premature labour. [ New 2018 ]P
In cases of vasa praevia that develop premature rupture of membranes and/or labour at viable
gestational ages, a caesarean section should be performed without delay.D
To avoid unnecessary anxiety, admissions, prematurity and caesarean section, it is essential toconﬁrm persistence of vasa praevia by ultrasound in the third trimester.P
At what gestation should elective delivery occur?
The ultimate management goal of con ﬁrmed vasa praevia should be to deliver before rupture
of membranes while minimising the impact of iatrogenic prematurity. Based on available data,planned caesarean delivery for a prenatal diagnosis of vasa praevia at 34 –36 weeks of
gestation is reasonable in asymptomatic women. [ New 2018 ]D
Administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be recommended from
32 weeks of gestation due to the increased risk of preterm delivery.P
1. Purpose and scope
The purpose of this guideline is to describe the diagnostic modalities and review the evidence-based approach to the
clinical management of pregnancies complicated by vasa praevia.
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
Vasa praevia occurs when the fetal vessels run through the free placental membranes. Unprotected by placental
tissue or Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord, a vasa praevia is likely to rupture in active labour, or whenamniotomy is performed to induce or augment labour, in particular when located near or over the cervix, under thefetal presenting part.
1,2Vasa praevia is classiﬁed as type I when the vessel is connected to a velamentous umbilical
cord, and type II when it connects the placenta with a succenturiate or accessory lobe.
Vasa praevia may be diagnosed during early labour by vaginal examination, detecting the pulsating fetal vessels inside
the internal os, or by the presence of dark-red vaginal bleeding and acute fetal compromise after spontaneous or

artiﬁcial rupture of the placental membranes. The fetal mortality rate in this situation is at least 60% despite urgent
caesarean delivery. However, improved survival rates of over 95% have been reported where the diagnosis has been
made antenatally by ultrasound followed by planned caesarean section.3
Vasa praevia is uncommon in the general population with a prevalence ranging between 1 in 1200 and 1 in 5000pregnancies, although the condition may have been under-reported.

3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and
PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT), systematic reviewsand meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published between May 2009 and July 2016 (the search forthe previous guideline was up to May 2009). A top-up literature search was performed in March 2018. Thedatabases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings, andthis was combined with a keyword search. Search words included, ‘vasa praevia’, ‘velamentous cord insertion’ and‘umbilical cord anomalies’. The search was restricted to humans and the English language. The National Library forHealth and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. In the absence of published evidence, these have
been annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix I.
4. Management of women with undiagnosed vasa praevia at delivery
Emergency caesarean delivery and neonatal resuscitation, including the use of blood transfusion
if required, are essential in the management of ruptured vasa praevia diagnosed during labour.B
Placental pathological examination should be performed to con ﬁrm the diagnosis of vasa
praevia, in particular when stillbirth has occurred or where there has been acute fetal
compromise during delivery. [ New 2018 ]P
The classic presentation of unexpected vasa praevia in labour is the presence of painless vaginal bleeding
(also known as Benckiser’s haemorrhage). This occurs mainly when the cervix is effaced and dilated, andthe membranes rupture spontaneously or are ruptured artiﬁcially.
2,3As the total fetal blood volume at
term is approximately 80 –100 ml/kg, the loss of what may appear as a relatively small amount of blood
can have major implications for the fetus and is rapidly fatal.3,7–10Evidence
level 4
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association among placental implantation abnormalities
(including placenta praevia, placenta accreta, vasa praevia, velamentous cord insertion) and pretermdelivery in singleton gestations has found a perinatal death rate random effect pooled risk ratio of 4.52(95% CI 2.77 –7.39) for vasa praevia.

5. Can vasa praevia be diagnosed antenatally?
The performance of ultrasound in diagnosing vasa praevia at the time of the routine fetal
anomaly scan has a high diagnostic accuracy with a low false-positive rate. [ New 2018 ]B
A combination of both transabdominal and transvaginal colour Doppler imaging (CDI)
ultrasonography provides the best diagnostic accuracy for vasa praevia.D
The previous version of this guideline concluded that in the absence of vaginal bleeding during the
antenatal period, there is no method to diagnose vasa praevia clinically. Vaginal bleeding in pregnancycould be considered as a possible alert symptom for vasa praevia,
11but this is likely to a have a very low
positive predictive value given the high prevalence of bleeding during pregnancy and low prevalence of
vasa praevia.12Various tests can differentiate between maternal and fetal blood but are often not timely in
a potentially life-threatening clinical situation.Evidence
level 4
The largest study to date on perinatal outcome is based on a cohort of 155 women with vasa praevia that
reported a 97% survival rate in cases of prenatal diagnosis compared with only 44% when the diagnosiswas made during delivery.
13
A prospective population-based cohort study using the Australasian Maternity Outcomes SurveillanceSystem (AMOSS) found that there were no perinatal deaths in the 58 cases diagnosed prenatally out ofthe 63 cases with conﬁrmed vasa praevia at birth.
14Evidence
level 2 +
Transvaginal CDI has improved the accuracy of greyscale imaging3,15in diagnosing vasa praevia by
demonstrating ﬂow and fetal vascular waveforms on pulsed Doppler through at least one aberrantvessel.
3,5Vasa praevia has been deﬁned as a vessel running in the free placental membranes within 2 cm
of the cervix.16,17The ultrasound deﬁnition of ‘within 2 cm from the internal cervical os’ was modelled
after the existing deﬁnitions for low-lying placentas18and will vary with gestational age; in particular during
the third trimester when the lower segment of the uterus forms. There is limited information regardingthe actual safe distance that a vasa praevia needs to be from the internal os to be conﬁdent that there isno risk for vessel rupture during labour and delivery. Overall, prenatal diagnosis is most effective aroundmidpregnancy (18 –24 weeks of gestation) but needs to be conﬁrmed during the third trimester
(30–32 weeks of gestation).

A systematic review, including two prospective and six retrospective cohort studies of which six had
poor methodology, found prenatal detection rates ranging between 53% (10/19) and 100% for a totalof 442 633 women, including 138 cases of vasa praevia.
15Four out of the eight studies used
transvaginal scanning (TVS) for primary assessment, while the remaining four studies usedtransabdominal ultrasound and only used TVS when vasa praevia was suspected on the transabdominal
scan. The results of two prospective studies including a total of 33 795 women reported that TVS
CDI performed during the second trimester detects all cases (n =11) of vasa praevia (sensitivity,
100%) with a speciﬁcity of 99.0 –99.8%.Evidence

A national UK study using the UK obstetric surveillance system of births between December 2014
and December 2015 found that only 25 out of 45 (56%) cases of vasa praevia were diagnosedantenatally.

The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) guideline based on the published
literature up to 2009 also indicates that using combined abdominal and transvaginal CDI results in a high
diagnostic accuracy with an extremely low false-positive rate.7However, the SOGC guideline19update
also highlighted that many cases are not diagnosed.Evidence

6. Should we screen for vasa praevia?
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to support universal screening for vasa praevia at the time of the
midpregnancy routine fetal anomaly scan in the general population.D
Although targeted midpregnancy ultrasound assessment of pregnancies at higher risk of vasapraevia has been investigated, the balance of bene ﬁt versus harm remains undetermined and
further research in this area is required. [ New 2018 ]P
The 2017 UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) external review of the 2013 screening policy
concluded that there appears to be little beneﬁt in attempting to identify cases of vasa praevia in thesecond trimester and that this strategy could be associated with a high false-positive rate.
12RCTs to
investigate whether ultrasound screening for vasa praevia decreases perinatal mortality would be ethicallyunacceptable in view of the poor neonatal prognosis. The analysis of the literature included in the 2017UK NSC external review of the 2013 screening policy indicates that up to 80% of vasa praevia cases haveone or more identiﬁable prenatal risk factors.
12There are no UK data on the epidemiology of
velamentous cord insertion and no studies on screening for vasa praevia have reported outcomes(beneﬁts and harms) from identifying velamentous cord insertion in the absence of vasa praevia. Overall,the UK NSC recommendation on screening for vasa praevia is that screening for velamentous cordinsertion as a means of identifying vasa praevia should not be implemented. In addition, due to the limitednumbers of prospective studies, it is not possible to evaluate the beneﬁts and harms of universal screeningover and above a more limited, or targeted, approach to identify vasa praevia in currently identiﬁed riskgroups, such as women with a low-lying placenta at the midpregnancy routine fetal anatomy ultrasoundexamination.Evidence
level 4
A 2016 systematic review of the incidence and risk factors of vasa praevia including 13 studies
(two prospective cohort studies, 10 retrospective cohort studies and one case –control study) and
reporting on 569 410 women found that 83% of the 325 cases reviewed had one or more risk factor,including placenta praevia, bilobed placenta, succenturiate placental lobes, conception by assistedreproductive technology and velamentous cord insertion.
20Evidence
level 2 ++
The 2017 prospective population-based cohort study using the AMOSS found that 55 of the 58 women
diagnosed prenatally had at least one risk factor for vasa praevia, with velamentous cord insertion (62%)and low-lying placenta (60%) the most prevalent.
14These data have also been conﬁrmed by recent
retrospective cohort studies.17,21,22Evidence

Vasa praevia diagnosed in the second trimester resolves in around 20% of cases before delivery.16,23A
follow-up ultrasound examination at 32 weeks of gestation is suggested, particularly in women with a low-
lying placenta as, even if it has resolved, it is still associated with a high risk of vasa praevia.8The
American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine has recommended that the placental cord insertion site bedocumented when technically possible.
24Identiﬁcation of the placental cord insertion at the routine fetal
anomaly scan is easy and accurate,3,8does not add signiﬁcantly to scan time and requires little additional
scanning skills for a trained operator.
A questionnaire survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists in England and Wales with a 55% response rate
found that most (80%) respondents felt that a selective screening policy for vasa praevia was not feasible,one-third could not name one risk factor associated with vasa praevia and over one-half had noexperience in diagnosing nor managing the condition.
25This survey highlights the need to increase
awareness of vasa praevia in healthcare professionals, and also the need to ensure skill validation andquality control across the board.
A decision-analytic model to estimate the lifetime incremental costs and beneﬁts of screening for vasa
praevia in all twin pregnancies was found to be cost effective in a study of approximately 132 000pregnancies.
26Using these data and based on an 80% detection rate, the 2014 UK NSC external review
found that the targeted screening of all twins and singleton pregnancies with at least one high-risk factorcould reduce the perinatal loss rate by as many as 150 cases per year.

Delivery by caesarean section of women with conﬁrmed vasa praevia is intuitive and logical, and not based on
RCTs.12
The objective of the management of vasa praevia diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy is
to prolong pregnancy safely while avoiding potential complications related to rupture of membranesbefore or during labour. Two other national societies have existing clinical guidelines on the managementof vasa praevia diagnosed during pregnancy,
7,8,19but the corresponding recommendations are also based
on observational data, decision analyses and expert opinion.
Antenatal hospitalisation in a unit with appropriate neonatal facilities has been proposed from
30–32 weeks of gestation, but the evidence is weak and of low quality.8The purpose of hospitalisation is
to allow for closer surveillance for signs of labour and a timelier performance of caesarean delivery beforelabour and/or before membrane rupture. The 2017 prospective population-based cohort study using theAMOSS found no difference in perinatal outcome when vasa praevia was diagnosed prenatally betweenwomen who were hospitalised compared to those with no antenatal hospitalisation.
14Overall, outpatient
care has been associated with excellent outcomes,3and thus, the beneﬁt of hospitalisation in
asymptomatic women remains unproven.
Data on the use of TVS cervical length measurements in the management of vasa praevia are limited and
the role of cervical cerclage is unknown.12Some authors have suggested that outpatient management is
possible if there is no evidence of cervical shortening on TVS and there are no symptoms of bleeding orpreterm uterine activity.
27Data from the follow-up of women with placenta praevia indicate that the
probability of bleeding is higher if the cervix is shorter in length than expected for gestational age.28–32Evidence
level 4
A 2018 retrospective case –control study of 29 singleton pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of vasa
praevia in the second trimester found that the rate of cervical length shortening was signiﬁcantly slowerfor women with elective compared with emergency caesarean delivery.
33For each additional
millimetre-per-week decrease in cervical length, the odds of emergency caesarean delivery increased by6.50 (95% CI 1.02 –41.20). Similarly, data from a 2017 systematic review on the management of vasa
praevia in twins have indicated that TVS cervical length measurements from 26 –28 weeks of gestation
may be useful to evaluate the individual risk of preterm birth.
34Evidence
level 2 +
Based on these observations, as well as a lower probability of labour, asymptomatic women with stable
cervical length measurements should be the best candidates for outpatient management.Evidence
level 4
8. At what gestation should elective delivery occur?
The ultimate management goal of con ﬁrmed vasa praevia should be to deliver before rupture
of membranes while minimising the impact of iatrogenic prematurity. Based on available data,planned caesarean delivery for a prenatal diagnosis of vasa praevia at 34 –36 weeks of
gestation is reasonable in asymptomatic women. [ New 2018 ]D

Administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be recommended from
32 weeks of gestation due to the increased risk of preterm delivery.P
Optimal timing of caesarean delivery remains unknown. There is no consensus about the timing of
delivery in cases of conﬁrmed vasa praevia and the currently low prevalence of prenatal diagnosis of thiscondition in the general population precludes any prospective trials to evaluate the ideal timing.
3,12
Overall, vasa praevia is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. The associated complications ofprematurity are in many cases the result of iatrogenic preterm birth in an effort to prevent stillbirth.Gestational age at delivery is the only other variable associated with perinatal outcomes in themanagement of vasa praevia. As for other obstetric situations associated with a higher risk for latepreterm delivery, the administration of corticosteroids is recommended.

In the largest cohort study published so far, fetuses that were diagnosed prenatally had a 97% survival rate
for a mean gestational age at delivery of 34.9 ( /C62.5) weeks of gestation.13Evidence
level 2 +
Data from a decision analysis study comparing 11 strategies for delivery timing in a woman with vasa
praevia found that delivery between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation balances the risk of premature ruptureof membranes, and subsequent fetal haemorrhage and death versus the risks of prematurity.
35The
authors found no beneﬁt to expectant management beyond 37 weeks of gestation and that at any givengestational age, incorporating amniocentesis for veriﬁcation of fetal lung maturity does not improveoutcomes.Evidence

9. Clinical governance
9.1 Debrieﬁng
Postnatal follow-up should include debrieﬁng with an explanation of what happened, why it happened and any
implications for future pregnancy.
9.2 Training
Raising awareness about the clinical risk factors of vasa praevia should be pursued locally, including organising policiesor guidelines for ﬂagging up women at risk and arranging for them to see a specialist consultant when suspected.
There should be appropriate training for ultrasound staff in the antenatal diagnosis of vasa praevia.
9.3 Clinical incident reporting
There should be written protocols for the identiﬁcation of and planning further care of women diagnosed with vasa
praevia.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in asimilar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
