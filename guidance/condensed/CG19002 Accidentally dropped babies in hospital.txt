Assessment and management of babies who are accidentally dropped in hospital

The aim of this guideline is to provide evidence-based guidance for maternity and neonatal services on the prevention and actions to take in the event of a baby being dropped. This guideline applies to all staff involved in the care of babies in maternity units and Special Care Baby Units within University Hospitals Sussex. Healthcare staff should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance, while management should ensure the guideline is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff. 

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's clinical guideline on head injury serves as a key reference source for this guidance, which includes information on managing a baby who is dropped while being cared for in a hospital setting. The prevention of falls is important, and factors predictive of a baby fall should be considered. Post-fall guidance includes checking the baby's stability, performing observations, informing the neonatal team, and documenting details of the fall. 

Ongoing responsibilities include informing the safeguarding midwife of the fall, conducting observations for at least 24 hours, and assessing any possible head injury. The neonatal team should promptly respond to concerns about altered neurological behavior and perform examinations as needed. If findings consistent with skull injury are present, immediate admission to the SCBU or pediatric ward is necessary.
