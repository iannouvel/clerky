Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually. Approximately 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage causing distress to women. There is an early pregnancy assessment clinic (EPAC) at St Richardsâ€™ and Worthing Hospitals for patients with pain and/or bleeding in early pregnancy up to 18 weeks.

Common symptoms of miscarriage include abdominal cramps, vaginal bleeding, and loss of pregnancy symptoms. Signs requiring urgent attention include significant pain, blood loss, and shock.

Ultrasound scans are offered to women between 6-12 weeks gestation with a positive pregnancy test. The scan process includes confirming patient details, obtaining consent, and reporting findings.

This guideline provides evidence-based guidance on the management of miscarriage.

- Assess sacs and mean sac diameter(s)  
- Position or site of the sac within the uterus  
- Presence of any haematoma and size  
- Presence/absence of a yolk sac and mean sac diameter  
- Presence/absence of an embryo and Crown Rump Length  
- Presence or absence of heart movement in the embryo  
- Presence of the pregnancy in the uterine cavity  
- Adnexa assessment for masses, tenderness, vascularity, and relation to other pelvic organs  
- Identification and documentation of ovaries, shape, size, morphology, and corpus luteum  
- Presence of free fluid and measurement  
- Use BMUS charts for dating by CRL and gestational sac diameter  
- General principles for all early pregnancy scanning  
- Transvaginal probe cleaning and disinfection  
- Seeking advice if findings are equivocal  
- Providing clear conclusions in scan reports  
- Diagnosis and classification of miscarriage on USS  
- Management of miscarriage options  
- Threatened miscarriage advice  
- Incomplete miscarriage management  
- Complete miscarriage diagnosis  
- Pregnancy testing post miscarriage  
- Expectant management of miscarriage  
- Risks of expectant management of miscarriage

Outpatient medical management should be offered for miscarriages less than or equal to 9 weeks gestation as measured on the ultrasound. This is successful in 85 out of 100 women and avoids an anaesthetic. The misoprostol can be administered vaginally at home 36-48 hours after taking Mifepristone. Women must have support at home during this treatment. If the miscarriage has not occurred after 48-72 hours, a repeat dose of misoprostol might be required. Offer women the opportunity to return with any products passed at home for sensitive disposal of fetal remains. Each woman needs to be assessed on an individual basis to determine the suitability of managing the miscarriage at home. Provide verbal and written information to ensure clear understanding of the process and potential side effects. After treatment, perform a urine pregnancy test 3-4 weeks later unless there are worsening symptoms. If the test is positive, arrange for further evaluation. The risks of medical management include infection, haemorrhage requiring transfusion, and retained products of conception requiring surgical intervention. Contraindications to medical management include certain medical conditions.
