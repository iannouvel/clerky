Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage
This is the second edition of this guideline, which was published in 2009 under the same title. The 2009 guideline
was based on an earlier guideline on the management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) developed in 1998 underthe auspices of the Scottish Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) andupdated in 2002.

Executive summary of recommendations
Prediction and prevention of PPH
What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised?
Risk factors
Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modi ﬁed as
and when risk factors arise. /check
Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account whencounselling women about place of delivery./check
Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a bloodbank on site.D
Minimising risk –treating antenatal anaemia
Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the
morbidity associated with PPH. [ New 2016 ]D
Minimising risk –reducing blood loss at delivery
Uterine massage is of no bene ﬁt in the prophylaxis of PPH. [ New 2016 ]A
Prophylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of
labour in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH.A

For women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally, oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscular
injection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose ofoxytocin is unlikely to be bene ﬁcial.A
For women delivering by caesarean section, oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should
be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss.B
Ergometrine –oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk
of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500 –1000 ml).C
For women at increased risk of haemorrhage, it is possible that a combination of preventative
measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. [ New 2016 ] /check
Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5 –1.0 g), in addition to oxytocin,
at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. [ New 2016 ]A
How should PPH be managed?
Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage
Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and
that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH. [ New 2016 ]C
Communication and multidisciplinary care
Communication with the woman
Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important, and clear information of
what is happening should be given from the outset. [ New 2016 ] /check
Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH?
Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH. [ New 2016 ]/check
The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when
women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500 –1000 ml) without clinical shock. /check
A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to
women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. /check

Resuscitation
Measures for minor PPH
Measures for minor PPH (blood loss 500 –1000 ml) without clinical shock:/check
/C15intravenous access (one 14-gauge cannula)
/C15urgent venepuncture (20 ml) for:
–group and screen
–full blood count
–coagulation screen, including ﬁbrinogen
/C15pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure recording every 15 minutes
/C15commence warmed crystalloid infusion.
Measures for major PPH
Full protocol for major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and continuing to bleed or
clinical shock (see Appendix III):
/C15A and B –assess airway and breathing
/C15C–evaluate circulation
/C15position the patient ﬂat
/C15keep the woman warm using appropriate available measures
/C15transfuse blood as soon as possible, if clinically required
/C15until blood is available, infuse up to 3.5 l of warmed clear ﬂuids, initially 2 l of warmed
isotonic crystalloid. Further ﬂuid resuscitation can continue with additional isotonic
crystalloid or colloid (succinylated gelatin). Hydroxyethyl starch should not be used.
/C15the best equipment available should be used to achieve rapid warmed infusion of ﬂuids
/C15special blood ﬁlters should not be used, as they slow infusions.
Blood transfusion
There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood
transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. [ New 2016 ] /check
Selection of red cell units for transfusion
Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with
immediate issue of group O, rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units, with a switch to
group-speci ﬁc blood as soon as feasible. [ New 2016 ]D
If clinically signi ﬁcant red cell antibodies are present, close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is
essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage. [ New 2016 ]D/check

All delivery units, especially small units without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supply
of group O, RhD-negative blood. [ New 2016 ] /check
Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with
caesarean section and with vaginal delivery. [ New 2016 ]D
Blood components
Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing, then, after 4 units of red
blood cells, FFP should be infused at a dose of 12 –15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are
known. [ New 2016 ]D
If no haemostatic tests are available, early FFP should be considered for conditions with a
suspected coagulopathy, such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism, or where
detection of PPH has been delayed. [ New 2016 ]/check
If prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time is more than 1.5 times normal and
haemorrhage is ongoing, volumes of FFP in excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed tocorrect coagulopathy. [ New 2016 ]D
Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need
for them is anticipated, as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need forthawing. [ New 2016 ]/check
Fibrinogen
A plasma ﬁbrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH.
[New 2016 ]C
Cryoprecipitate should be used for ﬁbrinogen replacement. [ New 2016 ]D
Transfusion of platelets
During PPH, platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3109/l
based on laboratory monitoring. [ New 2016 ]D
Is there a role for antiﬁbrinolytic drugs?
Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.

Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy?
The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part
of a clinical trial. [ New 2016 ] /check
Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and how should women be
monitored?
Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml)
and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock:
/C15immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for:
–cross-match (4 units minimum)
–full blood count

Appendix IV)
/C15acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed
/C15documentation of ﬂuid balance, blood, blood products and procedures.
What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH?
The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial
role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and, if necessary, in determining and administeringthe most appropriate method of anaesthesia. [ New 2016 ]D
What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding?
Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological, mechanical and surgical
methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor. [ New 2016 ]D
What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used?
When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding, then a sequence of mechanical
and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. /checkD

What surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding?
If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, surgical interventions should be
initiated sooner rather than later.D
Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical ’intervention for most
women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage.C
Conservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line, depending on clinicalcircumstances and available expertise.C
It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre./check
Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta oruterine rupture) .C
Ideally and when feasible, a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for
hysterectomy. /check
How should secondary PPH be managed?
In women presenting with secondary PPH, an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be
performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapyshould be initiated when endometritis is suspected. [ New 2016 ]D
A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception,
although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable. [ New 2016 ]C
Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an
experienced clinician.D
Risk management
Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of PPH?
Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH.[New 2016 ]/check
All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric
emergencies, including the management of PPH.B
Training for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals. [ New 2016 ]B
All cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of a
formal clinical incident review.D

Documentation
Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential./check
Debrieﬁng
An opportunity to discuss the events surrounding the obstetric haemorrhage should be offered
to the woman (possibly with her birthing partner/s) at a mutually convenient time. /check
1. Purpose and scope
Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the most common form of major obstetric haemorrhage. The traditional
deﬁnition of primary PPH is the loss of 500 ml or more of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birthof a baby.
2PPH can be minor (500 –1000 ml) or major (more than 1000 ml). Major can be further subdivided into
moderate (1001 –2000 ml) and severe (more than 2000 ml). In women with lower body mass (e.g. less than 60 kg), a
lower level of blood loss may be clinically signiﬁcant.3The recommendations in this guideline apply to women
experiencing a primary PPH of 500 ml or more.
Secondary PPH is deﬁned as abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks
postnatally.4This guideline also includes recommendations speciﬁc to the management of secondary PPH.
Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH;
this guideline does not include speciﬁc recommendations for the management of such situations or for managinghaemorrhage in women who refuse blood transfusion. Guidance on these topics is available from other sources.
5–8
This guideline has been developed primarily for clinicians working in consultant-led obstetric units in the UK;
recommendations may be less appropriate for other settings where facilities, resources and routine practices differ.There is increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units.
9Obstetricians and
midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community,including PPH. This is beyond the scope of this guideline.
10
This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH; the management of antepartum haemorrhage is thesubject of the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 63.
11The prevention and management of PPH related to placenta
praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in Green-top Guideline No. 27,12while Green-top Guideline No. 4713
provides guidance on the appropriate use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice.
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
Obstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and developingcountries. The 2011 –13 Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report
3identiﬁed 13 direct deaths
due to obstetric haemorrhage in the UK and Ireland; the report places obstetric haemorrhage as the second leadingcause of direct maternal deaths. The recommendations from the report focus on basic clinical skills, with promptrecognition of the severity of a haemorrhage and emphasise communication and teamwork in the management ofthese cases. A systematic review
14suggests that there may be regional variation in the prevalence of PPH.
Standardisation of the measurement of PPH is recommended so that data from different regions are comparable.15

3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines.
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevantrandomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles publishedbetween 2007 and September 2015. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)terms, including all subheadings, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included ‘postpartumh(a)emorrhage’, ‘factor VII’, ‘Syntocinon’, ‘carbetocin’, ‘carboprost’, ‘oxytocics’, ‘uterotonics’, ‘B-lynch suture’, ‘uterineartery embolism’, ‘bilateral internal iliac ligation’, ‘balloon, Rusch’, ‘Sengstaken catheters’, ‘thromboelastography’,‘thromboelastometry’, ‘ﬁbrinogen concentrate’, ‘point of care testing’ and the search limited to humans and the Englishlanguage. The National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevantguidelines and reviews. Guidelines and recommendations produced by organisations such as the British Committee forStandards in Haematology Transfusion Taskforce and national bodies were considered.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence and the areas where evidence is lacking are
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix I.
4. Prediction and prevention of PPH
4.1 What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised?
4.1.1 Risk factors
Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modi ﬁed as
and when risk factors arise. /check
Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account whencounselling women about place of delivery./check
Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a bloodbank on site.D
A number of case –control studies have identiﬁed antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for PPH (see
Appendix II),16–26although most cases of PPH have no identiﬁable risk factors.27These risk factors have
been summarised in a 2010 review.28Despite methodological limitations, these studies provide a guide to
levels of risk, which can help clinicians in their discussions with women about setting for delivery (Table 1).The Conﬁdential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health
29has recommended that women with known risk
factors for PPH should not be delivered in a hospital without a blood bank on site.
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has published a guideline on the prevention
and management of PPH.30This summarises the causes of PPH as related to abnormalities of one or more
of four basic processes –‘the four Ts’: tone, trauma, tissue and thrombin. The most common cause of
PPH is uterine atony.27Evidence

4.1.2 Minimising risk –treating antenatal anaemia
Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the
morbidity associated with PPH.D
Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)32recommend that pregnant
women should be offered screening for anaemia. The British Committee for Standards in Haematology33
has produced guidelines on the investigation and management of anaemia in pregnancy. Haemoglobin (Hb)levels outside the normal UK range for pregnancy (110 g/l at ﬁrst contact and 105 g/l at 28 weeks) shouldbe investigated and iron supplementation considered if indicated. It is recommended that parenteral irontherapy should be considered antenatally for women with iron deﬁciency anaemia who do not respond tooral iron.

A population-based study34has indicated an association between antenatal anaemia (Hb less than 90 g/l)
and greater blood loss at delivery and postpartum.Evidence

Prophylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of

For women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally, oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscularinjection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose ofoxytocin is unlikely to be bene ﬁcial.A

Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5 –1.0 g), in addition to
oxytocin, at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH.A
Uterine massage
A Cochrane review35analysed the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth, and before or after delivery
of the placenta, or both, to prevent PPH. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and thereview found no signiﬁcant difference between groups.Evidence
level 1+
Management of the third stage of labour
Various Cochrane reviews have addressed prophylaxis in the third stage of labour for women deliveringvaginally.
35–38These have established that both active management and the use of prophylactic uterotonics
in the third stage of labour reduce the risk of PPH. Active management of the third stage of labourinvolves the use of interventions (including the use of uterotonics, early clamping of the umbilical cord andcontrolled cord traction) to expedite delivery of the placenta with the aim of reducing blood loss. Inexpectant management, signs of placental separation are awaited and the placenta is deliveredspontaneously. A Cochrane systematic review
39found that, for women at mixed levels of risk of bleeding,
active management showed a reduction in the average risk of maternal primary haemorrhage at time ofbirth (more than 1000 ml; average risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 –0.87) and maternal Hb less than 90 g/l
following birth (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 –0.83).Evidence

However, active management results in a lower birthweight, reﬂecting a lower blood volume from early
cord clamping.39A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials40found that delaying clamping
for at least 2 minutes is beneﬁcial to the newborn and that the beneﬁts extend into infancy. Therefore,active management of the third stage that includes routine early clamping of the umbilical cord can nolonger be recommended. A detailed consideration of the literature relating to the timing of cord clampingcan be found in RCOG Scientiﬁc Impact Paper No. 14.
41Guidance from NICE9recommends that the
umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than 1 minute from delivery of the baby if there are noconcerns over cord integrity or the baby’s wellbeing.Evidence

Oxytocin and ergometrine –oxytocin
McDonald and colleagues’ meta-analysis36addressed prophylactic ergometrine –oxytocin versus oxytocin for the
third stage of labour. This review indicated that ergometrine –oxytocin (Syntometrine/C226, Alliance, Chippenham,
Wiltshire, UK), oxytocin 5 iu and oxytocin 10 iu have similar efﬁcacy in preventing PPH in excess of 1000 ml.Using the deﬁnition of PPH as blood loss of at least 500 ml, ergometrine –oxytocin was associated with a small
reduction in the risk of PPH (Syntometrine
/C226versus oxytocin any dose; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 –0.95).
There were major differences between ergometrine –oxytocin and oxytocin alone in the adverse effects of
nausea and vomiting, and elevation of blood pressure, with ergometrine –oxytocin carrying a ﬁve-fold increased
risk (OR 4.92, 95% CI 4.03 –6.00). Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of minor PPH needs to be
weighed against the adverse effects associated with the use of ergometrine –oxytocin.Evidence
level 1++
An RCT,42using a primary outcome of any treatment of uterine atony or haemorrhage, assessed whether or
not a higher dose of oxytocin after vaginal delivery was more effective than a low-dose regimen in preventingPPH after a vaginal delivery. Compared with 10 iu, administering 40 iu or 80 iu of prophylactic oxytocin didnot reduce overall PPH treatment when given in 500 ml over 1 hour for vaginal delivery. Evidence

Prostaglandins
The use of prostaglandins for the prevention of PPH has been the subject of two Cochrane reviews.37,38
Neither intramuscular prostaglandins (such as carboprost, a 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2aanalogue) nor
misoprostol (a prostaglandin E 1analogue given orally or sublingually) were preferable to conventional
injectable uterotonics (oxytocin and/or ergometrine) for routine prophylaxis.37Furthermore, another
systematic review43concluded that oxytocin is superior to misoprostol in the prevention of PPH.Evidence
level 1++
Appraisal of the evidence from both the Cochrane reviews, together with consideration of standard practice
in the UK, suggests that, for women delivering vaginally, oxytocin 10 iu by intramuscular injection is theregimen of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. Intramuscular oxytocin should be administeredwith the birth of the anterior shoulder, or immediately after the birth of the baby and before the cord isclamped and cut. This strategy has been endorsed in the NICE intrapartum care guideline.

Carbetocin
A Cochrane review44has addressed the use of a longer-acting oxytocin derivative, carbetocin, in the
prevention of PPH. Carbetocin is licensed in the UK speciﬁcally for the indication of prevention of PPH inthe context of caesarean delivery. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in theneed for further uterotonics compared with oxytocin for those undergoing a caesarean, but not for vaginaldelivery. However, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin interms of risk of PPH.

Guidelines from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada30recommend that carbetocin
(100 micrograms given as an intravenous bolus over 1 minute) should be used for the prevention of PPH inelective caesarean deliveries. Randomised trials

ergometrine –oxytocin, misoprostol, carbetocin and 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2a) for prophylaxis in women
delivering by caesarean section. Appraisal of the evidence from these trials, together with consideration ofstandard practice in the UK, led the development group for the NICE caesarean section guideline

Tranexamic acid
The use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH in women considered to be at low risk of PPH wasaddressed in a Cochrane review.
52This found that blood loss greater than 400 or 500 ml was less
common in women who received tranexamic acid in addition to the usual uterotonic agent after vaginalbirth or caesarean section in a dosage of 1 or 0.5 g intravenously. Tranexamic acid was effective indecreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 ml in women who had undergone caesareansection (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 –0.78; four studies; 1534 women), but not vaginal birth. Mean blood loss
until 2 hours postpartum was lower in the group of women who received intravenous tranexamic acidpostpartum (mean difference /C077.79 ml; 95% CI /C097.95 to /C057.64; ﬁve studies; 1186 women). The
authors of the Cochrane review on the use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH conclude thatfurther studies are required to investigate the risk of serious adverse effects, including thromboembolicevents, and the use of tranexamic acid in women considered to be at high risk of PPH (see section 5.3.6).

5. How should PPH be managed?
5.1 Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage
Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and
that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH.C
As visual estimation often underestimates blood loss,53,54more accurate methods may be used, such as
blood collection drapes for vaginal deliveries55and the weighing of swabs.56However, a study57comparing
visual estimation of blood loss with the use of a collector bag after vaginal delivery concluded that thelatter did not signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of severe PPH. Participating in clinical reconstructions mayencourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of PPH.
58Written and pictorial guidelines may help staff
working in labour wards to estimate blood loss.59Evidence
level 2+
Clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolaemia should be included in the assessment of PPH. However,
clinicians should be aware that the physiological increase in circulating blood volume during pregnancymeans that the signs of hypovolaemic shock become less sensitive in pregnancy.
60In pregnancy, pulse and
blood pressure are usually maintained in the normal range until blood loss exceeds 1000 ml; tachycardia,tachypnoea and a slight recordable fall in systolic blood pressure occur with blood loss of 1000 –1500 ml.
A systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg, associated with worsening tachycardia, tachypnoea and alteredmental state, usually indicates a PPH in excess of 1500 ml.

In nonpregnant patients, the shock index, calculated from the heart rate/systolic blood pressure, has been

5.2 Communication and multidisciplinary care
5.2.1 Communication with the woman
Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important, and clear information of
what is happening should be given from the outset. /check
PPH often occurs unexpectedly and can be very stressful for the woman and her partner or birth attendants; it is
crucial that, where feasible, they are kept informed and reassured, if appropriate, of the clinical development andproposed management.
5.2.2 Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH?
Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH./check
The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when
women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500 –1000 ml) without clinical shock. /check
A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to
women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. /check
Early involvement of appropriate senior staff (including the anaesthetic team and laboratory specialists) is fundamental
to the management of PPH. In minor PPH, the ﬁrst-line staff should be alerted and in major PPH, the followingmembers of staff should be called and summoned to attend:
/C15an experienced midwife (in addition to the midwife in charge)
/C15the obstetric middle grade
/C15the anaesthetic middle grade
/C15the on-call clinical haematologist with experience in major haemorrhage
/C15porters for delivery of specimens/blood.
Furthermore, the consultant obstetrician and consultant anaesthetist should be alerted, and the blood transfusion
laboratory should be informed. One member of the team should be assigned the task of recording events, ﬂuids,drugs, blood and components transfused, and vital signs.

Clinicians and blood transfusion staff should liaise at a local level to agree:
/C15a standard form of words (such as ‘we need compatible blood now’ or ‘group-speciﬁc blood’) to be used in
cases of major obstetric haemorrhage
/C15a timescale in which to deliver various blood components.
The use of the term ‘controlled major obstetric haemorrhage’ or ‘ongoing major obstetric haemorrhage’ may be
used to deﬁne the urgency to the team.
Senior obstetric staff must be receptive to concerns expressed by less experienced or junior medical
practitioners, and by midwives. The RCOG recommends that the consultant obstetrician should attend inperson when there is a PPH of more than 1500 ml where the haemorrhage is continuing.

A high concentration of oxygen (10 –15 l/min) via a facemask should be administered, regardless of maternal oxygen
concentration. If the airway is compromised owing to impaired conscious level, anaesthetic assistance should be
sought urgently. Usually, level of consciousness and airway control improve rapidly once the circulating volume isrestored.
Establish two, 14-gauge intravenous lines; a 20 ml blood sample should be taken and sent for diagnostic tests,
including full blood count, coagulation screen, urea and electrolytes, and to cross-match packed red cells (4 units).The urgency and measures undertaken to resuscitate and arrest haemorrhage need to be tailored to the degree of
shock (Table 2).
The cornerstones of resuscitation during PPH are restoration of both blood volume and oxygen-carrying
capacity. Volume replacement must be undertaken on the basis that blood loss is oftenunderestimated.

loss should be transfused as soon as available, if necessary. The clinical picture should be the maindeterminant of the need for blood transfusion and time should not be unnecessarily spent awaitinglaboratory results.

5.3.3 Fluid replacement
Fluid replacement is a crucial component of PPH treatment, although a dilutional coagulopathy may occur
when large volumes of crystalloid, colloid or red cells are used with insufﬁcient transfusion of fresh frozenplasma (FFP) and platelets. Traditionally, a total volume of 3.5 l of clear ﬂuids (up to 2 l of warmed isotoniccrystalloid as rapidly as possible, followed by up to a further 1.5 l of warmed colloid if blood is still notavailable) comprises the maximum that should be infused while awaiting compatible packed red cells.
1While
there is controversy as to the most appropriate ﬂuids for volume resuscitation,68–70the nature of ﬂuid
infused is of less importance than rapid administration and warming of the infusion.71The woman needs to be
kept warm using appropriate measures to prevent hypothermia which in turn could exacerbate acidosis.72Evidence
level 4
There have been no RCTs comparing the use of colloids with other replacement ﬂuids for the
resuscitation of women with PPH. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO)73
recommend that intravenous ﬂuid replacement for PPH should be with isotonic crystalloids inpreference to colloids. A Cochrane review
74compared colloids with crystalloids for ﬂuid resuscitation in
critically ill, nonpregnant patients (patients with burns, trauma or following surgery). This reviewconcluded that resuscitation with colloids was not associated with an improvement in survival and thatthe use of one particular colloid, hydroxyethyl starch, might increase mortality.Evidence

There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood

The use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice is addressed in the RCOG Green-top
Guideline No. 47.13There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion75,76and the decision to
provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. While bloodtransfusion is almost always required when the Hb is less than 60 g/l and rarely required when the Hbis more than 100 g/l, patients with acute haemorrhage can have normal Hb and clinical evaluation in thissituation is, therefore, extremely important. Between 2009 and 2012,
3there were at least three
maternal deaths where an acute point of care Hb measurement result is thought to have falsely
reassured staff. Furthermore, the Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting scheme has highlighted therisk of errors in using near patient testing of Hb measurements to guide transfusion.
77While single Hb/
haematocrit estimations may be misleading and can lead to delays in initiating red cell transfusion, serialmeasurements may be helpful to monitor ongoing progress. Guidelines from the European Society ofAnaesthesiology
78recommend that repeated measurements of serum lactate and base deﬁcit, together with
haematocrit/Hb, are made during haemorrhage and resuscitation to assess tissue perfusion and oxygenation;however, it has not yet been shown whether the outcome of severe bleeding can be improved if volumeresuscitation is guided by serum lactate concentration and base deﬁcit.Evidence

Selection of red cell units for transfusion.
Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with
immediate issue of group O, rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units, with a switch togroup-speci ﬁc blood as soon as feasible.D
If clinically signi ﬁcant red cell antibodies are present, close liaison with the transfusion
laboratory is essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.D
All delivery units, especially small units without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supplyof group O, RhD-negative blood./check
Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated withcaesarean section and with vaginal delivery.D
Pregnant women (and women of childbearing age) who are RhD negative must only receive RhD-negative
blood to avoid the risk of D alloimmunisation.79Previous blood transfusion is an important cause of
alloimmunisation, with antibodies other than anti-D, in particular anti-K, causing severe haemolytic diseaseof the fetus and newborn .
80Accordingly, unless a woman is known to be K positive, only K-negative blood
should be used for transfusion in women of childbearing age.79The aim of antibody screening is to
determine the presence of red cell antibodies of likely clinical signiﬁcance. In addition to the risk ofhaemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn,
80these red cell antibodies may have implications for the
selection of blood for transfusion in the mother owing to the risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions, andthe laboratory should select red cell units negative for the relevant antigen for cross-matching. Closeliaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential, with input if needed from the clinical haematology teamand specialist advice from the national blood service.Evidence
level 4
All delivery units, especially small units without a blood bank on site, should maintain a supply of group O, RhD-
negative blood, as this might offer the only means of restoring oxygen-carrying capacity within an acceptabletimescale. The minimum number of units of group O, RhD-negative, K-negative blood to be maintained on siteshould be agreed within local protocols and should reﬂect the likely period of delay in the arrival of further suppliesshould an emergency arise; small delivery units remote from the nearest blood bank will require a larger minimumsupply than those a short distance from a blood bank.
Cross-matching versus electronic issue of blood
The principles of blood grouping, antibody testing and selection of blood in pregnancy are addressed in the RCOGGreen-top Guideline No. 47.
13
The majority of laboratories in the UK now use automated testing for blood grouping and antibody testingwith advanced information technology systems for documentation and reporting of results. The hospitaltransfusion laboratory can readily provide red cells that are ABO and RhD compatible using electronic issue
with no cross-matching needed, provided that the patient does not have any antibodies and there are robust
automated systems in place for antibody testing and identiﬁcation of the patient.
79In this setting, since blood
can be readily issued, there is no need to reserve units for individual cases. Where electronic issue is notavailable, a locally agreed maximum surgical blood ordering schedule should be used to decide how many redcell units should be reserved and available for particular cases, based on the obstetric diagnosis. In unforeseenhaemorrhage, group O, RhD-negative and K-negative units must be immediately available for emergency use,with a switch to group-speciﬁc blood as soon as feasible.Evidence

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status
In elective transfusion in the antenatal period, CMV-seronegative products should be used to avoid
transmission of CMV to the fetus, although, the UK policy of universal leucocyte depletion substantiallyreduces the risk of CMV transmission.

components should be given to avoid delay, and CMV-negative blood or platelets are not needed fortransfusion during delivery or in the postpartum period.

Intraoperative cell salvage
Intraoperative cell salvage (the process whereby blood shed during an operation is collected, ﬁlteredand washed to produce autologous red blood cells [RBCs] for transfusion to the patient) is commonlybeing used in cardiac, orthopaedic and vascular surgery with a relative reduction of blood transfusionof 38% and an absolute risk reduction of 21%. Cell salvage does not appear to impact adversely onclinical outcomes.
83,84Several bodies have endorsed cell salvage in obstetric practice, including NICE,85
the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE)10and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great
Britain and Ireland.86It has been proposed that cell salvage should be considered for emergency use
in PPH associated with both caesarean section and vaginal delivery.87Although large prospective trials
of cell salvage with autotransfusion in obstetrics are lacking to date, no single serious complicationleading to poor maternal outcome has been directly attributed to its use. A large RCT is currently inprogress comparing intraoperative cell salvage with donor blood transfusions (standard care) duringcaesarean section in women at risk of haemorrhage (SALVO study, UKCRN ID14032).

5.3.5 Blood components
There are limited data to inform best clinical practice for the management of haemostatic impairment during PPH,
but the principle of management is to prevent and treat haemostatic abnormalities during bleeding, but not tocorrect abnormalities in nonbleeding women. It is not known whether haemostasis should be corrected to normalityfor pregnant or nonpregnant women.
Methods to assess haemostatic impairment during PPH include clinical observation, laboratory-based tests
(PT, APTT, Clauss ﬁbrinogen and platelet count) and point of care testing.
89Studies in patients following
surgery show that laboratory or point of care testing leads to appropriate use of blood components90and
both may be used simultaneously. Coagulopathies may evolve rapidly and repeated testing (such as every30 minutes) during continued bleeding and observation of trends are more useful than single measurements.
Evidence
level 3Routine coagulation tests are widely available and have well-regulated quality control.89,91They include PT,
APTT, Clauss ﬁbrinogen assay and platelet count. However, turnaround times are often too slow to beclinically useful in acute and rapidly evolving bleeds, and inevitably reﬂect the past haemostatic status of thewoman. Clauss ﬁbrinogen should always be measured as part of the routine coagulation screen because itfalls early and may be reduced to a clinically signiﬁcant level despite a normal PT/APTT.
89,91,92Platelet
number should be measured as part of the full blood count.

Point of care testing using viscoelastometry, such as thromboelastography (TEG/C226, Haemonetics, Braintree,
Massachusetts, USA) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM/C226, Tem, Munich, Germany), combined
with an agreed treatment algorithm, has been associated with decreased blood loss and blood product use,both outside and within the obstetric setting.
89,93,94The main advantage is that results are known sooner
than for laboratory tests. Point of care testing using TEG/C226and ROTEM/C226has been recommended by the
Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.95However,
NICE has concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the routine adoption ofviscoelastometric point of care testing in the management of PPH.

Transfusion of FFP
If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing, then, after 4 units of RBCs,
FFP should be infused at a dose of 12 –15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are known.D
If no haemostatic tests are available, early FFP should be considered for conditions with a
suspected coagulopathy, such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism, or where
detection of PPH has been delayed./check
If PT/APTT is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing, volumes of FFP inexcess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to correct coagulopathy.D
Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a needfor them is anticipated, as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need forthawing./check
Formulaic protocols, such as 1:1 or 6:4 RBC:FFP, based on data derived from traumatic bleeding, have
been advocated for the management of major haemorrhage.69,71However, there is no evidence that this
improves outcomes in PPH. The drawbacks of early FFP are that the majority of women with PPH willhave normal coagulation at the time of administration,
97–99and that it is associated with an increased risk
of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)100and transfusion-related acute lung injury.101FFP
results in relatively small increments in ﬁbrinogen level, and to increase the level rapidly, cryoprecipitate orﬁbrinogen concentrate are required.
102
There are limited data on the utility of laboratory and point of care coagulation tests to guide FFPreplacement during PPH. Abnormal PT/APTT suggests progression towards signiﬁcant haemostaticimpairment, while PT/APTT greater than 1.5 times normal demonstrate that severe and establishedhaemostatic impairment has occurred.
67,68,103
If the PPH has stopped, no FFP is required. If haemorrhage is ongoing and the last PT/APTT results areavailable and are prolonged, 12 –15 ml/kg of FFP should be requested and infused with the aim of
maintaining the PT/APTT at less than 1.5 times normal.
68If the PT/APTT is greater than 1.5 times normal,
a larger volume of FFP is likely to be required to correct these parameters,104and this may be associated
with an increased risk of TACO. If the PT/APTT are normal, then no FFP is required, although repeatedtesting should be performed if bleeding persists.Evidence

haemostasis during ongoing PPH.97,98,109 –111Fibrinogen below 3 g/l and especially below 2 g/l is associated
with progression of bleeding, increased RBC and blood component requirements, and the need forinvasive procedures.

A double-blind RCT112has shown that pre-emptive infusion of 2 g ﬁbrinogen concentrate in women with
500–1000 ml PPH has no beneﬁt; however, the ﬁbrinogen level at the time of randomisation was greater
than 4 g/l in most women.Evidence
level 1
The appropriate ﬁbrinogen intervention trigger or target level is unknown. A pragmatic view based on available
evidence is that, during continuing PPH, cryoprecipitate or ﬁbrinogen concentrate should be used to maintain aﬁbrinogen level of at least 2 g/l, even if PT/APTT are normal. Fibrinogen loss can be replaced by cryoprecipitateor ﬁbrinogen concentrate, although ﬁbrinogen concentrate is not licensed for acquired hypoﬁbrinogenaemia inthe UK. Similar clinical outcomes and increments in ﬁbrinogen have been reported for cryoprecipitate andﬁbrinogen concentrate, but these are based on limited data.
113It is expected that 2 pools of cryoprecipitate
(1 pool is taken from ﬁve donors) would increase the ﬁbrinogen level by about 1 g/l. Increasing the ﬁbrinogenlevel by 1 g/l requires about 60 mg/kg ﬁbrinogen concentrate.
114Observational studies report improved
clinical haemostasis and possible reduced use of FFP and post-transfusion-related events, such as TACO,94,115

During PPH, platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3109/l

5.3.6 Is there a role for antiﬁbrinolytic drugs?
Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.B
A large RCT118found that early administration of tranexamic acid in the management of trauma in
nonpregnant patients resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in death from haemorrhage. The dose employed inthis study was 1 g intravenously over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. One RCT
119
assessed the role of high-dose tranexamic acid in PPH. Women with PPH greater than 800 ml followingvaginal delivery were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 4 g over 1 hour, theninfusion of 1 g/hour over 6 hours) or not; the study concluded that high-dose tranexamic acid can reduceblood loss, fall in Hb and the need for blood transfusion. The study was not powered to address safetyissues and speciﬁcally, the risk of the treatment causing deep vein thrombosis.
A Cochrane review
2on treatments for PPH found that trials testing the effectiveness of tranexamic acid
were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. A large trial120is currently in progress aiming to
determine the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid on mortality, hysterectomy and other
morbidities in women with PPH. The dose of tranexamic acid employed in this trial is 1 g by intravenousinjection; a second dose may be given after 30 minutes.Evidence

5.3.7 Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy?
The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part
of a clinical trial. /check
rFVIIa (NovoSeven/C226, Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) is an expensive product that is licensed in the
UK for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with speciﬁc inherited bleeding disorders. Outwithits licence, it has been used primarily in the management of uncontrolled haemorrhage in the traumasetting. It reduces blood loss through enhancement of tissue factor-dependent coagulation. Its effectivenessis markedly diminished by hypothermia, acidosis and low platelets, so effective resuscitation towardsnormal physiology is a prerequisite of its use.
121Evidence
level 3
There are only poor quality data from anecdotal reports or patient registries to support its use.122
Systematic reviews of case series and observational studies have examined the use of rFVIIa in PPH.123,124
In a review of the literature regarding the use of rFVIIa in the treatment of PPH, Ahonen122concluded that
rFVIIa should not be used to compensate for inadequate blood transfusion therapy; administration of bloodand blood products, as well as management of uterine atony, are essential in the treatment of PPH beforeconsidering administration of rFVIIa. A 2015 open-label RCT
125(n=84) found that administration of rFVIIa
lowered the risk of requiring second-line therapies by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 –0.76) compared
with controls (no rFVIIa) in women with PPH in whom uterotonics had failed to arrest the bleeding.All 84 women survived, but two women in the intervention group experienced a venousthromboembolism (2/42).
A study
126investigating the safety of rFVIIa when employed on an off-label basis to treat life-threatening
haemorrhage found a signiﬁcant increase in the risk of arterial, but not venous, thromboembolic events whencompared with placebo (5.5% versus 3.2%).Evidence

5.4 Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and
how should women be monitored?
Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml)
and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock:D

–cross-match (4 units minimum)

–coagulation screen, including ﬁbrinogen
–renal and liver function for baseline
/C15monitor temperature every 15 minutes
/C15continuous pulse, blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter, electrocardiogram
and automated blood pressure recording)
/C15Foley catheter to monitor urine output
/C15two peripheral cannulae, 14 gauge
/C15consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion)
/C15consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring at highdependency unit on delivery suite, if appropriate

Appendix IV)
/C15acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed
/C15documentation of ﬂuid balance, blood, blood products and procedures.
Continuous physiological monitoring is necessary and the recording of parameters over time on a ﬂow chart that
will give the reader good visual cues on the clinical progress of the patient (Appendix IV). The need to continuallyre-evaluate the woman’s physiological condition, even when bleeding appears to have stopped, is essential torecognise continuing bleeding.
The presence of a central line not only provides a means of accurate central venous pressure monitoring,
but also a route for rapid ﬂuid replacement. Nevertheless, the threshold for instituting invasive monitoringhas been controversial, with some authorities advising early recourse to central venous pressuremonitoring
127–129and others advocating caution.76,130The 2000 –02 report of the UK Conﬁdential
Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD)29included the recommendation: ‘Central venous and direct
arterial pressure monitoring should be used when the cardiovascular system is compromised byhaemorrhage or disease’. Central venous pressure monitoring requires early involvement of a seniorskilled anaesthetist, who will usually take responsibility for this aspect of management. The use ofultrasound is more likely to make the procedure safer,
29as this procedure carries signiﬁcant morbidity and
mortality.131Once bleeding is under control, transfer to an intensive care or high dependency unit on
delivery suite should be considered, depending on the severity of the blood loss (see section 5.6.3).Evidence

It is also important that once the bleeding is arrested and any coagulopathy is corrected, chemical
thromboprophylaxis is administered, as there is a high risk of thrombosis. Alternatively, anti-embolismstockings, foot impulse devices or intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used if chemicalthromboprophylaxis is contraindicated, for example, in cases of thrombocytopenia.

5.5 What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH?
The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial
role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and, if necessary, in determining and administeringthe most appropriate method of anaesthesia.D
Anaesthetists play an important role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the management of patients
with PPH. A senior anaesthetist should be consulted early to help assess, initiate and continue promptresuscitation of these patients, using their expertise in ﬂuid and transfusion therapy as well as theirexperience in managing critically ill patients.
10
If the patient needs to go to theatre for a surgical intervention, an experienced anaesthetist shouldpromptly assess the patient in order to decide on the most suitable mode of anaesthesia, depending onthe patient’s haemodynamic status. Central neuraxial anaesthesia has become the anaesthetic technique ofchoice in the obstetric population and this has resulted in a reduction in maternal mortality.
133
While general anaesthesia in obstetric patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality whencompared with regional anaesthesia due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy,
9it may be
preferable in patients who are haemodynamically unstable or who have a coagulopathy.
The patient may need high dependency or intensive care in the postoperative period. An obstetric early
warning score system would help in the early identiﬁcation of continuous bleeding, especially in caseswhich are not apparent, as recommended by CMACE (see Appendix IV).

5.6 What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding?
Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological, mechanical and surgical
methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor.D
Careful clinical examination is required to determine the cause of PPH (see Table 1 and Appendix II for
the risk factors and causes of PPH). A 2014 Cochrane review2addressing the treatment of primary PPH
found no trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPHthat were unresponsive to pharmacological methods. Thus, recommendations on treatment strategies arebased on observational data and consensus only.Evidence

5.6.1 What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used?
When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding, then a sequence of mechanical
and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. /check

The most common cause of primary PPH is uterine atony.27The initial management of PPH should,
therefore, involve measures to stimulate myometrial contractions. The following mechanical and
pharmacological measures should be instituted/administered in turn:2
/C15palpate the uterine fundus and rub it to stimulate contractions (‘rubbing up the fundus’)
/C15ensure that the bladder is empty (Foley catheter, leave in place)
/C15oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection (may have repeat dose)
/C15ergometrine 0.5 mg by slow intravenous or intramuscular injection (contraindicated in
women with hypertension)
/C15oxytocin infusion (40 iu in 500 ml isotonic crystalloids at 125 ml/hour) unless ﬂuid restriction
is necessary
/C15carboprost 0.25 mg by intramuscular injection repeated at intervals of not less than 15 minutesto a maximum of eight doses (use with caution in women with asthma)
/C15misoprostol 800 micrograms sublingually.
The simple mechanical and physiological measures of ‘rubbing up the fundus’ and emptying the bladder to
stimulate uterine contraction represent ﬁrst-line management of PPH. No published studies have beenidentiﬁed to provide an evidence base for these interventions; nevertheless, professional consensussupports their continued use.
134
Despite decades of empirical use in clinical practice, there are no trials comparing ergometrine withoxytocin as ﬁrst-line agents for the treatment of PPH. It seems appropriate to use both agents, althoughoxytocin is to be preferred initially, especially in women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Previousguidance
1advocated an initial dose of 10 iu oxytocin by slow intravenous injection for treatment (rather
than prophylaxis) of PPH. The British National Formulary recommends a dose of 5 iu ‘by slowintravenous injection (dose may be repeated)’.
135The 1997 –99 report of the UK CEMD highlighted the
risk of profound hypotension that may be associated with oxytocin injection.136This guideline has
adopted the CEMD recommendation that ‘When given as an intravenous bolus the drug should be givenslowly in a dose of not more than 5 iu’. This dosage is in line with guidance from other authorities.

level 4
There are no trials comparing the prostaglandin carboprost (15-methyl prostaglandin F 2a) with other
uterotonic agents. Two case series from the USA,137,138comprising 26 and 237 cases, respectively, have
reported on the use of carboprost in the successful management of PPH, without resort to surgicalinterventions in 85% and 95% of cases. Two of the four failures in the smaller series were associated withplacenta accreta. If bleeding occurs at the time of caesarean section, intramyometrial injection ofcarboprost may be used (although not licensed). It is also possible to inject intramyometrial carboprostthrough the abdominal wall in the absence of laparotomy. The recommended dose is 250 microgramsintramuscularly. This may be repeated every 15 minutes to a total dose of 2 mg (eight doses). However, ifsigniﬁcant atonic haemorrhage continues after a third dose of carboprost, without signiﬁcant improvement(i.e. 30 minutes or more after the ﬁrst dose was given), the team should consider transfer to theoperating theatre for examination under anaesthesia, with an awareness of the impending need forlaparotomy and/or hysterectomy.

Two systematic reviews,2,139which includes the 2014 Cochrane review, focused on misoprostol to treat
PPH and examined the optimal route and dosage, and its efﬁcacy. Compared with 40 iu oxytocin infusion,800 micrograms sublingual misoprostol was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the number of womenwho had blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 –6.75) and who required blood transfusion
(RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 –2.14). The review authors concluded that oxytocin infusion should be
recommended as ﬁrst-line treatment for primary PPH. When used following prophylactic uterotonics,misoprostol and oxytocin infusion work similarly.Evidence

A study140of women in early pregnancy demonstrated that regardless of the route of administration
(vaginal, sublingual or rectal), misoprostol took 1.0 –2.5 hours to increase uterine tone. Clinicians should be

Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics142recommend that in the management of PPH, misoprostol is
administered sublingually.Evidence

5.6.2 What surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding?
If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, surgical interventions should be
initiated sooner rather than later.D
Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical ’intervention for most
women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage.C
Conservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line, depending on clinicalcircumstances and available expertise.C
It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre./check
Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta oruterine rupture) .C
Ideally and when feasible, a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for
hysterectomy. /check
The use of pharmacological agents other than those detailed should not delay recourse to surgery. Once the
decision is made to embark on surgical haemostasis, the most appropriate choice of procedure will depend, in part,on the experience and expertise of available staff.
Compression of the aorta may be a temporary but effective measure to allow time for resuscitation to catch up with
the volume replacement and the appropriate surgical support to arrive. The judgement of senior clinicians, takinginto account the individual woman’s future reproductive aspirations, is required in deciding the appropriate sequenceof interventions.
The management of placenta praevia accreta is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and guidance is available in the
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 27.

5.6.2.1 Uterine balloon tamponade
Tamponade using various types of hydrostatic balloon catheter has superseded uterine packing for the
control of atonic PPH.143Case series have used a Foley catheter,144Bakri balloon,145Sengstaken –
Blakemore oesophageal catheter146,147and a condom catheter.148The urological Rusch balloon has been
described as preferable by virtue of larger capacity, ease of use and low cost.149A detailed protocol for
uterine tamponade using the Rusch balloon is available.149The 2014 Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe
Maternal Morbidity report identiﬁed 339 women who had an estimated blood loss of 2500 ml or higher; in
82 cases, balloon tamponade was employed, successfully avoiding hysterectomy in 75 (91%) women.150
This success rate is of the same order as that reported in other case series.Evidence
level 3
Some of the reports of balloon tamponade148,151describe the intervention as the ‘tamponade test’. A
‘positive test’ (control of PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) indicates that laparotomy is not required,whereas a ‘negative test’ (continued PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) is an indication to proceed tolaparotomy. The concept of balloon tamponade as a ‘test’ serves to afﬁrm its place as ﬁrst-line ‘surgical’
management. There is no clear evidence on how long the balloon tamponade should be left in place. In
most cases, 4 –6 hours of tamponade should be adequate to achieve haemostasis and ideally it should be
removed during daytime hours, in the presence of appropriate senior staff, in case further intervention isnecessary.

A systematic review concluded that uterine balloon tamponade is an effective treatment for PPH in

5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing
Several case series153have been published describing success with haemostatic brace sutures. The best
known version, described by B-Lynch in 1997,154requires hysterotomy for its insertion and is particularly
suitable when the uterus has already been opened for a caesarean section. A review published in 2005155
summarised nine case series of B-Lynch suturing (a total of 32 cases), reporting success in all but one case.
In 2002, Hayman et al.156described a modiﬁed compression suture which does not require hysterotomy,
and success in 10/11 women managed with this suture has been reported.157Other authors have
described variants on these techniques.158,159Double vertical compression sutures have proved effective in
treating PPH due to atony and placenta praevia. This may have a dual action of reducing uterine bloodﬂow and compressing the bleeding surface.
160
A prospective population-based study of 211 women treated with a uterine compression suture to controlPPH concluded that the overall failure rate of sutures leading to hysterectomy was 25%.
161There was no
difference in failure rate among B-Lynch, modiﬁed B-Lynch and other suture techniques. Risk factors for ahysterectomy included increasing age and vaginal delivery. In addition, a prolonged delay of 2 –6 hours
between delivery and uterine compression suture was independently associated with a four-fold increasedrisk of hysterectomy. This emphasises the need for careful postpartum evaluation of blood loss to avoidprolonged delay in haemorrhage recognition.Evidence

The 2014 Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity report150identiﬁed 21 cases where

These observational data suggest that haemostatic suture techniques are effective in controlling severe PPH and in
reducing the need for hysterectomy. In the absence of comparative data to demonstrate that any one variant is
superior to another, obstetricians are encouraged to familiarise themselves with one technique under the
supervision of an experienced colleague. It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture techniquebe kept in theatre.
A systematic review
162has concluded that compression sutures are associated with a low complication
rate. A higher risk of uterine ischaemia appeared to be caused when the procedure was combined withvessel ligation. No negative impact on fertility has been reported.
Case series have reported the combined use of haemostatic suturing and balloon tamponade in the

5.6.2.3 Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation
Stepwise uterine devascularisation describes the successive ligation of (i) one uterine artery, (ii) both
uterine arteries, (iii) low uterine arteries, (iv) one ovarian artery and (v) both ovarian arteries, in the
management of PPH.166The original case series167of 103 patients with intractable PPH not responding to
medical management was effective in all cases without the need for hysterectomy, leading some cliniciansto propose that stepwise uterine devascularisation should be the ﬁrst-line conservative surgical treatmentto control PPH.
When internal iliac artery ligation is being considered, a senior gynaecologist or vascular surgeon should be
informed and involved since this technique requires a high degree of surgical skill and training, and may beassociated with ureteric injury. A case series described 84 women with PPH from various causes whounderwent internal iliac artery ligation as the ﬁrst-line surgical intervention. Hysterectomy wassubsequently required in 33 (39%) women.

A study of 45 women following internal iliac artery ligation suggests that subsequent fertility and pregnancyoutcomes are not impaired.

5.6.2.4 Selective arterial occlusion or embolisation by interventional radiology
A large retrospective study171has evaluated arterial embolisation in 251 patients after PPH. It was
successful in arresting the bleeding in 86.5% (217/251). The analysis suggested that caesarean sectiondelivery, disseminated intravascular coagulation and transfusion of more than 10 units of packed red cellswere related to failed embolisation. Evidence

The logistics of performing arterial occlusion or embolisation where the equipment or an interventional radiologist
may not be available mean that uterine balloon tamponade is a more appropriate ﬁrst-line treatment.
Follow-up studies of 17172and 25173women who underwent arterial embolisation for treatment of PPH
suggest that the intervention does not impair subsequent menstruation, fertility and obstetric outcomes.Selective arterial occlusion may also be effective after failed internal iliac artery ligation.

5.6.2.5 Hysterectomy
The decision for hysterectomy should be made by an experienced consultant clinician and the decision
preferably discussed with a second experienced clinician when feasible.29Early recourse to hysterectomy is
recommended, especially where bleeding is associated with placenta accreta or uterine rupture.12
Hysterectomy should not be delayed until the woman is in extremis or while less deﬁnitive procedureswith which the surgeon has little experience are attempted. The procedure should be carried out by asurgeon who is experienced in carrying out hysterectomies. Subtotal hysterectomy is the operation ofchoice in many instances of PPH requiring hysterectomy, unless there is trauma to the cervix or amorbidly adherent placenta in the lower segment.Evidence

Sequential reports of the Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity from 2003 until 2012,

The authors concluded that care for these women may be better provided byobstetricians and anaesthetists on the labour ward, a view that others have shared.

6. How should secondary PPH be managed?
In women presenting with secondary PPH, an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be
performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy
should be initiated when endometritis is suspected.D
A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception(RPOC), although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable.C
Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by anexperienced clinician.D
The causes of secondary PPH are numerous and include endometritis, RPOC and subinvolution of the
placental implantation site.177,178The management of women presenting with secondary PPH should
include an assessment of their haemodynamic status, an assessment of the blood loss and an evaluation ofthe woman’s concerns (for example, is her bleeding becoming inconvenient because it has persisted longerthan she had expected?).Evidence
level 4
Investigations should include bacteriological testing for endometritis (high vaginal swab), although a low
yield of positive vaginal swab results has been reported in patients with secondary PPH.179In contrast,
Pather et al.180found a high incidence of abnormal vaginal microbiology (52%) and endometritis in their
case series, supporting the practice of routine assessment of vaginal microbiology and appropriate use ofantimicrobial therapy in women presenting with secondary PPH.Evidence
level 3
A Cochrane review investigated the effect of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of postpartum
endometritis.181This review concluded that a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate,
and that once uncomplicated endometritis has clinically improved with intravenous therapy, there is noadditional beneﬁt from further oral therapy. The management of women presenting with secondary PPHand sepsis is addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 64b.
182Evidence

Pelvic ultrasound scans are commonly performed on women presenting with secondary PPH to identify
any RPOC. Case series180,183 –186have reported a wide range of sensitivities and speciﬁcities of ultrasound
in the detection of RPOC (44 –94% and 16 –92%, respectively). These series suggest that the presence of
an echogenic mass and a thickened ‘endometrium’ is associated with RPOC. In a prospective observationalstudy
187of 79 women with secondary PPH, Mulic-Lutvica and Axelsson concluded that an echogenic mass
in the uterine cavity and an anteroposterior diameter of the cavity above the 90th centile (approximately25 mm on days 1 –7 postpartum) was associated with RPOC. Since the range of sensitivities and
speciﬁcities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC is so wide, the clinical ﬁndings, including the degree ofbleeding and whether the cervical os is open, should be taken into account before the decision toundertake surgery is made. It has been proposed that colour ﬂow Doppler imaging should be included inthe evaluation of the postpartum uterus, although, there is no strong evidence to support its use;
178its
use may facilitate the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, which are rare butrecognised causes of secondary PPH.

Surgical evacuation of the uterus for RPOC is not without morbidity and can result in uterine
perforation (1.5%)180,191and Asherman’s syndrome.192It is, therefore, recommended that surgical
evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician.An appropriately trained clinician may consider performing uterine evacuation under direct ultrasoundguidance.
A 2002 Cochrane review (assessed as up-to-date in January 2008) addressed treatments for secondary
PPH.
4No trials were identiﬁed which met the review group’s inclusion criteria and no recommendations
were made regarding effective treatments. Uterotonics, such as misoprostol and ergometrine, have beenrecommended in the management of secondary PPH, although evidence to support their use islimited.
178Transcatheter arterial embolisation193and balloon tamponade194have been employed in cases
of secondary PPH with ongoing bleeding.Evidence

7. Risk management
7.1 Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of
PPH?
Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH./check
All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric
emergencies, including the management of PPH.B
Training for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals.B
All cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of aformal clinical incident review.D
To ensure optimal management of PPH, every unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol with
which staff should be familiar (see section 5). Updates on the management of obstetric emergencies(including the management of PPH) are a proactive approach to risk management. Skills drills shouldensure that all members of staff, including those working in the transfusion laboratory, are aware oftheir role in the management of PPH. A systematic review
195of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary
simulation training in obstetric emergencies (including PPH) showed that teamwork training in asimulation setting resulted in improvement of knowledge, practical skills, communication and teamperformance. Training in a simulation centre did not further improve outcome compared with trainingat a local unit.Evidence
level 2++
The RCOG recommends that all cases of PPH with an estimated blood loss of more than 1500 ml should
be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.196Evidence

7.2 Documentation
Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential./check
Accurate documentation is important for further clinical management, continuity of care and team work. In
addition, inadequate documentation can contribute to the likelihood of there being medicolegal
consequences.197The team member recording events on the structured proforma, the scribe, is crucial in the
management of PPH (see Appendix V); the proforma is effectively a checklist of available interventions, andteam leaders should communicate with the scribe during the PPH to ensure that no steps have been omitted.PPH should be notiﬁed through a clinical incident reporting or risk management system.Evidence
level 4
It is important to record:
/C15the staff in attendance and the time they arrived
/C15the sequence of events
/C15the administration of different pharmacological agents, their timing and sequence
/C15the time of surgical intervention, where relevant
/C15the condition of the mother throughout the different steps
/C15the timing of the ﬂuid and blood products given.
7.3 Debrieﬁng
An opportunity to discuss the events surrounding the obstetric haemorrhage should be offered
to the woman (possibly with her birthing partner/s) at a mutually convenient time. /check
After obstetric emergencies, women can be psychologically affected by postnatal depression or fear of
further childbirth. Major PPH can be traumatic to women and their families and has been associated withthe subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder.
198Women who have experienced a major
PPH should be offered an opportunity to discuss the events surrounding their delivery. A discussion offuture pregnancy, including the likelihood of a repeat PPH and any fears regarding pregnancy andchildbirth that the woman may have should be addressed. This should include arrangements forappropriate investigations as necessary, such as testing for coagulopathies if there are other indicators andscreening for the rare complication of postpartum hypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome) secondary tohypotension.

/C15RCTs are required to identify the best drug combinations, route and dose of uterotonics for the treatment of
primary PPH.
/C15The role of viscoelastometric point of care tests using TEG/C226and ROTEM/C226in the management of PPH
requires evaluation.
/C15Studies are required to determine the optimal ratio of packed red cells to FFP in the management ofobstetric haemorrhage.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classi ﬁcation of evidence levels Grades of recommendations

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
