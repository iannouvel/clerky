Diabetes in Pregnancy Maternity Protocol: MP018 
Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable standards for action. 
Scope: Applies to pregnant individuals with pre-existing or gestational diabetes. 
Responsibilities: Healthcare professionals must follow and apply the guidance. 
Definition of Diabetes: Metabolic disorder with raised glucose levels, posing risks in pregnancy. 
Pre-existing Diabetes: Pre-pregnancy planning and routine care are crucial for optimal outcomes. 
Antenatal Care: Regular monitoring and individualized care for pregnant individuals with diabetes. 
Targets for Glycaemic Control: Monitoring blood glucose levels and aiming for specific targets. 
Additional Care for Insulin Users: Offer glucagon, insulin pump therapy, and educate on hypoglycemia. 
Management: Immediate treatment for suspected diabetic ketoacidosis as an emergency.

should be senior input at an early stage  
 Diabetic women and pregnant individuals should receive immediate critical care upon admission to the hospital. A multidisciplinary plan should be made by the obstetrician, medical team, and diabetic team. 
For women with MODY, genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis. Treatment and monitoring should be similar to those with pre-existing diabetes. 
Insulin pump therapy can be used for optimal glucose control during pregnancy. 
During delivery, continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential. 
Neonatal care should be provided for babies at risk of hypoglycemia due to maternal diabetes. 
After delivery, insulin requirements return to pre-pregnancy levels. Postpartum care should include monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin doses accordingly.

- Women and people with gestational diabetes should be offered testing and monitoring throughout pregnancy. 
- Encourage healthy diet choices and weight management advice. 
- Offer metformin or insulin if blood glucose targets are not met through diet and exercise. 
- Monitor blood glucose levels regularly during labor and birth. 
- Babies of women with diabetes should be monitored for hypoglycemia after birth.

36 weeks if dictated clinically by the initial assessment of the baby and feeding on the labour ward. Stop VRIII at delivery. Monitor CBG before and 2 hours after meal for 24 hours with targets of 6.0mmol/L fasting and 7.8mmol/L two hours after meals. Offer an HbA1c test 6 - 13 weeks after birth to exclude diabetes. Advise on risks of gestational diabetes in subsequent pregnancies and screening for diabetes when planning pregnancy. Offer lifestyle advice, annual HbA1c test to women diagnosed with gestational diabetes who have a negative postnatal test for diabetes. Encourage healthy diet choices and weight management advice. Use 'units' for insulin measurement in all contexts. Accurate documentation is essential. Include evidence of a multidisciplinary team and timetable of antenatal appointments in documentation. Offer an antenatal ultrasound examination at 20 weeks. Include an individual management plan in maternity records covering pregnancy and postnatal period.
