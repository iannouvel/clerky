Shoulder Dystocia  
 
Definition: Delivery requiring additional obstetric manoeuvres after gentle downward traction fails.  
 
Identification of risk factors: Previous shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal BMI > 30, induction of labor, prolonged labor, prolonged second stage, oxytocin augmentation, assisted vaginal delivery.  
 
Prevention: No evidence for early induction or elective caesarean for suspected macrosomia in non-diabetic women. Induction at 38 weeks may reduce incidence in gestational diabetes. Caesarean considered for suspected macrosomia in pregnancies with maternal diabetes.  
 
Diagnosis: Gentle traction used to diagnose shoulder dystocia.  
 
Management: McRoberts' manoeuvre first, followed by suprapubic pressure. Avoid lateral and downward traction.  
 
Documentation: Complete shoulder dystocia proforma in maternal notes.  
 
Post-Delivery Care: Increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal tears.  
 
Training: Maintain skills in dealing with shoulder dystocia for quicker and fewer complications.
