Perinatal Collapse in Pregnancy & Puerperium Maternity Protocol: MP055 Date agreed: March 2022 University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East 

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgment may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all seriously ill women and all women found collapsed in the peri-partum period.

Responsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Maternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium: Maternal collapse is a rare but life-threatening event, with a wide-ranging etiology. Prompt and effective resuscitation is crucial for the mother and fetus.

Immediate Emergency Resuscitative Management: Call for help, check for signs of life, initiate basic life support, give oxygen, obtain venous access, start fluid resuscitation, and institute advanced life support as needed.

Process for the Use of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS): MEOWS chart should be used for antenatal patients, postnatal women with risk factors or complications, and those who have undergone surgical intervention. Regular observations and documentation are essential.

Roles and Responsibilities of Staff Groups: Midwives should escalate to management, provide one-to-one care, and document observations. Obstetricians should be involved in care plans and attend all cases of maternal collapse. Anaesthetists should be notified for severely ill pregnant women and liaise with ITU if necessary. All team members should consider Critical Care Outreach team for support. Fast bleep the Obstetric Registrar for clinical deterioration or loss of consciousness.

Guidance for staff on when to involve clinicians from outside the maternity service: Specialist clinicians should be involved for specific medical issues beyond common obstetric complications. Contact them via the hospital switchboard as needed.

Haematologist and Microbiologists are key in managing blood disorders and sepsis/infection/antibiotic issues. 

ITU admissions require collaboration between Obstetrician, Anaesthetic Consultant, and ITU Consultant. 

Major obstetric haemorrhage is a common cause of maternal collapse, with causes including postpartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and ectopic pregnancy. 

Cardiac disease is a leading cause of maternal death, with various causes including ischaemia and sudden arrhythmic cardiac death. 

Thromboembolism is a common cause of direct maternal death, and appropriate thromboprophylaxis is crucial. 

Amniotic fluid embolism presents as collapse during labor or birth and requires supportive management. 

Sepsis is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt and appropriate therapy. 

Drug toxicity should be considered in cases of collapse, with magnesium sulphate and local anaesthetic agents being common culprits. 

Eclampsia and intracranial hemorrhage are important considerations in cases of maternal collapse. 

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction that can lead to collapse and requires immediate intervention.

The incidence of severe perioperative obstetric anaphylaxis is between 1 and 3.5 per 100,000, with a mortality rate of approximately 1%. Anaphylaxis is likely when sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms, life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems, and skin and/or mucosal changes are present. Exposure to a known allergen for the woman supports the diagnosis, but many cases occur with no previous history. Mast cell tryptase levels can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In cases of anaphylaxis, all potential causative agents should be removed, and the ABCDE approach to assessment and resuscitation followed. The treatment for anaphylaxis is 1:1000 adrenaline 500 micrograms intramuscularly, with adjuvant therapy consisting of chlorphenamine 10mg and hydrocortisone 200 mg. Other causes of collapse in pregnant women include hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. Aortocaval compression can occur from around 20 weeks of gestation onwards, reducing venous return in the supine position. Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the standard ABCDE approach, with some modifications for maternal physiology, in particular relief of aortocaval compression. If there is no response to correctly performed CPR within 4 minutes of maternal collapse, perimortem caesarean section should be considered to assist maternal resuscitation. Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age, and access to emergency care, with survival rates being poorer if the collapse occurs out of hospital. All cases of maternal collapse should generate a clinical incident form and be reviewed through the clinical governance process. All maternity staff should have annual formal multidisciplinary training in ABLS and the management of maternal collapse. Life support training improves resuscitation skills.

Debriefing is recommended for the woman, the family, and the staff involved in the event. Maternal collapse can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, postnatal depression, and tocophobia. Debriefing is an important part of holistic maternity care and should be offered by a competent professional to support the ongoing mental health of all concerned. It is recommended to audit the management of maternal collapse and ensure compliance with incident reporting. Additionally, useful links and support groups are provided for further information and resources.
