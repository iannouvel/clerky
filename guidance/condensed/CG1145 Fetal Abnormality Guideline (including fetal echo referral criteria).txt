Fetal Abnormality Guideline aims to ensure effective communication and referral for fetal abnormalities, providing optimal care for babies and mothers. The guideline applies to all staff caring for antenatal women when a fetal abnormality is detected. Responsibilities include accessing and following the guidance, with management ensuring the guideline is reviewed as required. Abbreviations used in the guideline are listed for reference. The guideline outlines the process following an inconclusive or abnormal scan, fetal medicine referral criteria, and continuing care during pregnancy, birth, and postnatal period. The importance of designated midwife care throughout the antenatal period is emphasized. Labor ward staff should inform the pediatric and obstetric teams upon admission for birth, with postnatal care including recording birth outcomes and arranging follow-up appointments.

Confirmed fetal anomalies should be recorded and discussed quarterly at departmental meetings. Information should be shared with the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service for monitoring. Referral for fetal echo is indicated for certain cases, such as previous significant cardiac abnormalities in the family or NT > 3.5 mm. Maternal anti-Ro/La antibodies are not an indication for fetal echo. Pregnant individuals with diabetes do not require a fetal echo but should have a routine anomaly scan at 20 weeks. Referral for fetal medicine early anomaly scan is indicated for cases of major structural abnormalities in previous pregnancies or parents, or if the patient is taking teratogenic drugs. The guideline is monitored through annual KPI data submitted to Public Health England by the screening team.
