CLINICAL GUIDELINE  
Maternity Smoking & Smoke Free Pregnancy  

This guideline is to ensure optimal outcomes for mother and baby in pregnancies complicated by smoking and to act as a resource for staff caring for women. It applies to all staff caring for pregnant women who smoke or have stopped smoking since conception.  

Smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of poor birth outcomes, including stillbirth, miscarriage, and sudden infant death. Stopping smoking reduces these risks and improves outcomes. The recommended treatment is a combination of behavioral support and nicotine replacement therapy.  

Health professionals should provide consistent messaging on smoking, emphasizing the benefits of stopping completely. Cutting down on smoking still increases risks associated with stillbirth.  

Referrals for smokers should be made using an 'Opt-Out' method. Referrals are for current smokers, raised CO levels, and ex-smokers/early quitters. All eligible referrals must be included in reports for appropriate monitoring and support.  

Community midwives play a role in supporting pregnant smokers undergoing a quit attempt. CO monitoring should be offered at each antenatal appointment, regardless of smoking status. CO affects oxygen transport in the body and is a marker for smoking exposure.

1. CO testing is important for detecting exposure to harmful gases that can affect the fetus.
2. The procedure for CO testing involves clear instructions for the patient to follow.
3. Results of CO testing should be explained to the patient.
4. Smoking status should be assessed and documented, with referrals made to smoke-free services for smokers.
5. Interpretation of CO readings is essential for identifying potential causes and taking appropriate actions.
6. Continuous monitoring of CO levels and referrals to specialist services may be necessary for high readings.
7. Partners and household members who smoke should be encouraged to quit for the health of the pregnant individual and the baby.
8. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is safe and effective for pregnant individuals who want to quit smoking.
9. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are considered safer alternatives to traditional cigarettes, but long-term effects are still unknown.
10. Care within the maternity unit includes offering NRT to support temporary abstinence and providing support for smokers during admission.
11. Staff training on CO screening, smoking cessation support, and local guidelines is essential for providing quality care.
