Care in labour guideline provides evidence-based practices for managing pregnant women and birthing people in all care settings. The goal is to ensure optimal outcomes for low-risk individuals by involving them in decision-making. Midwives and obstetricians are responsible for following the guideline and using their professional judgment. Initial assessment includes reviewing records, physical observations, and assessing fetal movements. Risk assessments should be conducted on admission or at home, with timely referrals for any identified risks. The guideline emphasizes promoting normal birth and avoiding unnecessary interventions for low-risk individuals.

In labor, it is important to consider the clinical picture, obstetric history, medical history, anaesthetic history, risk factors, social lifestyle, routine observations, and referral for pregnant women with identified risks. Risk documentation and individualized management plans should be documented. Monitoring of maternal and fetal conditions, as well as fluid balance management, should be carried out. Biomechanics and monitoring progress during the first stage of labor are also essential components of care. Delay in the first stage of labor should be carefully monitored and managed.

When delay in the established first stage of labor is suspected, consider factors such as parity, cervical dilation, uterine contractions, station and position of presenting part, emotional state of the pregnant woman, and emptying the bladder. Referral to a healthcare professional may be necessary.

If delay is suspected, amniotomy should be considered for women with intact membranes. If amniotomy is declined, a vaginal examination should be advised after 2 hours to assess progress. In cases of amniotomy for delay, a vaginal examination should be done 2 hours later to check progress.

Laboring women who develop complications can return to the normal care pathway once the complication is resolved.

Referral to the obstetric team is recommended when delay in the established first stage of labor is confirmed.

There is insufficient evidence to support starving pregnant women in labor. Eating a light diet is recommended unless certain risk factors are present.

Pain management options include support, breathing techniques, hydrotherapy, and pharmacological analgesia such as Entonox, morphine sulfate, epidural, and Remifentanil PCA.

Monitoring maternal and fetal condition during the second stage of labor is essential, including pulse, blood pressure, temperature, contractions, and vaginal examinations.

Pushing should be supported in the active stage of the second stage of labor. Different positions are encouraged for laboring women with regional analgesia. Lack of progress in the second stage is defined based on specific timeframes and conditions.

Management of delay in progress in the second stage includes offering amniotomy, emptying the bladder, and considering electronic fetal monitoring.

In the third stage of labor, options for active and physiological management should be discussed with pregnant women and documented in their birth plan. Delayed cord clamping is recommended, and precautions should be taken when handling blood products. Inspection of the placenta and estimation of blood loss are important steps in the third stage of labor.

Active management of the third stage of labor involves administering a uterotonic after birth, followed by clamping and cutting the cord and delivering the placenta. This approach is recommended for reducing blood loss and postpartum hemorrhage. Physiological management, on the other hand, is a hands-off approach where the uterotonic drug is not given, and the cord is not clamped until pulsation stops. It can be offered to low-risk women who meet certain criteria. Delivery of the placenta should occur within one hour with physiological management. Referral to the obstetric team should be considered if the placenta remains undelivered after a certain time. Placental cord drainage is an alternative practice that can be used with both active and physiological management. Monitoring of the mother's condition and the baby's care immediately after birth is essential. Skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding initiation, and newborn examination should be encouraged. Placental histology is necessary in certain cases, such as miscarriage or severe fetal distress.

Clinical guideline updates have been made periodically, with additions and amendments to include new practices and recommendations. The guideline is due for review on August 21, 2027.
