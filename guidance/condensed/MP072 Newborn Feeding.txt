Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only) MP072

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This guideline applies to all women, mothers, and babies receiving care from the Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Directorate of Women and Childrenâ€™s Health.

Responsibilities: Midwives, Nursery Nurses, Maternity Support Workers, Maternity Care Assistants, Paediatricians.

Policy Statement and Rationale: The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that all staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust understands their role and responsibilities in supporting expectant and new mothers and their partners to feed and care for their baby in ways which support optimum health and well-being.

Aims and Objectives: Breastfeeding is an important health issue, and its positive impact on the short and long-term health of mothers and newborns is well documented.

Outcomes: This policy aims to improve outcomes for children and families, including an increase in breastfeeding initiation rates, promoting breastfeeding, and supporting safe feeding practices.

The purpose of the breastfeeding protocol: To promote breastfeeding and safe feeding practices by ensuring staff understand their role, familiarizing new staff with the protocol, and providing ongoing education and support.

Definitions: Breastfeeding involves giving human breastmilk to infants for their nutritional needs, while infant formula is a manufactured food for infants under 6 months of age.

Care standards: Based on UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards, providing education and support for expectant mothers and families.

Support for breastfeeding: Mothers will receive support with positioning and attachment, hand expression, and signs of effective feeding until they are feeding confidently. Discussions on responsive feeding and feeding cues will be included.

Assessment using the breastfeeding tool in Badgernet is essential for effective feeding and mother-baby wellbeing. Breastfeeding mothers will receive information on recognizing effective feeding, importance of wet and dirty nappies, and how to access support services. Responsive feeding allows for feeding, comfort, and calming of babies. Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged for best outcomes, with support for partial breastfeeding if needed. Hand expressing and using an electric breast pump are important skills to maintain milk supply. Supplementation should only be given when medically indicated, with documentation and plans to support breastfeeding. Cup feeding and syringe feeding are temporary measures to support breastfeeding. Avoiding dummies and nipple shields is recommended. Formula feeding mothers will be educated on responsive feeding and safe practices. Recommendations for discussing bed-sharing with parents are provided. Guidance for managing reluctant feeders is outlined for newborn babies.

Reluctant feeding is common behavior for many healthy term babies in the first 24 hours of life. It is important to differentiate between healthy babies and those at risk of hypoglycemia. Signs of hypoglycemia include jitteriness, lethargy, feeding difficulties, irritability, and seizures. It is essential to monitor babies closely for these signs. Stimulating a good milk supply through early and frequent breastfeeding or expressing is important. Babies may be slow to feed due to various reasons such as sedation, illness, or birth trauma. It is crucial to inform mothers about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of formula feeding. Avoiding teats while babies are learning to breastfeed is recommended. Weighing newborns at specific intervals and identifying excessive weight loss is important for monitoring their health. Plans for managing weight loss in newborns include observing breastfeeding, teaching breast compressions, and monitoring urine and stool output. Supplementing with expressed breast milk is preferred over formula, and the amount of milk given should be based on the infant's cues. Neonatal readmissions for excessive weight loss should be carefully monitored and analyzed.

Babies readmitted to the postnatal ward with >12% weight loss, sodium >150, or complex feeding problems will be clinically reviewed by an ANNP or Neonatologist. A management plan will be discussed and agreed upon with the mother, and a feeding plan will be implemented. Midwives should check and document wet and dirty nappies, contact the Infant feeding team for support, and consider maternal physical and mental health. For breastfeeding women, a plan should include responsive feeding, top-up volumes, and documenting feed quality. For artificially feeding women, volumes should be documented. Parents with a baby on the neonatal unit should be supported in having a close relationship with their baby, encouraged to provide touch and comfort, and enabled to have skin-to-skin contact. Breastmilk is the first choice for feeding preterm or ill babies, and mothers should be supported in expressing milk effectively. Non-nutritive sucking at the breast is encouraged when possible. When supplementation is needed, a breastfeeding/lactation supportive plan should be in place. Staff should follow the International Code for the Advertising of Artificial Milk and all Breast Milk Substitutes. Training and monitoring compliance are essential.

responsiveness with mother: 
- Discuss signs of readiness to feed
- First feed in skin contact preferably within 1 hour
- For babies being fed formula, follow the chart but give formula milk instead of colostrum

Fed Effectively? 1-2 hours following birth:
- Maintain skin-to-skin contact
- Try different feeding positions
- Assess well-being of the baby and record observations
- Encourage mother to hand express and give colostrum (EBM) baby

Concerns about baby wellbeing:
- Refer to neonatal team/paediatric team if coming in from home

Day 2 and not breastfeeding:
- Encourage skin-to-skin/laid back position
- Monitor baby's well-being and feeding cues
- Offer breast 2-3 hourly
- Express milk frequently
- Give EBM, increase volume as needed
- Refer to infant feeding team if necessary

Baby feeds? Features suggesting a same day medical review:
- Not waking or showing signs of hunger
- Abnormal temperature, responsiveness, or appearance
- Abnormal heart rate or breathing
- Abnormal cry or jitteriness

Prevention and management of excessive weight loss in healthy breastfed newborns:
- Perform full examination of the baby
- Take breastfeeding history from the mother
- Teach mother how to do breast compressions
- Ensure minimum feeds in 24 hours
- Skin-to-skin contact to encourage effective breastfeeding

Calculating milk volumes for supplementation:
- Amount of expressed milk should reflect normal colostrum amounts
- Offer supplements based on infant cues
- Start small and increase as needed

Breastfeeding Specialist Contact Details:
- Referrals via Badgernet or email

Tongue Tie:
- Effects on infant feeding and signs to watch for
- Assessment should be done by trained health professionals
- Referral to tongue tie practitioner if necessary

Frenulotomy is indicated for babies with feeding difficulties that are not resolved by positioning and attachment help. Referral criteria include unresolved feeding problems and exclude concerns about eating, speech, aesthetics, or dental decay. Referrals can be made by various healthcare professionals or self-referred by the mother. The procedure involves a detailed assessment, confirmation of tongue tie, and explanation of the frenulotomy procedure. Parents are encouraged to be involved during the procedure. Management while waiting for the appointment includes improving positioning and attachment, hand expressing breast milk, and advising on feeding volumes. If there is excessive bleeding post-procedure, steps are outlined to control the bleeding. It is recommended to hand express and store colostrum antenatally to reduce the need for manufactured milk for at-risk infants.
