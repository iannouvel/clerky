Care of Women with Haemoglobinopathies  
 
Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.  
 
Scope: This protocol applies to childbearing women with Haemoglobinopathies.  
 
Responsibilities: Midwives and Obstetricians are responsible for accessing, reading, understanding, and following this guidance, as well as using their professional judgement in application of this protocol. Management is responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.  
 
Objective Standards: All pregnant women with Haemoglobinopathies should be discussed with the antenatal screening coordinator midwife and offered partner testing after an abnormal result.  
 
Thalassaemia in pregnancy: Thalassaemia trait does not present hazards to the mother or fetus, while Thalassaemia major and intermedia are associated with increased risks and should involve a haematologist in antenatal care.  
 
Sickle cell disease in pregnancy: Crisis can be common in the third trimester and may require intravenous infusion to prevent dehydration. Women may be at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction.  
 
Management of antenatal sickle cell crisis: Admit to delivery suite, refer to the obstetric and anesthetic team, and provide adequate analgesia.  
 
Management of haemoglobinopathies in labour: There is no contraindication to normal obstetric practice, and continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended.  
 
Postnatal management of haemoglobinopathies: Women with these conditions should be considered high risk for venous thromboembolism and may require low-molecular-weight heparin.
