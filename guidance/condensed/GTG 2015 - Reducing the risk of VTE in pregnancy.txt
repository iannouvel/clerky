Venous Thromboembolism during 
Pregnancy and the Puerperium
Green-top Guideline No. 37a 
April 2015RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists2 of 40Reducing the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism during 
Pregnancy and the Puerperium
This is the third edition of this guideline, first published in 2004 under the title ‘Thromboprophylaxis 
during Pregnancy, Labour and after Vaginal Delivery’ and revised in 2009 under the title ‘Reducing the 
Risk of Thrombosis and Embolism during Pregnancy and the Puerperium’.
Executive summary of recommendations 
Prepregnancy and antenatal risk assessment 
What are the risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the puerperium and 
what is the magnitude of risk for these factors?
All women should undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for VTE in early pregnancy 
or prepregnancy. 
Risk assessment should be repeated if the woman is admitted to hospital for any reason or develops 
other intercurrent problems. 
Risk assessment should be repeated again intrapartum or immediately postpartum. 
Any woman with four or more current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than 
previous VTE or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) throughout the antenatal period and will usually require prophylactic LMWH for 6 
weeks postnatally but a postnatal risk reassessment should be made. 
Any woman with three current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than previous 
VTE or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic LMWH from 28 weeks and will 
usually require prophylactic LMWH for 6 weeks postnatally but a postnatal risk reassessment 
should be made. 
Any woman with two current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than previous VTE 
or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic LMWH for at least 10 days postpartum. 
Women admitted to hospital when pregnant (including to the gynaecology ward with hyperemesis 
gravidarum or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) should usually be offered thromboprophylaxis 
with LMWH unless there is a specific contraindication such as risk of labour or active bleeding.
The risk of VTE should be discussed with women at risk and the reasons for individual 
recommendations explained. 
Previous VTE
How should women with previous VTE be managed in pregnancy? (see Appendix IV)
Single previous VTE
Women with previous VTE should be offered prepregnancy counselling and a prospective 
management plan for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy made. Those who become pregnant before 
receiving such counselling should be referred at the earliest opportunity in pregnancy to a clinician 
with expertise in thrombosis in pregnancy. C

PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists3 of 40Women with previous VTE (except those with a single previous VTE related to major surgery 
and no other risk factors) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with LMWH throughout the 
antenatal period.
Women with previous VTE should have a careful history documented. Where objective documentation 
is not available, the previous diagnosis of VTE can be assumed in cases where the woman gives a 
good history and received prolonged (greater than 6 weeks) therapeutic anticoagulation. 
Thrombophilia-associated VTE
Heritable thrombophilia 
Women with previous VTE associated with antithrombin deficiency (who will often be on long-term 
oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher dose LMWH (either 50%, 
75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks postpartum or until 
returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery.
Management should be undertaken in collaboration with a haematologist with expertise in 
thrombosis in pregnancy and consideration given to antenatal anti-Xa monitoring and the potential 
for antithrombin replacement at initiation of labour or prior to caesarean section.
If anti-Xa levels are measured, a test that does not use exogenous antithrombin should be used 
and 4-hour peak levels of 0.5–1.0 iu/ml aimed for.
Other heritable thrombophilic defects are lower risk and can be managed with standard doses of 
thromboprophylaxis.
Acquired thrombophilia – see also section 4.4 
Women with VTE associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (who will often be on long-
term oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher dose LMWH (either 
50%, 75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks postpartum or until 
returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery.
Pregnant women with APS and prior VTE or arterial thromboses should be managed in collaboration 
with a haematologist and/or rheumatologist with expertise in this area.
Previous recurrent VTE
What extra advice is needed for women with previous recurrent VTE?
Advice regarding doses of LMWH in pregnancy should be sought from a clinician with expertise in 
haemostasis and pregnancy.
Some women with previous recurrent VTE require higher doses of LMWH.
Women on long-term warfarin or other oral anticoagulants should be counselled about the risks of 
these agents to the fetus (see section 8.6) and advised to stop their oral anticoagulant therapy and 
change to LMWH as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, ideally within 2 weeks of the missed period 
and before the sixth week of pregnancy.
Women not on warfarin or other oral anticoagulants should be advised to start LMWH as soon as 
they have a positive pregnancy test.C

PDDRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists4 of 40Stratification of women with previous VTE
How should women with previous VTE be stratified to determine management in pregnancy?
Women with VTE associated with either antithrombin deficiency or APS or with recurrent VTE (who 
will often be on long-term oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher 
dose LMWH (either 50%, 75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks 
postpartum or until returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery. These women require 
specialist management by experts in haemostasis and pregnancy.
Women in whom the original VTE was unprovoked/idiopathic or related to estrogen (estrogen-
containing contraception/pregnancy) or related to a transient risk factor other than major surgery 
or who have other risk factors should be offered thromboprophylaxis with LMWH throughout the 
antenatal period.
In women in whom the original VTE was provoked by major surgery from which they have recovered 
and who have no other risk factors, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH can be withheld antenatally 
until 28 weeks provided no additional risk factors are present (in which case they should be offered 
LMWH). They require close surveillance for the development of other risk factors.
Testing for thrombophilia in women with prior VTE
Which women with prior VTE require thrombophilia testing?
Prior to testing for thrombophilia, women should be counselled regarding the implications for 
themselves and family members of a positive or negative result. The results should be interpreted 
by clinicians with specific expertise in the area.
Women with a family history of VTE and either antithrombin deficiency or where the specific 
thrombophilia has not been detected should be tested for antithrombin deficiency.
Women with an unprovoked VTE should be tested for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.
Asymptomatic heritable thrombophilia 
How should women with asymptomatic thrombophilia be treated? (see Appendix IV)
Women should be stratified according to level of risk associated with their thrombophilia and the 
presence or absence of a family history or other risk factors.
Women with asymptomatic antithrombin, protein C or S deficiency or those with more than one 
thrombophilic defect (including homozygous factor V Leiden, homozygous prothrombin gene 
mutation and compound heterozygotes) should be referred to a local expert and antenatal 
prophylaxis considered. They should be recommended for six weeks’ postnatal prophylaxis even 
in the absence of additional risk factors.
Heterozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation or antiphospholipid antibodies are 
considered as risk factors for thrombosis in asymptomatic women (see Appendix I). In the presence 
of three other risk factors such women may be considered for antenatal thromboprophylaxis, if 
there are two other risk factors thromboprophylaxis should be considered from 28 weeks and if 
there is one other risk factor postnatal thromboprophylaxis for 10 days should be considered.
Women with no personal history or risk factors for VTE but who have a family history of an 
unprovoked or estrogen-provoked VTE in a first-degree relative when aged under 50 years should 
be considered for thrombophilia testing. This will be more informative if the relative has a known 
thrombophilia.D

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5 of 40Antiphospholipid antibodies 
How should women with antiphospholipid antibodies be treated? 
Persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin and/or 
β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) in women without previous VTE should be considered as a risk factor 
for thrombosis (see Appendix I) such that if she has other risk factors she may be considered for 
antenatal or postnatal thromboprophylaxis as above.
Timing of initiation of thromboprophylaxis 
When should thromboprophylaxis be started?
Antenatal thromboprophylaxis for those with previous VTE should begin as early in pregnancy 
as practical.
Women without previous VTE and without particular first trimester risk factors or admission to 
hospital, but with four other risk factors, should be considered for antenatal prophylaxis throughout 
pregnancy.
Women without previous VTE and without particular first trimester risk factors or admission to 
hospital, but with three other risk factors, can start antenatal prophylaxis at 28 weeks of gestation.
First trimester risk factors
What are the first trimester risk factors for VTE and how should they be managed? 
Women admitted with hyperemesis should be considered for thromboprophylaxis with LMWH and 
can discontinue thromboprophylaxis when the hyperemesis resolves. 
Women with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should be considered for thromboprophylaxis 
with LMWH in the first trimester. 
Women with an IVF pregnancy and three other risk factors should be considered for 
thromboprophylaxis with LMWH starting in the first trimester. 
Thromboprophylaxis during labour and delivery, including the use of regional analgesia 
When should thromboprophylaxis be interrupted for delivery?
Women receiving antenatal LMWH should be advised that if they have any vaginal bleeding or once 
labour begins they should not inject any further LMWH. They should be reassessed on admission 
to hospital and further doses should be prescribed by medical staff.
Regional techniques should be avoided if possible until at least 12 hours after the previous 
prophylactic dose of LMWH.
LMWH should not be given for 4 hours after use of spinal anaesthesia or after the epidural catheter 
has been removed and the catheter should not be removed within 12 hours of the most recent injection.
When a woman presents while on a therapeutic regimen of LMWH, regional techniques should be 
avoided if possible for at least 24 hours after the last dose of LMWH.
Women receiving antenatal LMWH having an elective caesarean section should receive a 
thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH on the day prior to delivery and, on the day of delivery, any 
morning dose should be omitted and the operation performed that morning.C

PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists6 of 40The first thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH should be given as soon as possible after delivery 
provided there is no postpartum haemorrhage and regional analgesia has not been used.
Women at high risk of haemorrhage with risk factors including major antepartum haemorrhage, 
coagulopathy, progressive wound haematoma, suspected intra-abdominal bleeding and 
postpartum haemorrhage may be managed with anti-embolism stockings (AES), foot impulse 
devices or intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Unfractionated heparin (UFT) may also 
be considered.
If a woman develops a haemorrhagic problem while on LMWH the treatment should be stopped and 
expert haematological advice sought.
Thromboprophylaxis should be started or reinstituted as soon as the immediate risk of haemorrhage 
is reduced.
Thromboprophylaxis after delivery 
Assessment of risk
What are the risk factors for VTE after delivery?
All women with class 3 obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2) should be considered for 
prophylactic LMWH in doses appropriate for their weight for 10 days after delivery.
Women with two or more persisting risk factors listed in Table 1 should be considered for LMWH in 
prophylactic doses appropriate for their weight for 10 days after delivery.
Previous VTE
Which women with previous VTE need postpartum thromboprophylaxis?
All women with a previous history of confirmed VTE should be offered thromboprophylaxis with 
LMWH or warfarin for at least 6 weeks postpartum regardless of the mode of delivery.
Asymptomatic thrombophilia
Which women with thrombophilia without previous VTE need postpartum thromboprophylaxis? 
Women with thrombophilia without previous VTE should be stratified according to both the level of 
risk associated with their thrombophilia and the presence or absence of a family history or other 
risk factors.
Women with a family history of VTE and an identified thrombophilia should be considered for 
6 weeks’ postnatal thromboprophylaxis.
Caesarean section
What is the magnitude of risk of VTE after caesarean section?
All women who have had caesarean sections should be considered for thromboprophylaxis with 
LMWH for 10 days after delivery apart from those having an elective caesarean section who should 
be considered for thromboprophylaxis with LMWH for 10 days after delivery if they have any 
additional risk factors (see Appendix I and Table 1).P

CRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists7 of 40For how long should thromboprophylaxis be continued after delivery?
Risk assessment should be performed in each woman at least once following delivery and before 
discharge and arrangements made for LMWH prescription and administration (usually by the 
woman herself) in the community where necessary.
Thromboprophylaxis should be continued for 6 weeks in high-risk women and for 10 days in 
intermediate-risk women (see Appendix I and Appendix IV).
In women who have additional persistent (lasting more than 10 days postpartum) risk factors, 
such as prolonged admission, wound infection or surgery in the puerperium, thromboprophylaxis 
should be extended for up to 6 weeks or until the additional risk factor/s is/are no longer present.
Which agents should be used for thromboprophylaxis?
Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
LMWHs are the agents of choice for antenatal and postnatal thromboprophylaxis.
Doses of LMWH are based on weight. For thromboprophylaxis the booking or most recent weight 
can be used to guide dosing.
It is only necessary to monitor the platelet count if the woman has had prior exposure to 
unfractionated heparin (UFH).
Monitoring of anti-Xa levels is not required when LMWH is used for thromboprophylaxis.
Doses of LMWH should be reduced in women with renal impairment.
LMWH is safe in breastfeeding.
Unfractionated heparin
In women at very high risk of thrombosis (see Appendix IV), UFH may be used peripartum in 
preference to LMWH where there is an increased risk of haemorrhage or where regional anaesthetic 
techniques may be required.
If UFH is used after caesarean section (or other surgery), the platelet count should be monitored 
every 2–3 days from days 4–14 or until heparin is stopped.
Danaparoid
Potential use of danaparoid should be in conjunction with a consultant haematologist with 
expertise in haemostasis and pregnancy.
Fondaparinux 
Fondaparinux should be reserved for women intolerant of heparin compounds. 
Fondaparinux use in pregnancy should be in conjunction with a consultant haematologist with 
expertise in haemostasis and pregnancy.
Low-dose aspirin 
Aspirin is not recommended for thromboprophylaxis in obstetric patients.P

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists8 of 40Warfarin 
Warfarin use in pregnancy is restricted to the few situations where heparin is considered unsuitable, 
e.g. some women with mechanical heart valves.
Women receiving long-term anticoagulation with warfarin can be converted from LMWH to warfarin 
postpartum when the risk of haemorrhage is reduced, usually 5–7 days after delivery.
Warfarin is safe in breastfeeding.
Dextran
Dextran should be avoided antenatally and intrapartum because of the risk of anaphylactoid 
reaction.
Oral thrombin and Xa inhibitors
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) should be avoided in pregnant women.
Use of NOACs is not currently recommended in women who are breastfeeding.
Anti-embolism stockings 
The use of properly applied anti-embolism stockings (AES) of appropriate size and providing 
graduated compression with a calf pressure of 14–15 mmHg is recommended in pregnancy and the 
puerperium for women who are hospitalised and have a contraindication to LMWH. These include 
women who are hospitalised post-caesarean section (combined with LMWH) and considered to be 
at particularly high risk of VTE (e.g. previous VTE, more than four risk factors antenatally or more 
than two risk factors postnatally) and women travelling long distance for more than 4 hours.
Contraindications to LMWH
Which women should not be given thromboprophylaxis with LMWH?
LMWH should be avoided, discontinued or postponed in women at risk of bleeding after careful 
consideration of the balance of risks of bleeding and thrombosis.
Women with previous or current allergic reactions to LMWH should be offered an alternative 
preparation or alternative form of prophylaxis.
Further advice on the management of a woman with both VTE risk factors and bleeding risk factors 
or LMWH allergy may be sought from a haematologist with expertise in the management of 
thrombosis and bleeding disorders in pregnancy.
Risk scoring methodologies
A formal VTE risk assessment with numerical scoring for all pregnant and postpartum women is 
recommended (see Appendix IV).B

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists9 of 401. Purpose and scope 
The aim of this guideline is to provide advice, based on clinical evidence where available, regarding the 
prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy, birth and following delivery. For the 
diagnosis and management of acute VTE in pregnancy, please refer to Green-top Guideline No. 37b.1 For 
anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves in pregnancy, the reader is directed to the chapter covering 
this within the proceedings of the RCOG study group on heart disease.2 A summary of the guideline for 
antenatal and postnatal thromboprophylaxis is given in Appendix I.
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading direct cause of maternal death in the UK. There was a 
significant fall in the maternal mortality rate from PE (from 1.56 [95% CI 1.43–2.63] per 100 000 
maternities in 2003–2005 [33 deaths] to 0.70 [95% CI 0.49–1.25] per 100 000 maternities in 2006–2008 
[16 deaths]3,4) due largely to reductions in deaths from antenatal VTE (which fell from 11 to 3) and 
deaths from VTE after vaginal delivery (which fell from 8 to 2) and attributed to the first version of this 
guideline published in 2004.4
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) estimates that low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) reduces VTE risk in medical and surgical patients by 60% and 70% respectively.5 
Therefore it is reasonable to assume that it may substantially reduce the risk of VTE in obstetric patients. 
A Scandinavian study6 found a relative risk reduction of VTE of 88% in obstetric patients with one 
previous VTE given LMWH.
Seventy-nine percent and 89% of the women who died from PE in the UK between 2003 and 2005 and 
between 2006 and 2008 respectively had identifiable risk factors3,4 and a similar proportion (70%) from 
the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) cohort (n = 143) of fatal (3.5%) and nonfatal antenatal PE 
also had identifiable risk factors.7 
The UK incidence of antenatal PE calculated in the UKOSS study is 1.3 per 10 000 maternities.7 Although 
the relative risk of VTE in pregnancy is increased four- to six-fold8,9 and this is increased further 
postpartum,9–11 the absolute risk is low with an overall incidence of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium 
of 1–2 per 1000.8,12–17 Absolute incidence of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium is 107 per 100 000 
person-years (95% CI 93–122 per 100 000 person-years) in the UK,9 107 per 100 000 pregnancy-years 
during pregnancy and 175 per 100 000 puerperal-years during the puerperium in Denmark,17 and 175 
per 100 000 pregnancies (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] 121 per 100 000, PE 54 per 100 000) in Canada.16
Many fatal antenatal VTE events occur in the first trimester and therefore prophylaxis for women 
with previous VTE should begin early in pregnancy.18–20 The risk for VTE increases with gestational 
age, reaching a maximum just after delivery.8–10,16,17 Caesarean section is a significant risk factor12,21–24 
but women having vaginal deliveries are also at risk.3 The relative risk postpartum is five-fold higher 
compared to antepartum8 and a systematic review of risk of postpartum VTE found that the risk varied 
from 21- to 84-fold from the baseline nonpregnant, nonpostpartum state in studies that included an 
internal reference group.11 The absolute risk peaked in the first 3 weeks postpartum (421 per 100 000 
person-years; 22-fold increase in risk).9 
As the absolute risk of VTE in pregnancy is low, some form of risk stratification is required to determine 
which women warrant pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.25 The threshold for recommending 
postpartum thromboprophylaxis is lower than that for recommending antenatal thromboprophylaxis 
because the risk per day is higher and the duration of risk is shorter.26 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists10 of 403. Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-
top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects 
[DARE]), EMBASE, the ACP Journal Club and MEDLINE, including in-process and other non-indexed 
citations, were searched from 2009 to 2013 to identify all relevant randomised controlled trials, systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses published since the previous edition of the guideline. The databases were 
searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings. The 
principal search terms used were: ‘venous thromboembolism’, ‘thrombosis’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘postpartum’, 
‘puerperium’, ‘antenatal’, ‘prenatal’. The search was limited to humans and the English language. The 
National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant 
guidelines and reviews. A top-up search was performed in October 2014.
Current guidelines for the prevention of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium were reviewed.26–28 A 
Cochrane systematic review29 of randomised trials comparing one method of thromboprophylaxis with 
placebo or no treatment and randomised trials comparing two (or more) methods of thromboprophylaxis 
concluded that there is insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for thromboprophylaxis 
during pregnancy and the early postnatal period. The current guidelines are therefore drawn up 
recognising the limited evidence in this area. 
4. Prepregnancy and antenatal risk assessment 
4.1 What are the risk factors for VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium and what is the 
magnitude of risk for these factors?
All women should undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for VTE in early pregnancy or 
prepregnancy.
Risk assessment should be repeated if the woman is admitted to hospital for any reason or develops 
other intercurrent problems.
Risk assessment should be repeated again intrapartum or immediately postpartum.
Any woman with four or more current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than 
previous VTE or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic LMWH throughout the 
antenatal period and will usually require prophylactic LMWH for 6 weeks postnatally but a 
postnatal risk reassessment should be made.
Any woman with three current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than previous 
VTE or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic LMWH from 28 weeks and will 
usually require prophylactic LMWH for 6 weeks postnatally but a postnatal risk reassessment 
should be made.
Any woman with two current risk factors shown in Appendix I and Table 1 (other than previous VTE 
or thrombophilia) should be considered for prophylactic LMWH for at least 10 days postpartum.
Women admitted to hospital when pregnant (including to the gynaecology ward with hyperemesis 
gravidarum or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) should usually be offered thromboprophylaxis 
with LMWH unless there is a specific contraindication such as risk of labour or active bleeding.
The risk of VTE should be discussed with women at risk and the reasons for individual 
recommendations explained.C

PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists11 of 40The risk factors are listed in Table 1, Appendix II and Appendix III. For most risk factors the level of 
evidence is 2+ but it varies from 2– to 2++ depending on the risk factor. Some women can be identified 
to be at increased risk because of the presence of one or more well-documented risk factors.12,14–16,22–25,30–35
Appendix II summarises the odds ratios (ORs) for VTE associated with each risk factor derived from 
various studies. Women with multiple risk factors for VTE, even those who are not known to have a 
thrombophilia or a previous VTE, may be at greatly increased risk of VTE in pregnancy, especially in 
the third trimester and postpartum.9 Indeed, age greater than 35 years, obesity and caesarean section 
contribute most substantially to the rates of VTE because of their high and increasing prevalence.36
4.1.1 Previous VTE or thrombophilia 
Two well-recognised significant risk factors for VTE in pregnancy, identifiable before 
pregnancy, are thrombophilia and previous VTE.15,16 Heritable thrombophilia is found in 20–
50% of pregnancy-related VTE.37,38 A large retrospective study calculated an odds ratio of 24.8 
(95% CI 17.1–36) for previous VTE.32 Previous VTE and thrombophilia are discussed in more 
detail in sections 4.2 and 4.3 below.
4.1.2 Obesity 
Sixty percent of women who died from PE in the UK between 2003 and 2008 were obese 
(body mass index [BMI] 30 or higher)3,4 compared with the 20% prevalence of obesity in 
women aged 16–44 in the Health Survey for England 2010.39,40 Obesity is a risk factor for VTE in 
pregnancy7,12,31–33 and the risk is higher with increasing obesity.41 It is associated with a higher 
risk of PE (adjusted OR [aOR] 14.9, 95% CI 3.0–74.8) than of DVT (aOR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–11.9).33 
Being overweight (BMI 25–29.9), too, is a weak risk factor for pregnancy-related VTE and is 
extremely common, with a prevalence within the childbearing population of almost 50%.39 
4.1.3 Age 
Data for age are conflicting. Data from case–control studies (see Appendix II) have suggested a 
modest increased relative risk of less than two-fold for women aged over 35 years.14,16,31 In a UK 
study using a large population-based cohort,9 outside pregnancy, women in the oldest age band 
(35–44 years) had a 50% higher rate of VTE than women aged 25–34 years. The rate of VTE did 
not increase with age in the antepartum period; however, in the postpartum period women 
aged 35 and over had a 70% increase in risk compared to 25–34 year olds (corresponding to 
an excess absolute risk of 1.6 per 1000 person-years). A Korean study similarly found that 
increased age was not associated with VTE in pregnancy.24 However, for simplicity we have 
retained age greater than 35 years as a risk factor antenatally and postpartum.
4.1.4 Immobility and long-distance travel
For immobility and long-distance travel, data for pregnancy-related risk are limited and extrapolation 
from studies in nonpregnant patients is necessary.34
The NICE guideline on antenatal care42 and the RCOG Scientific Impact Paper on air travel in 
pregnancy43,44 state that long-haul air travel increases the risk of VTE; this guideline considers 
all long-distance (more than four hours) travel (not exclusively by air) to be a risk factor for 
VTE in pregnancy.
Some studies have demonstrated interaction between the effects of the risk factors listed 
in Table 1 and Appendix II. For example, in a Norwegian case–control study,12 BMI greater 
than 25 and antepartum immobilisation (defined as strict bed rest 1 week or more prior to Evidence

and postpartum VTE (aOR 40.1, 95% CI 8.0–201.5).
4.1.5 Admission to hospital
Admission to hospital during pregnancy is associated with an 18-fold increased risk of first 
VTE (adjusted incidence ratio 17.5, 95% CI 7.69–40.0) compared with time outside hospital and 
the risk remains increased after discharge, being six-fold higher in the 28 days after discharge. 
The risk is higher in the third trimester and in women over 35 years old. The risk of VTE 
during hospitalisation and after discharge are four-fold higher for admissions lasting less than 
3 days but 12-fold higher if 3 days or longer.45
4.1.6 Other risk factors
Examples of comorbidities which have been shown to be associated with an increase in 
the risk of VTE in pregnancy include active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),22,46 urinary 
tract infection,22 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), heart disease,16 pregnancy-induced 
hypertension/pre-eclampsia15,24 and non-obstetric antenatal surgery.47
Recent data using a primary care database containing 376 154 pregnancies between 1995 and 
2009 found that, in pregnancy, varicose veins, IBD, urinary tract infection and pre-existing 
diabetes were associated with an increased risk for VTE (absolute risks [ARs] ≥ 139/100 000 
person-years; incidence rate ratios [IRRs] ≥ 1.8).22 Analysing data from 1 475 301 Scottish 
maternity discharges, Kane et al.15 found that risk factors for VTE included three or more 
previous pregnancies, obstetric haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia.
An individual assessment of thrombotic risk should be undertaken before pregnancy, or in early 
pregnancy, and at each hospital admission. Appendix III provides a suggested checklist for 
documentation of this risk assessment. Early assessment is important in view of the increased 
thrombotic risks associated with complications in the first trimester. For example, in one study 
the odds ratio for VTE in women with hyperemesis gravidarum was 2.5 (95% CI 2–3.2)32 (see 
later for first trimester risk factors). This has implications for general practitioners, physicians 
and gynaecologists since many fatal antenatal VTE events occur in the first trimester3,18–20 and 
‘booking’ often does not occur until the end of the first trimester, after the stage at which 
thromboprophylaxis should have ideally begun.
Available evidence does not allow an accurate risk estimation of VTE to be determined from 
combinations of the different risk factors listed in Table 1 and Appendix II. Neither is this list 
exhaustive. There may be some conditions that increase the risk of VTE that are not listed. In 
general, active autoimmune and inflammatory conditions should be considered as risk factors. 
Multiple risk factors increase the risk of VTE.12 The risk of antenatal VTE is highest in the third 
trimester9,17,48 (see below under section 5).
Therefore, as a pragmatic approach to women with risk factors (except previous VTE; see below and 
Appendix I and Appendix III), it is suggested that thromboprophylaxis with LMWH be considered 
antenatally if there are four or more risk factors, from 28 weeks if there are three risk factors and 
postnatally if there are only two risk factors.Evidence

4.2 Previous VTE
How should women with previous VTE be managed in pregnancy? (see Appendix IV)
4.2.1 Single previous VTE
Women with previous VTE should be offered prepregnancy counselling and a prospective 
management plan for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy made. Those who become pregnant before 
receiving such counselling should be referred at the earliest opportunity in pregnancy to a clinician 
with expertise in thrombosis in pregnancy.
Women with previous VTE (except those with a single previous VTE related to major surgery 
and no other risk factors) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with LMWH throughout the 
antenatal period.P
CRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists14 of 40Women with previous VTE should have a careful history documented. Where objective documentation 
is not available, the previous diagnosis of VTE can be assumed in cases where the woman gives a 
good history and received prolonged (greater than 6 weeks) therapeutic anticoagulation.
Women with previous VTE have an increased risk of recurrence in pregnancy and 
postpartum15,16,32 with reported recurrence rates of 2–11%.27,50–53 A retrospective comparison of 
the recurrence rate of VTE during pregnancy and the nonpregnant period revealed recurrence 
rates of 10.9% during and 3.7% outside pregnancy, giving a relative risk during pregnancy of 
3.5 (95% CI 1.6–7.8).50 The risk of recurrence appears to be constant over the whole period 
of pregnancy.52,53
There are no randomised trials on which to base measures to prevent antenatal VTE in women 
with prior VTE and decisions are therefore based on estimates from observational studies. 
Evidence from prospective51 and retrospective53 studies suggests that the risk of antenatal 
recurrence is very low if the prior VTE was provoked by a transient major risk factor that is no 
longer present. Outside pregnancy, the recurrence risk is lower in those with VTE complicating 
major surgery than in those provoked by other transient nonsurgical risk factors.54
All women with prior VTE should receive postpartum prophylaxis15,16,32 as this is the period 
of greatest risk.
4.2.2 Thrombophilia-associated VTE
Heritable thrombophilia 
Women with previous VTE associated with antithrombin deficiency (who will often be on long-term 
oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher dose LMWH (either 50%, 
75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks postpartum or until 
returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery.
Management should be undertaken in collaboration with a haematologist with expertise in 
thrombosis in pregnancy and consideration given to antenatal anti-Xa monitoring and the potential 
for antithrombin replacement at initiation of labour or prior to caesarean section.
If anti-Xa levels are measured, a test that does not use exogenous antithrombin should be used 
and 4-hour peak levels of 0.5–1.0 iu/ml aimed for.
Other heritable thrombophilic defects are lower risk and can be managed with standard doses of 
thromboprophylaxis.
The evidence on which to base guidance on the prevention of recurrent VTE during 
pregnancy in women with thrombophilia remains limited. However, since most women 
with previous VTE will be offered thromboprophylaxis anyway, the presence of a heritable 
thrombophilia generally makes little difference to management and, outside pregnancy, 
heritable thrombophilias are at best weak predictors of recurrent VTE.55
Risks of recurrent VTE appear higher for those with a family history and deficiencies of 
the naturally occurring anticoagulants, particularly type 1 antithrombin deficiency (both 
activity and antigen reduced), than for those with heterozygous V Leiden or the prothrombin 
variant.56–60 Patients with prior VTE and type 1 antithrombin deficiency typically have a family 
history of VTE and are often on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Heparins may not be 
as effective in antithrombin deficiency as their mode of action is antithrombin-dependent. 
Although evidence is limited,61 they are likely to require intermediate or therapeutic dose C

postpartum or until converted back to long-term oral anticoagulation. Different subtypes of 
antithrombin deficiency are associated with different levels of VTE risk and therefore advice 
should be sought from a local expert in this area. Antithrombin replacement around the time 
of delivery has been suggested61,62 and might be considered in individual cases. 
Acquired thrombophilia – see also section 4.4 
Women with VTE associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (who will often be on long-
term oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher dose LMWH (either 
50%, 75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks postpartum or until 
returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery. 
Pregnant women with APS and prior VTE or arterial thromboses should be managed in collaboration 
with a haematologist and/or rheumatologist with expertise in this area. 
Women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and previous VTE are at high risk of recurrent 
VTE in pregnancy. A Canadian study found that APS was associated with an adjusted odds 
ratio for PE of 12.9 (95% CI 4.4–38.0), and for DVT 5.1 (95% CI 1.8–14.3).16 Many women with 
unprovoked or recurrent VTE diagnosed with APS will be on long-term oral anticoagulant 
therapy. There are no randomised controlled trial data to support recommendations for 
particular doses of LMWH in pregnancy. Case series support high prophylactic doses,63,64 but 
some authors recommend either intermediate (75%) or therapeutic full anticoagulant doses of 
LMWH26,65 and this may be appropriate for APS with recurrent previous VTE or arterial events.
4.2.3 Previous recurrent VTE
What extra advice is needed for women with previous recurrent VTE?
Advice regarding doses of LMWH in pregnancy should be sought from a clinician with expertise in 
haemostasis and pregnancy. 
Some women with previous recurrent VTE require higher doses of LMWH. 
Women on long-term warfarin or other oral anticoagulants should be counselled about the risks of 
these agents to the fetus (see section 8.6) and advised to stop their oral anticoagulant therapy and 
change to LMWH as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, ideally within 2 weeks of the missed period 
and before the sixth week of pregnancy. 
Women not on warfarin or other oral anticoagulants should be advised to start LMWH as soon as 
they have a positive pregnancy test. 
Individuals with recurrent VTE are at increased risk of further recurrence66,67 and many will 
be on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Although data are lacking, it would be expected 
that they would have a high risk of recurrence in pregnancy.
4.2.4 Stratification of women with previous VTE 
How should women with previous VTE be stratified to determine management in pregnancy?
Women with VTE associated with either antithrombin deficiency or APS or with recurrent VTE (who 
will often be on long-term oral anticoagulation) should be offered thromboprophylaxis with higher 
dose LMWH (either 50%, 75% or full treatment dose) (see Appendix IV) antenatally and for 6 weeks 
postpartum or until returned to oral anticoagulant therapy after delivery. These women require 
specialist management by experts in haemostasis and pregnancy. Evidence

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists16 of 40Women in whom the original VTE was unprovoked/idiopathic or related to estrogen (estrogen-
containing contraception/pregnancy) or related to a transient risk factor other than major surgery 
or who have other risk factors should be offered thromboprophylaxis with LMWH throughout the 
antenatal period. 
In women in whom the original VTE was provoked by major surgery from which they have recovered 
and who have no other risk factors, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH can be withheld antenatally 
until 28 weeks provided no additional risk factors are present (in which case they should be offered 
LMWH). They require close surveillance for the development of other risk factors.
Administration of antenatal LMWH depending on categorisation of women with prior VTE 
into higher and lower risk groups depending on the presence or absence of a temporary risk 
factor and/or thrombophilia was associated with a low risk of recurrence in a prospective 
German study.25 
These data and recent international guidelines5,26,68 support stratification of women with 
previous VTE into different risk categories requiring different levels of thromboprophylaxis 
(see Appendix I and Appendix IV). 
4.2.5 T esting for thrombophilia in women with prior VTE
Which women with prior VTE require thrombophilia testing?
Prior to testing for thrombophilia, women should be counselled regarding the implications for 
themselves and family members of a positive or negative result. The results should be interpreted 
by clinicians with specific expertise in the area. 
Women with a family history of VTE and either antithrombin deficiency or where the specific 
thrombophilia has not been detected should be tested for antithrombin deficiency. 
Women with an unprovoked VTE should be tested for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. 
It is important to be aware of the effects of pregnancy on the results of thrombophilia tests. 
These are described in another guideline.1 Thrombophilia testing should not be requested 
inappropriately and only if the finding of a thrombophilia would alter the proposed management. 
All women with prior VTE (see above) should be considered for thromboprophylaxis and 
hence testing for heritable thrombophilia is not routinely required.
Recent reviews of risk assessment for recurrent venous thrombosis recommend against testing 
routinely for thrombophilia.69,70 However, if thrombophilia testing is performed following 
an episode of VTE (e.g. following an unprovoked VTE episode and with a family history), 
it is preferable that this is done before pregnancy, both because pregnancy itself affects the 
estimation of protein S in particular and because it allows decisions on thromboprophylaxis 
to be considered in advance of pregnancy.
Women with previous VTE should not be screened for thrombophilia in pregnancy unless 
the result will influence recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis. Detection 
of antithrombin deficiency or APS will alter the dose of thromboprophylaxis offered in 
pregnancy and therefore screening for the former is indicated in women with previous 
VTE and a family history of VTE and either antithrombin deficiency or where the 
specific thrombophilia has not been detected and for APS in those with an unprovoked 
VTE. APS is not diagnosed unless lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin and/or 
β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies are positive on two occasions 12 weeks apart.71 D

level 4RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists17 of 404.3 Asymptomatic heritable thrombophilia 
How should women with asymptomatic thrombophilia be treated? (see Appendix IV)
Women should be stratified according to level of risk associated with their thrombophilia and the 
presence or absence of a family history or other risk factors. 
Women with asymptomatic antithrombin, protein C or S deficiency or those with more than one 
thrombophilic defect (including homozygous factor V Leiden, homozygous prothrombin gene 
mutation and compound heterozygotes) should be referred to a local expert and antenatal 
prophylaxis considered. They should be recommended for six weeks’ postnatal prophylaxis even 
in the absence of additional risk factors. 
Heterozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation or antiphospholipid antibodies are 
considered as risk factors for thrombosis in asymptomatic women (see Appendix I). In the presence 
of three other risk factors such women may be considered for antenatal thromboprophylaxis, if 
there are two other risk factors thromboprophylaxis should be considered from 28 weeks and if 
there is one other risk factor postnatal thromboprophylaxis for 10 days should be considered. 
Women with no personal history or risk factors for VTE but who have a family history of an 
unprovoked or estrogen-provoked VTE in a first-degree relative when aged under 50 years 
should be considered for thrombophilia testing. This will be more informative if the relative has a 
known thrombophilia. 
The role of testing for heritable thrombophilias in women with a family history but no personal 
history of VTE remains controversial, as does the management in pregnancy and following 
childbirth of any thrombophilic tendency that is thereby identified.26,68,72
Family history itself in the absence of an identifiable thrombophilic tendency is associated 
with an increased risk of VTE.73–75 It may be reasonable to consider case finding in high-risk 
thrombophilic families and in asymptomatic pregnant women with a family history of VTE 
in a first-degree relative aged under 50 years where the episode has been unprovoked or 
provoked by pregnancy, combined oral contraceptive exposure or the presence of a minor 
risk factor.55,68 Testing is more informative if the thrombophilic tendency in the proband is 
known. In contrast, thrombophilia testing is not required in pregnant women with other 
clinical risk factors indicating a need for thromboprophylaxis.
Recent prospective and retrospective family studies support the view that deficiencies of 
the naturally occurring anticoagulants (antithrombin, protein C and protein S) are of greater 
clinical significance than heterozygous carriage of factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene 
mutation.59,76 Recent studies have been consistent with a higher risk of pregnancy-related 
VTE in women who are antithrombin deficient or who are homozygous for factor V Leiden, 
the prothrombin gene mutation or are compound heterozygotes for factor V Leiden and the 
prothrombin gene mutation.61,62,77,78
Women should be stratified according to both the level of risk associated with their 
thrombophilia (see Table 2) and the presence or absence of a family history or other risk 
factors.79 The decision to offer antenatal thromboprophylaxis should be based on an estimate of 
the absolute risk of VTE during the pregnancy (and of the bleeding risk of prophylaxis) and this 
depends on the individual thrombophilic tendency, the details of the family history (number of 
affected relatives, age at which thrombosis developed, whether it was pregnancy- or estrogen-
associated and the presence or absence of additional risk factors in the affected relatives),80 the 
presence of additional clinical risk factors and the wishes of the individual woman.D

thrombophilias, standard doses can be used, with the exception of antithrombin deficiency 
where intermediate doses may be required.61
Antenatal thromboprophylaxis is not routinely required in women with a low-risk thrombophilic 
tendency (heterozygosity of factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation) unless there 
are additional clinical risk factors including a strong family history particularly of pregnancy-
related VTE. 
Homozygosity for a thermolabile variant of the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
(MTHFR) is sometimes included in thrombophilia testing but there is no evidence of an 
association with a clinically relevant increase in the risk of VTE in pregnancy and it should 
be ignored.81

4.4 Antiphospholipid antibodies 
How should women with antiphospholipid antibodies be treated? 
Persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin and/or 
β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) in women without previous VTE should be considered as a risk factor 
for thrombosis (see Appendix I) such that if she has other risk factors she may be considered for 
antenatal or postnatal thromboprophylaxis as above. 
Diagnostic criteria for APS, an acquired thrombophilic tendency, have been agreed.71 Management 
recommendations in this guideline are limited to the prevention of VTE and not that of other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes. 
The risk of VTE in women with obstetric APS characterised by recurrent miscarriage or fetal 
loss without prior VTE is unclear, but data from randomised trials suggest that the risk is 
low. Antenatal heparin therapy administered to improve pregnancy outcome in these trials 
was typically stopped between 35 weeks and delivery and no maternal VTE events were 
reported.90,91 In a series of 33 women with primary APS, there were no thromboses in women 
with APS but without previous VTE given 3–5 days’ thromboprophylaxis postpartum only.63
Antiphospholipid antibodies are sometimes detected because of a coagulation disturbance or 
connective tissue disorder in the absence of a history of thrombosis or obstetric problems.

way as V Leiden or the prothrombin variant and consider LMWH thromboprophylaxis if other 
risk factors are present. 
5. Timing of initiation of thromboprophylaxis 
5.1 When should thromboprophylaxis be started?
Antenatal thromboprophylaxis for those with previous VTE should begin as early in pregnancy 
as practical.
Women without previous VTE and without particular first trimester risk factors or admission 
to hospital, but with four other risk factors, should be considered for antenatal prophylaxis 
throughout pregnancy.
Women without previous VTE and without particular first trimester risk factors or admission to 
hospital, but with three other risk factors, can start antenatal prophylaxis at 28 weeks of gestation. 
Meta-analysis has shown that most VTE occurs antenatally with an equal distribution throughout 
gestation,94 but two-thirds of antenatal fatal pulmonary VTE in 2003–2005 occurred in the 
first trimester.3 Several studies have found that 40–50% of antenatal VTE occurred before 15 
weeks of gestation.18–20 These data emphasise the need for risk assessment prepregnancy and 
institution of prophylaxis if appropriate in early pregnancy. 
However, recent studies have demonstrated that the risk of antenatal VTE is highest in the 
third trimester. A Norwegian study48 found that, of all VTEs associated with pregnancy and 
postpartum, 10% occurred in each of the first and second trimesters and 28% in the third 
trimester; a UK study found that the rate of VTE during the third trimester was six times 
higher than outside pregnancy (IRR 6.1, 95% CI 4.7–7.9). In contrast, both the first (IRR 1.6) 
and second (IRR 2.1) trimesters conferred little increase in risk.9 In a Danish cohort study,17 the 
absolute risk of VTE per 10 000 pregnancy-years increased from 4.1 (95% CI 3.2–5.2) during 
the first trimester to 59.0 (95% CI 46.1–76.4) by week 40.
5.2 First trimester risk factors
What are the first trimester risk factors for VTE and how should they be managed? 
Women admitted with hyperemesis should be considered for thromboprophylaxis with LMWH and 
can discontinue thromboprophylaxis when the hyperemesis resolves.
Women with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should be considered for thromboprophylaxis 
with LMWH in the first trimester. 
Women with an IVF pregnancy and three other risk factors should be considered for 
thromboprophylaxis with LMWH starting in the first trimester. 
Certain additional risk factors may complicate the first trimester (Table 1 and Appendix II), 
such as hyperemesis,16,32 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and IVF.12,24,95,96 In a Norwegian 
case–control study12 assisted reproduction and multiple pregnancies had additive effects. 
Evidence from a Swedish study suggests that not only does IVF double the risk of VTE 
compared to natural conception, but the risk in the first trimester was four-fold higher 
and the risk of PE during the first trimester was seven times higher.97 Women with ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome are particularly prone to VTE in the upper body.95,96 At present 
it is unclear whether women undergoing surgical management of miscarriage and surgical 
termination of pregnancy are at increased risk of VTE.Evidence

When should thromboprophylaxis be interrupted for delivery?
Women receiving antenatal LMWH should be advised that if they have any vaginal bleeding or once 
labour begins they should not inject any further LMWH. They should be reassessed on admission 
to hospital and further doses should be prescribed by medical staff.
Regional techniques should be avoided if possible until at least 12 hours after the previous 
prophylactic dose of LMWH.
LMWH should not be given for 4 hours after use of spinal anaesthesia or after the epidural catheter 
has been removed and the catheter should not be removed within 12 hours of the most recent 
injection.
When a woman presents while on a therapeutic regimen of LMWH, regional techniques should be 
avoided if possible for at least 24 hours after the last dose of LMWH.
Women receiving antenatal LMWH having an elective caesarean section should receive a 
thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH on the day prior to delivery and, on the day of delivery, any 
morning dose should be omitted and the operation performed that morning.
The first thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH should be given as soon as possible after delivery 
provided there is no postpartum haemorrhage and regional analgesia has not been used.
Women at high risk of haemorrhage with risk factors including major antepartum haemorrhage, 
coagulopathy, progressive wound haematoma, suspected intra-abdominal bleeding and postpartum 
haemorrhage may be managed with anti-embolism stockings (AES), foot impulse devices or 
intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Unfractionated heparin (UFT) may also be considered.
If a woman develops a haemorrhagic problem while on LMWH the treatment should be stopped and 
expert haematological advice sought.
Thromboprophylaxis should be started or reinstituted as soon as the immediate risk of haemorrhage 
is reduced.
The pregnancy-associated prothrombotic changes in the coagulation system are maximal 
immediately following delivery. However, in order to allow for use of regional analgesia or 
anaesthesia and minimise the risk of epidural haematoma,98 women are advised to discontinue 
LMWH at the onset of labour or prior to planned delivery. Regional analgesia can be sited 
only after discussion with a senior anaesthetist, in keeping with local obstetric anaesthetic 
protocols.1 It is important to discuss the implications of treatment with LMWH for regional 
analgesia with the woman prior to labour or caesarean section. This could be undertaken in 
an antenatal anaesthetic clinic.
If LMWH is routinely prescribed at 6 p.m., this allows for an elective caesarean section the next morning, 
removal of the epidural catheter before 2 p.m. and a first postnatal dose of LMWH at 6 p.m. the same day.
In some women, particularly those on high-dose prophylactic or treatment doses of LMWH, 
there may be an indication for induction of labour to help plan thromboprophylaxis around 
delivery and facilitate a 24-hour window between the last dose of LMWH and regional 
analgesia.99 If LMWH precludes regional techniques (in, for example, the woman who presents 
in spontaneous labour within 12 hours of taking a LMWH dose), alternative analgesia such as 
opiate-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia can be offered.P

7.1 Assessment of risk
What are the risk factors for VTE after delivery?
All women with class 3 obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2) should be considered for 
prophylactic LMWH in doses appropriate for their weight for 10 days after delivery.
Women with two or more persisting risk factors listed in Table 1 should be considered for LMWH in 
prophylactic doses appropriate for their weight for 10 days after delivery.
Risk factors for VTE after delivery are summarised in Table 1, Appendix I and Appendix II. 
Nearly all women7,8 dying from VTE following vaginal delivery in the 2003–2005 Confidential 
Enquiry were overweight or obese or over the age of 40 years.
Additional risk factors relevant for postpartum thromboprophylaxis after delivery include 
prolonged labour, immobility, infection, haemorrhage and blood transfusion (see Appendix 
I, Table 1, Appendix II and Appendix III). Recent evidence supporting these obstetric 
complications as risk factors for VTE comes from several large population-based studies.15,16,22 
A Canadian population-based cohort study of around 7000 women with pregnancy-related 
hospitalisations for VTE from 1991–1992 to 2005–200616 identified major puerperal infection 
(aOR for PE 4.1, 95% CI 3.0–5.6; aOR for DVT 6.1, 95% CI 5.0–7.5) and blood transfusion (aOR 
for PE = 4.5, 95% CI 3.3–6.2; aOR for DVT 3.6, 95% CI 2.8–4.7) as risk factors for VTE. The 
study by Sultan et al.22 found that the strongest risk factor was stillbirth (AR 2444/100 000 
person-years; IRR 6.2) and the risk was also significantly increased with preterm birth (AR 
854/100 000 person-years, 95% CI 649–1124; IRR 2.69, 95% CI 1.99–3.65). These have therefore 
been added as risk factors in this edition of the guideline. 
7.2 Previous VTE
Which women with previous VTE need postpartum thromboprophylaxis?
All women with a previous history of confirmed VTE should be offered thromboprophylaxis with 
LMWH or warfarin for at least 6 weeks postpartum regardless of the mode of delivery.
Since the risk of VTE is higher postpartum8,9,17,52,53,94 than antenatally, all women with previous 
VTE need to continue their LMWH prophylaxis for 6 weeks postpartum. Those with recurrent 
VTE on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy need to continue their LMWH until switched 
back to warfarin or another oral agent.
7.3 Asymptomatic thrombophilia
Which women with thrombophilia without previous VTE need postpartum 
thromboprophylaxis? 
Women with thrombophilia without previous VTE should be stratified according to both the level of 
risk associated with their thrombophilia and the presence or absence of a family history or other 
risk factors. 
Women with a family history of VTE and an identified thrombophilia should be considered for 
6 weeks’ postnatal thromboprophylaxis.

DCBRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists22 of 407.4 Caesarean section
What is the magnitude of risk of VTE after caesarean section?
All women who have had caesarean sections should be considered for thromboprophylaxis with 
LMWH for 10 days after delivery apart from those having an elective caesarean section who should 
be considered for thromboprophylaxis with LMWH for 10 days after delivery if they have any 
additional risk factors (see Appendix I and Table 1).
Most women who suffer a VTE after caesarean section have other risk factors including twin 
pregnancy, obesity, severe pre-eclampsia, reoperation, immobilisation and placenta praevia.100 
Caesarean section is a risk factor for death from PE.3,4,101,102 Women delivered by elective 
caesarean section have at least double the postpartum risk of VTE compared with vaginal 
birth.21 The risk of postpartum VTE after an emergency caesarean section is twice that after 
an elective caesarean section and four times that after a vaginal delivery.12,103 Studies exploring 
the risk of VTE comparing all caesarean sections with vaginal delivery have found relative 
risks of 2–6.7.16,22,24,104
7.5 For how long should thromboprophylaxis be continued after delivery?
Risk assessment should be performed in each woman at least once following delivery and before 
discharge and arrangements made for LMWH prescription and administration (usually by the 
woman herself) in the community where necessary.
Thromboprophylaxis should be continued for 6 weeks in high-risk women and for 10 days in 
intermediate-risk women (see Appendix I and Appendix IV).
In women who have additional persistent (lasting more than 10 days postpartum) risk factors, 
such as prolonged admission, wound infection or surgery in the puerperium, thromboprophylaxis 
should be extended for up to 6 weeks or until the additional risk factor/s is/are no longer present.
The prothrombotic changes of pregnancy do not revert completely to normal until several weeks 
after delivery. The time of greatest risk for VTE is the early puerperium and, although most VTE 
occurs antenatally, the risk per day is greatest in the weeks immediately after delivery.8,9,17,52,53,94,105 
For women at high risk of postpartum VTE, the recommended duration of thromboprophylaxis 
is 6 weeks. Although laboratory evidence from thromboelastography (TEG) suggests correction 
of hypercoagulability by 4 weeks,106 clinical data from observational studies in Sweden,107 the 
USA,8,105 Norway48 and the Netherlands10 suggest that the increased risk of VTE persists for 6 
weeks postpartum, albeit less during weeks 5 and 6. The triennial UK confidential enquiries 
into maternal mortality between 1994 and 2005 suggest that the increased risk of fatal PE is 
still present in weeks 5 and 6 (a total of 15 deaths compared to 21 in weeks 3 and 4) and all six 
women who died from PE after caesarean section (2006–2008) died between 2 and 6 weeks 
after delivery, whereas fatal events after that are very rare.3,4,101,102,108 
There is little evidence to support recommendations regarding duration of postpartum 
thromboprophylaxis in women at intermediate risk of VTE. TEG data from 71 women post 
normal delivery showed that all parameters remained abnormal at 1 week postpartum and the 
authors suggested that 3–5 days’ thromboprophylaxis may be insufficient.106 The numbers of 
VTEs after caesarean sections were similar in weeks 1, 2 and 3 in one study.12 This suggests 
that caesarean section continues to be a significant risk factor for fatal PE and therefore it is 
important to extend the duration of prophylaxis in the presence of additional persistent (lasting 
more than 10 days postpartum) risk factors, such as prolonged admission or wound infection, 
for up to 6 weeks or until the additional risk factor/s is/are no longer present (see Appendix I).Evidence

Evidence 
level 2+RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists23 of 408. Which agents should be used for thromboprophylaxis?
8.1 Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
LMWHs are the agents of choice for antenatal and postnatal thromboprophylaxis.
Doses of LMWH are based on weight. For thromboprophylaxis the booking or most recent weight 
can be used to guide dosing.
It is only necessary to monitor the platelet count if the woman has had prior exposure to 
unfractionated heparin (UFH).
Monitoring of anti-Xa levels is not required when LMWH is used for thromboprophylaxis.
Doses of LMWH should be reduced in women with renal impairment.
LMWH is safe in breastfeeding.
LMWHs are as effective as and safer than unfractionated heparin (UFH) when used to prevent 
VTE in pregnancy.21,109–112 The risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is substantially 
lower with LMWH.109,110,113 Guidelines recommend against monitoring platelet count where 
LMWH is used and where there is no previous exposure to UFH.1,114 In a systematic review 
of 2777 pregnancies there were no cases of HIT.109 Prolonged UFH use during pregnancy 
may result in osteoporosis and fractures,115 but this risk is very low with LMWH.109,116–119 A 
systematic review of LMWH109 showed the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was 0.04% 
(95% CI 0.01–0.2) and that of allergic skin reactions was 1.8% (95% CI 1.34–2.37). More recent 
studies provide further evidence for the safety and efficacy of dalteparin,120 enoxaparin120 
and tinzaparin121 for prophylaxis in pregnancy. In the study of tinzaparin,121 three women 
developed bone fractures, but all had prior risk factors for osteoporosis (such as low BMI, 
previous osteoporosis, smoking, long-term steroid and/or other UFH/LMWH use).
Evidence for an increased risk of bleeding is more controversial. A systematic review found 
significant bleeding, usually related primarily to obstetric causes, occurred in 1.98% (95% CI 
1.5–2.57).109 This related to both treatment and prophylactic doses of LMWH and therefore the 
risk of bleeding is likely to be less than 2% with prophylactic doses.109 There is an increased 
risk of wound haematoma following caesarean section with LMWH of around 2%.6,109,122 
Some have found an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage6 but this is not supported by 
other studies.123 A Cochrane review29 of UFH or LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in women 
undergoing caesarean section found more bleeding or bruising episodes compared to women 
not receiving heparin (risk ratio 5.15).
Table 3 gives suggested prophylactic and therapeutic subcutaneous doses of LMWH in pregnancy and 
postpartum. There are no data to guide appropriate doses of LMWH for obese pregnant or puerperal 
women. The doses in Table 3 are only suggestions and doses for obese women are not evidence-based. 
In the UKOSS study,7 some overweight and obese women suffered a PE while receiving doses of LMWH 
prophylaxis appropriate for women of weights 50–90 kg.
Anti-Xa levels provide only a rough guide of the concentration of heparin present and provide 
little or no evidence on the efficacy in relation to prevention of thrombosis.124
Lower doses of LMWH should be employed if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/
minute (enoxaparin and dalteparin) or less than 20 ml/minute with tinzaparin.124 A creatinine 
clearance of 30 ml/minute equates to a serum creatinine of about 200 μmol/l for a 30-year-old 
woman weighing 70 kg.A

LMWH is safe and easy to use postpartum and has the advantage of not requiring monitoring. 
For those women receiving LMWH antenatally (and therefore for 6 weeks postpartum) or for 
those requiring 10 days’ postpartum thromboprophylaxis, it is the agent of choice. Experience 
of LMWH in the puerperium reports no problems during breastfeeding.109
8.2 Unfractionated heparin
In women at very high risk of thrombosis (see Appendix IV), UFH may be used peripartum in 
preference to LMWH where there is an increased risk of haemorrhage or where regional anaesthetic 
techniques may be required. 
If UFH is used after caesarean section (or other surgery), the platelet count should be monitored 
every 2–3 days from days 4–14 or until heparin is stopped.
The benefits of UFH are that it has a shorter half-life than LMWH and there is more complete 
reversal of its activity by protamine sulfate.125 So, for example, if no LMWH has been given 
for 24 hours but the woman has not yet delivered and there is concern about delaying further 
doses of anticoagulants, a prophylactic dose of 5000 iu subcutaneously of UFH could be used 
and repeated every 12 hours until LMWH can be resumed after delivery. The required interval 
between a prophylactic dose of UFH and regional analgesia or anaesthesia is less (4 hours) 
than with LMWH (12 hours)99 and there is less concern regarding neuraxial haematomas with 
UFH.98 Any exposure to UFH is associated with an increased risk of HIT.126
8.3 Danaparoid
Potential use of danaparoid should be in conjunction with a consultant haematologist with 
expertise in haemostasis and pregnancy.
Danaparoid is a heparinoid that is mostly used in patients intolerant of heparin, either because 
of HIT or a skin allergy to heparins. Experience in the use of this agent in a total of 91 pregnancies 
has been reviewed.127,128 There were six maternal bleeding events, two of which were fatal due 
to placental problems (praevia and abruption). Additionally there were seven early miscarriages 
and one neonatal death following emergency caesarean section at 28 weeks for fetal growth 
restriction. There were no adverse fetal outcomes attributed to danaparoid. Danaparoid seems 
reasonable to use in pregnancy when there is a requirement for anticoagulant prophylaxis 
or treatment and heparins cannot be used. The half-life of danaparoid is long (24 hours) and 
regional anaesthesia should be avoided in women receiving it for thromboprophylaxis.99 
Although direct evidence is limited, it seems likely that breastfeeding would be safe while on 
danaparoid since little if any appears in breast milk129 and oral absorption is unlikely.Evidence

PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 37a © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists25 of 408.4 Fondaparinux 
Fondaparinux should be reserved for women intolerant of heparin compounds.
Fondaparinux use in pregnancy should be in conjunction with a consultant haematologist with 
expertise in haemostasis and pregnancy.
Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that acts through inhibition of factor Xa 
via antithrombin. It is licensed in the UK for the prevention and treatment of VTE outside 
pregnancy and has a broadly similar efficacy to LMWH. There is limited experience of its 
use in pregnancy but it has been used in the setting of heparin intolerance with no reported 
hypersensitivity reactions or adverse effects on the fetus.130–137 No placental passage of 
fondaparinux was found in a human cotyledon model138 but anti-factor Xa activity about 10% 
of that in maternal plasma was found in the umbilical cord plasma in newborns of four of 
five mothers being treated with fondaparinux.139 No adverse effects were observed in the 
newborns. It does not seem necessary to alter the dose in pregnancy.131 It is unknown whether 
fondaparinux is excreted in breast milk but oral absorption seems unlikely. The half-life of 
fondaparinux is long (18 hours) and 36–42 hours should pass following the previous dose 
before it becomes acceptable to consider regional anaesthesia.99 Thus, although experience is 
limited, it seems likely that fondaparinux would be a reasonable alternative when there is a 
need for anticoagulant prophylaxis or treatment in pregnancy and heparins cannot be used.
8.5 Low-dose aspirin 
Aspirin is not recommended for thromboprophylaxis in obstetric patients. 
There are no controlled trials on the use of aspirin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy. 
Conclusions about its efficacy have been extrapolated from trials in the nonpregnant population. 
In the NICE guideline reviewing VTE prevention in hospitalised patients,5 300 mg or more of 
aspirin daily reduced the risk of postoperative DVT in patients undergoing a variety of surgical 
procedures. However, the benefit was modest in comparison to heparin and aspirin was not 
recommended for postoperative thromboprophylaxis. The Women’s Health Study140 found low-
dose aspirin no better than placebo for long-term primary prevention of VTE in older women. 
In contrast, two recent trials outside pregnancy suggested that after completion of treatment 
with warfarin, low-dose aspirin conferred a modest reduction compared to placebo in the risk 
of recurrent VTE in patients with a first unprovoked event.141,142 Overall, any benefit of aspirin 
in VTE prevention appears uncertain and significantly less than that of LMWH.
8.6 Warfarin 
Warfarin use in pregnancy is restricted to the few situations where heparin is considered unsuitable, 
e.g. some women with mechanical heart valves.
Women receiving long-term anticoagulation with warfarin can be converted from LMWH to warfarin 
postpartum when the risk of haemorrhage is reduced, usually 5–7 days after delivery.
Warfarin is safe in breastfeeding.
Warfarin crosses the placenta leading to an increased risk of congenital abnormalities including 
a characteristic warfarin embryopathy (hypoplasia of nasal bridge, congenital heart defects, 
ventriculomegaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, stippled epiphyses) in approximately 5% 
of fetuses exposed between 6 and 12 weeks of gestation.143–150 There is evidence that this 
incidence is dose-dependent with a higher incidence in women taking greater than 5 mg/
day.147–149 Other reported complications associated with warfarin therapy during pregnancy D

neurological problems in the baby153,154 and fetal and maternal haemorrhage.148,149
Warfarin can be safely used following delivery and in breastfeeding mothers, although it requires close 
monitoring and visits to an anticoagulant clinic and carries an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage 
and perineal haematoma compared with LMWH. It is not appropriate for those women requiring only 
10 days’ postpartum prophylaxis. However, it is appropriate for those on maintenance warfarin outside 
pregnancy. Conversion from LMWH back to warfarin should be delayed for at least 5–7 days after delivery 
to minimise the risk of haemorrhage during the period of overlap of LMWH and warfarin treatment.
8.7 Dextran
Dextran should be avoided antenatally and intrapartum because of the risk of anaphylactoid reaction.
Although dextran may reduce the risk of postoperative DVT outside pregnancy, the evidence 
is weak, it is less effective than LMWH and it appears to increase the risk of bleeding.155 
Anaphylaxis to dextran has been associated with uterine hypertonus, fetal distress, fetal 
neurological abnormalities and death.156,157
8.8 Oral thrombin and Xa inhibitors
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) should be avoided in pregnant women.
Use of NOACs is not currently recommended in women who are breastfeeding.
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs, previously known as new/novel oral anticoagulants) 
such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban work through direct inhibition of thrombin or factor Xa. 
They are not licensed for use in pregnancy where there is no experience in their use.
9. Anti-embolism stockings 
The use of properly applied anti-embolism stockings (AES) of appropriate size and providing 
graduated compression with a calf pressure of 14–15 mmHg is recommended in pregnancy and the 
puerperium for women who are hospitalised and have a contraindication to LMWH. These include 
women who are hospitalised post-caesarean section (combined with LMWH) and considered to be 
at particularly high risk of VTE (e.g. previous VTE, more than four risk factors antenatally or more 
than two risk factors postnatally) and women travelling long distance for more than 4 hours. 
There are no trials to support the use of AES in pregnancy and the puerperium and 
recommendations are largely derived from extrapolation from studies using AES in the 
hospitalised nonpregnant population158,159 Small studies have shown that AES significantly 
improve venous emptying in pregnant women160 and increase the blood flow while decreasing 
the lumen diameter of the superficial femoral161 and common femoral162 veins in late pregnancy 
and early postpartum patients.
Evidence from nonpregnant patients and other guidelines support the use of AES for patients 
at high risk of bleeding (unable to receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis), or where 
there is a contraindication to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis,26,163 or as an adjunct to 
anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients.
There are few data regarding the most efficacious length of AES to use in pregnancy and 
advice in the nonpregnant population is contradictory.26,164–167 More DVTs in pregnant women 
are iliofemoral compared to the nonpregnant population where calf vein DVTs are more Evidence

in the obstetric population, there is the added problem of full-length stockings becoming 
bloodstained. Therefore, on balance, properly applied full-length AES are advocated for 
pregnant women but knee-length AES should be considered if (as is often the case) full-length 
AES are ill-fitting or compliance is poor.
The role of graduated compression stockings providing greater than 23 mmHg support at the ankle 
for the prevention and/or treatment of the post-thrombotic syndrome rather than VTE prevention is 
discussed in Green-top Guideline No. 37b.
10. Contraindications to LMWH
Which women should not be given thromboprophylaxis with LMWH?
LMWH should be avoided, discontinued or postponed in women at risk of bleeding after careful 
consideration of the balance of risks of bleeding and thrombosis.
Women with previous or current allergic reactions to LMWH should be offered an alternative 
preparation or alternative form of prophylaxis.
Further advice on the management of a woman with both VTE risk factors and bleeding risk factors 
or LMWH allergy may be sought from a haematologist with expertise in the management of 
thrombosis and bleeding disorders in pregnancy. 
Risk factors for bleeding are summarised in Appendix III. LMWHs can increase bleeding if it 
occurs and therefore should be delayed in women with active bleeding, coagulopathy or low 
platelets (fewer than 75 x 109/l). LMWH is contraindicated in women with HIT. Women who 
develop allergic reactions to one LMWH will often be allergic to other LMWHs.5,26,109,115
11. Risk scoring methodologies
A formal VTE risk assessment with numerical scoring for all pregnant and postpartum women is 
recommended (see Appendix IV).
Compared with not using a formal assessment system, Shoenbeck et al. found there was a 
significant increase in the rate of risk assessment, earlier treatment and greater consistency in 
clinical decision making with the use of a numerical scoring system. This approach maintains 
a highly individualised assessment of VTE risk while achieving consistency in management.168
12. Recommendations for future research 
l Doses of LMWH required in obese pregnant and puerperal women.
l At present it is unclear whether women undergoing surgical management of miscarriage and 
surgical termination of pregnancy are at increased risk of VTE.
l How do risk factors for VTE interact in the antenatal and postpartum periods?
l How do we reduce/avoid the prevalence of risk factors for VTE?
l Should thromboprophylaxis vary with different heritable thrombophilias?

• If total score ≥ 4 risk factors antenatally , consider thromboprophylaxis from the first trimester.
• If total score 3 risk factors antenatally , consider thromboprophylaxis from 28 weeks.
• If total score ≥ 2 risk factors postnatally , consider thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days.
• If admitted to hospital antenatally consider thrombopr ophylaxis.
• If readmitted to hospital within the puerperium consider thromboprophylaxis.
For patients with an identified bleeding risk, the balance of risks of bleeding and thrombosis should be discussed 
in consultation with a haematologist with expertise in thrombosis and bleeding in pregnancy.

Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in 
making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematically 
developed using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical 
Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website 
at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate 
an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual 
patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. 
It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine 
practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated. 
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations 
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
At least one meta-analysis, systematic reviews 
or randomised controlled trial rated as 1++, and 
directly applicable to the target population; or

The review process will commence in 2018, unless otherwise indicated.
DISCLAIMER
 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice. 
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by 
obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular 
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented 
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to 
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols 
or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
