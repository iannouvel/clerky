Management of Patients Admitted for Urinary Incontinence Surgery

Key Principles:
A protocol is a set of measurable standards for action. Professional judgement may be used in application.

Scope:
Applies to all women attending for urinary incontinence surgery.

Responsibilities:
Nursing staff and gynaecologists must follow the guidance and use professional judgement.

Urinary Incontinence:
15-30% of women over 65 and up to 50% of nursing home residents have urinary incontinence. It has adverse effects on quality of life.

Pre-Operative Management:
Patients need to fast from midnight and follow routine observation and enhanced recovery programme.

Post-Operative Bladder Care:
Most operations do not require catheter or pack insertion. Ensure patient passes urine before discharge and monitor for retention symptoms.

Management of PVR/TWOC:
Assess post void residual within 4 hours of return from theatre. High residuals may require catheterization.

Post-Operative Prescription and Follow-Up:
Patients can eat and drink once conscious. Can go home after passing urine and feeling well. Follow-up in Urogynecology clinic as planned.
