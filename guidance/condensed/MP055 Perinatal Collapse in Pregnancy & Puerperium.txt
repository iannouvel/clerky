Perinatal Collapse in Pregnancy & Puerperium
Maternity Protocol: MP055
Date agreed: March 2022
University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust East

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This protocol applies to all seriously ill women and all women found collapsed in the peri-partum period.

Responsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians are responsible for accessing, reading, understanding, and following this guidance. Management is responsible for ensuring the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations.

Maternal Collapse in Pregnancy and the Puerperium: Maternal collapse is a rare but life-threatening event, with a wide-ranging etiology. Prompt and effective resuscitation is crucial for the outcome of both the mother and fetus.

Immediate Emergency Resuscitative Management: Call for help, check for signs of life, initiate basic life support, give oxygen, obtain venous access, initiate fluid resuscitation, and institute advanced life support as needed.

Process for the Use of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning System (MEOWS): The MEOWS chart should be used for antenatal patients, postnatal women with risk factors, complications, or surgical intervention. Regular observations and assessments are essential for early recognition of deterioration.

Roles and Responsibilities of Staff Groups: Midwives, Obstetricians, Anaesthetists, and all team members should follow specific guidelines for the management of severely ill pregnant women. Fast bleep the Obstetric Registrar in case of obvious clinical deterioration or loss of consciousness.

Guidance for staff on when to involve clinicians from outside the maternity service: Specialist clinicians should be involved when complications beyond common obstetric issues arise, after discussion with the maternity team and Consultant on call.

In conclusion, prompt and effective resuscitation is essential in cases of maternal collapse during pregnancy and the puerperium. Proper use of the MEOWS chart and involvement of specialist clinicians when necessary are key components of management.

Haematologist and microbiologists play key roles in managing blood related disorders and sepsis/infection/antibiotic issues, respectively. Obstetrician, anaesthetic consultant and ITU consultant collaborate for ITU admissions. Major obstetric haemorrhage is a common cause of maternal collapse, with causes including postpartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and ectopic pregnancy. Prompt delivery of fetus and placenta is crucial for managing antepartum haemorrhage. Cardiovascular events, thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, drug toxicity, eclampsia, intracranial haemorrhage, and anaphylaxis are other important considerations in managing maternal collapse. Expert multidisciplinary teams and specific management protocols are essential for optimal outcomes.

Evidence of severe perioperative obstetric anaphylaxis is between 1 and 3.5 per 100 000, with a mortality rate of approximately 1%. Anaphylaxis is likely when sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms, life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems, and skin and/or mucosal changes are present. Exposure to a known allergen for the woman supports the diagnosis. In cases of anaphylaxis, all potential causative agents should be removed, and the ABCDE approach to assessment and resuscitation followed. Treatment for anaphylaxis includes adrenaline, chlorphenamine, and hydrocortisone. Other causes of collapse in pregnant women include hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and other metabolic and electrolyte disturbances. Aortocaval compression can occur from around 20 weeks of gestation onwards, reducing venous return in the supine position. Maternal collapse resuscitation should follow the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines using the standard ABCDE approach. If maternal cardiac arrest occurs in the community, basic life support should be administered and rapid transfer arranged. Manual displacement of the uterus to the left is effective in relieving aortocaval compression in women above 20 weeks' gestation. Intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube should be performed immediately by an experienced anaesthetist. Supplemental high flow oxygen should be administered as soon as possible to counteract rapid deoxygenation. Chest compressions should be commenced immediately if there is no cardiac output. Delivery of the fetus and placenta should be considered within 5 minutes of maternal collapse. Outcomes for mothers and babies depend on the cause of collapse, gestational age, and access to emergency care. Accurate documentation and incident reporting are essential in all cases of maternal collapse. All maternity staff should have annual formal multidisciplinary training in ABLS and the management of maternal collapse.

Debriefing is recommended for the woman, the family, and the staff involved in the event. Maternal collapse can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, postnatal depression, and tocophobia. Debriefing is an important part of holistic maternity care and should be offered by a competent professional to support the ongoing mental health of all concerned.
