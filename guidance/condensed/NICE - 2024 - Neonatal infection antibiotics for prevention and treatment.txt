81This guideline par tially r eplaces CG149 . 
This guideline is t he basis of QS7 5 and QS37 . 
This guideline should be r ead in conjunction wit h NG2 40. 
Overview 
This guideline co vers pr eventing bact erial inf ection in healt hy babies of up t o and including 
28 da ys corr ected gestational age, tr eating pr egnant w omen whose unborn bab y is at risk 
of inf ection, and caring f or babies of up t o and including 28 da ys corr ected gestational age 
with a suspect ed or confirmed bact erial inf ection. It aims t o reduce dela ys in r ecognising 
and tr eating inf ection and pr event unnecessar y use of antibiotics. The guideline does not 
cover viral inf ections. 
The guideline uses t he terms 'w oman' or 'mot her' t hroughout. These should be tak en to 
include people who do not identify as w omen but ar e pregnant or ha ve giv en bir th. 
Similarly , wher e the term 'par ents' is used, t his should be tak en to include an yone who has 
main r esponsibility f or caring f or a bab y. We recognise t here are man y diff erent f amily 
arrangement s. 
Who is i t for? 
• Healt hcare professionals in primar y and secondar y car e 
• Commissioners and pr oviders of neonatal and mat ernity ser vices 
• Parents and car ers of babies who ar e at risk of or who ha ve a neonatal inf ection Neonatal inf ection: antibiotics f or pr evention and tr eatment (NG195)

about t heir bab y's healt h and car e, and t o be giv en inf ormation and suppor t to enable 
them t o do t his, as set out in t he NHS Constitution and summarised in NICE's 
information on making decisions about y our car e. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations and has inf ormation about pr escribing 
medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds and laws 
(including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding. 
Please not e that t he Royal College of Obst etricians and Gynaecologist s has pr oduced 
guidance on CO VID-19 and pr egnancy f or all midwif ery and obst etric ser vices . The 
Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Healt h has published guidance on CO VID-19 
for neonatal ser vices . 
Throughout t his guideline, unless ot herwise specified, t he term neonatal inf ection co vers 
both early-onset and lat e-onset inf ections.

• do not dela y treatment, but when possible giv e the bab y's par ents and car ers 
time t o think about t he inf ormation t hey have been giv en and ask an y 
questions t hey ma y have bef ore making tr eatment decisions. [2021] 
1.1.3 If giving antibiotics because of clinical concerns about possible early- or lat e-
onset neonatal inf ection , discuss wit h par ents and car ers: 
• the reason f or the tr eatment 
• the risks and benefit s in r elation t o their bab y's cir cumstances 
• the obser vations and in vestigations t hat might be needed t o guide tr eatment 
(for example, t o help decide when t o stop tr eatment) 
• the pr eferred antibiotic r egimen (including ho w it will be deliv ered) and lik ely 
duration of tr eatment 
• the impact, if an y, on wher e the w oman or her bab y will be car ed for. [2021]

These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. The y link t o details of t he evidence and a full description of t he 
committ ee's discussion. 
Informa tion and suppor t 
Recommendations 1 .1.1 to 1.1.11, and 1 .1.15 to 1.1.16 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee decided t hat some of t he inf ormation and suppor t recommendations in t he 
2012 v ersion of t he NICE guideline on neonatal inf ection f or the families of babies wit h 
early-onset inf ection w ere also applicable t o the families of babies who ma y develop lat e-
onset inf ection. 
The 2012 v ersion of t he guideline on early-onset inf ection r ecommended t hat par ents and 
carers of babies wit h risk f actors f or early-onset inf ection should be giv en verbal and 
writt en inf ormation on t he signs and sympt oms of inf ection. This is par ticularly impor tant 
when t he bab y already has risk f actors t hat indicat e they ma y develop inf ection. Ho wever, 
the committ ee not ed that an y bab y can de velop an inf ection, e ven if t hey are not identified 
as high risk at t he time of dischar ge. The committ ee therefore thought it was impor tant 
that all par ents and car ers should be giv en inf ormation about t he signs and sympt oms of 
neonatal inf ection bef ore their bab y is dischar ged fr om hospital. 
The committ ee also want ed to ensur e that t he signs of inf ection list ed in t he 
recommendations w ere writt en in simple language t hat f amilies could understand, rat her 
than using clinical t erminology . Ther efore, examples of t he most common br eathing 
problems e xperienced b y babies wit h neonatal inf ection w ere added t o the 
recommendation on signs and sympt oms. 
The committ ee thought it was impor tant t hat inf ormation was giv en in accessible f ormat s, 
including diff erent languages wher e appr opriat e to ensur e that inf ormation was equally 
accessible to all. The y not ed these principles ar e out lined in t he NICE guideline on patient 
experience in adult NHS ser vices and so cr oss-r eferred to this guideline. Neonatal inf ection: antibiotics f or pr evention and tr eatment (NG195)

These r ecommendations ha ve been adapt ed fr om t he existing guidelines f or early-onset 
neonatal inf ection, r eflecting standar d practice. As such, t hey are not e xpect ed to have a 
substantial impact on practice. Expanding t he recommendation on signs and sympt oms so 
that advice is giv en to all par ents and car ers will mean t hat mor e families will be awar e of 
the signs of inf ection and will kno w to seek medical help if t heir bab y develops an y of 
them.

Recommendations 1 .1.12 to 1.1.14 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee made r ecommendations based on e vidence on t he views of par ents and 
carers, and based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience. 
The committ ee emphasised t he need t o discuss t he issues co vered in t he 
recommendations wit h par ents and car ers of babies wit h bact erial meningitis, t o giv e them 
the chance t o ask questions, and t o repeat inf ormation o ver time. This is because people 
may be distr essed and unable t o ask questions or understand inf ormation when t heir bab y 
is first admitt ed to hospital.

Recommendations 1 .2.1 to 1.2.5 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
No new e vidence was identified since 2012, when t he pr evious v ersion of t he guideline 
was published. The committ ee extended t he 2012 r ecommendation on antibiotics f or 
group B str eptococcus t o cover women who had colonisation in a pr evious pr egnancy . This 
was because gr oup B str eptococcus colonisation in a pr evious pr egnancy gr eatly 
increases t he chance of being colonised in futur e pregnancies. The committ ee w ere 
concerned about a w oman not r eceiving tr eatment because of a f alse negativ e test result, 
and so t hey decided t o specify t hat a negativ e test should be fr om enrichment cultur e or 
polymerase chain r eaction (PCR) on r ectovaginal swab samples. Alt hough some t ests ma y 
have higher f alse positiv e rat es, all w omen wit h positiv e tests should be tr eated as if t hey 
have GBS so t hat no babies who ar e at higher risk of inf ection ar e missed. 
For women in pr e-term labour and w omen wit h a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, 
there was no e vidence identified on t he eff ects on intrapar tum antibiotics on t he number 
of neonatal inf ections. Ho wever, antibiotics did r educe t he number of mat ernal inf ections 
in women in pr e-term labour . The committ ee also agr eed t hat pr e-term labour and 
chorioamnionitis ar e impor tant risk f actors f or neonatal inf ection, so intrapar tum antibiotics 
are very likely to reduce t he risk t o the bab y. Chorioamnionitis is a serious inf ection t hat 
needs t o be tr eated wit h antibiotics t o prevent harm t o the mot her. The committ ee thought 
that it was impor tant t o mak e recommendations f or antibiotic tr eatment t hat w ould 
simultaneously tr eat inf ection in t he mot her and pr event early-onset gr oup B str eptococcal 
infection in t he bab y to mak e the best use of antibiotics. 
The committ ee retained t he recommendations on using benzylpenicillin as first -choice 
antibiotic fr om t he 2012 guideline. Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, gentamicin 
and metr onidaz ole ar e also no w recommended f or women wit h chorioamnionitis, because 
chorioamnionitis can be caused b y Gram positiv e or negativ e aer obic and anaer obic 
bacteria, so clinicians need t o use br oad-spectrum antibiotics t hat ar e eff ectiv e against 
both. Once-daily dosing f or gentamicin was r ecommended based on t he kno wledge and 
experience of t he committ ee because 8 hourly dosing has additional monit oring 
requir ement s and w ould need additional nursing time f or administration. 
The committ ee also pr ovided guidance on alt ernativ es for women wit h a penicillin aller gy, Neonatal inf ection: antibiotics f or pr evention and tr eatment (NG195)
© NICE 202 4. All right s reserved. Subject t o Notice of right s (https://www .nice.or g.uk/t erms-and-
conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 55
of 81based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience. The committ ee amended t he 2012 
recommendation on antibiotic alt ernativ es for women who ar e aller gic to penicillin. The y 
changed t he recommended antibiotic fr om clindam ycin because t here is e vidence of 
resistance t o group B str eptococcus emer ging wit h clindam ycin, meaning t hat t his 
antibiotic should no longer be used r outinely . Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, 
the committ ee recommended a cephalosporin wit h activity against gr oup B str eptococcus 
as an alt ernativ e for women wit h a penicillin aller gy that was not se vere, and v ancom ycin 
or an alt ernativ e antibiotic wit h activity against gr oup B str eptococcus in t he case of 
severe penicillin aller gy. The committ ee w ere awar e of t he possibility of aller gic reaction t o 
cephalosporins in w omen wit h a hist ory of penicillin aller gy. For women wit h a hist ory of 
penicillin aller gy that was not se vere they thought t hat t his risk was small and was 
outw eighed b y the benefit s of using cephalosporins t o treat chorioamnionitis and pr event 
neonatal inf ection. The y not ed that cephalosporins should be used wit h caution in t hese 
women. Cephalosporins w ere not r ecommended in t he case of se vere penicillin aller gy 
because of an incr eased chance of a se vere aller gic reaction t o cephalosporins. Se vere 
penicillin aller gy refers t o a hist ory of aller gy to penicillin wit h eff ects that ar e clearly lik ely 
to be aller gic in natur e such as anaph ylaxis, r espirat ory distr ess, angioedema or ur ticaria. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Many of t he recommendations r emain t he same as in t he 2012 guideline. The 
recommendations on intrapar tum antibiotics ha ve been e xtended t o cover women in pr e-
term labour wit hout pr elabour ruptur e of membranes, w omen wit h chorioamnionitis and 
women wit h group B str eptococcus colonisation in a pr evious pr egnancy . However, these 
changes r eflect curr ent practice, as man y of t hese w omen alr eady r eceiv e intrapar tum 
antibiotics. 
The committ ee expect ed that t he recommendation on intrapar tum antibiotics f or 
chorioamnionitis w ould ha ve the gr eatest impact on clinical practice. Ther e is curr ently 
variation in which antibiotics ar e giv en to women wit h chorioamnionitis, wit h some unit s 
prescribing br oad-spectrum antibiotics t o treat inf ection in t he mot her and benzylpenicillin 
to prevent inf ection in t he bab y. Recommending a combination of narr ow-spectrum 
antibiotics f or women wit hout an aller gy to penicillin is lik ely to reduce t he use of br oad-
spectrum antibiotics, which will impr ove antibiotic st ewar dship.

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The e vidence suggest ed that immediat e deliv ery can r esult in a r educed risk of a bab y 
developing neonatal inf ection when a mot her is betw een 34 and 37 weeks' gestation and 
has pr olonged pr elabour ruptur e of membranes and a positiv e test result f or gr oup B 
streptococcus. The e vidence did not indicat e any significant harms t o the bab y from 
choosing immediat e deliv ery over expectant management. Ther efore, the committ ee 
decided t hat, giv en the pot ential serious consequences of a bab y developing neonatal 
infection, a r ecommendation in f avour of immediat e deliv ery was impor tant. This was 
further suppor ted by the economic e vidence, which sho wed not only a clinical benefit t o 
immediat e deliv ery but also lo wer associat ed cost s in comparison t o expectant 
management, which has incr eased ant enatal cost s and higher rat es of inf ections. 
The committ ee made a recommendation f or resear ch on e xamining t he healt h-related 
quality of lif e impact on par ents or car ers when a bab y has neonatal inf ection . This 
information was not a vailable and w ould ha ve impr oved ho w well the economic model truly 
reflect ed the cost s and healt h consequences of neonatal inf ection. 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice 
This r ecommendation could incr ease t he number of w omen who ar e off ered immediat e 
deliv ery when t hey have bot h prolonged pr elabour ruptur e of membranes and a positiv e 
test for gr oup B str eptococcus. This in turn could r educe t he number of babies who need

be monit ored throughout t he expectant management period. The e xact impact of t hese

Before bir th 
No e vidence was f ound t hat r elated specifically t o this topic, and t he committ ee agr eed 
that t he recommendations fr om t he pr evious v ersion of t his guideline still r eflect ed curr ent 
best practice so did not need t o be changed. These r ecommendations apply t o all w omen

Assessing and managing t he risk of early-onset neonatal inf ection aft er bir th 
The committ ee based t heir r ecommendations on e vidence on t he accuracy of clinical 
decision models f or early-onset neonatal inf ection, as w ell as e vidence on individual 
neonatal and mat ernal risk f actors. 
Ther e was uncer tainty about ho w well the Kaiser P ermanent e neonatal sepsis calculat or

of inf ection t hat w ere confirmed b y blood cultur e. This was a pr oblem f or the framew ork

effectiv eness and saf ety of t he Kaiser P ermanent e calculat or which can be used t o inform 
decisions on it s use in futur e updat es of t his guideline. 
The committ ee decided t o specify t hat t he Kaiser P ermanent e calculat or should only be 
used f or babies who ar e being car ed for in a neonatal unit (neonatal int ensiv e car e unit s, 
local neonatal unit s and special car e unit s), transitional car e or a postnatal war d. The 
committ ee highlight ed ho w it w ould be mor e difficult t o collect t he inf ormation needed f or 
the audit in ot her settings. The y did not t hink t he calculat or should be r ecommended f or 
use in t he emer gency depar tment, as babies who ar e brought in fr om home ar e likely to 
already be sho wing signs of being unw ell and t herefore need mor e immediat e treatment 
than babies who ar e being assessed f or risk of inf ection in a neonatal unit. In t hese cases, 
waiting t o consult t he calculat or could inst ead dela y treatment. The committ ee also 
thought t hat t he calculat or was not appr opriat e for use in a midwif e-led unit or 
freestanding midwif ery unit as t here is curr ently no e vidence t hat has used t he calculat or 
in these settings. 
As there was only limit ed new e vidence, t he framew ork f or assessing and managing risk, 
involving r ed flag indicat ors and ot her indicat ors of inf ection, has been r etained fr om t he 
2012 guideline. The committ ee select ed the red flag indicat ors as t hose t hat, based on 
their clinical e xperience, ar e the most high-risk f actors t hat need immediat e treatment. 
Non-r ed flag indicat ors ar e those t hat can ha ve causes ot her t han neonatal inf ection and 
therefore do not alwa ys signal t he need f or immediat e treatment. Man y of t he clinical 
indicat ors mat ched t hose in t he 2012 guideline, wit h the following changes. 
Parenteral antibiotics ar e no longer a risk f actor. Since t he 2012 guideline, awar eness of 
the risks of mat ernal sepsis has incr eased and t here has been a f ocus on early tr eatment 
with antibiotics. This has led t o mor e babies being pr escribed antibiotics e ven when a 
maternal inf ection is not str ongly suspect ed. This rise in antibiotic use can r esult in babies 
being unnecessarily e xposed t o the side eff ects associat ed wit h antibiotics, such as 
nephr otoxicity , as w ell as incr easing a bab y's lengt h of sta y in hospital. Incr eased antibiotic

onset inf ection. Of t he ot her diagnostic t ests, only C-r eactiv e protein has enough e vidence 
to recommend it. It is not accurat e enough t o be used as an alt ernativ e to blood cultur e, 
but when used in combination it can impr ove the accuracy of t he diagnosis. The 
committ ee discussed ho w a single C-r eactiv e protein measur ement is not sufficient t o

recommend t hat a C-r eactiv e protein sample is tak en when star ting antibiotics. This will 
provide clinicians wit h a baseline against which t o compar e futur e C-r eactiv e protein 
result s, to indicat e whet her a bab y is lik ely to have infection, whet her t hey are responding

the gold standar d test for diagnosing neonatal inf ection but using it in combination wit h C-
reactiv e protein measur ement s will allo w babies who do not need antibiotics t o stop taking 
them sooner . 
As the evidence f or lat e-onset inf ection lined up wit h the evidence fr om t he 2012 guideline

Ther e was limit ed evidence on lumbar punctur e specifically f or lat e-onset inf ection. 
However, lumbar punctur e is t he 'gold standar d' test for identifying meningitis, and it was 
recommended in t he 2012 guideline f or babies wit h early-onset inf ection. The committ ee 
extended t his recommendation t o cover bot h early- and lat e-onset neonatal inf ection, as 
they felt that t he benefit s of identifying meningitis outw eighed t he risks of t he pr ocedur e. 
No e vidence was identified t hat suppor ted using urine cultur e or skin swabs in t he

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e is v ariation acr oss t he countr y in antibiotic r esistance patt erns and in which 
organisms ar e most lik ely to cause lat e-onset neonatal inf ection. Because of t his, local 
data needs t o be used when choosing antibiotics. 
Babies in a neonatal unit ar e likely to have been e xposed t o diff erent bact eria t han babies 
at home, so t he committ ee made separat e recommendations f or the 2 groups. 
For babies in a neonatal unit, t he committ ee did not belie ve there was enough e vidence t o 
recommend specific antibiotics, and so made a recommendation f or resear ch int o the best 
antibiotic r egimen t o treat lat e-onset inf ection . However, the evidence a vailable did sho w 
that combinations of narr ower-spectrum antibiotics ar e as eff ectiv e as br oader -spectrum 
antibiotics. The committ ee w ere awar e that using br oad-spectrum antibiotics in babies is 
associat ed wit h altered gut flora, incr eased risk of in vasive fungal inf ection and t he 
development of antibiotic r esistance, and so a combination of narr ow spectrum antibiotics 
was r ecommended as first -line tr eatment. 
For babies who ha ve been admitt ed fr om home, t here was also limit ed evidence on which 
antibiotics t o use. The NICE guideline on suspect ed sepsis recommends tr eating 
community-acquir ed sepsis wit h ceftriax one or cef otaxime depending on gestational age. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t hese antibiotics w ould be appr opriat e for lat e-onset neonatal 
infection in babies who ha ve been admitt ed fr om home, and none of t he evidence f or this 
group contradict ed it. 
Ther e was no e vidence on duration of antibiotic tr eatment f or lat e-onset inf ection. 
However, the 2012 guideline made r ecommendations on t his for early-onset inf ection, and 
the committ ee adapt ed these so t hat t hey were applicable t o late-onset inf ection. The 
duration of initial tr eatment is r ecommended t o be 48 hours rat her t han 36 hours as

making decisions about antibiotic tr eatment f or lat e-onset inf ection. 
No e vidence on tr eatment duration was identified, and so t he committ ee made 
recommendations based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience. The committ ee 
recommended a tr eatment of 7 da ys for babies wit h a positiv e blood cultur e, consist ent 
with the recommendation on early-onset neonatal inf ection fr om t he 2012 v ersion of t he 
guideline. The committ ee recommended t hat a shor ter treatment duration should be used 
when no pat hogen is identified (t he blood cultur e is negativ e) or t he pat hogen is a 
common commensal. In t hese situations, t he committ ee not ed that inf ection was lik ely to 
be less se vere and could be saf ely tr eated wit h a shor ter treatment duration, which w ould 
have the adv antage of r educing e xposur e to antibiotics, which is consist ent wit h the 
principles of good antibiotic st ewar dship. The committ ee also specified situations when a 
longer tr eatment duration should be used, such as when t here is intra-abdominal co-

These r ecommendations will help t o reduce t he use of br oad-spectrum antibiotics as first -
line tr eatment f or babies in neonatal unit s, which ma y help r educe antibiotic r esistance. 
However, use of narr ow-spectrum antibiotics is alr eady standar d practice in man y unit s, 
and t he cost s of antibiotics ar e low, so t here is e xpect ed to be v ery little impact on

Antifung als to pr event fung al inf ection during

Recommendation 1 .12.1 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Evidence fr om randomised contr olled trials sho wed that bot h nystatin and fluconaz ole can 
reduce t he risk of a bab y developing an in vasive fungal inf ection in comparison t o placebo 
or no tr eatment. Evidence mar ginally f avoured the use of n ystatin o ver fluconaz ole for 
reducing t he risk of fungal inf ection and based on t he kno wledge and e xperience of t he 
committ ee, n ystatin is bett er tolerat ed and t here is a lo wer risk of fungi de veloping 
resistance t o this antifungal t han fluconaz ole. Economic e vidence sho wed that n ystatin 
was also lik ely to be t he most cost -effectiv e option, and so t he committ ee recommended 
oral n ystatin f or antifungal pr ophylaxis when a bab y is being giv en antibiotics f or lat e-
onset neonatal inf ection. The r ecommendation f or antifungal pr ophylaxis was limit ed to 
babies belo w 1,500 g or 30 weeks' gestational age because t he evidence was fr om babies 
in these population gr oups. 
Although oral n ystatin was t he committ ee's first choice f or antifungal pr ophylaxis, oral 
administration of antifungals ma y not be possible f or all babies, par ticularly t hose who ar e 
very prematur e. The committ ee therefore specified t hat t he use of intra venous fluconaz ole 
is appr opriat e when oral administration is not possible. 
The committ ee made a recommendation f or resear ch for studies in vestigating t he optimum 
regimen f or giving antifungal pr ophylaxis when tr eating a bab y wit h antibiotics f or lat e-
onset inf ection , because e vidence was not a vailable t o suppor t specific r ecommendations 
on the duration and dose of antifungal tr eatment t hat should be used. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
This r ecommendation ma y incr ease t he number of babies who ar e giv en nystatin as

reasonable t o extrapolat e much of t his e vidence t o newborn babies, because meningitis 
can ha ve similar impact s on people r egar dless of age. 
Based on t his e vidence, t he committ ee agr eed t hat people wit h bact erial meningitis should 
not be dischar ged fr om hospital until f ollow-up needs ha ve been identified and planned

Neonatal bact erial inf ection is a significant cause of mor tality and morbidity in newborn 
babies. Par ent or ganisations and t he scientific lit eratur e repor t that t here can be 
unnecessar y dela ys in r ecognising and tr eating sick babies. In addition, concern about t he 
possibility of neonatal inf ection is common. This concern is an impor tant influence on t he 
care giv en to pregnant w omen and newborn babies. Ther e is wide v ariation in ho w the risk 
of neonatal inf ection is managed in healt hy babies. The appr oach tak en by the NHS needs 
to: 
• prevent neonatal inf ection when possible 
• prioritise t he tr eatment of sick babies 
• minimise t he impact of management pat hways on healt hy women and babies 
• use antibiotics wisely t o avoid t he de velopment of r esistance t o antibiotics.

• Babies wit h suspect ed neonatal inf ection should r eceiv e treatment as quickly as
