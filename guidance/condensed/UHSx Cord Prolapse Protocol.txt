Clinical Protocol: Cord Prolapse Management

Cord prolapse is defined as the descent of the umbilical cord through the cervix alongside or past the presenting part in the presence of ruptured membranes. The overall incidence ranges from 0.1% to 0.6%. Risk factors include long cord, breech presentation, and artificial rupture of membranes. Additional risk is associated with balloon induction of labor. 

Antenatal care for pregnant women with predisposing factors includes review by an Obstetric Consultant/Registrar and urgent presentation if signs of labor are present. In the hospital setting, immediate action is required upon diagnosis of cord prolapse, including summoning help and preparing for a caesarean section. 

Debriefing should be offered postnatally to reduce the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Training in the management of obstetric emergencies, including cord prolapse, should be provided annually. Clinical incident forms should be submitted for all cases of cord prolapse, and audits should be conducted in both hospital and community settings.
