Antenatal care guideline by NICE outlines the organization and delivery of antenatal care, routine antenatal clinical care, information and support for pregnant women and their partners, and interventions for common problems during pregnancy. It emphasizes the importance of involving partners in care decisions and providing comprehensive care for pregnant women. The guideline also includes recommendations for starting antenatal care, antenatal appointments, and involving partners in the care process.

Consider reviewing the woman's previous medical records if needed, including records held by other healthcare providers. Be aware that women and babies from some minority ethnic backgrounds and those who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of death and may need closer monitoring and additional support. Assess the woman's risk of and, if appropriate, discuss female genital mutilation (FGM) in a kind, sensitive manner. Refer the woman for a clinical assessment by a doctor to detect cardiac conditions if there is a concern based on the pregnant woman's personal or family history. Refer the woman to an obstetrician or other relevant doctor if there are any medical concerns or if review of current long-term medicines is needed. Ask the woman about domestic abuse in a kind, sensitive manner at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for venous thromboembolism at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for gestational diabetes at the first antenatal appointment. Assess the woman's risk factors for pre-eclampsia at the first antenatal appointment and again in the second trimester. Measure and record the woman's blood pressure at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a urine dipstick test for proteinuria at every routine antenatal appointment. Offer a risk assessment for fetal growth restriction at the first antenatal appointment, and again in the second trimester. Offer symphysis fundal height measurement at each antenatal appointment after 24+0 weeks. If there are concerns about the symphysis fundal height, consider an ultrasound scan for fetal growth and wellbeing.

1.2.34 Discuss the topic of babies' movements with the woman after 24 weeks, ask about concerns and advise to contact maternity services if needed.
1.2.35 Structured fetal movement awareness packages have not been shown to reduce stillbirth rates.
1.2.36 Offer abdominal palpation after 36 weeks to identify possible breech presentation.

1.3.17 Discuss prolonged pregnancy options after 38 weeks.
1.3.18 Provide support for women with babies at increased risk of neonatal admission.
1.3.19 Offer appropriate information and support based on risk factors.

1.3.23 Discuss the potential benefits of peer support with pregnant women (and their partners), and explain how it may provide practical support, help to build confidence, and reduce feelings of isolation.
1.3.24 Offer pregnant women (and their partners) information about how to access local and national peer support services.

1.3.25 Advise women to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks of pregnancy and to consider using pillows to maintain their position while sleeping.
1.3.26 Explain to the woman that there may be a link between going to sleep on her back and stillbirth in late pregnancy (after 28 weeks).

1.4 Interventions for common problems during pregnancy
Nausea and vomiting
1.4.1 Reassure women that mild to moderate nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy and are likely to resolve before 16 to 20 weeks.
1.4.2 Recognize that by the time women seek advice from healthcare professionals about nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, they may have already tried a number of different interventions.
1.4.3 For pregnant women with mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting who prefer a non-pharmacological option, suggest that they try ginger.
1.4.4 When considering pharmacological treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different antiemetics with the woman. Take into account her preferences and her experience with treatments in previous pregnancies.
1.4.5 For pregnant women with nausea and vomiting who choose a pharmacological treatment, offer an antiemetic.
1.4.6 For pregnant women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting, consider intravenous fluids, ideally on an outpatient basis, and consider acupressure as an adjunct treatment.
1.4.7 Consider inpatient care if vomiting is severe and not responding to primary care or outpatient management. This will include women with hyperemesis gravidarum.

Models of antenatal care and the identification of breech presentation were discussed, as well as the management of severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Recommendations were made based on the need for timely access to antenatal care, involvement of partners, and the importance of taking and recording the woman's history. The impact on practice was considered, with a focus on improving care for women without major changes in practice.

Addressing inequalities is important in antenatal care. It is essential to discuss a woman's past and present conditions and experiences to identify potential risks and tailor care to her needs. This includes reviewing medication use and discussing home and family situations. Healthcare professionals should be aware of disparities in maternal mortality rates among different populations and address them. It is crucial to inquire about domestic abuse and female genital mutilation to provide appropriate support and safeguarding. Identifying underlying cardiac problems is also important to prevent maternal mortality. Antenatal appointments allow for monitoring and reassessment of care needs. Overall, the recommendations aim to improve current best practices in antenatal care.

The committee discussed the importance of fetal movements and the need for structured fetal movement awareness packages. Evidence did not show a significant benefit from these packages, but the committee agreed that fetal movements should be routinely discussed and women's concerns taken seriously. There is no agreed definition of normal fetal movements, so discussions on changes throughout pregnancy are important. The recommendations on fetal growth monitoring reflect current practice, with potential changes in offering ultrasound scans after 28 weeks. Managing reduced fetal movements should follow the NHS saving babies' lives care bundle. The recommendations on breech presentation and communication emphasize informed decision-making and listening to women's needs. Providing information about antenatal care and scheduling appointments can improve engagement and follow-up. Antenatal classes can benefit women, especially nulliparous women, and should be accessible to all groups. Peer support during the antenatal period can be valuable, especially for specific subpopulations. Lastly, recommendations on sleep position aim to reduce the risk of stillbirth and babies being born small for gestational age.

28 weeks if women fall asleep on their backs. The committee agreed that there is some uncertainty about this risk because the evidence was from relatively small studies whose design made it difficult to assume that sleep position caused the adverse outcomes. Further research is unlikely because conducting sufficiently powered prospective cohort studies is not feasible given the relatively low incidence of stillbirth. On balance, the committee agreed that the evidence was strong enough to advise women to try to avoid going to sleep on their back after 28 weeks.

The committee recognized the potential anxiety and feelings of guilt that women may experience if they wake up on their backs. Healthcare professionals may need to spend more time talking to women about sleep position in pregnancy, but the recommendations are not expected to have a significant cost or resource impact.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect daily functioning and quality of life. The committee agreed that it is important to reassure pregnant women who experience mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting that these are common symptoms in early pregnancy and will usually settle later in the second trimester. Some women prefer non-pharmacological treatments while others may prefer pharmacological treatments, so both options are recommended.

There was evidence that ginger is effective in treating mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting in pregnancy compared with placebo. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and ondansetron were also found to be effective in improving symptoms. The committee recommended considering acupressure for women with moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting as an additional treatment. No recommendation was made on the use of corticosteroids for severe nausea and vomiting in pregnant women.

The treatment options for heartburn in pregnancy reflect current clinical practice. Lifestyle and diet information may help alleviate symptoms. Antacids and alginates are recommended as they are equally effective. No recommendations were made on acupuncture or proton pump inhibitors.

Limited evidence on the effectiveness of treatments for symptomatic vaginal discharge in pregnant women led the committee to base their recommendations on their knowledge and clinical experience. Antifungal treatments for vaginal candidiasis and antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis were recommended, either orally or vaginally. No recommendations were made for metronidazole to treat symptomatic vaginal discharge due to vaginal trichomoniasis.

Exercise advice from a physiotherapist may reduce pelvic girdle pain intensity and functional disability. Referral to physiotherapy services is recommended, as non-rigid lumbopelvic belts together with general information and advice were found to reduce pain intensity.

No evidence was identified about adverse effects of using a lumbopelvic belt. Providing a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt was also found to be cost-effective, but due to limited clinical evidence, a strong recommendation was not made. Manual therapy alone was not found to have any benefits for women with pelvic girdle pain. The evidence for acupuncture to treat pelvic girdle pain was mixed and of poor quality, therefore not enough to justify a recommendation with substantial resource impact. Providing a lumbopelvic belt is not current practice in all units, so the recommendation may have cost implications. However, health economic modeling showed that it is cost-effective even if women are referred for physiotherapy. The recommendation may increase the number of pregnant women seeking referral to physiotherapy services.

Unexplained vaginal bleeding after 13 weeks should prompt a review in secondary care for monitoring, administering corticosteroids, and neonatal unit care if the baby is born preterm. Hospitalization should be considered for these cases. Recommendations reflect current practice. 

Around 660,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year. The antenatal period is crucial for providing support, information, and assessing the risk of complications. Good quality antenatal care is essential to identify and address potential problems and reduce the chance of poor outcomes for both the woman and the baby. This guideline covers routine antenatal care for all women. It does not cover specialized care for women with underlying medical conditions or obstetric complications.
