Management of Bladder Pain Syndrome
Initial clinical assessment should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, completion of a bladder diary, and testing for urinary tract infections. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Severity of BPS can be classified using validated symptom scores and visual analogue scales for pain. Initial management may include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Intravesical treatments such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, and dimethyl sulfoxide may be considered if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Further treatment options should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Referral to secondary care should be considered for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Physiotherapy and psychological support may be beneficial for patients with refractory BPS. Long-term follow-up in secondary care may be necessary until symptoms are controlled. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin.

Pelvic pain should be thoroughly investigated, including history of physical or sexual abuse. Physical examination should rule out bladder distension, hernias, and trigger points. Baseline investigations include bladder diary, food diary, and urine tests. Differential diagnoses should be considered, and BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Bladder biopsies and hydrodistention are not recommended for diagnosis. Conservative treatments include dietary modifications, stress management, and analgesia. Pharmacological treatments may include oral amitriptyline or cimetidine if conservative treatments fail.

Multimodal therapy may be considered if single drugs are unsuccessful, but should be commenced by consultants with special expertise and consideration of multidisciplinary input. Intravesical treatments, such as lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, botulinum toxin A, dimethyl sulfoxide, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate, may be added or substituted if conservative and oral treatments are unsuccessful. Options should be individualized based on clinical team expertise. Further treatment options, such as cystoscopic fulguration, neuromodulation, oral cyclosporin A, cystoscopy, and major surgery, should be considered after referral to a pain clinic and discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting. Treatments not recommended include oral hydroxyzine, oral pentosan polysulfate, long-term antibiotics, intravesical resiniferatoxin, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, high-pressure long-duration hydrodistension, and long-term oral glucocorticoids. Referral to a physiotherapist, pain team, or clinical psychologist should be considered for additional support. Patients should be followed up periodically in secondary care until symptoms are controlled, with consideration for shared care between the pain team and urogynaecology. Support groups can provide additional resources for patients.

The effect of pregnancy on the severity of BPS symptoms can be variable. Treatment options safe in pregnancy include oral amitriptyline and intravesical heparin. DMSO should be avoided in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects. Limited information is available on changes in symptoms during pregnancy. Patients with mild symptoms may experience worsening during pregnancy, while those with severe symptoms may see improvement. Oral amitriptyline is the safest oral treatment option in pregnancy. Heparin is the safest intravesical treatment. Lidocaine crosses the placenta, and corticosteroids may have long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Sacral nerve stimulators should be turned off during pregnancy. There is limited evidence on a genetic predisposition for BPS. DMSO should be avoided during pregnancy. Recommendations for future research include creating a standardized assessment questionnaire and assessing the role of conservative treatments for BPS. Useful links and support groups are available for BPS patients.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist clinicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. Each guideline is developed using a standardized methodology and should be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs and resources. The evidence used in guidelines is graded based on the quality of research studies. Recommendations are formulated based on the evidence level. It is important to note areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be needed.
