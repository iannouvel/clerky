1.1 Current e vidence on t he saf ety and efficacy of lapar oscopic t echniques 
for hysterectomy (including lapar oscopically-assist ed vaginal 
hysterectomy [LAVH], lapar oscopic h ysterectomy [LH], lapar oscopic 
supracer vical h ysterectomy [LSH] and t otal lapar oscopic h ysterectomy 
[TLH]) appears adequat e to suppor t their use, pr ovided t hat normal 
arrangement s are in place f or consent, audit and clinical go vernance. 
1.2 Clinicians should advise w omen t hat t here is a higher risk of urinar y tract 
injury and of se vere bleeding associat ed wit h these pr ocedur es, in 
comparison wit h open sur gery. 
1.3 Advanced lapar oscopic skills ar e requir ed for these pr ocedur es, and 
clinicians should under go special training and ment orship. The R oyal 
College of Obst etricians and Gynaecologist s has de veloped an Adv anced 
Training Skills Module, 'Benign Gynaecological Sur gery: Lapar oscop y'.

2 The pr ocedure 
2.1 Indic ations 
2.1.1 Hyst erectomy is per formed f or a v ariety of benign conditions t hat ha ve 
not r esponded t o conser vative management, including hea vy menstrual 
bleeding, sympt omatic ut erine fibr oids, chr onic pelvic pain and ut erine 
prolapse. Hyst erectomy is also per formed f or cancer of t he ut erus 
(including cer vical cancer) and o varies. 
2.1.2 A con ventional 'open' h ysterectomy involves removal of t he ut erus 
through an abdominal or a v aginal appr oach. 
2.2 Outline o f the pr ocedure 
2.2.1 This guidance does not co ver lapar oscopic radical h ysterectomy (see 
3.1). Under general anaest hesia, small incisions ar e made in t he abdomen 
to allo w inser tion of a lapar oscope and sur gical instrument s. 
2.2.2 In TLH and LSH, t he entir e procedur e is per formed lapar oscopically , 
including division of t he ut erine v essels. In TLH t he cer vix is r emoved, 
while in LSH it is left in situ. 
2.2.3 In LAVH and LH, par t of t he operation is per formed lapar oscopically and 
part vaginally . Uterine v essel division is per formed v aginally in L AVH and 
lapar oscopically in LH. 
2.2.4 In all of t he abo ve procedur es, the ut erus can be r emoved eit her t hrough 
the open v ault of t he vagina or one of t he abdominal por ts. 
2.3 Efficacy 
2.3.1 A syst ematic r eview and meta-analysis r epor ted that in nine randomised 
contr olled trials (RCT s) including 948 w omen and comparing Lapar oscopic t echniques f or hysterectomy (IPG239)

abdominal h ysterectomy (AH), t he average lengt h of hospital sta y was 
2.0 days shor ter (95% confidence int erval [CI] 1 .9 to 2.2) in t he 
lapar oscopic gr oup. 
2.3.2 The syst ematic r eview and meta-analysis r epor ted that in six RCT s 
including 520 w omen and comparing lapar oscopic t echniques (type not 
specified) wit h AH, w omen in t he lapar oscopic gr oup r eturned t o normal 
activities on a verage 13 .6 days earlier (95% CI 11 .8 to 15.4) than t hose in 
the AH gr oup. 
2.3.3 The syst ematic r eview and meta-analysis r epor ted that in six RCT s 
including 842 w omen and comparing lapar oscopic t echniques (type not 
specified) wit h vaginal h ysterectomy (VH), t here was no significant 
difference betw een t he techniques in t he need f or unint ended 
lapar otomy (odds ratio [OR] 1 .55, 95% CI 0 .75 to 3.21). In a non-
randomised contr olled study , con version t o lapar otomy was r equir ed in 
7% (82/12 42) of w omen who under went lapar oscopic pr ocedur es. 
2.3.4 One case series r epor ted con version t o lapar otomy in 0 .83% (14/1692) of 
women under going LSH. Anot her case series r epor ted con version t o 
lapar otomy in 2. 79% (46/1647) of w omen who under went TLH. F or mor e 
details, r efer to the 'Sour ces of e vidence' section. One Specialist Adviser 
consider ed lapar oscopic t echniques f or hysterectomy to be established 
practice and anot her consider ed them t o be no vel and of uncer tain 
efficacy and saf ety. 
2.3.5 One Specialist Adviser consider ed lapar oscopic t echniques f or 
hysterectomy to be established practice and anot her consider ed them t o 
be no vel and of uncer tain efficacy and saf ety. 
2.4 Safety 
2.4.1 In a non-randomised contr olled study of 37 ,048 w omen under going 
hysterectomy, 0/1154 of t hose tr eated wit h lapar oscopic t echniques f or 
hysterectomy (type not specified) died, but 14 tr eated wit h non-
lapar oscopic t echniques died wit hin 6 w eeks of t he sur gery (0.04%, 95% 
CI 0.025 t o 0.064). A non-randomised contr olled study of 10 ,110 w omen Lapar oscopic t echniques f or hysterectomy (IPG239)

procedur es (type not specified) died during t he con valescence period 
(not ot herwise defined), compar ed wit h 0.06% (1/1801) of w omen who 
had VH and 0 .02% (1/587 5) of w omen who had AH (significance le vel not 
stated). The aut hors stat ed that t he causes of deat h were alcoholic 
cirrhosis, car diac inf arct and pulmonar y embolism, and w ere not dir ectly 
related to the operation. 
2.4.2 The non-randomised contr olled study of 37 ,048 w omen r epor ted that t he 
incidence of major operativ e haemorrhage was significant ly higher (p < 
0.001) f or lapar oscopic t echniques (4 .4%, 51/1154) t han f or VH (2. 0%, 
218/11 ,122) or AH (2. 3%, 571/2 4,772). Ho wever, the non-randomised 
contr olled study of 10 ,110 w omen r epor ted no significant diff erence in 
perioperativ e haemorrhage betw een lapar oscopic t echniques, VH and 
AH. 
2.4.3 A case series of w omen under going LH r epor ted haemorrhage r equiring 
blood transfusion in 0 .3% (5/1648). The case series of w omen 
under going TLH r epor ted that blood transfusion was r equir ed for 0.97% 
(16/1647). 
2.4.4 The syst ematic r eview and meta-analysis and t he non-randomised 
contr olled study of 10 ,110 w omen f ound t hat t he incidence of urinar y 
tract injuries was significant ly higher among w omen who under went 
lapar oscopic pr ocedur es (type not specified) t han t hose who had AH 
(meta-analysis: OR 2. 61, 95% CI 1 .22 t o 5.60, 10 RCT s, n = 1912; non-
randomised study: 1 .1% vs 0 .2% f or ur eteric injur y and 1 .3% vs 0 .5% for 
bladder injur y, p < 0 .0001). Ther e was no significant diff erence in t he 
incidence of bo wel injur y betw een lapar oscopic t echniques and AH in 
either study (meta-analysis: tw o RCT s, n = 1066; non-randomised study:

2.4.5 Comparing lapar oscopic t echniques wit h VH, t he meta-analysis f ound no 
significant diff erence f or urinar y tract injur y (six RCT s, n = 805), bo wel

Comparing lapar oscopic t echniques wit h VH, t he non-randomised

2.4.8 A case series of 5104 w omen who under went lapar oscopic pr ocedur es 
(type not specified) r epor ted ur eteric injur y in 66 w omen (1 .3%), simple 
bladder injur y in 22 (0 .4%), v esico vaginal fistula in 12 (0 .2%), int estinal 
injury in 15 (0 .3%) and major v ascular injur y in 1 (0 .02%). 
2.4.9 In a case series of 1405 w omen under going LSH in volving electric 
morcellation of t he ut erus, adenom yosis was r epor ted in 0 .6% (8/1405) 
of women, all of whom had been tr eated for sympt omatic menorrhagia 
due t o submucosal m yomas. Sympt oms of t he adenom yosis occurr ed 
betw een 2 and 9 y ears aft er LSH and included pelvic pain and deep 
dyspar eunia. Lapar oscopic sur gery was r equir ed to mak e a final 
diagnosis of t he tumours and t o remove them. F or mor e details, r efer to 
the 'Sour ces of e vidence' section. 
2.4.10 Both Specialist Advisers consider ed special training t o be necessar y and 
to have impor tant implications f or saf ety. The y consider ed theor etical 
adverse e vents to be injur y to the ur eter and bo wel, vascular injur y,
