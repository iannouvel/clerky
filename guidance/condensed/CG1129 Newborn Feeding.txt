Newborn Feeding Guideline: 
This guideline supports patient care by providing evidence-based guidance for supporting mothers in newborn feeding in accordance with UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiation standards. It aims to increase breastfeeding rates and improve outcomes for children and families. The guideline covers responsibilities of staff, the Baby Friendly Initiative Care Standard, and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. It applies to all staff involved in newborn care and emphasizes the importance of breastfeeding and supporting mothers' feeding choices.

Strum provides essential nutrients for babies and acts as a laxative for passing meconium stools. Skin-to-skin contact after birth is crucial for breastfeeding initiation. Mothers separated from their baby on the neonatal unit should start expressing milk as soon as possible. Safety measures should be taken during skin-to-skin contact. Breastfeeding support and assessments are important in the first week after birth. Exclusive breastfeeding is encouraged for optimal outcomes. Modified feeding regimes may be necessary in certain cases. Supplementation should be limited and offered responsively. Finger feeding using a syringe can be used for small amounts of colostrum. Larger volumes can be administered using a tube and finger method.

Condensed Version:

Finger feeding and cup feeding are alternative feeding methods for babies. Finger feeding involves placing a finger in the baby's mouth to allow them to suck and draw milk. Cup feeding uses a soft curved cup to administer larger volumes of milk. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. 

Mothers who formula feed will receive guidance on preparing infant formula and responsive feeding practices. The importance of skin-to-skin contact and recognizing feeding cues will be emphasized. 

Inpatient formula milk provision guidelines include bringing ready-made formula to the hospital and using clear plastic bottles for feeds. Formula milk will be provided for babies with medical indications for supplementation. 

Support for parenting and close relationships includes encouraging skin-to-skin contact and providing information on local parenting support. 

Health professionals will discuss safe sleeping practices with parents, emphasizing the importance of a cot by the bed and avoiding sleeping with the baby on a sofa. 

Care standards on the neonatal unit focus on supporting parent-infant attachment, enabling babies to receive breastmilk, and valuing parents as partners in care. 

Rooming in is encouraged, with mothers assuming primary responsibility for baby care. Weighing newborns at birth, day 5, and day 10 is recommended. 

Feeding problems will be addressed with feeding assessments and support plans. Referrals will be made for complex breastfeeding challenges and suspected tongue ties. Re-admitted newborns with feeding problems will be reported through the Trust's incident reporting system.

Midwives have the primary responsibility for protecting and promoting breastfeeding and helping women/birthing parents overcome related problems. Professional and support staff who have contact with pregnant women/people and mothers/birthing parents will receive training in breastfeeding support at a level appropriate to their professional group. Staff will have a mandatory infant feeding update annually. Clerical and ancillary staff will be made aware of the breast feeding policy and receive advice to enable them to refer breast feeding queries appropriately. The responsibility for providing training lies with the Trust and details are contained within the Maternity Training Needs Analysis document. Compliance with this guidance is audited at least annually using the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative audit. Outcomes will be monitored through Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) audit cycles specifically the continuous supplementation audit, as supplementation rates are indicative of the level of individualized care and promotion of breastfeeding. Outcomes will be reported to the Infant Feeding Group and Public Health Meeting.

Breastfed babies should feed 8-12 times in twenty four hours. Feed your baby at the earliest feeding cues and seek help for optimal positioning and attachment. Try a laid back position to encourage self-attachment. If baby seems sleepy while feeding, compress the breast to increase milk flow. Express small amounts of milk to stimulate a sleepy baby. Offering formula milk may affect breastmilk supply and increase chance of gut infections and cow's milk allergy. Nipple confusion and overfeeding can occur with formula supplementation. Medical reasons may require formula supplementation, with breast milk being the healthiest option. Offer formula milk in small amounts to mimic breastfeeding, use a cup or tube to avoid teat confusion, and express breastmilk to maintain supply. Staff will support your decision to continue breastfeeding while supplementing with formula.
