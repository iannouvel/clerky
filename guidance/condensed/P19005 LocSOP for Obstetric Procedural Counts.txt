Local SOP for swabs, needle & instrument counts for invasive procedures in obstetric settings

The purpose of this SOP is to provide a local standard operating procedure for safe management of swabs, needles, and instrument counts during invasive procedures within maternity outside of theatre.

This guideline applies to midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, maternity recovery staff, operating department practitioners, and maternity assistants.

Swabs, instruments, blades, and needles are used in obstetric and gynaecological procedures outside an operating theatre. Two staff members must count together to prevent retention of items.

Responsibilities include accessing, reading, and following the SOP, ensuring the SOP is reviewed as required, and ensuring the SOP is accessible to all relevant staff.

Swabs, instruments, and needles must be counted before and after procedures, and all counts must be recorded and signed. Any discrepancies must be investigated to ensure items are not retained.

Staff must follow safety standards for sharps and dispose of items appropriately. Counts must be performed in a loud and audible tone.

At the end of the procedure, counts must be performed with two people, and all items must be checked separately. If a discrepancy arises, steps must be taken to locate the missing item.

If a count is incomplete but reconciled before the woman leaves the procedure room, it is not generally classified as a clinical incident.

7.6 Known -non reconciled counts:
- Missing item location confirmed, plan for removal discussed and documented
- If item not located, urgent x-ray requested
- Information and discussion needed for discharge, documented in notes and transfer letters

7.6 Unreconciled counts at homebirths:
- Follow Section 7.4, if item not located, woman must attend hospital for urgent x-ray

7.8 Transfer to theatre:
- All counts must be completed before transfer
- In case of emergency vaginal packing, must be documented and communicated to theatre team

Audit:
- Checklist for pre-procedure count, procedural checks/count, and end of procedure count
- Instructions for count discrepancies and actions to take if item is missing or not found
