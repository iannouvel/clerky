Key principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol.

Scope: This guideline applies to women who are suspected of having a foreign body in their genital tract.

Responsibilities: Nurses & Gynaecologists should access, read, understand, and follow this guidance. Management should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required and accessible to all relevant staff.

Objective standards: This protocol provides guidance for patient assessment and management of foreign body insertion in the female genital tract.

Causes: Foreign bodies can be inserted accidentally, by children, by patients themselves, or may indicate sexual abuse or mental health issues.

Referral: Patients with urgent symptoms should be referred immediately. Patients with less urgent symptoms can be seen during the day for assessment.

Assessment: History and examination should be conducted to determine the nature and duration of the foreign body. Investigations may be necessary to assess for infection or other complications.

Treatment: Treatment should be based on the severity of symptoms, with urgent removal for sharp foreign bodies or severe bleeding.

After Care: Patients may be discharged home on the same day. Mental health support may be needed for patients with habitual insertion of foreign bodies.

Monitoring compliance: An audit will be carried out regularly to monitor compliance with this protocol.
