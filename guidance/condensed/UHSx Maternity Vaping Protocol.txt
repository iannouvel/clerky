Maternity Vaping Protocol for integrating nicotine vape products into the UH Sussex Maternity Smoke Free Service outlines the benefits of using nicotine vapes as a smoking cessation aid during pregnancy. Vaping is considered less harmful than smoking and can help manage nicotine cravings effectively. Pregnant smokers can be offered a regulated vape starter kit alongside behavioral support to quit smoking. It is important to note that vaping is not recommended for non-smokers or individuals under 18 years of age. While there are risks associated with nicotine, the harm from smoking comes from other toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke. Vaping can be an effective tool to quit smoking, especially when used in conjunction with support from healthcare professionals. Pregnant individuals who choose to use an e-cigarette should be supported in their decision. It is crucial to consider inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as cautions for individuals with certain medical conditions. Partners of pregnant smokers can also receive behavioral support and access to vouchers for vaping products if they choose to quit smoking. The service delivery protocol includes issuing nicotine vape starter kits to adult smokers as part of the smoking cessation pathway. During the initial assessment, clients can choose between behavioral support alone, NRT medication, or a vape starter kit with ongoing support.

Practitioner should demonstrate how to operate a vape device and select the correct nicotine strength based on smoking habits. Highly nicotine dependent clients may benefit from NRT patches in addition to vaping. A personalized nicotine reduction plan should be created to gradually reduce vaping frequency and nicotine strength over a 12-week program. Vouchers for e-liquids and atomizer heads will be provided for pregnant clients. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress and issue voucher codes. If a client relapses, vaping products should be stopped. After the initial 4-week program, follow-up vouchers can be used. The outcome appointment will determine the level of support needed for the remainder of the pregnancy. Voucher codes will be ordered weekly and recorded on the internal management system. The Advisor should update MIS with intervention details.

Providers will be given a service account by the county council to log in and place orders for vape vouchers. The Midwife can order two types of vouchers from the platform, with a limit of 10 per type. Totally Wicked will provide voucher codes within one working day. Financial costs will be charged to the Maternity Department. Vape products should be ordered through the voucher scheme. Clients can redeem their vouchers on the Totally Wicked website. It is advised not to vape while undergoing oxygen therapy. Nicotine vape products should be stored according to guidelines. Faulty vape devices should be disposed of properly. Training is recommended for midwives and practitioners. Monitoring will be conducted by various teams and reports will be submitted regularly. Additional guidance on disposal and recycling is provided. The protocol is owned by Sebastian Adamson & Francis Usifo and approved by relevant committees.
