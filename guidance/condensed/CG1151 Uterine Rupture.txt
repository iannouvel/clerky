Uterine Rupture Guideline Summary: This document provides evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis and management of uterine rupture during pregnancy and labor. It aims to support staff in ensuring patient safety and optimal outcomes for women and babies. Responsibilities include accessing and following the guideline, using professional judgment, and ensuring guideline accessibility. Uterine rupture is defined as a full thickness separation of the uterus leading to significant hemorrhage and/or fetal distress, with a rare occurrence rate of 2 per 10,000 pregnancies. Risk factors include previous cesarean birth, high parity, and certain pregnancy complications. Management involves intrapartum care, continuous fetal monitoring, vigilance for signs of rupture, and thorough examination during surgical delivery. Warning signs of rupture may include restlessness and constant lower uterine pain.

- Contractions may become longer, stronger, and more frequent in an effort to overcome the obstruction, leading to tonic contractions and the uterus becoming continuously hard.
- Poor progress in labor (less than 0.5 cm per hour).
- Mother/birthing parent experiences significant, continuous pain and may complain of scar pain or tenderness.
- Maternal/birthing parent may experience pyrexia, tachycardia, vomiting, and signs of dehydration.
- The uterus may appear closely molded around the fetus.
- The fetus may show signs of severe compromise.
- Following rupture, women/people may describe a sudden feeling of something giving way with complete cessation of uterine activity.
- An abnormal CTG and severe tearing abdominal pain are consistent findings in uterine rupture.
- Signs of maternal/birthing parent shock may occur.
- Surgery is imperative for suspected uterine rupture to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.
- Communication and clinical actions should include calling for help, alerting theater staff, informing the pediatrician, and checking the ABCs.
- Surgery for uterine rupture involves delivering the uterus through the wound, repairing lacerations, and considering hysterectomy if necessary.
- Post-birth, manage the woman/person in the Recovery or Critical Care Unit, check full blood count, and involve the neonatal unit staff and chaplaincy as needed.
- Women/people with a previous uterine rupture should be advised to have future elective caesarean births.
- Monitoring and auditing uterine rupture incidence are essential for quality improvement.
