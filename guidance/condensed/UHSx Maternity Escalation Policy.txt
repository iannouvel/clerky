UH Sussex Maternity Escalation Policy: This document provides a framework for responding to a Maternity Divert, ensuring appropriate steps are taken if closure of the unit is unavoidable. It applies to midwives, obstetricians, and maternity managers. Responsibilities include accessing and following the guidance and ensuring the document is reviewed as required. Abbreviations used in the guideline are provided. The policy gives guidance for the workforce in the event of capacity or staffing issues, with a standardized approach to diverting pregnant women to other Trusts. Different escalation levels are outlined, with triggers and actions for each level. The process for Red - MOPEL Level 3 escalation is detailed.

8.0 Risk assessments and mitigation of risk reviews

At the start of each shift and at regular safety huddles; escalation levels should be rated to assess alert levels.

Staffing Safety huddles are to be held twice daily AM and PM.

Identification of warning signs that the maternity unit is potentially unable to provide safe care; a review via a safety huddle needs to be undertaken.

Main causes of red flags are usually:

8.1 Insufficient staff

Daily review of the staffing levels should be undertaken at the staff of each shift; any staffing concerns should be highlighted and discussed at the twice daily safety huddles.

8.2 Insufficient beds

Maternity services can lead to peaks in activities that exceed capacity.

8.3 Closure of the neonatal unit

Review of the activity and acuity on the Neonatal unit will need to be reviewed at the maternity workforce safety huddles.

8.4 Provision of urgent or emergency care

Where a pregnant woman and person requires urgent or emergency maternity care, this should be provided at the nearest available maternity/obstetric unit, irrespective of whether that unit has been required to suspend their service.

9.0 Notifying service users

When women and people telephone during the period of closure:

10.0 Notifying other departments/aligned specialties and Ambulance Control

The Communication Checklist for diverting from a maternity unit or closing all UH Sussex Maternity units should be completed by Maternity Manager or Delivery Suite Coordinator.

11.0 Reopening the unit and follow-up

As soon as the situation resolves and there are adequate facilities and/or staff the reverse process applies.

12.0 Monitoring

Monitoring of compliance with this policy will be through completion and audit of:

• Assess all callers contacting the unit/birth center according to clinical need.

• Inform all callers of the reason for the diversion, apologies made, and the caller informed as to which hospitals are accepting referrals.
• Agree on a practical review period, usually 2 hourly until green status achieved.
• Overnight working and weekends hours: 8pm-8am - The Delivery Suite Coordinator should call the Maternity Manager On-Call for support and advice.
• Document the woman and person's name, address, and telephone number of all women and people who are diverted to other Trusts when the unit/birth center is closed.
• On no account are callers to be advised to telephone other maternity units themselves.
• If a unit is not sourced or the woman and person calls back and is felt to be progressing in labor, they must be invited to the unit for assessment or advised to go to A&E.
• Before a request to divert outside of UH Sussex is made, the status of the neighboring maternity units should be ascertained and communicated to the decision-maker.
• On the decision to divert new admissions: Inform Maternity Telephone Triage, Strategic Commander to contact ambulance service, follow up with an email with the details of accepting Trust and number of patients able to accept.
• 1 hourly safety huddles to review the situation and monitor the situation. The diversion should be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so.
