Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust Maternity Protocol: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 

Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol. 

Scope: This guideline applies to all staff producing protocols and guidelines for maternity care, members of the Maternity and Gynaecology Risk Management Group, and members of the Protocol and Guideline Group. 

Responsibilities: Clinicians, Nurses, A&E Clinical Staff, and Management all have specific responsibilities outlined in the protocol. 

Introduction & Definition: OHSS is an iatrogenic condition that occurs after taking medications to stimulate the ovaries for fertility treatment. It is a systemic disease resulting from vasoactive products released by hyperstimulated ovaries. 

Diagnosis: Diagnosis of OHSS is usually straightforward given a history of ovarian stimulation and typical symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 

Differential Diagnosis: Alternative diagnoses should always be considered, such as complications of an ovarian cyst, pelvic infection, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis. 

Assessing Severity & Reporting Adverse Outcomes: Women with OHSS should have the severity of their condition assessed and documented. Any death related to OHSS must be reported to the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths. 

Classification of Severity: OHSS is classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical categories based on symptoms, signs, and investigation results. 

Clinical Management: Management of OHSS is supportive until the condition resolves spontaneously. Symptomatic relief is important, especially for pain and nausea. 

Outpatient Management: Mild and some moderate cases of OHSS can be managed on an outpatient basis with regular monitoring and symptom management. 

Inpatient Management: Severe or critical cases of OHSS, or moderate cases not controlled with oral treatment, should be admitted to the hospital for closer monitoring and management. 

Discharge & Follow Up: All women should inform their primary clinician of admission, receive a discharge letter, and be given patient information leaflets and contact numbers.
