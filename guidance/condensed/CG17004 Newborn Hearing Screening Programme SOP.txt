Newborn Hearing Screening Standard Operating Procedure provides information for staff on the process for offering, undertaking, and providing results for newborn hearing screening. The document supports the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme Service specifications. It identifies the eligible population for screening and outlines the national screening pathways. The screening pathway for well babies and NICU babies at UH Sussex West (SRH&WH) is detailed, including the process for referrals and governance structure. The document also covers training, equipment, and quality assurance tests. The pathway aims to identify babies with permanent hearing loss early to provide them with support and improve their language, speech, and communication skills.
