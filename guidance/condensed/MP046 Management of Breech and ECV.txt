Management of Breech Presentation and ECV (RSCH PRH only) MP046

Breech presentation is defined as a fetus in longitudinal lie with the buttocks, legs or feet in the lower uterine segment closest to the cervix. The incidence of breech presentation decreases with advancing gestational age from approximately 20% at 28 weeks of gestation to 16% at 32 weeks of gestation. The incidence of breech at term is 3 –4%. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are increased with breech presentation compared with cephalic presentation irrespective of route of delivery.

Types of breech presentation include Frank or extended breech, Complete or flexed breech, Footling breech, and Kneeling Breech.

Pregnant women with suspected breech presentation prior to 36 weeks gestation should be informed that the majority of babies will turn to cephalic by 37 weeks and only 3 -4% will remain breech. Pregnant women with suspected breech presentation >36 weeks gestation should be referred to the Day Assessment Unit (DAU).

All pregnant women with confirmed breech presentation at term should be directed to the RCOG leaflet: ’A Breech Baby at the end of Pregnancy’. External cephalic version (ECV) should be offered unless there is an absolute contraindication to vaginal birth.

ECV is the manipulation of the fetus to a cephalic presentation through the maternal abdomen. The overall success rate of ECV is approximately 50%. ECV should be undertaken by trained obstetricians and consent should be obtained. Exclusion criteria for ECV include certain medical conditions and situations.

Pregnant women should be informed of the risks and benefits of ECV and other delivery options. Those choosing an elective LSCS for breech presentation should be booked near 39 weeks gestation. Pregnant women opting for vaginal breech birth should be referred to the appropriate clinic for assessment.

7.1.2 Thorough assessment for risk factors in planned vaginal breech birth is essential. Higher risk factors include hyperextended neck, high or low estimated fetal weight, footling presentation, and evidence of antenatal fetal compromise.

7.1.3 If any risk factors are identified, pregnant individuals should be counseled that planned vaginal birth has increased perinatal risks and caesarean section is recommended.

7.2 A detailed birth plan should be made with consultation from a consultant midwife and obstetrician, shared with all involved parties, and documented clearly in the notes.

7.3 Pregnant individuals should be recommended to have labor and birth in an obstetric unit with access to immediate caesarean section and neonatal support.

7.4 Induction of labor is not recommended for breech presentation unless specific criteria are met.

8 Intrapartum care for planned vaginal breech birth should involve a multidisciplinary team approach, clear documentation, and continuous monitoring.

9 Management of undiagnosed breech presentation in labor should consider factors such as stage of labor, complications, expertise, and informed consent.

10 Progress and delay in the first stage of labor should be closely monitored, with lower tolerance for slow progress in breech labors.

11 Care during the second stage of labor should involve the full team, preparation for birth, and passive second stage before active pushing.

12 Progressive descent of the breech in the second stage is expected, with interventions if delay occurs.

13 Active second stage and assisted vaginal breech maneuvers should be undertaken if necessary, with a focus on expedited delivery if fetal distress is present.

The choice of manoeuvres used for delivery of a breech baby should depend on the experience/preference of the attending doctor or midwife. Positions for delivery can include semirecumbent or all-fours, with maternal preference and experience of the attendant guiding the choice. Encouragement of maternal effort should not start until the breech is visible. Significant cord compression is common once the buttocks have passed the perineum. A 'hands-poised' or 'hands off' approach is recommended for progressive births with good descent and normal fetal monitoring. Traction should never be applied to the breech. Selective episiotomy is recommended. Signs that delivery should be assisted include lack of tone or color, or delay, commonly due to extended arms or an extended neck. Descent of the body should be visible after the breech has passed over the perineum. The body should be in a sacro-anterior position. If there is delay with the legs or arms, specific manoeuvres should be used. Delay with the after-coming head should be managed with the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre. In the case of preterm breech, caesarean section is recommended for planned deliveries due to maternal/fetal compromise. For twin pregnancies with a breech presentation, planned caesarean section is recommended for the presenting twin. Organizational and governance support for vaginal breech delivery services should include skills and drills training, yearly audits, and clear communication with the birthing person.
