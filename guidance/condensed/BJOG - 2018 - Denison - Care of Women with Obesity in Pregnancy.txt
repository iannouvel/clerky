Care of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy
Green-top Guideline No. 72
November 2018

Prepregnancy care
- Primary care services should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to optimise their weight before pregnancy.
- Women of childbearing age with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should receive information and advice about the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and be supported to lose weight before conception and between pregnancies.
- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily.
- Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, but routine vitamin D supplementation remains uncertain.

Provision of antenatal care
- Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics.
- Maternity units should have a documented environmental risk assessment regarding the availability of facilities to care for pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater.
- Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a moving and handling risk assessment carried out in the third trimester of pregnancy.
- All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured at the antenatal booking visit.
- There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain in obese women.

Information giving during pregnancy
- Pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy.
- Dietetic advice should be provided early in pregnancy.
- Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy.

Risk assessment during pregnancy in women with obesity
- Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment.
- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater have a pre-existing risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.
- Women should be screened for mental health problems in pregnancy.

Special considerations for screening, diagnosis and management of maternal disease in women with obesity
- All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes.
- An appropriate size of cuff should be used for blood pressure measurements in women with obesity.
- Women with more than one moderate risk factor may benefit from taking 150 mg aspirin daily.
- Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater have a pre-existing risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.

Women with class 1 obesity or greater having a caesarean section should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery. Women undergoing caesarean section with more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of infection and wound separation. There is a lack of evidence to recommend routine use of negative pressure dressing therapy, barrier retractors, and subcutaneous drains in obese women undergoing caesarean sections. Maternal obesity should be considered when deciding on postnatal contraception. Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight management services. A waiting period of 12-18 months after bariatric surgery is recommended before attempting pregnancy. Women with previous bariatric surgery should have consultant-led antenatal care and nutritional surveillance during pregnancy. Women with obesity should receive folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy. Obese women are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and may benefit from supplementation.

iometry scan and were analysed
for the primary endpoint. The neonatal whole-body bone mineral content of infants born to mothersassigned to cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day did not signiﬁcantly differ from that of infants born to mothersassigned to placebo. However, supplementation of women with cholecalciferol 1000 iu/day during pregnancy did demonstrate that this dosage was sufﬁcient to ensure that most pregnant women were vitamin D replete and it was safe.
Provision of antenatal care
Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear local policies and guidelines for care available. Maternity services must develop and implement robust processes to manage the risks associated with obesity, and consistently provide sensitive, comprehensive, and appropriate multidisciplinary care. Specific recommendations include a requirement for all women with a BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater to have multidisciplinary care, a documented antenatal consultation about the intrapartum risks and to be advised to deliver in a consultant-led unit for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater. Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater.
Measuring weight, height and BMI
All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing women during the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnel required during labour and birth.
Information giving during pregnancy
All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should be provided with accurate and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and how they may be minimised. Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in the pregnancy. Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment. Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2 or greater should have a documented risk assessment in the third trimester of pregnancy by an appropriately qualified professional to consider.

Tissue viability issues should involve the use of a validated scale to support clinical judgment. A BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 and immobility are risk factors for developing pressure sores. A documented assessment of pressure ulcer risk using a validated scale is recommended, with reassessment if there is a change in clinical status. Plans for skin assessment, skin care, repositioning frequency, and pressure redistributing devices should be put in place for those at risk. Pregnant women with a booking BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is a significant risk factor for gestational diabetes and hypertensive complications of pregnancy. Women with obesity should be offered screening and diagnostic tests for mental health problems. Pregnant women with obesity have an increased risk of structural anomalies and should be offered screening and diagnostic tests despite limitations in visualizing fetal structures.

11. Fetal surveillance
- Serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) recommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation.
- Women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound.
- Ultrasound can be considered as an alternative method for assessing fetal presentation.
- Various methods of estimating fetal growth have been assessed, but all are technically more difficult in women with obesity.
- Intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women should follow NICE recommendations.
- Obese pregnant women are at increased risk of stillbirth and prolonged pregnancy.

12. Planning labour and birth
- Planning for labour and birth requires ongoing review of antenatal progress and potential complications.
- Women with maternal obesity should have an informed discussion with their obstetrician and anaesthetist about a birth plan.
- Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.
- Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birth without increasing adverse outcomes.
- The decision for a woman with maternal obesity to have a planned caesarean section should involve a multidisciplinary approach.
- Induction of labour may be considered when macrosomia is suspected.
- Parents should have a discussion about the options of induction of labour and expectant management when macrosomia is suspected.

Women with obesity and a previous caesarean section should have an individualized decision for VBAC following informed discussion and consideration of all relevant clinical factors. Obesity is a risk factor for unsuccessful VBAC, with Class III obesity associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labor and neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is also associated with an increased risk of serious maternal morbidity. Continuous midwifery care is recommended for obese women in established labor, with extra vigilance required for care of pressure areas and fetal heart rate monitoring. Intrapartum care for obese women should follow NICE guidelines, with considerations for venous access, active management of the third stage of labor, and specific surgical techniques for performing cesarean section. Postoperative wound care for obese women should include prophylactic antibiotics and suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space to reduce the risk of wound infection. Breastfeeding initiation and maintenance may be more challenging for obese women and dedicated support is needed. Postnatal contraception advice should be tailored for women with obesity, and long-term health risks for both mother and child should be discussed and addressed.

Support in the community for minimal interpregnancy weight gain includes postpartum weight loss support and referral to weight management services. Women with previous bariatric surgery should wait 12-18 months before attempting pregnancy to stabilize weight and address nutritional deficiencies. Studies show lower risks of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and macrosomia in women who have had bariatric surgery, but higher risks of small-for-gestational-age newborns. Women with previous bariatric surgery should receive consultant-led antenatal care, nutritional surveillance, and screening for deficiencies during pregnancy. They should also be referred to a dietician for specialized nutritional needs. Pregnancy can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies in women with malabsorptive procedures, requiring vitamin and mineral supplementation. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of obesity on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for infectious morbidity in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Extreme obesity is associated with postcesarean maternal complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis may help prevent infection after cesarean section. Superficial wound disruption after cesarean delivery may be affected by the depth and closure of subcutaneous tissue. Wound drainage and the use of a plastic sheath wound retractor may reduce surgical site infections and wound disruptions in obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Maternal weight status, diet, and supplement use can impact breastfeeding and complementary feeding. Delayed lactogenesis II and barriers to breastfeeding are concerns for obese women. Interventions for promoting breastfeeding and support for healthy breastfeeding mothers are important. Postpartum weight retention can be reduced through a correspondence intervention. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can develop after gestational diabetes. Maternal obesity is associated with various pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, slower labor progress, caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, wound infection, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Stillbirth and neonatal death are also risks associated with maternal obesity.
