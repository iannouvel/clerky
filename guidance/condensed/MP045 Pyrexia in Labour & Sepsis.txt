Pyrexia & Sepsis in Pregnancy, Labour and in the postnatal period  
Maternity Protocol MP045  
 
Key Principles: A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action.  
 
Scope: Recognition and management of serious bacterial illness arising in the genital tract or elsewhere in the antenatal, intrapartum periods or following pregnancy, and its management in primary and secondary care.  
 
Responsibilities: Midwives & Obstetricians should access, read, understand and follow this guidance. Management Team should ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National recommendations.  
 
Sepsis: Infection plus systemic manifestations of infection. Severe sepsis includes organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion. Septic shock is defined as persistent hypoperfusion despite fluid replacement therapy.  
  
Sepsis in Pregnancy: Special attention should be paid to higher risk pregnant women. Risk factors for sepsis during pregnancy and labour include obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired immunity, and more.  
  
Management of Pyrexia in Labour: Complete full set of maternal observations, inform doctor if signs of sepsis, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, rehydrate with IV fluids, and consider fetal monitoring.  
  
Sepsis in the Puerperium: Inform women of risks of infection, provide postnatal observations, and report any problems to community carers upon discharge.

Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be administered. Inform neonatology team in all cases of suspected puerperal sepsis. The baby has an increased risk of infection during birth and breastfeeding. The umbilical area should be examined and a paediatrician consulted in the event of sepsis. If either the mother or the baby is infected with invasive GAS in the postpartum period, both should be treated with antibiotics. The community midwife should undertake a full review of the woman and her maternity notes to assess the risk and possible causes of infection. A full set of observations should be undertaken and documented where sepsis is suspected. If the woman is unwell and/or observations indicate a moderate or significant infection, immediate medical attention is required.
