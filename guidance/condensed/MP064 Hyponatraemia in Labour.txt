Hyponatraemia in Labour 
Defined as a serum sodium concentration below 130mmol/L, hyponatraemia is common in hospitalised patients. It can cause morbidity and mortality, with symptoms including headache, lethargy, and confusion. Pregnant individuals are at greater risk due to physiological changes. Prevention includes monitoring fluid intake and output, avoiding excess water intake, and encouraging bladder care. Treatment depends on the severity of hyponatraemia.

Treatment of Severe Hyponatraemia  
Severe hyponatraemia (sodium < 125mmol/L + symptoms) is a medical emergency.  
The aim of treatment is to improve symptoms and not to correct the sodium to normal.  
 
•Urgent senior obstetric and anaesthetic review  
•Inform ITU/Critical Care Outreach team  
•Consider transfer to Level 2 care in ITU if possible  
•Check sodium concentration  
•Continue strict fluid restriction of 30mls/hr  
•Continue accurate fluid balance monitoring  
•Repeat sodium hourly  
•Request 1.8% Sodium Chloride bags from ITU  
•1.8% Sodium Chloride given in 150ml bolus ONLY under instruction or supervision from ITU  
•If no improvement consider 2nd bolus 150mls 1.8% Sodium Chloride ONLY under instruction or supervision from ITU  
•Continue fluid restriction and fluid balance monitoring until asymptomatic  
•Aim to increase sodium by no greater than 10mmol/L in 24 hours
