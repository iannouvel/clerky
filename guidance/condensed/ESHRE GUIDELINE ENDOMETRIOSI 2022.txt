The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a clinical practice guideline to improve healthcare delivery for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting women of reproductive age, with symptoms including pain and infertility. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, including hormone therapies and surgical options. While there are still gaps in knowledge, the guideline aims to address the clinical needs of patients with endometriosis.

Treatment of endometriosis-associated pain includes offering NSAIDs or other analgesics, hormone treatments like GnRH agonists or antagonists, and surgical options. The use of Danazol, anti-progestogens, LUNA, PSN, and anti-adhesion agents is no longer recommended. Surgical options include excision over ablation and cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma. Referral to a center of expertise is recommended for deep endometriosis. Hysterectomy may be considered for women who do not wish to conceive and have not responded to other treatments.

59 Discuss fertility preservation options with women with extensive ovarian endometriosis. 
60 Do not advise pregnancy solely for treating endometriosis. 
61 Refer patients with atypical endometrioma during pregnancy to appropriate expertise. 
62 Increased risk of first-trimester miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in women with endometriosis. 
63 Be aware of endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy.

Clinicians should be aware that women with endometriosis who have undergone an early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy have an increased risk of diminished bone density, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. Women with endometriosis also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, regardless of surgical menopause. For extrapelvic endometriosis, surgical removal is preferred for abdominal cases, while hormone treatment may be an option when surgery is not possible. Hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis, with surgery recommended when indicated in a multidisciplinary manner. Women with asymptomatic endometriosis should be informed and counseled, but surgical excision or medical treatment is not recommended. Routine ultrasound monitoring for asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered. While there is no direct evidence, aiming for a healthy lifestyle with reduced alcohol intake and regular physical activity may help prevent endometriosis. Women with endometriosis have a slightly higher risk of certain cancers, but general cancer prevention measures are recommended.

Clinical symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, painful rectal bleeding, and infertility should prompt consideration of endometriosis. Symptoms like abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and previous diagnoses of certain conditions increase the likelihood of endometriosis. Severe dysmenorrhea may be predictive of endometriosis, but overall, clinical symptoms alone are not reliable for diagnosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, can help identify deep nodules or endometriomas in suspected cases, but further diagnostic steps, including imaging, should be considered if the examination is normal.

The guideline recommends using clinical examination for diagnosing endometriosis and further diagnostic steps if needed. Medical technologies like imaging and biomarkers can also be used, but there are limitations in their reliability. Imaging techniques like ultrasound and MRI are recommended for diagnosis, but they may not always be conclusive, especially for superficial disease. Laparoscopy may still be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, especially if imaging results are negative or treatment is unsuccessful.

The guideline recommends using imaging in the diagnostic work-up for endometriosis. Laparoscopy is considered the standard for diagnosis, but it is invasive and costly. Empirical treatment following imaging results can be considered for symptomatic patients. Long-term monitoring for endometriosis is not recommended for preventing adverse outcomes. Individualized follow-up based on previous treatments and disease severity is suggested. Further research is needed to develop consensus criteria for diagnosis and to investigate long-term management approaches.

Impact of the time of diagnosis on quality of life: Early diagnosis of endometriosis may reduce pain, infertility risk, and provide relief, empowerment, and understanding for affected women. While no studies directly compare early versus late diagnosis on quality of life, diagnosis can lead to positive adjustments and support services. The guideline recommends symptom relief or treatment after diagnosis. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of early diagnosis on quality of life.

Treatment of endometriosis-associated pain: Analgesics, such as NSAIDs, may be offered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence supporting their use is limited. Hormone treatments, including combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists, or antagonists, are recommended to reduce pain. Individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability should be considered when choosing hormone treatments. Hormone treatments have shown to be effective in reducing pain symptoms associated with endometriosis.

Based on clinical trials, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have been shown to improve pain associated with endometriosis. Continuous use of OCP may be more effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain compared to cyclic use. The vaginal ring and transdermal patch have also been studied for their efficacy in treating endometriosis. Progestogens and anti-progestogens have shown to be effective in treating endometriosis-associated pain, with some adverse effects. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems and subdermal implants is recommended for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Danazol is not recommended due to severe side effects. GnRH agonists have been found to be effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain, but may be less effective than other treatments. Further details are available in the full guideline.

In studies comparing different routes of administration, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches, and decreased libido were reported, but there was no difference between intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intranasal administration. The bone mineral density was decreased in both groups at 20 weeks after treatment, but the degree of loss of BMD was significantly higher in the full dose group. Reduction of bone mineral density is one of the undesirable effects of long-term GnRH-agonist treatment. It is recommended to prescribe women GnRH agonists to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Clinicians should consider prescribing combined hormonal add-back therapy alongside GnRH agonist therapy to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptoms. A meta-analysis found that Lumbar spine BMD after treatment and at 6 months of follow-up were superior with GnRH agonist + add-back therapy than with GnRH agonist alone. GnRH antagonists have been added to the medical treatment options for endometriosis. GnRH antagonists can be considered to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, although evidence is limited regarding dosage or duration of treatment. Aromatase inhibitors may be prescribed in combination with other medications to reduce endometriosis-associated pain.

Surgical treatment to eliminate endometriotic lesions and divide adhesions has long been an important part of the management of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is preferred over open surgery for its benefits. Excision is recommended over ablation for reducing endometriosis-associated pain. Superficial peritoneal endometriosis may be a separate entity, but more research is needed on its surgical treatment outcomes. Research should investigate the effect of surgery on pain and quality of life parameters in different subtypes of endometriosis.

Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in primary and secondary dysmenorrhea was analyzed in a Cochrane review. Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) did not offer additional benefit, but presacral neurectomy (PSN) showed significant benefits in reducing pain and improving quality of life. PSN is associated with increased risk of adverse effects. 

For ovarian endometrioma, cystectomy is recommended over drainage and coagulation to reduce recurrence of pain and endometrioma. CO2 laser vaporization can also be considered, with similar recurrence rates beyond the first year. It is important to minimize ovarian damage during surgery. 

For deep endometriosis, excision of nodules is recommended, especially for colorectal involvement. Various surgical techniques have shown improvement in pain and quality of life, with segmental bowel resection being a widely acceptable option. Standardized reporting of surgical trials is recommended for deep endometriosis.

A multicentre study showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life after laparoscopic excision of deep rectovaginal endometriosis. Analgesia use decreased, and complications occurred in 6.8% of cases. Surgical removal of deep endometriosis can reduce pain and improve quality of life. Referral to a centre of expertise is recommended, and patients should be informed of potential risks and benefits. Surgery improves pain and quality of life, but caution is advised due to varying study methods and outcomes. Different surgical approaches for bowel endometriosis have shown improvements in pain and quality of life. A minimally invasive approach is preferred for radical removal of endometriosis lesions. Complications of surgery for bowel endometriosis are significant, especially with rectal surgery.

The reported recurrence rates following surgery for colorectal endometriosis were 5-25%. Surgery for posterior compartment endometriosis showed improvement in pain symptoms. Surgical treatment of bladder and ureteral endometriosis resulted in significant improvement in pain symptoms. Nerve-sparing laparoscopy can reduce the risk of urinary retention. Hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain can relieve symptoms and reduce the need for re-operation. Patient selection for surgery should consider prognostic factors to predict improvement in pain symptoms. Further research is needed in this area.

Surgical treatment for endometriosis includes excision or ablation techniques, with excision showing better outcomes in terms of pain improvement. Laparoscopic surgery is effective for deep infiltrating endometriosis, with various techniques used for different locations of endometriotic lesions. Quality of life and fertility outcomes are important considerations in the surgical management of endometriosis. Recurrence rates after surgery vary depending on the type of procedure performed. It is essential to consider the impact of surgery on symptoms and quality of life when choosing a surgical approach for endometriosis.

II.4. Medical therapies adjunct to surgery  
The question on whether medical therapies are effective as an adjunct to surgical therapy considers both therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes, and therapies aimed at secondary prevention. A good practice point in this respect was formulated in the previous ESHRE guideline for endometriosis: “The GDG recommends that clinicians clearly distinguish adjunctive short-term (<6 months) hormone treatment after surgery from long-term (>6 months) hormone treatment; the latter is aimed at secondary prevention.” The evidence and recommendations are separated into ‘therapies to improve immediate surgical outcomes’ and ‘therapies for secondary prevention’. 

PICO QUESTION: ARE MEDICAL THERAPIES EFFECTIVE AS AN ADJUNCT TO SURGICAL THERAPY?

It is not recommended to prescribe preoperative hormone treatment to improve the immediate outcome of surgery for pain in women with endometriosis. Surgeons may prescribe preoperative medical treatment with GnRH agonists to facilitate surgery, but there are no controlled studies supporting this. Postoperative hormone therapy may be prescribed for pain in women with endometriosis if not desiring immediate pregnancy. 

II.5. Medical versus surgical treatment for endometriosis

There is no conclusive evidence to make any definite recommendation on whether medical therapies or surgery are more effective for relieving pain in women with endometriosis. The decision between hormone treatments and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain should be based on shared decision-making, individual preferences, side effects, efficacy, costs, and availability. 

II.6. Non-medical management strategies

Non-medical management strategies for endometriosis include complementary and alternative medicine, self-management strategies, and psychological and physical therapies. Research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these strategies in women with endometriosis. Acupuncture, psychological therapy, exercise, and other non-medical approaches are discussed in recent studies for relieving endometriosis-associated pain and improving quality of life.

One RCT compared ‘sham’ acupuncture with verum acupuncture in women with endometriosis and found that verum acupuncture resulted in significantly less pain and improved psychological well-being. Another study concluded that Japanese acupuncture is a safe and effective adjunct therapy for endometriosis-related pain. Overall, acupuncture was found to alleviate dysmenorrhea and pain in women with endometriosis, with little to no reported adverse effects.

Physiotherapy interventions for endometriosis are not well documented, but pelvic floor exercises have shown moderate evidence for addressing pelvic floor dysfunction. However, no specific research was identified for pelvic floor training for women with endometriosis. Massage and trigger point release therapy have not shown significant reduction in pain compared to general massage in chronic noncancer pain.

Exercise has benefits for mental health and overall health, but there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion on its effects on endometriosis-related pain. Psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and mindfulness-based programmes, have shown some improvements in pain and quality of life for women with endometriosis, but more research is needed. Overall, no recommendation can be made about physical therapies, exercise, or psychological interventions for improving quality of life and reducing pain in women with endometriosis.

Participants were included up to 5 years after their laparoscopic diagnosis, with most indicating their post-endometriosis-treatment condition as "recovered" and no current symptoms collected. No recommendations can be made regarding the effectiveness of psychological approaches for pain and quality of life in women with endometriosis. Studies on the impact of psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Nutrition may affect endometriosis symptoms, with limited studies evaluating the benefit of dietary interventions. Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may have positive effects on pain scores. Antioxidants, gluten, and soy were not well studied. Women with endometriosis may change their diets to alleviate symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine studies were generally poorly constructed. No recommendations can be made for nutrition or Chinese Medicine to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with endometriosis. Adequately designed trials are needed to define the potential benefits of non-medical interventions in endometriosis.

Women with endometriosis are confronted with one or both of two major problems: endometriosis associated pain, infertility, or both. For clarity, the GDG decided to separately discuss the evidence on pain as the outcome in chapter II; infertility as an outcome is addressed in this chapter. The first part of this chapter deals with treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility, including medical, surgical, and non-pharmacological treatments. Medically assisted reproduction and adjunctive treatments are discussed in the second part of the chapter. In the last part of the chapter, the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcome is discussed, as well as indications for ART after surgery, and indications for fertility preservation.

In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe ovarian suppression treatment to improve fertility. Women seeking pregnancy should not be prescribed postoperative hormone suppression with the sole purpose to enhance future pregnancy rates. Those women who cannot attempt to or decide not to conceive immediately after surgery may be offered hormone therapy as it does not negatively impact their fertility and improves the immediate outcome of surgery for pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs and aromatase inhibitors have shown uncertain effects on pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis.

In infertile women with endometriosis, clinicians should not prescribe pentoxifylline, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or letrozole outside ovulation-induction to improve natural pregnancy rates. Studies show no benefit of these interventions to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. Operative laparoscopy could be offered as a treatment option for endometriosis-associated infertility in rASRM stage I/II endometriosis as it improves the rate of ongoing pregnancy. Clinicians may consider operative laparoscopy for the treatment of endometrioma-associated infertility as it may increase the chance of natural pregnancy, although no data from comparative studies exist. Although no compelling evidence exists that operative laparoscopy for deep endometriosis improves fertility, it may represent a treatment option in symptomatic patients wishing to conceive. The decision to perform surgery should be guided by various factors such as pain symptoms, patient age and preferences, history of previous surgery, presence of other infertility factors, ovarian reserve, and estimated Endometriosis Fertility Index.

The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated tool that can be used to counsel patients on their reproductive options after surgery. It can help reduce healthcare costs through optimal patient selection. The EFI can also be used to guide decision-making between surgery, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or other fertility management options for women with endometriosis-related infertility. It is recommended to use the EFI for better patient phenotyping in studies on surgical treatment and/or the place of medically assisted reproduction in endometriosis-related infertility. Studies should clarify whether intrauterine insemination (IUI) with or without ovarian stimulation is a relevant option for women with different subtypes of endometriosis, and the value of the EFI to predict the relevance of IUI could be further investigated. 

In infertile women with stage I/II endometriosis, clinicians may consider performing IUI with ovarian stimulation instead of expectant management or IUI alone, as it increases pregnancy rates. The benefit of ovarian stimulation with IUI in women with stage III/IV endometriosis is uncertain, but it could be considered. 

There are currently no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of assisted reproductive technology (ART) versus no intervention in women with endometriosis. Studies comparing the outcomes of ART in women with endometriosis to women without endometriosis have reported lower fertilization rates and pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. The impact of endometrioma on ART reproductive outcomes has been summarized, with lower numbers of oocytes retrieved in women with endometrioma. Studies evaluating different ovarian stimulation protocols in women with endometriosis have not shown significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates.

In women with endometriosis, both GnRH antagonist and agonist protocols can be offered for ART based on patient and physician preferences as no difference in pregnancy or live birth rate has been demonstrated. Women with endometriosis can be reassured regarding the safety of ART, as recurrence rates are not increased compared to those not undergoing ART. Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval in women with endometriomas is recommended. Overall, evidence does not show a negative impact of endometriosis on live birth rate after ART, although ovarian response and clinical pregnancy rates may be lower. ART may be effective for endometriosis-associated infertility, especially in cases where other treatments have failed. The severity of the disease may affect live birth rates, with stage III-IV endometriosis potentially decreasing the rate. Studies evaluating IUI and ART outcomes in women with endometriosis are recommended to report clinically relevant outcomes and perform subgroup analysis by stage of endometriosis and type of disease. Further research on medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis-associated infertility is needed to clarify treatment effectiveness.

Surgical therapies as an adjunct to MAR for endometriosis-associated infertility may be effective. Surgery for peritoneal endometriosis prior to ART has shown higher implantation, pregnancy, and live birth rates. However, surgery for ovarian endometrioma before ART does not improve live birth rates and may negatively impact ovarian reserve. Surgery for deep endometriosis should be guided by pain symptoms and patient preference, as its effectiveness on reproductive outcomes is uncertain. More data are needed to confirm the benefits of surgery for improving ART outcomes.

In symptomatic infertile women with previous failed ART and deep endometriosis, surgical removal of the lesions may be (re)considered. Surgery for pain in women with deep endometriosis, risk of surgery, and complication rates are discussed in further detail in section II.3.f. Non-medical management strategies for infertility associated with endometriosis have not shown clear evidence of benefit. Fertility preservation should be discussed with women with severe endometriosis, as surgical treatment can impact ovarian reserve and AMH levels. The impact of endometriosis on pregnancy and obstetric outcomes is still unclear.

Endometriotic lesions in pregnancy can show a variety of changes, including decidual reaction, atrophy, fibrosis, and necrosis. Management may involve serial monitoring or surgery if malignancy is suspected. Pregnancy does not consistently improve symptoms of endometriosis, and women should continue medical treatment after giving birth. Endometriomas may change in appearance during pregnancy, requiring referral to a specialized center. Complications from endometriosis during pregnancy are rare but may be life-threatening, necessitating surgical management. Women with endometriosis have an increased risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Clinicians should be vigilant for symptoms in the first trimester. Larger studies are needed to understand the impact of endometriosis on pregnancy outcomes. Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association between endometriosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the second and third trimesters. Complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm birth, placenta previa, and hypertensive disorders may be more common in women with endometriosis.

Women with endometriosis may have a higher risk of stillbirth and Caesarean section. They may also be more likely to have babies that are small for gestational age and experience neonatal death. Endometriosis does not seem to increase the risk of obstetric hemorrhages. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks, but currently, there is no need for increased monitoring or discouraging pregnancy in women with endometriosis. Studies on interventions for risk reduction are lacking. Risk factors for endometriosis recurrence include surgery-related variables and patient-related factors. Surgical techniques for prevention of recurrence include ovarian cystectomy for endometrioma.

Cystectomy is superior to drainage and coagulation for ovarian endometrioma ≥3 cm. Ovarian surgery should consider impact on ovarian reserve. Hormone therapy post-surgery can prevent disease recurrence. OCP and LNG-IUS have shown effectiveness in reducing pain and recurrence. Progestogens and GnRH agonists are also options. Long-term hormone treatment can prevent endometriosis recurrence. ART does not increase endometriosis recurrence. LNG-IUS or combined hormonal contraceptives can be used post-surgery for prevention. Consider patient preferences, costs, risks, and side effects when choosing treatment. Data on subtype-specific treatments are limited. Recommendations are strong for ovarian endometrioma and weak for deep endometriosis.

IV.2 Treatment of recurrent endometriosis  
Medical treatment for recurrent endometriosis after surgery has been described in few RCTs and uncontrolled observational studies. In an RCT, 242 women with recurrent pelvic pain within 1 year following laparoscopic surgery were randomised to dienogest or depot leuprolide acetate. VAS scores for pelvic pain, back pain, dyspareunia or endometrioma size were significantly lower at 12 weeks follow-up. Another RCT compared 6-month treatment with desogestrel or OCP in 40 women with recurrent dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain after conservative surgery. Both treatments resulted in a significant decrease of VAS scores at 6 months compared to baseline. In the RCT by Vercellini and colleagues, 90 women with recurrent moderate or severe pelvic pain after conservative surgery for symptomatic endometriosis were randomised to 6-month treatment with cyproterone acetate or a continuous monophasic OCP. The study showed no difference in efficacy for cyproterone acetate versus a continuous monophasic OCP. Dienogest treatment immediately after recurrence was effective in controlling disease progression in a small cohort study. Dienogest was also effective in reducing the size of endometriomas and providing symptomatic relief in another study. Retreatment with nafarelin for recurrent endometriosis symptoms showed improvements in symptoms. 

Surgical treatment for recurrent endometriosis has limited evidence, with one small, uncontrolled study showing recurrence of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain in some women. A small prospective study showed that surgery for recurrent endometriomas may harm healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserve. 

Any hormone treatment or surgery can be offered to treat recurring pain symptoms in women with endometriosis. Recurrence of endometriosis is a prevalent clinical observation, and the lack of evidence should not prioritize certain treatments over others that have been shown effective in relieving endometriosis-associated pain. Other causes for pain symptoms, such as adenomyosis or pelvic floor dysfunction, should be investigated if symptoms recur soon after surgery.

In adolescents, diagnosis of endometriosis is often based on pain symptoms only, which may have a more varied presentation compared to adults. Symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and nausea with pelvic pain should raise suspicion for endometriosis. Clinical examination, including vaginal examination, should be considered, and transvaginal ultrasound is recommended for diagnosing ovarian endometriosis in adolescents. Serum biomarkers are not recommended for diagnosing endometriosis in adolescents. If imaging is negative and medical treatments have not been successful, diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered. Histological confirmation of endometriosis through biopsies during laparoscopy is recommended, as negative histology does not entirely rule out the disease.

In adolescents with severe dysmenorrhea and/or endometriosis-associated pain, clinicians should prescribe hormonal contraceptives or progestogens as first-line hormone therapy. Clinicians may consider NSAIDs as treatment for endometriosis-associated pain in adolescents with (suspected) endometriosis. In adolescents with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and associated pain, clinicians may consider prescribing GnRH agonists for up to 1 year, as they are effective and safe when combined with add-back therapy. In young women and adolescents, if GnRH agonist treatment is considered, it should be used only after careful consideration and discussion of potential side effects and potential long-term health risks with a practitioner in a secondary or tertiary care setting. 

In adolescents with endometriosis, clinicians may consider surgical removal of endometriosis lesions to manage endometriosis-related symptoms. If surgical treatment is indicated in adolescents with endometriosis, it should be performed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon, and, if possible, complete laparoscopic removal of all present endometriosis should be performed. 

The effect of long-term treatment with GnRH agonists and OCP after conservative surgery for endometriosis in adolescents showed low recurrence rates.

Endometriosis symptoms may persist after menopause, with a prevalence of 2-5% in postmenopausal women. Hormone therapy may stimulate endometriosis growth. Surgical treatment is recommended as first-line for postmenopausal women with endometriosis.

2007 , Pavone and Bulun, 
2012 , Polyzos , et al. , 2011 ). Also, there are very little options available for medical treatment - besides 
using analgesics or aromatase inhibitors (see  below) - due to the naturally low levels of estrogen in 
postmenopausal women.
  
VI.2.a. Surgical treatment  
We identified five cohort studies on surgery in postmenopausal endometriosis patients: three studies 
described a cohort of postmenopausal women who presented with pain and subsequently underwent 
surgery whilst two retrospective cohort studies reported on women in whom endometriosis was 
identified based on histology.   
VI.2.a.1. Efficacy of surgery in postmenopausal women  
A prospective cohort by Redwine et al.  included 75 women with previous bilateral salpingo -
oophorectomy ( BSO) who received excision of histologically confirmed  endometriosis as treatment for 
pain. Most women had a marked alleviation of pain after excision of endometriosis, although only 13 patients underwent a re -operation due to pelvic pain. No malignancy was found in this study.  
Behera et al.  described a retrospective cohort of 124 women with chronic pelvic pain after hysterectomy and BSO. Laparoscopic treatment of any pelvic pathologic condition improved pain symptoms in the majority of women. In 2 women a malignancy of the bowel was found.  
Clayton et al.  described a case series of five women with recurrent pain after BSO and hysterectomy who had residual endometriosis managed by laparoscopic excision. The women had improved pain symptoms at 4 months after surgery.
VI.2.a.2. Risk of malignant transformation in postmenopausal women  
Consideration of the possibility of malignancy should be taken in postmenopausal women with endometriosis irrespective of symptoms. This may require further imaging studies and/or the surgical exploration of the area.  
A retrospective cohort study identified 72 postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis, of which 57 had endometriomas. In 35% of these endometriomas a (pre)malignancy was found. 
Sun et al.  described a retrospective cohort study of postmenopausal patients in whom endometriosis was histologically confirmed. In 62 women an endometrioma was found and 10 women had a coexisting ovarian, endometrial,  or cervical malignancy.  

Recommendations: 
Clinicians may consider surgical treatment for postmenopausal women presenting with signs of endometriosis and/or pain. 
The GDG recommends that clinicians acknowledge the uncertainty towards the risk of malignancy in postmenopausal women.
For postmenopausal women with endometriosis-associated pain, clinicians may consider aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option especially if surgery is not feasible. 

Justification: 
Surgical treatment can improve pain in postmenopausal women with endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors have shown effectiveness in reducing endometriosis-associated pain in premenopausal women and may be a medical alternative to surgery for postmenopausal endometriosis.

Research recommendation: 
More evidence is needed on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors or other medical treatments in postmenopausal women with endometriosis-related pain symptoms.

Abdominal wall endometriosis is frequently associated with gynecologic procedures and can be diagnosed using transabdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI. The appearance of scar endometriosis on imaging depends on various factors. CT imaging has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing abdominal wall endometriosis. MRI is preferred in younger patients due to improved tissue characterization and lack of ionizing radiation. Diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms with a catamenial pattern.

Catamenial pneumothorax is defined by at least two episodes of pneumothorax occurring during this time interval. In a review of data on 490 cases of catamenial pneumothorax, pneumothorax was mainly present in the right lung. Diaphragmatic endometriosis and/or nodules were observed in a high percentage of cases. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome involves catamenial thoracic pain, with the right hemithorax being involved in more than 90% of cases. MRI is recommended for diagnosis of diaphragmatic endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of extrapelvic endometriosis and discuss diagnosis and management in a multidisciplinary team. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for abdominal extrapelvic endometriosis, while hormone treatment can be offered for thoracic endometriosis. In cases of catamenial pneumothorax, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.

Women with incidental findings of asymptomatic endometriosis do not require treatment unless there is evidence of disease progression. Surgical excision or ablation is not recommended due to associated risks. Medical treatment is also not recommended. Clinicians should inform and counsel women about any incidental findings of endometriosis but should not perform surgical procedures or prescribe medical treatment. Monitoring of asymptomatic endometriosis can be considered, but there is limited evidence supporting its benefit. Women can be advised to aim for a healthy lifestyle and diet to potentially reduce the risk of developing endometriosis in the future. The use of hormonal contraceptives for primary prevention is uncertain. Genetic testing for endometriosis risk assessment should only be done in a research setting.

Endometriosis shares features with cancer, such as resistance to apoptosis and chronic inflammation. While there is a small increased risk of ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer with endometriosis, the absolute risk remains low. Clinicians should reassure patients and recommend general cancer prevention measures. Hormone treatments for endometriosis may have varying effects on cancer risk, with OCPs potentially reducing ovarian and endometrial cancer risk but increasing breast and cervical cancer risk. More research is needed on the impact of hormone treatments on cancer risk.

Among women with endometriosis, hormonal treatments do not impact ovarian cancer risk. Clinicians should reassure women with endometriosis about the risk of malignancy associated with hormonal contraceptives. Monitoring for ovarian malignancy through CA-125 measurement or imaging is not recommended for women with endometriosis without additional risk factors. Monitoring for other types of malignancy is not justified given the low absolute risk in women with endometriosis. Clinicians should not systematically perform cancer screening beyond existing guidelines but can consider it in individual patients with additional risk factors. More data are needed on the malignant transformation of endometrioma and endometriosis to guide monitoring needs.

Some authors advocate for earlier and more meticulous surgical intervention for complete disease removal to reduce future ovarian cancer risk. However, preventative surgery may not significantly reduce the future risk of cancer due to the relapsing nature of endometriosis. Studies have shown that unilateral oophorectomy or removal of all visible endometriosis during surgery can dramatically reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.
