Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Screening SOP

The NHS Newborn and Infant Physical Examination (NIPE) Screening Programme aims to identify and refer babies born with congenital abnormalities of the heart, hips, eyes, or testes within 72 hours of birth. The overall health outcomes are to reduce mortality and morbidity through early assessment and intervention for various conditions.

Eligible babies are those born within University Hospitals Sussex (UH Sussex) NHS Trust - St. Richardâ€™s (SRH) & Worthing (WH) Hospitals maternity care. Referrals will be made to different departments based on the baby's location.

NIPE KPI data is submitted quarterly to PHE and local SIT team. Performance, management changes, and incidents are discussed in quarterly meetings. Mitigations for screens not carried out within KPI will be provided to NSC QA & local SIT team quarterly.

The NIPE standards include identifying the population, timeliness of intervention for various conditions, and ensuring timely diagnosis and intervention. KPI data should be counted based on the provider responsible for the baby at the time of screening.

Missed NIPE screens include when parents decline screening, babies on NICU are too ill to screen, or babies <34+0 weeks. If a screen is missed due to a failure in the screening pathway, it should be reported internally and escalated. Training for NIPE practitioners includes completing a minimum number of screens, e-learning modules, and annual updates. Practitioners who can perform NIPE include doctors competent in newborn examination and midwives who have completed accredited training. Various pathways for completing NIPE screenings post-discharge are outlined, with provisions for homebirths, NICU transfers, and community midwife assessments. Documentation and referrals for specific examinations are detailed in the guidelines. If a baby is deceased, the record should be marked accordingly and the NIPE team informed. All departments should be advised of any missed referrals or appointments.

Maternity information systems and CRIS IT systems are used to notify NIPE of neonatal and child deaths from specific departments. NIPE is also notified of all stillbirths. In the event of neonatal or child deaths, specific procedures are followed, including documenting declines in screening, sending letters to parents, and notifying healthcare providers of results. There are protocols in place for cases where data is missing or incomplete, and guidelines for addressing abnormalities found during screenings. Escalation processes are in place for babies close to breaching the screening timeline. Additionally, there are procedures for handling failed screenings and ensuring completion of NIPE screenings for all babies. Serious incidents are reported to the appropriate helpdesks, and protocols are followed to ensure accurate record-keeping and completion of screenings.

Check Badgernet to see if baby has been discharged. Document on the spreadsheet where baby is. If USS apt >4-6/52 & baby was born >34 weeks & above then these need highlighting to USS admin. If USS apt >4-6/52 & baby was born <34 weeks these babies have been age adjusted and is acceptable. Keep checking until baby is home or NIPE is complete. If discharged and NIPE not completed advised NIPE lead. Referrals for RACH Baby Hip Ultrasound clinic should be sent to: uhsussex.outpatientbookings@nhs.net. Queries regarding outcomes and treatment should be sent to: uhsussex.infanthipscreening@nhs.net. Babies with abnormal clinical examination in the neonatal period should be referred to the RACH baby hip clinic as soon as possible for an ultrasound scan at 4 weeks of age. Babies with the following risk factors and a normal clinical hip examination should be referred as soon as possible to the RACH baby hip clinic for an ultrasound at 4-6 weeks of age. The primary purposes of screening are early identification of a dislocated or a dislocatable hip(s) and the identification of sonographic pathological hip dysplasia through selective ultrasound scan. A 'one stop shop' model can be provided for timely assessment and intervention. Treatment protocol for babies presenting with suspected Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) includes different types and corresponding treatments and follow-ups. Neonatal hip examination should be repeated at 6-8 week baby check by GP. Abnormal clinical findings should be referred to a local baby ultrasound clinic for scan. Positive screens should be referred for a scan, while negative screens can be discharged. The NIPE target timescales for USS depend on the baby's gestation at birth. In case of appointment failsafe, a search should be created from the previous week to track and follow up on appointments. Risk factors for hip dysplasia include family history, breech presentation, and abnormal clinical examination findings. If a baby is still waiting for an allocated appointment, follow up with the USS team.

Please check the most recent version of the document on the Staffnet. Baby has an appointment for a hip ultrasound, but it is scheduled too late according to Public Health England guidelines. Request to bring the appointment forward. Follow-up on hip abnormalities for babies following NIPE screening. Request clarification on suspected hip abnormalities. Email to relevant practitioners for further action. Contact list for NIPE team provided.
