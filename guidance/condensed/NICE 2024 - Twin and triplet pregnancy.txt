68Recommenda tions 
People ha ve the right t o be in volved in discussions and mak e informed decisions 
about t heir car e, as described in NICE's inf ormation on making decisions about y our 
care. 
Using inclusiv e language in healt hcare is impor tant f or saf ety, and t o promot e equity , 
respect and eff ectiv e communication wit h everyone. This guideline does not use 
inclusiv e language in whole or in par t because: 
• the evidence has not been r eview ed, and it is not cer tain fr om e xper t opinion 
which gr oups t he advice co vers, or 
• the evidence has been r eview ed, but t he inf ormation a vailable f or some gr oups 
was t oo limit ed to mak e specific r ecommendations, or 
• only a v ery limit ed number of r ecommendations ha ve been updat ed in dir ect 
response t o new e vidence or t o reflect a change in practice. 
Healt hcare professionals should use t heir clinical judgement when implementing 
recommendations, taking int o account t he individual's cir cumstances, needs and 
preferences, and ensuring all people ar e treated wit h dignity and r espect t hroughout 
their car e. 
Making decisions using NICE guidance explains ho w we use w ords to sho w the 
strengt h (or cer tainty) of our r ecommendations, and has inf ormation about 
prescribing medicines (including off -label use), pr ofessional guidelines, standar ds 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and saf eguar ding.

Intrapar tum c are 
Recommendation 1 .3.6 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tion 
The committ ee recognised t hat t he cor e multidisciplinar y team r ecommended b y the 
previous guideline (see r ecommendation 1 .3.1) provides car e during t he ant enatal period 
and w ould not be t he same t eam pr oviding intrapar tum car e. Because intrapar tum car e 
was added t o the guideline updat e, they made a r ecommendation t o clarify t hat healt hcare 
professionals suppor ting w omen when t hey are giving bir th should also ha ve kno wledge 
and e xperience in multiple pr egnancy . 
How the r ecommenda tion mig ht affect practice

Screening f or chr omosomal c ondi tions 
Recommendations 1 .4.3 to 1.4.8 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Since t he 2011 guideline, t he National Scr eening Committ ee's r ecommendations on 
screening for fetal chr omosomal conditions ha ve been published and ha ve been 
implement ed by the NHS f etal anomaly scr eening pr ogramme (FASP). These apply t o

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 43 of
68replaced b y a cr oss r eference t o this scr eening pr ogramme. The committ ee recognised 
that no curr ent guidance e xists for triplet s so t hey retained a r ecommendation on triplet s 
from t he 2011 guideline. Ho wever, based on t heir e xper tise t hey decided t his e xisting 
recommendation w ould apply only t o scr eening in trichorionic triplet s so t hey made an 
additional r ecommendation about dichorionic and monochorionic triplet pr egnancies. 
Because of t he comple xity of scr eening t hese types of triplet pr egnancies, t his scr eening 
should only be carried out aft er referral t o a tertiary level fetal medicine centr e. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The r ecommendations r einforce curr ent best practice. 
Return t o recommendations 
Screening f or pr eterm bir th 
Recommendations 1 .4.13 to 1.4.15 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee agr eed, based on t heir e xperience and e xper tise, t hat w omen and 
pregnant people should be giv en inf ormation about t he higher risk of pr eterm bir th in twin 
and triplet pr egnancy compar ed wit h singlet on pr egnancy , and about f actors t hat ma y 
further incr ease t his risk. 
The committ ee retained t he existing 2011 r ecommendations t hat f etal fibr onectin t esting 
and home ut erine activity monit oring should not be used t o predict t he risk of spontaneous

68Intrapar tum monit oring 
The committ ee recommended off ering continuous car diotocograph y to women in 
established labour wit h a twin pr egnancy o ver 26 weeks because at t his gestational age, 
neonatal sur vival rat es impr ove and t he risks of neonatal morbidity fr om pr eterm bir th are 
falling. The adv antages of using car diotocograph y over int ermitt ent auscultation 
monit oring include t he ability t o assess baseline v ariability and monit or continuously . 
Performing a por table ultrasound (bedside) scan at t he star t of established labour not only 
helps t o confirm which is t he first and which t he second twin and locat e the fetal hear ts 
but also confirms pr esentation – malpr esentation is mor e common in twin pr egnancy t han 
singlet on pr egnancy and an emer gency caesar ean section ma y be indicat ed if t he first 
twin pr esent s in t he br eech position. 
The committ ee recommended in volving a senior obst etrician t o decide ho w twins ar e 
monit ored in established e xtreme pr ematur e labour (23+0 t o 25+6 w eeks of pr egnancy) in 
line wit h NICE's guideline on pr ematur e labour and bir th in singlet on pr egnancies. 
The committ ee recommended dual channel monit ors t o mak e sur e bot h fetal hear t rates 
could be monit ored and displa yed accurat ely at t he same time on t he same r ecord during

cardiotocograph y trace t o ensur e 2 fetal hear t rates w ere being r ecorded (wit hout 
mistaking t he mat ernal hear t rate for a f etal hear t rate). 
The committ ee recommended classifying and int erpreting car diotocograph y in a wa y that 
is broadly consist ent wit h the NICE guideline on intrapar tum car e, but wit h additional 
considerations specific t o twins. These include r egar ding twin pr egnancy as a f etal clinical 
risk f actor when classifying a car diotocograph finding as 'abnormal' or 'non-r eassuring' . 
This w ould r esult in a lo wer threshold f or classifying a car diotocograph as pat hological.

They also r ecommended applying a f etal scalp electr ode t o the first bab y while continuing 
abdominal monit oring of t he second bab y if abdominal monit oring is unsuccessful or t here 
are concerns about synchr onicity of t he fetal hear ts. This should only be carried out aft er

Twins or triplet s occur in appr oximat ely 1 in 60 pr egnancies (16 in e very 1,000 w omen 
giving bir th in 2015 had a multiple bir th), and 3% of liv e-born babies ar e from multiple 
gestations. The incidence of multiple bir ths has risen in t he past 30 years. This is due 
mainly t o incr easing use of assist ed reproduction t echniques, including in vitro fertilisation 
(IVF), and also t o changing demographics as w omen def er pr egnancy and twins ar e mor e 
common at lat er ages (102 in e very 1,000 w omen giving bir th in 2015 w ere aged 45 or 
over). 
Women wit h a twin or triplet pr egnancy ar e at higher risk compar ed wit h women wit h a 
singlet on pr egnancy . Adv erse out comes ar e mor e likely, bot h for the w oman and her 
babies, during t he pr enatal and intrapar tum periods. Because of t his, w omen need 
increased monit oring and mor e contact wit h healt hcare professionals during t heir 
pregnancy . 
Assessment and planning star t as soon as t he twin or triplet pr egnancy is det ected and 
continue t hroughout pr egnancy at each ant enatal contact. Det ermining t he chorionicity 
and amnionicity of t he pr egnancy allo ws the risk t o be stratified and t he number of 
antenatal visit s and ultrasound e xaminations t o be planned. It is impor tant t hat ultrasound 
surveillance is car efully scheduled t o monit or for complications including selectiv e fetal 
growth restriction, f eto-fetal transfusion syndr ome and twin anaemia poly cythaemia 
sequence (T APS). 
Identifying complications earlier means t hat decisions can be made pr ompt ly about 
referring t he w oman t o a tertiary level fetal medicine centr e. It also inf orms discussions 
with women in t heir second and t hird trimest ers about t heir hopes and wishes in r elation 
to timing and mode of bir th, and t he management of t he intrapar tum period (including f etal 
monit oring, analgesia and t he third stage of labour). 
This guideline r eplaces t he pr evious NICE guideline on multiple pr egnancy (CG129). The 
surveillance pr ocess f ound new e vidence and identified a need t o include intrapar tum 
care, an ar ea that was not included in t he original guideline. In curr ent practice, a 
significant pr opor tion of multiple pr egnancy losses occur intrapar tum and t he risk of
