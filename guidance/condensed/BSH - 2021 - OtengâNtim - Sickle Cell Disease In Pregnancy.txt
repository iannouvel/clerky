Literature review details
This BSH guideline was developed and updated from a pre-
vious Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
(RCOG) Green-top guideline1in accordance with the stan-
dard method of producing BSH guidelines. Medline, Embase,
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane
Control Register of Controlled Trials (CONTROL), the Data-
base of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects (DARE), the ACP
Journal Club and the Ovid database were searched for rele-
vant randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and
meta-analyses between 2000 and August 2018. In all, 218
papers were identiﬁed. Search terms included: ‘sickle cell’,
‘hydroxycarbamide’, ‘antenatal’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘intrapartum’,
‘penicillin prophylaxis’, ‘ACE inhibitor’, ‘transfusion’, ‘ultra-
sound’, ‘Doppler’, ‘echocardiogram’, ‘anti-coagulation’, ‘pro-
phylaxis’, ‘sickle cell and risk factors’, ‘preconceptual’ and
‘sickle cell crisis’ and included all relevant Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms and subheadings. The search waslimited to humans and the English language. The National
Library for Health and the National Guidelines Clearing
House were also searched for relevant guidelines.

Introduction
The purpose of this guideline is to describe the management
of sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy in the UK. It will
cover preconception screening and antenatal, intrapartum
and postnatal management of women with the condition. It
will not cover the management of women with sickle cell
trait. Updates from the previous guideline1include new
information on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD),
more comprehensive information on pre-conceptual screen-
ing and medication review, updated information on throm-
boprophylaxis, aspirin and vitamin D, changes to advice on
antenatal care including frequency of ultrasonography (USS)
scanning. It also includes reference to the most recent
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
and RCOG guidelines. SCD comprises a group of conditionsCorrespondence: Jo Howard, BSH Guidelines Administrator, British

caused by the inheritance of the abnormal haemoglobin
sickle gene (HbS). The most severe form of SCD is homozy-gous SCD (HbSS) but SCD can also be due to compoundheterozygous genotypes of HbS and another haemoglobinvariant (e.g., HbC, HbD
Punjab, HbE or bthalassaemia, see
Table I).
Sickle cell disease is one of the most common inherited
condition worldwide, with over 300 000 children born withthe condition each year globally, three-quarters of whom areborn in Africa.
3The prevalence of SCD varies considerably
across different ethnic communities, predominantly affectingpeople of African or African –Caribbean origin. Owing to
population migration, SCD is now of increasing importance
worldwide and there are increasing numbers of affected indi-
viduals in Europe and the United States. Within Europe, theUK has the largest population with the condition. In the UKit is estimated that there are 15 000 affected individuals, andapproximately 300 infants born with the condition each year.
The pathophysiology of SCD is the consequence of poly-
merisation of the abnormal sickle haemoglobin in low oxy-gen conditions leading to the formation of rigid and fragile
sickle-shaped red cells. These cells are prone to increased
breakdown, which causes haemolytic anaemia and the sickle-shaped red cells do not ﬂow through blood vessels easily,causing blockage (vaso-occlusion) in small vessels, leading tomost of the clinical features, including acute painful crises.Other complications of SCD include acute chest syndrome,pulmonary hypertension (PH), stroke, renal dysfunction,retinal disease, leg ulcers, cholelithiasis and avascular necro-
sis. SCD was previously associated with high childhood mor-
tality, but now, in high-resource countries with neonatalscreening and lifelong treatment, life expectancy is at leastthe mid-50s. With the majority of individuals born withSCD in the UK living to reproductive age and beyond, man-agement of this condition in pregnancy is now more perti-nent.
There are approximately 110 –200 pregnancies in women
with SCD per year in the UK.
4Pregnancy in women with
SCD is associated with higher risk of mortality and morbid-ity.
4,5Data from a national study in the UK showed an
increased risk of both sickle-related complications (acute pain,acute chest syndrome) and pregnancy-related complications[hypertension, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and urinary
tract infections].
4A retrospective study has shown that preg-
nancy-related VTE in women with SCD appears to be 1 /C15–5
times greater than in the general population.6Women with
SCD were more likely to require blood transfusion or admis-
sion to the critical care unit. Women with SCD were more
likely to deliver before 37 weeks of gestation and the babieswere more likely to have a reduced birth weight. Whilstmost of these complications were more common in womenwith HbSS than HbSC, both groups of women experiencedan increased risk of complications. A systematic review andmeta-analysis of studies in pregnancy in SCD conﬁrmedthese ﬁndings showing signiﬁcant increases in maternal mor-
tality, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, preterm delivery and infants
that are small for gestational age.
5Meta-regression demon-
strated that increased relative risks were associated withgenotype (HbSS versus HbSC) and low gross national
income.
Although women with HbSC experience fewer adverse
outcomes than women with HbSS, they are still susceptibleto increased painful crises during pregnancy, fetal growth
restriction, antenatal hospital admission and postpartum
infection
4,7,8and these women should have the same level of
vigilance and care as for those with HbSS. There are fewerdata on pregnancy outcomes in women with HbS/ bthalas-
saemia, HbSD, HbSE or HbSO
Arab, but anecdotal evidence
indicates that these too should be similarly monitored andtreated.
Preconception care
Discussion of pregnancy and conception should be embed-ded into routine care for women with SCD and be part ofthe comprehensive annual review (at least) from youngadulthood onwards
9and this should begin in paediatric clin-
ics where appropriate. This should include discussion ofreproductive options, partner screening, optimisation of
health prior to conception, preconception folic acid supple-
mentation and review of teratogenic medications. Preconcep-tion clinics should be available and accessible.
Genetic screening
Women with SCD who have a partner who is a carrier of abglobin variant (e.g., HbS, HbC, bthalassaemia) will have a
risk of up to 50% in each pregnancy of having a child with a
sickling disorder. Women with SCD should be counselledabout their reproductive options (non-intervention, prenataldiagnosis or PGD) by an appropriately trained professionaland this should be clearly documented.
Women are often not aware of the possibility of PGD and
hence do not have the opportunity to consider or participatein this. A review conducted in a London tertiary referral cen-
tre showed that 60 at-risk couples referred over a ﬁve-year
period, over all having 74 cycles of PGD, had a live birth rateTable I. Signiﬁcant maternal haemoglobinopathies.2

of 63% per couple.10This was much higher than the previ-
ously reported 17% live birth rate.11This paper noted that
there were signiﬁcant barriers to referral, and a separate sur-vey of parents of children with SCD found that only 41%had been aware of PGD prior to pregnancy.
12Care givers
should ensure that discussion of PGD and relevant referrals
take place in a timely fashion.
Recommendations
/C15As part of the annual review, all women with SCDshould be encouraged to engage with partner testingprior to embarking on pregnancy (1C) .
/C15High-risk couples should be counselled prior to preg-
nancy about their reproductive options: non-interven-tion, prenatal diagnosis or pre-implantation geneticdiagnosis (1C) .
Preconception comprehensive review of complications
A comprehensive annual review is part of recommended rou-
tine care; discussion of reproduction, pregnancy and contra-ceptive options and review of chronic complications shouldbe part of this annual review. The outcomes of the most
recent annual review should be assessed in any woman who
is actively planning pregnancy; investigations of particularimportance preconceptually include assessment of renal dys-function and cardiopulmonary disease. Renal complicationsoccur in up to 60% of those with SCD during their lifetimesand are characterised by glomerular hyper-ﬁltration andmicroalbuminuria from young adulthood with the develop-ment of proteinuria and chronic kidney disease in later
years.
13
Prior to pregnancy, women should have blood pressure
monitoring and screening with creatinine and urinary pro-tein (albumin:creatinine or protein:creatinine ratio). Womenwith abnormalities in renal function or proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio >50 mg protein/mmol creatinine) should be
investigated to exclude non-sickle causes. Anti-hypertensivetreatment should be considered in women with a persistently
raised blood pressure of >130/80 mm Hg.
14Choice of anti-
hypertensive medication should follow the NICE guidance.15
Pulmonary hypertension, ventricular diastolic dysfunction
and early cardiac death are all increased in SCD and Dopplerechocardiography has been used as a non-invasive tool forinitial evaluation and screening for PH. A raised tricuspidregurgitant jet velocity (TRV) is associated with increasedmortality and increased risk of PH.
16A small single-centre
study has shown that 33% of pregnant women had a raised
TRV, but this was not associated with poor outcomes.17
Women planning pregnancy should have screening withechocardiography if this has not been performed in the pre-vious year and at any time if they have symptoms suggestiveof PH.Other signiﬁcant previous medical history should also be
reviewed, for example, history of auto-immune disease asthis may need additional specialist clinical review.
Other complications of SCD that merit screening and
optimisation prior to embarking on pregnancy are sum-
marised in Table II.
Recommendations
/C15Pregnancy and conception should be discussed with
women of child-bearing age with SCD as part of theirannual review (1C) .
/C15Women should be reviewed by a specialist prior to
conception to ensure optimisation of health and
screening for disease complications (1C) .
/C15Preconception clinics should be available and accessi-
ble (1C) .
Preconception medication review
A thorough review of medications should be performed prior
to conception. Folic acid is recommended for patients withSCD in view of their haemolytic anaemia that puts them atincreased risk of folate deﬁciency.
18Folic acid is also recom-
mended in all pregnant women to prevent neural tube
defects and should be commenced preconceptually.19There-
fore, folic acid 5 mg daily should be prescribed when plan-ning pregnancy and during pregnancy both to reduce therisk of neural tube defect and to also compensate for theincreased demand during pregnancy.
Vitamin D deﬁciency is common in patients with SCD
and regular monitoring and supplementation for deﬁcient
patients are recommended outside pregnancy. Vitamin D
supplementation is recommended for all pregnant andbreastfeeding women in the UK.
20Pregnant women with
SCD should be prescribed vitamin D as per national recom-mendations for pregnancy
20and it may be helpful to moni-
tor vitamin D levels to ensure adequate supplementation.
Patients with SCD are hyposplenic and are at risk of infec-
tion, in particular from encapsulated bacteria such as Neisse-
ria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae . Penicillin prophylaxis is of beneﬁt in young chil-
dren with SCD, but there is no randomised trial evidence inpregnant women. In view of their hyposplenism andincreased risk of pneumonia, pregnant women with SCDshould continue penicillin prophylaxis, or start this if theyare not already taking it. Vaccination status should also bereviewed and updated as per national recommendations and
this should include annual inﬂuenza vaccination and pneu-
mococcal vaccination if this has not been given within theprevious ﬁve years.

The optimal analgesics to use during pregnancy should be
discussed with women as part of their pain managementplan. Paracetamol and codeine-containing analgesics can beGuideline

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
offered during pregnancy as ﬁrst-line agents.21,22If these are
not effective, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) should only be used with caution before 12 weeksand avoided after 31 weeks of gestation owing to concernsregarding the risk of premature closure of the patent duc-tus.
21Opioid intake should be assessed, with referral to a
chronic pain team if needed.
As part of standard care potentially teratogenic medica-
tions should be reviewed and particular attention should be
paid to those that are commonly used in SCD including
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angio-tensin II receptors blockers (ARBs) for renal dysfunction,hydroxycarbamide and iron chelators.
The recent Renal Association Guidelines (2019) recom-
mend that women with chronic kidney disease who are tak-ing ACEi have a plan for discontinuation/conversion guidedby the strength of indication for renin –angiotensin blockade
and the likelihood of early pregnancy conﬁrmation and that
ARBs are discontinued in advance of pregnancy.
21,23In these
women renal function and proteinuria should be carefullymonitored at least monthly throughout pregnancy.
Many women will be taking hydroxycarbamide prior to
pregnancy as this has been shown to decrease the incidenceof acute painful crisis and acute chest syndrome in individu-als with severe clinical manifestations of SCD and is the only
currently licensed treatment for SCD in the UK.
24Hydroxy-
carbamide is teratogenic in animals and its use in pregnancyhas been discussed in a previous BSH guideline.
25This
advises stopping hydroxycarbamide preconceptually in femalepatients. If women are taking hydroxycarbamide due tofrequent and severe sickle pain episodes, treatment with reg-ular red cell erythrocytapheresis should be discussed as analternative.If women do become pregnant whilst taking hydroxycar-
bamide, it should be stopped as soon as possible. There arereports in the literature of women receiving hydroxycarbamidein pregnancy both for SCD and for other indications and someof these have continued it throughout pregnancy without
adverse effects on the baby.
26–29Concerns have been raised that
for women with severe phenotype disease and no other treat-ment options, the risks of stopping hydroxycarbamide (whichinclude increased risk of pain crises, acute chest syndrome andworsening anaemia) may outweigh the risks of continuinghydroxycarbamide. This is particularly true for women who arenot able to receive blood transfusion because of multiple red cellalloantibodies or previous severe delayed haemolytic transfusion
reactions. For these women, we recommend a discussion
between the haematologist, the obstetrician and the woman priorto pregnancy to provide her with information about the risksand beneﬁts of continuing hydroxycarbamide therapy through-out pregnancy to aid patient-led decision-making. Referral to thefetal medical unit for additional detailed ultrasound scanning forfetal abnormalities may be considered, although the reliability indetecting hydroxycarbamide-induced abnormalities is uncer-
tain.
30A clinical trial is currently collecting retrospective data on
hydroxycarbamide exposure during pregnancy [HydroxyureaExposure Limiting Pregnancy and Follow-up Lactation (HELP-FUL): NCT04093986].
Iron chelators are not recommended during pregnancy
due to a lack of safety data so they should be regarded aspotentially teratogenic in the ﬁrst trimester and should bestopped when a woman is trying to conceive. Women with
iron overload should be carefully assessed with liver and car-
diac magnetic resonance imaging prior to conception tohighlight those at high risks of iron-related complications. Ifthere is evidence of iron overload, this should be treatedprior to conception. Cardiac iron overload is unusual inSCD, but if it occurs women should be encouraged to rigor-ously chelate prior to conception and third-trimester desfer-rioxamine can be considered.
New medications including voxelotor, crizanlizumab and
glutamine are not approved for use during pregnancy andshould be stopped prior to conception or when pregnancy isconﬁrmed if unplanned. Although these drugs are notapproved for use in the UK at the time of publication theymay be approved at some point and women may have beenprescribed these drugs from overseas.
Recommendations
/C15Folic acid (5 mg daily) should be given from beforeconception and throughout pregnancy (1A) .
/C15Women should be given vitamin D as per national
recommendations for all pregnant women (1C) .
/C15Daily antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended (2B) .

Antenatal care
Antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening
It is essential that any woman who has a potentially affected
infant (i.e. whose partner is a carrier or is affected by a sig-
niﬁcant haemoglobinopathy) is aware of this and receivesappropriate counselling. Partner status and subsequent coun-selling should be clearly documented. Further informationcan be obtained on the NHS Sickle Cell & ThalassaemiaScreening Programme website which includes informationabout the laboratories that can perform prenatal diagnostictesting.
31The objective of the screening programme is to
ensure that screening tests are offered by 8 –10 weeks of preg-
nancy by primary care or maternity services, so that earlyprenatal diagnosis can be offered.
Prenatal diagnosis (by chorionic villus sampling or amnio-
centesis) should be offered as early as possible in pregnancyto ensure early access to termination of an affected preg-nancy if requested. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed from11 weeks of gestation and is associated with a low risk of
miscarriage ( ~1%). Studies are ongoing using non-invasive
prenatal diagnosis via detection of cell-free fetal DNA in thematernal circulation, but this approach is not yet availableoutside research studies.
32Non-invasive testing would
increase the uptake of prenatal testing, though this needs tobe balanced against concerns that non-invasive testingputs couples under increased pressure to have prenatalintervention.
33
Recommendations
/C15If the woman has not been seen preconceptually, sheshould be offered partner testing (1B) .
/C15If the partner is a carrier, counselling regarding the
potential for an affected fetus should take place in theﬁrst trimester to enable prenatal diagnosis and if an
affected fetus is identiﬁed the option of termination
should be offered (1B) .
Maternal health
Many women become pregnant without preconception care.
Therefore, all of the actions outlined in the section onpreconception care including vaccinations, review of medica-
tions, assessment for organ damage, red cell alloantibodiesand iron status, should take place as early as possible duringpregnancy. Flu vaccine should be given but live attenuatedvaccines should be deferred until after delivery.
Thereafter, the mainstay of antenatal care is monitoring
for and prevention of general and SCD-speciﬁc complica-tions. Guidance on routine antenatal care for the healthypregnant woman is provided by NICE CG 62 /C1
34Prevention
of SCD-speciﬁc complications necessitates multidisciplinarycare involving obstetricians, midwives and Specialised Hae-moglobinopathy Teams. Good communication betweenhealth professionals is key to patient safety and hospital (or
network) protocols for transfusion indications and early
detection and management of SCD complications includinginfection, acute pain and management of labour should beavailable.
The frequency of routine appointments will depend on
medical progress and the presence of complications but areasonable guide is once per month, for clinical assessment,counselling, blood pressure measurement, blood tests and
urinalysis to identify asymptomatic bacteriuria.
5,35These are
summarised in Table III.
At each appointment, opportunities should be offered for
giving information and education regarding crisis preventionmeasures such as rest, warmth and avoidance of dehydrationand infections. The woman’s housing and work circum-stances should be reviewed, and interventions that mayreduce the potential provocation of acute crises (e.g.,
improved heating, allowance for increased hospital visits)
should be encouraged. Compliance with prescribed medica-tions such as folic acid and prophylactic antibiotics shouldbe ensured. NSAIDs should be used with caution before12 weeks and avoided after 31 weeks of gestation owing toconcerns regarding premature closure of the patent ductus.Iron supplementation should be given to women with pro-ven iron deﬁciency (serum ferritin <30lg/l); it should not
be given empirically as for anaemic women without
haemoglobinopathy.
36
Hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to dehydration and
sickle cell crisis and women with persistent vomiting shouldbe advised to seek medical advice early. They should be kepthydrated and consideration given to hospital admission andthromboprophylaxis. Multiple gestation in women with SCDsubstantially increases the risk of pre-eclampia, hypertension,
acute pain episodes and acute anaemic events; therefore these
pregnancies require close attention and increased monitor-ing.
Pregnancy-induced hypertension
Women with SCD have an increased risk of pregnancy-in-duced hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
4,5,37Aspirin prophy-
laxis is recommended at 75 –150 mg daily from 12 weeks of
gestation for women at high risk of pre-eclampsia,15,38unlessGuideline

they have aspirin sensitivity. Although there is no speciﬁc
evidence that aspirin decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia inwomen with SCD, in view of their increased risk we recom-mend that women with SCD and no contraindicationsshould be offered aspirin prophylaxis from 12 weeks.
15
Recent evidence suggests that aspirin may increase the risk ofpostpartum haemorrhage.
39so should be stopped at
36 weeks.
Close monitoring for pre-eclampsia is part of antenatal
care for all women and blood pressure and the presence ofproteinuria should be assessed at each visit. Women withpre-existing proteinuria or known renal impairment willrequire more frequent monitoring and should be discussed
with a multidisciplinary high-risk pregnancy team.
23Women
with SCD often have a low blood pressure, so an upwardtrend in blood pressure, even if modest, should be monitoredcarefully. A target blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg should
be used, based on recent American Society of Hematology(ASH) recommendations for all patients with SCD.
14This is
lower than recommendations for women without SCD.15In
women with neurological symptoms it is important to distin-
guish pre-eclampsia/eclampsia from the neurological compli-
cations of SCD.
Recommendations
/C15A full assessment, as for preconception care, shouldbe repeated as early as possible in the antenatal per-iod, including review of vaccinations and medications,
organ damage and red cell alloantibodies (1B) .
/C15Antenatal care should be provided by a multidisci-
plinary team including an obstetrician and midwifewith experience of high-risk antenatal care and ahaematologist with links to a Specialised Hae-moglobinopathy Team (1C) .
/C15Regular antenatal appointments for women with SCD
should provide routine antenatal care as well as care
speciﬁcally for women with SCD (1C) .
/C15Women with persistent vomiting should be advised to
seek medical advice early (1C) .
/C15Women should be reminded to take daily folic acid
(5 mg) and prophylactic antibiotics (if not contraindi-cated) and avoid drugs that are unsafe in pregnancy(1A).
/C15Iron supplementation should be given if there is labo-
ratory evidence of iron deﬁciency (1B) .
/C15Women with SCD should be considered for low-dose
aspirin 75 –150 mg once daily from 12 weeks of gesta-
tion in an effort to reduce the risk of developing pre-eclampsia and should be monitored for blood pressurerises and proteinuria (1B) .
/C15Aspirin prescription should be reviewed at 36 weeks
of gestation to consider stopping prior to delivery
(2C).Scheduled ultrasound scanning
Standard ultrasound scanning should be performed as per
the NICE guidelines.34A number of studies suggest an
increased risk of fetal anomalies and babies that are small forgestational age in the offspring of women with SCD.
37
Third-trimester growth scans should be undertaken for earlydetection of fetal growth restriction to aid appropriate timingof delivery and to reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity
in view of the four times increased risk of stillbirth.
40If preg-
nancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels are per-formed in the ﬁrst trimester and the value is <0/C15 multiple
of the median then consider performing more frequent scansafter 20 weeks.
41
Recommendations
/C15Women should be offered serial fetal biometry scans(growth scans) every four weeks from 24 weeks of ges-tation (1C) .
Blood transfusion during pregnancy
Transfusion has been used in pregnant women with SCD to
correct severe anaemia and reduce sickle-related complica-tions. It may also reduce pregnancy complications by reduc-ing the extent of sickling in the maternal and placentalcirculation and therefore may improve blood ﬂow and oxy-gen supply to the fetus. These beneﬁts must be weighed up
against the side effects of transfusion including the risk of
alloimmunisation and risk of delayed haemolytic transfusionreactions. The type of blood selected for transfusion ofwomen with SCD should be cytomegalovirus (CMV)-nega-tive, HbS-negative and extended Rh- and Kell-matched inline with previous BSH recommendations.
42
A full transfusion history should be taken from the patient
at the booking appointment or ﬁrst obstetric/haematology
appointment and should include communication with the
transfusion laboratory and national transfusion database toensure there are no historical alloantibodies. Patients withhistoric alloantibodies should be referred to the fetal red cellantibody clinic or screening programme for haemolytic dis-ease of the newborn for monitoring of antibody titres.
A key question in the management of pregnant women
with SCD regards the best approach to blood transfusion
during pregnancy. One approach is to give blood only if
required by the clinical situation, for example for acute anae-mia or other acute complications. The other approach is togive blood prophylactically throughout pregnancy; if thisapproach is used then further questions include whether sim-ple or exchange transfusion should be used, at what gestationtransfusion therapy should be started and is there a targetHb or HbS% that should be used. This has been discussed in
a previous BSH guideline and a recent ASH guideline.

There is currently insufﬁcient evidence to recommend
prophylactic transfusion over standard care (transfusion asrequired) and whilst there is some evidence that prophylactictransfusion will reduce vaso-occlusive pain during pregnancyit is not clear if the beneﬁts of transfusion will outweigh the
risks of transfusion (e.g., alloimmunisation). The recent ASH
guidelines
44concluded that there was insufﬁcient evidence to
recommend a strategy of prophylactic transfusion rather thanstandard care. A phase 2 clinical trial is currently investigat-ing the role of serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusionin pregnant women with SCD (TAPS-2).
45
In one randomised trial, including 72 women and pub-
lished in the 1980s44women received standard care or pro-
phylactic transfusion with simple or partial exchange
transfusion to achieve Hb 100 –110 g/l and HbS% <35%. In
the standard care arm, 44% of women required transfusion.There was a signiﬁcant reduction in vaso-occlusive crises inthe prophylactic transfusion arm [relative risk (RR) 0 /C128,
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0 /C112–0/C167] but no clear differ-
ences in other outcomes (maternal mortality, perinatal mor-tality or severe maternal morbidity) although this may be
explained by the small numbers included in the trial. There
was no harm identiﬁed from the transfusions. A Cochranereview
47did not ﬁnd any additional randomised trials and
concluded that there were no clear clinical beneﬁts of prophy-lactic transfusion over standard care. There have been numer-ous observational trials reporting on outcomes ofprophylactic transfusion in pregnancy and a meta-analysis hasreported on the previous randomised clinical trial and addi-
tional 11 cohort studies involving 1 291 participants.
48This
meta-analysis demonstrated that prophylactic transfusion wasassociated with a reduction in maternal mortality, vaso-occlu-sive crises, pulmonary complications, pyelonephritis, perinatalmortality, neonatal death and preterm birth. There was nodifference in pulmonary infection, acute chest syndrome, uri-nary tract infections, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine fetal demise,infants that are small for gestational age or have a low birth
weight. The event rates were low for most of the outcomes
and they concluded that prophylactic transfusion may posi-tively impact on severe maternal and neonatal outcomes butthe evidence comes from a small number of studies.
There has been a further paper looking at outcomes of
women with HbSC and comparing 10 women receiving pro-phylactic exchange transfusion with 14 women receivingtransfusion on demand or no transfusion but numbers were
small and selection methods were biased so it is not possible
to reach conclusions about the role of prophylactic transfu-sion in women with HbSC.
49
The risks and beneﬁts of prophylactic transfusion during
pregnancy should be discussed with the patient, haematolo-gist and obstetrician in early pregnancy and factors to beconsidered will include:
1. Genotype (HbSS more likely to beneﬁt than HbSC).
2. Phenotype (severe disease phenotype more likely to beneﬁt).3. Previous obstetric history (women with a history of previ-
ous sickle complications in pregnancy may be more likelyto beneﬁt).
4. Twin pregnancy may be more likely to beneﬁt (expert
opinion due to adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies).
5. Alloimmunisation (women with a history of multiple red
cell alloantibodies or previous delayed haemolytic transfu-sion reaction are at increased risk of transfusion-relatedcomplications).
Women who are already on long-term transfusion ther-
apy should continue on this during pregnancy at the samefrequency. Women on hydroxycarbamide will be advisedto stop this prior to conception and prophylactic transfu-sion should be considered if they experience a worseningof their sickle symptoms once they stop hydroxycarbamideor if they have a very severe prehydroxycarbamide pheno-
type.
If the beneﬁts of prophylactic transfusion are not
thought to outweigh the risks, then standard care is to givetransfusion on demand, when clinically indicated. There islittle evidence to indicate what target Hb or HbS% shouldbe used for optimal care and most evidence comes fromthe care of non-pregnant patients with SCD. The ran-domised trial of transfusion described above
46used an Hb
value of <60 g/l as an indication for simple transfusion and
this level was used in previous RCOG guidance.1Many
clinicians would aim for a higher Hb value during preg-nancy although this will depend on baseline Hb and symp-toms of anaemia. Women with severe sickle complications(e.g., acute chest syndrome, stroke or intractable pain)should be treated with transfusion as recommended in non-pregnant patients with SCD.
43,50
There is no evidence about the optimal Hb level or HbS%
prior to caesarean delivery. A randomised trial looking atelective surgery in non-pregnant patients with HbSS showedthat pre-operative transfusion to Hb >90 g/l was associated
with reduced postoperative sickle complications, particularlyacute chest syndrome.
51Caesarean section was not included
in this trial and the main complications were probably dueto general anaesthesia. Women with marked anaemia ( <70 g/
l) may beneﬁt from pre-operative transfusion prior to cae-
sarean section.

Management of acute pain episodes during pregnancy
Pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of acute
painful crises,52–56in both HbSS and to a lesser extent HbSC
disease.7In a prospective UK study, acute pain was the most
common complication, affecting 57% of pregnant womenwith SCD. Severe or extremely severe crises (requiring hospi-tal attendance or admission) occurred in 17 /C16% of women
with HbSS and 9 /C11% of women with HbSC ( P=0/C123). Post-
natal painful crises were also signiﬁcantly higher in the HbSSwomen, occurring in 21 /C16% of HbSS and 2 /C13% of HbSC
women ( P=0/C101).
4
There are a number of possible reasons for the increased
incidence of crisis including increased physical and psycho-logical stress; dehydration, particularly in early pregnancywhen nausea and vomiting are common; worsening anaemia,
which is common in pregnancy, related to increased iron
requirements and red cell turnover; the pro-coagulant statein pregnancy predisposing to vaso-occlusive disease; and theincreased risk of infection, for example, urinary infection orinﬂuenza, which can precipitate a sickle crisis. Birth, whetherby vaginal delivery or caesarean section, is a profound physi-ological challenge and can increase the risks of dehydration,hypoxia, anaemia, overexertion and signiﬁcant metabolic
derangement, which can all lead to a higher incidence of cri-
sis. Pregnant women with SCD may present with non-sicklecauses of acute pain such as placental abruption or appen-dicitis. A careful history is essential to determine whether thepain is typical for vaso-occlusive pain and if not alternativeaetiologies should be explored.
All pregnant women should have a prospective pain man-
agement plan for use in the event of a potential crisis that
should have been developed and discussed with the multidis-
ciplinary team (MDT) and the woman and shared with allhealthcare providers involved with her care including hergeneral practitioner and her community midwife. This
should be discussed at her ﬁrst multidisciplinary clinicappointment and reviewed at subsequent appointments.There should be a low threshold for referring a woman tosecondary care and all women with pain that does not settle
with simple analgesia, who are febrile, have atypical pain or
chest pain or symptoms of shortness of breath should bereferred to hospital.
There are no randomised controlled trials examining the
management of painful crisis in pregnant women with SCD, sotreatment of acute pain in pregnant women should follownational recommendations applicable to non-pregnant womenwith modiﬁcations to account for evidence of safety of speciﬁc
analgesics for the fetus. Mild pain may be managed in the com-
munity with rest, oral ﬂuids and paracetamol or weak opioids(such as co-dydramol, co-codamol or dihydrocodeine). NSAIDsshould be used with caution in the ﬁrst trimester and avoidedafter 31 weeks of gestation due to the risk of premature closureof the patent ductus.
21,22,57If a woman needs strong opiate ther-
apy, she will need to be admitted to the hospital. The NICEguidelines for the management of acute crisis advocate that
analgesia be given within 30 min of arrival in hospital after a
rapid initial assessment and the pain should be controlledwithin 60 min of starting analgesia.
58There is no evidence to
suggest pregnant women should be treated differently.
For severe pain, morphine, diamorphine or oxycodone
can be given by the oral, subcutaneous or intravenous route,depending on the woman’s preference and local expertise.Pethidine should be avoided because of the risk of toxicity
and pethidine-associated seizures in patients with SCD.
On presentation, a woman with sickle crisis should be
assessed rapidly for medical complications and precipitatingfactors requiring intervention. A full set of observations,using a modiﬁed obstetric early warning chart, including sys-tolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate,temperature, oxygen saturation and pain score should berecorded and repeated every 1 –2h .
58With analgesia admin-
istration, assessments of pain score, sedation score and respi-
ratory rate should be monitored initially at 20-min intervals.Women should ideally be cared for in an environment withexperienced nurses/midwives with training in looking afterpregnant women with SCD. Depending on local expertiseand the gestation of the woman and the severity of her con-dition, it may be appropriate to manage her on a medicalward, a haematology ward, an obstetric ward or in a level 2
or 3 critical care setting. Senior obstetricians, haematologists,
obstetric anaesthetists, obstetric physicians, specialist nursesand midwives should make up the MDT and care should becoordinated and planned by this group and discussed withthe woman and her family.
Fluid status should be assessed and documented carefully.
Dehydration should be avoided, and intravenous (IV) ﬂuidsmay be required to maintain adequate hydration. Fluid status
and IV ﬂuid prescription should be reviewed at least 12-
hourly, especially in a woman with SCD-related renal diseaseGuideline

or with suspected pre-eclampsia as ﬂuid overload is a poten-
tial risk.
Oxygen saturations should be monitored and if oxygen
saturation falls below the woman’s baseline or below 95%urgent medical review should be requested, due to the risk of
acute chest syndrome and pulmonary embolism (PE), and
facial oxygen should be prescribed. There should be earlyrecourse to intensive care if satisfactory oxygen saturationcannot be maintained with oxygen via face mask or nasalcannula. Women with back or chest pain should be offeredan incentive spirometer.
The woman should be assessed for infection and urine
culture and microscopy performed. A chest X-ray should
be performed if the woman has abnormalities on chest
examination or is hypoxic. Antibiotics as per the localpregnancy-speciﬁc guideline should be prescribed, if thewoman is febrile or there is a high clinical suspicion ofinfection. White blood cell counts are often raised in preg-nant women and in SCD and alone, do not necessarilyindicate infection.
59
Thromboprophylaxis should be prescribed for women
with SCD who are admitted to hospital with painful crises,
unless there is a contraindication.60Other adjuvants may be
required to treat the adverse effects of opiates, such as anti-histamines to treat itching or laxatives to prevent opiate-in-duced constipation, and anti-emetics may be required. As thepainful crisis resolves, most women are able to reduce theiropiate requirement rapidly, but this should be guided by thewoman’s previous experience.
In severely unwell woman, an accurate identiﬁcation of
the gestation of the fetus is required. If before the thresholdfor viability (approximately 24 weeks and 500 g), additionalfetal monitoring is not needed. From 24 to 28 weeks, fetalwell-being should be monitored by ultrasound scanning.After 28 weeks daily continuous fetal monitoring should beperformed in addition to ultrasound scanning (if not per-formed in the last week).
Recommendations
/C15Pregnant women with SCD should have an agreedpain management plan for the treatment of acutepainful crisis (1D) .
/C15If pregnant women are admitted with acute pain crises
they should be looked after by the MDT (1D) .
/C15The NICE guidelines58on the management of acute
painful episodes should be followed (1B) .
/C15NSAIDs should be used with caution in the ﬁrst tri-
mester and avoided after 31 weeks of gestation (2C) .
/C15Fluid and oxygen balance should be monitored regu-
larly in women admitted with sickle pain crisis (1D) .
/C15Women with SCD should be prescribed prophylactic
low-molecular-weight heparin during any antenatal
hospital admission (1B) .Management of acute chest syndrome
Acute chest syndrome is an important complication of SCD
affecting up to 10% of pregnant women with SCD.4It is
characterised by fever and/or respiratory symptoms and anew pulmonary inﬁltrate on chest X-ray. Patients should bemonitored for this complication throughout their hospitalstay and all hospitals should have a guideline that includesthe treatment pathway.
50Essential investigations for diagno-
sis and prognosis include chest X-ray and full blood count.
Arterial blood gas analysis should be considered in adultswith low oxygen saturations as severe hypoxia is a useful pre-dictor of severity and helps guide treatment. The main differ-ential diagnosis is PE which should be considered in patientswith a normal chest examination and chest X-ray. Aetiologyis multifactorial and includes infection so careful investiga-tion for infective causes should be undertaken including
blood cultures, sputum for microscopy and culture and spu-
tum and nasopharyngeal aspiration for viral testing.
Basic management will include prompt pain relief, incen-
tive spirometry and treatment of bacterial or viral infection.Blood transfusion should be considered early in the hypoxicpatient. A simple (top-up) transfusion may sufﬁce in early orless severe disease but exchange transfusion will be necessaryif there are features of clinical severity or a lack of response
to simple transfusion.
The critical care team should be involved in the care of
any patients with severe clinical features or in a deterioratingpatient to consider non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Fol-lowing an episode of acute chest syndrome requiring transfu-sion, the patient should be offered regular prophylactic bloodtransfusion throughout the remainder of pregnancy.
Recommendations (adapted from Ref.50)
/C15Patients with SCD can present with acute chest syn-drome (ACS) or it may develop after the onset of sev-ere pain. Therefore vigilance should be maintainedthroughout hospital admission (1B) .
/C15All hospitals should have a treatment pathway for
ACS which should include a referral pathway to the
high dependency unit or intensive care unit (1B) .
/C15Antibiotics, with cover for atypical organisms, should
be used even if blood cultures and sputum culturesare negative (1B) .
/C15Simple (‘top-up’) transfusion should be considered
early in the hypoxic patient but exchange transfusion isnecessary if there are severe clinical features or evidenceof progression despite initial simple transfusion (1B) .
Management of other acute complications
Acute stroke, both infarctive and haemorrhagic, is associated
with SCD61and this diagnosis should be considered in anyGuideline

woman with SCD who presents with acute neurological
impairment. Acute stroke is a medical emergency andrequires urgent brain imaging and referral to the strokephysician and haematologist. Rapid exchange blood transfu-sion can decrease long-term neurological damage. The role
of thrombolysis should be discussed with a stroke physician
and senior obstetrician. In women with neurological signs, itis important to distinguish cerebrovascular disease due toSCD from pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.
Acute anaemia in women with SCD may be attributable
to erythrovirus infection (parvovirus B19). Infection witherythrovirus in SCD causes a red cell maturation arrestand an aplastic crisis characterised by a reticulocytopenia.
Therefore, a reticulocyte count should be requested in any
woman presenting with an acute anaemia and, if low, mayindicate infection with erythrovirus. Treatment is withblood transfusion and the woman must be isolated. Witherythrovirus infection there is the added risk of verticaltransmission to the fetus, hence a review by a fetal medi-cine specialist is indicated to assess fetal anaemia.
62,63
Women with SCD can develop anaemia owing to bleeding
or any other causes of anaemia incidental to the SCD.
Rare causes of anaemia in SCD include malaria and, occa-sionally, splenic sequestration in women with a mildphenotype.
Recommendations
/C15Acute stroke should be considered in women present-
ing with acute neurological impairment and requires
urgent consideration of exchange transfusion (1B) .
/C15Acute erythrovirus infection should be considered in
women presenting with acute anaemia (1A) .
Management of VTE and thromboprophylaxis
Pregnancy is a well-established risk factor for VTE for
women but this risk is magniﬁed in pregnant women with
SCD.64–68In a recent meta- analysis the risk of VTE [odds
ratio (OR) 33 /C12, 95% CI 9 /C17–113/C14,P<0/C1001] and deep vein
thrombosis (OR 30 /C17, 95% CI 1 /C16–578/C12,P=0/C102) were
increased when compared to a cohort without SCD.68The
prevalence of VTE was 3 /C15-fold greater in women with com-
plications such as vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndromeand pneumonia when compared to those without these com-
plications, but was less in those with more severe anaemia.
6
In this study 28 /C16% and 71 /C14% of VTE episodes were identi-
ﬁed as having occurred in the antenatal and postpartumperiods respectively.
SCD is listed as one of the risk factors for thrombosis in
the 2015 RCOG Green-top guideline: Reducing the Risk ofVTE during Pregnancy and the Puerperium.
60This guideline
provides recommendations for risk assessments for thrombo-
prophylaxis and suggests that:1. All women with SCD should have risk assessments per-
formed in early pregnancy, if admitted to hospital, in theintrapartum and early postpartum period.
2. Women with SCD should be considered for prophylactic
low-weight heparin (LMWH) from 28 weeks of preg-
nancy until six weeks postpartum and if women have
additional risk factors, prophylaxis should start from thebeginning of pregnancy.
3. Women admitted to hospital with a vaso-occlusive crisis
or for other reasons should be offered LMWH through-out their admission unless there are contraindications.
Due to the higher incidence of PE in women with co-exis-
tent chest infections or acute chest syndrome
6and the over-
lap in presenting features a high index of suspicion for PE isrequired when assessing these patients. Women suspected ofVTE should be managed according to RCOG Green-top
Guideline No. 37b: The Acute Management of Thrombosis
and Embolism during Pregnancy and the Puerperium.

Intrapartum care
Timing of birth
There are no randomised controlled trials to dictate the
appropriate timing of delivery. Recent systematic review andmeta-analysis
5,70conﬁrm increased perinatal mortality, par-
ticularly during the later stages of pregnancy, in part due tothe complications of SCD. The risks of abruption, unex-
plained stillbirth, pre-eclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy
and acute sickle cell crisis are increased and unpredictable. Aprospective birth plan should be made, in consultation withthe woman to include mode of delivery, place of labour,MDT, positions for labour, analgesia and additional moni-toring requirements that may be appropriate. Due to theincreased risk of placental insufﬁciency and pre-eclampsia,delivery between 38 and 40 weeks is often indicated to pre-
vent late-pregnancy complications and associated adverse
perinatal outcomes.Guideline

Recommendation
/C15Pregnant women with SCD who have a normally
growing baby should be delivered between 38 and40 weeks of gestation (2D) .
Mode of birth
Whilst older studies questioned vaginal delivery as the opti-
mal mode of delivery for women with SCD, recent studiesreﬂecting UK practice of supporting vaginal delivery as therecommended mode of delivery, with the need for the cae-sarean section based on obstetric indications, report satisfac-
tory outcomes.
4,5Caesarean section increases the woman’s
risk of infection and VTE so elective caesarean birth shouldnot be advised for women with SCD in the absence of otherrisk factors or obstetric indications. Women with SCD aremore at risk of caesarean section because of the increasedobstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia, intra-uterinegrowth restriction and the need for earlier delivery.
5Previous
avascular necrosis of the hip can lead to poor hip rotation
and abduction; and in women with recurrent severe crises,
avoiding a long labour may help to minimise the risk ofintrapartum SCD crisis.
Recommendations
/C15Women with SCD can be offered vaginal delivery andvaginal birth after previous caesarean (VBAC) if there
are no other contraindications (2D) .
/C15In women who have hip replacements (because of
avascular necrosis) suitable positions for deliveryshould be discussed prior to delivery (1D) .
Optimal intrapartum care
Good analgesia (with a prospective management plan for
anaesthetics made prior to labour), with avoidance of dehy-dration, regular monitoring of oxygen saturations and avoid-ance of a protracted labour, form the mainstay of the
intrapartum management of a woman with SCD. General
anaesthesia carries additional risks beyond the normal obstet-ric case and should be avoided where possible. Womenshould be offered review by an anaesthetist in the third tri-mester of pregnancy to discuss these issues. Pethidine shouldbe avoided because of the risk of seizures when administeredto a woman with SCD.
There are no randomised controlled trials regarding the
place of birth for women with SCD but women should be
advised to give birth in hospitals that are able to manageboth the complications of SCD and high-risk pregnancies.Obstetricians need to be aware of the increased frequency ofsickle cell crisis and ACS in the intrapartum period and ofthe increased risk of painful crisis with long labour ( >12 h).This is often secondary to dehydration and in this situation,
the woman should be well hydrated. If labour is progressing,the labour should be carefully supervised; caesarean sectionshould be considered if labour is not progressing well anddelivery is not imminent.
During labour, if oral hydration is not tolerated or is
inadequate, intravenous ﬂuids should be administered usinga ﬂuid balance chart to prevent ﬂuid overload. If venousaccess is difﬁcult to obtain the woman should be referredto the anaesthetist. The demand for oxygen is increasedduring the intrapartum period and the use of pulse oxime-try to detect hypoxia in the mother is appropriate duringlabour. Arterial blood gas analysis may be considered and
oxygen therapy instituted if oxygen saturation is 94% or
less.
Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in labour is currently not
supported by evidence, but hourly observations of vital signsshould be performed. A raised temperature (over 37 /C15/C176C)
requires investigation. The clinician should have a lowthreshold to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics.
There are no randomised controlled trials regarding inter-
ventions during labour for women with SCD but close obser-
vation during labour is essential. Continuous electronic fetalheart rate monitoring is recommended because of theincreased rate of stillbirth, placental abruption and compro-mised placental reserve.
71Sickle cell crisis in labour should
be treated as per the guidance for antepartum crisis above.
Epidural analgesia is safe and effective and should be
available for women in labour.
Recommendations
/C15Women with SCD should be advised to give birth inhospitals that are able to manage both the complica-tions of SCD and high-risk pregnancies (1D) .
/C15The relevant MDT (senior midwife in charge, senior
obstetrician, anaesthetist and haematologist) should
be informed as soon as labour is conﬁrmed (1D) .
/C15Blood should be cross-matched for delivery if there
are atypical antibodies present (since this may delaythe availability of blood) (1D) .
/C15Women should be kept warm and given adequate ﬂuid
during labour, using a ﬂuid balance chart to avoidﬂuid overload (1D) .
/C15Continuous intrapartum electronic fetal heart rate
monitoring is recommended owing to the increased

Postpartum care
Optimal postdelivery care
It is important for clinicians to remain vigilant postnatally as
the risk of sickle cell crisis remains increased with 21 –25% of
women having a crisis post delivery and crisis being morecommon following general anaesthesia.
5,72Hydration and
oxygenation should be maintained and early mobilisationencouraged. Crises should be managed as for non-pregnantwomen. NSAIDs are routinely administered in the postpar-tum period and can be used during breastfeeding. Neonatesand young infants are at risk from the adverse effects of opi-
oids. Codeine should not be given during breastfeeding.
Dihydrocodeine and tramadol and other opioids can be usedbut should be at the lowest effective dose, for the shortestduration and under medical supervision. Infants should bemonitored for sedation, breathing difﬁculties, constipation,difﬁculty feeding and weight gain.
Breastfeeding should be encouraged, as in women without
SCD. If the baby is at high risk of SCD (i.e. the partner is a
carrier, affected or unknown status) early testing for SCD
should be offered. Samples should be sent to laboratorieswhere there is experience in the routine analysis of SCD innewborn samples.
Routine care should be provided as per the NICE guide-
line on postnatal care.
73Antithrombotic stockings are recom-
mended in the puerperium.60Thromboprophylaxis in the
form of LMWH is recommended whilst the pregnant woman
is in hospital and for six weeks post delivery.60
Women should be given appropriate postpartum contra-
ceptive advice, the timing depending on breastfeeding andthe choice of contraception to be used.
Recommendations
/C15Women should be advised that they have an increased
risk of pain episodes in the postnatal period and pre-
cipitants should be avoided (1D) .
/C15Women should receive thromboprophylaxis with
LMWH for six weeks after delivery (1C) .
Contraception advice for women with SCD
Given the health risks of an unintended pregnancy, coun-
selling about contraception is an important component inthe care of women with SCD and appropriate advice shouldbe conveyed to the woman’s primary care workers. Used cor-
rectly, all hormonal contraceptives have 99% efﬁcacy and the
choice of contraception should be individualised, taking intoaccount the woman’s preference, lifestyle and ease of compli-ance.
There is theoretical concern with combined hormonal
contraceptives (CHCs) that the risk of thrombosis or sicklecrisis may be increased. A retrospective study of
1 257 women with SCD, of which 178 (14 /C12%) were CHC
users, showed a fourfold increased risk of ischaemic strokeassociated with CHC. However, when adjusted for confound-ing cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, there was no
signiﬁcant difference.
74A systematic review found no effect
of CHCs on the frequency of sickle crises or other adverseevents and no effect on haematological parameters associatedwith sickle crises.
75However, whilst evidence remains lim-
ited, the authors’ recommendations are that CHCs should beused selectively, with risk being mitigated by controllingother cardiovascular risk factors. The 2019 updated Facultyof Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guide classiﬁes
CHCs as category 2, where the advantages outweigh the the-
oretical risks.
76
Progesterone-only preparations, such as the progesterone-
only pill, injectable contraceptives and the levonorgestrelintrauterine system (LNG-IUS) have not been shown to havedetrimental effects
77and indeed there is some evidence of
clinical beneﬁt. An early study showed oral progesterone ledto an 80% reduction in painful episodes.
78Intramuscular
depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) has been found
to reduce painful crises79and improve laboratory parame-
ters80suggesting an inhibition of in vivo sickling. Etono-
gestrel sub-dermal implant has been associated withimproved well-being in women with SCD,
81with clinical
improvement paralleled by elevation of F cells.82With the
LNG-IUS bleeding may be unpredictable for the ﬁrst fewweeks but most women will see reduced bleeding thereafter.
83
The FSRH classiﬁes progesterone-only preparations as cate-gory 1, unrestricted use.
76
The copper intrauterine device is classiﬁed as category 2
due to concern about the potential increased risk of bloodloss but it is still considered that the beneﬁts outweigh therisks. Barrier methods are safe in women with SCD but gen-erally less effective than other forms of contraception.
Recommendations
/C15Contraceptive advice should be given and conveyed tothe woman’s primary care team (1D) .
/C15The choice of contraception should be individualised
but methods that eliminate user failure, such as LNG-IUS and sssntramuscular DMPA are preferred (2B) .
/C15There is some evidence for reduction in sickle pain
associated with progesterone-only preparations (2C) .
/C15CHCs are an option for women with SCD but cardio-
vascular risk factors should be minimised to mitigatepotential risk (2D) .
Conclusion

ductive age and discussion of reproduction options andGuideline

pregnancy should form part of their annual review. Pregnancy is
a time of increased risk for women with SCD with increasedrates of maternal and fetal complications. Therefore each hospi-tal should have a protocol for the management of pregnantwomen with SCD. This should identify an MDT that has
responsibility for the care of pregnant women with SCD, includ-
ing an obstetrician with expertise in managing high-risk preg-nancies and a haematologist. Areas with a low prevalence ofSCD should be linked to a specialist centre or haemoglobinopa-thy co-ordinating centre for shared care arrangements andshared protocols and all staff involved in maternity care shouldreceive training in the care of pregnant women with SCD.
The majority of the recommendations in this document
are of low certainty, reﬂecting the limited knowledge base
and lack of clinical trials in this area and many are based onexpert opinion. As such they are likely to be updated if fur-ther clinical evidence becomes available. There is a need forwell-designed clinical trials in this area to ascertain optimaltreatment options.
