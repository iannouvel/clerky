Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH):
Causes include normal physiological changes to the cervix, local conditions of the cervix, vagina, and vulva, mild trauma, placental abruption, placenta praevia, and vasa praevia. Management includes clinical review and assessment.

Placenta Praevia:
Antenatal and day of delivery considerations for women with placenta praevia, including referral to a Consultant Obstetrician, documentation of placenta location, counseling on risks, and management of delivery.

Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH):
Risk assessment and care planning during antenatal and intrapartum stages, including identification of risk factors, documentation, and communication of care plans. Effective communication and responsibilities are crucial for management.

Clear communication between medical staff is vital in managing obstetric hemorrhage. The labor ward coordinator should ensure important information is communicated clearly. In cases of major hemorrhage, the Obstetric Registrar and Anaesthetic Registrar should be contacted for immediate management. For home births, midwives should initiate emergency management and call for urgent transfer if needed. In cases of primary hemorrhage, basic measures should be taken to facilitate resuscitation. For major and massive hemorrhage, specific protocols should be followed, including summoning the correct team and initiating emergency management. Communication with the hematology department and regular monitoring of blood components are essential. In cases of secondary hemorrhage, antibiotics may be indicated, and surgical measures may be necessary if bleeding persists. Postnatal care for women who have had a hemorrhage should include close monitoring and follow-up. Women who decline blood products should be informed of the risks and have a plan in place. Antenatal care should involve developing a care plan with medical staff and religious advisors if needed. Each woman's individual choices regarding interventions should be respected. Regular monitoring of blood levels and iron stores is important throughout pregnancy.

An ultrasound scan should be carried out to identify the placental site. There are well-described procedures for elective surgery in Jehovah’s Witness, and if any complication is noted during the antenatal period, the Consultant Obstetrician must be informed. A clear individual management plan should be documented in the maternal notes where blood products will be declined. All women who wish not to receive blood products should be seen by a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist. It is important for experienced staff to provide care during labor and birth. Oxytocic’s should be given when the baby is delivered, and an FBC should be performed before discharge home. Accurate documentation is essential, and thromboprophylaxis is essential once bleeding is arrested and coagulopathy is corrected. Debriefing is recommended to be performed by a senior member of the team, and a 6-week follow-up appointment should be offered to discuss the events in more detail. A datix needs to be completed for all MOHs >1500ml.
