Pregnancy and Breast Cancer Greenâ€“top Guideline No. 12 March 2011

1. Purpose and scope: This document provides clinical guidance for health professionals caring for women of childbearing age with a diagnosis or history of breast cancer.

2. Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females, with a lifetime risk of one in nine in the UK. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer occurs in younger women and may have an inferior prognosis. Treatment should be in a multidisciplinary team.

4. What is the optimal management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: Prognosis for women diagnosed during pregnancy is not worsened compared to non-pregnant controls. Diagnosis may be difficult, and treatment should be based on tumor characteristics and pregnancy stage.

5. Contraceptive choices for women wishing to avoid pregnancy after treatment of breast cancer: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods are recommended. Hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with current or recent breast cancer.

6. What advice should be given to women planning pregnancy following breast cancer: Women planning pregnancy after treatment should consult their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon, and obstetrician. Long-term survival after breast cancer is not adversely affected by pregnancy.

Several studies show better survival outcome in women who conceive after treatment for breast cancer. In the largest series, women who had a full-term pregnancy had a relative risk of death. The impact of pregnancy does not seem to be modified by tumor characteristics, but there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. Women with BRCA gene mutations have uncertain risks associated with subsequent pregnancy. Advice on postponement of pregnancy should be individualized based on treatment needs and prognosis over time. Most women should wait at least 2 years after treatment before conception. Women with estrogen receptor-positive diseases should be advised on the recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment. The majority of pregnancies after breast cancer proceed to live birth. Women can be reassured concerning the risk of malformation in children conceived after treatment. Pregnancy following breast cancer should be jointly supervised by the obstetrician, oncologist, and breast surgeon. Echocardiography should be performed during pregnancy in women at risk to detect cardiomyopathy. A slightly increased risk of delivery complications and caesarean section has been reported in breast cancer survivors. Women can breastfeed from the unaffected breast and there is no evidence that breastfeeding increases the risk of recurrence. The effect of breast cancer treatment on fertility should be discussed with all women of reproductive age diagnosed with breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhea with complete loss of germ cells. The effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy on fertility should also be considered. Women are generally advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years after treatment, but age is a major determinant of fertility. Fertility preservation options should be discussed with women before treatment, including the use of GnRH analogues and cryopreservation. Every breast oncology service should have a designated pathway for prompt referral to a fertility specialist able to offer assisted conception.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends universal access to sperm, egg, and embryo storage for individuals undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. However, NHS funding is not available in all areas, and the oncology referral pathway may not align with local IVF arrangements. Assisted reproduction after breast cancer treatment is limited due to loss of ovarian reserve, but options such as donated eggs and surrogacy can be considered. Women may need hormone replacement therapy for pregnancy after chemotherapy-induced menopause.

Reproductive concerns for young women with breast cancer are important to address. Fertility preservation options, such as GnRH agonist cotreatment and cryopreservation, can help protect ovarian function. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea and its impact on fertility should be considered in treatment planning. It is recommended to discuss fertility preservation options with patients before starting treatment.
