Guidelines for uterine artery embolisation (UAE)

Prospective studies have shown the role of UAE in treating symptomatic fibroids. UAE should be considered for lifestyle-altering symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, severe dysmenorrhoea, or anaemia. It can also be used for fibroids causing pain or mass effect on bladder or bowel. Contraindications include viable pregnancy, gynaecological malignancy, and active uterine infection. The technical success rate is high, with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Before UAE, a gynaecological review is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and discuss alternative treatments. The procedure involves embolisation of the uterine arteries and arterial closure devices are generally used. Post-procedure care includes monitoring for complications and pain management. Follow-up MRI is recommended, and further concerns should be addressed promptly.
