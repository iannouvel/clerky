Remifentanil PCA in Labour Guideline: 
A Remifentanil PCA provides a safe, effective alternative analgesic option for laboring women/people in whom epidural analgesia is contraindicated or has failed. 
Key changes to increase safety include reducing the bolus dose, ensuring 1:1 midwifery care, and increasing the lockout period. 
Indications for use include when epidural analgesia is contraindicated or at maternal request if staffing levels allow. 
Contraindications include inadequate staffing, allergy to opioid drugs, recent opioid use, and gestation less than 36 weeks. 
Absolute requirements before use include patient education, continuous midwifery care, dedicated IV cannula, and monitoring of oxygen saturation. 
Complications may include desaturation, decreased respiratory rate, drowsiness, and poor CTG variability. 
Monitoring requirements include continuous SaO2 monitoring, CTG monitoring, sedation scoring, and respiratory rate monitoring. 
The PCA pump and drug should be prepared by the anaesthetist, with a dedicated IV cannula and specific dilution method.

- No loading dose
- No background infusion
- Maximum 800mcg/hour
- Anaesthetist must be present for initial bolus and first 15 minutes of use
- Always use a dedicated cannula
- Flush the cannula after PCA is removed
- Only the patient is to use the PCA button
- PCA can be used during delivery and for repair of tears and episiotomies
- Naloxone should be readily available
- Educate on coordinating dose with contractions
- Give oxygen supplementation for maternal desaturation
- Reduce bolus dose for sedation
- Prescribe cyclizine for nausea and vomiting
- Prescribe Chlorpheniramine for pruritus
- Explain PCA as fast-acting pain reliever
- Timing of button press is important
- Inform of potential side effects
- Remifentanil is safe for babies
- Request remifentanil at any time in labor
- Complete PCA Prescription & Observation Chart with staff details, solution, PCA setting, observation scores, sedation scores, management of side effects, and absolute requirements.

Continue observations for 15 minutes after the PCA has been stopped.
