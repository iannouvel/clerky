Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus that affects the liver. The virus causes both acute and chronic infections. Acute infection may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms such as fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. Chronic infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Perinatal transmission is the most common route of HBV acquisition. Screening for Hepatitis B is offered to all pregnant women. Management of Hepatitis B positive women during pregnancy includes regular monitoring and antiviral treatment if needed. Babies born to Hepatitis B positive mothers require vaccination and surveillance. Breastfeeding is acceptable if the mother is Hepatitis B positive and not on treatment. Screening for Hepatitis C should be considered in pregnant women with risk factors. Management of Partners who are HIV, Hep B, and C positive includes notifying sexual health services.

B vaccine would be recommended followed by the full hexavalent course for newborns. IV drug users or women/people with a positive partner should be re-tested for HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B & Hep C in the third trimester. Pregnant women/people are offered screening for syphilis at booking of each pregnancy. Cases of known or previous syphilis should be documented. A formal re-offer of screening must be made by 20 weeks. The urgency to complete the assessment is because treatment, when indicated, needs to be instituted as early as possible to avoid adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Pregnant women/people with positive screening test results should be contacted and advised about the result within 10 working days. Assessment by the Sexual Health Team is needed to provide diagnostic evaluation of maternal infection. Signs and symptoms of Congenital Syphilis should be monitored. Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea testing is essential for pregnant women/people under 25 years old. Symptoms of these infections should be noted.

Infusion of 1mg/kg/hr IV until the umbilical cord is clamped. For ease of administration, the infusion solution is made up to 2mg/ml of AZT in 5% glucose. Prepare fresh infusion bag if required. Follow specific criteria for babies requiring Hep B vaccination and Hep B immunoglobulin.
