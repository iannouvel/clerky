Disengaging a Deeply Impacted Fetal Head at LSCS and Use of Fetal Pillow

This guideline applies to pregnant women requiring a lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) ≥37 weeks gestation with a cephalic presentation. Responsibilities include midwives and obstetricians following the guidance and management ensuring accessibility and review of the guidance.

Second stage LSCS is associated with higher maternal and neonatal risks. A deeply impacted fetal head is a common complication, requiring systematic management. Fetal Pillow is recommended as the first-line action to disengage the head. If the head remains impacted, reverse breech extraction is the second-line action.

For first stage LSCS, reverse breech extraction is the first-line action. If delivery is not achieved, the push technique can be used as a second-line action.

The decision flowchart guides the management of impacted fetal heads during LSCS. Instructions on how to insert a Fetal Pillow are provided for cases meeting specific criteria.
