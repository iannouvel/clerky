The purpose of this competency is to ensure that staff who are administering Methotrexate (via intramuscular injection (IM)) have sufficient knowledge and competence in order to do so safely.

Methotrexate is used to treat conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, Crohn’s Disease, and Sarcoidosis, as well as to medically resolve ectopic pregnancies and treat persistent trophoblastic disease.

Persistent Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (PGTD):
Patients with molar pregnancies may require chemotherapy, with ongoing monitoring and treatment plans.

Patients must provide informed consent before receiving IM Methotrexate.

Authority to proceed:
Patients must have adequate information, a clear prescription, and appropriate blood results before receiving IM Methotrexate.

Contraindications:
Patients with allergies to Methotrexate components, significant pain/bleeding from ectopic pregnancy, or abnormal renal/liver function tests should not receive Methotrexate.

Special warnings and precautions for use:
Staff administering Methotrexate should not be pregnant, and proper disposal and administration procedures must be followed.

Undesirable effects of Methotrexate:
Common side effects include injection site reactions, ulceration, bleeding, eye reactions, and photo-sensitivity.

Monitoring and audit:
Trained staff availability and incidents related to IM Methotrexate administration will be monitored and appropriate actions taken.
