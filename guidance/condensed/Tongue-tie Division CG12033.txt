Division of Tongue Tie (Ankyloglossia) Guideline

The aim of this guideline is to provide a resource for staff caring for mothers/birthing parents and their babies who have breastfeeding or bottle-feeding concerns relating to tongue tie.

This guideline applies to all staff involved in providing feeding support: Midwives, Neonatal staff, Maternity assistants, Maternity support workers.

Ankyloglossia, also known as Tongue Tie, is a congenital anomaly characterized by an abnormally short lingual frenulum which restricts mobility of the tongue. Breastfeeding difficulties may arise from the inability to suck effectively, causing sore nipples and mastitis in the mother and poor infant weight gain.

Symptoms of Tongue Tie include breastfeeding difficulties for both the mother/birthing parent and the baby. Referral to the Tongue Tie Clinic is for feeding concerns relating to tongue tie only.

In the case of all breastfeeding babies, a full breastfeeding assessment must be undertaken and a management plan put in place before discussing the presence of a tongue tie. The main part of the assessment is to observe a full feed and make any adjustments to ensure correct positioning and attachment.

Inpatient tongue tie divisions can be carried out on an ad-hoc basis, but only when a practitioner is available and their workload will allow. Training is required for any midwife or nurse completing an assessment of tongue tie and division.

A detailed assessment should take place using the Tongue tie Assessment and Division Clinic form and the Frenulotomy Safety Checklist. This should include an assessment of breastfeeding, maternal and birth history, family history, assessment of tongue structure and function, clinical judgment, discussion with parents, and ensuring the baby has received IM vitamin K.

2 doses of oral vitamin K.

Contraindications to performing a frenulotomy may include an unusually thick frenulum or where the presence of blood vessels can be identified. These cases will need referral to a specialist center with a neonatal surgeon.
