Preface: This guideline aims to support clinical decision-making, patient care, and health outcomes for individuals with PCOS. Contributions were made by healthcare professionals, researchers, experts, clinicians, and patients internationally.

Deputy Lead, Dr Anju Joham and Translation Lead, Dr Rhonda Garad. We acknowledge the enthusiasm and engagement of the healthcare professionals and women affected by PCOS, our partners, and collaborating professional societies and organizations internationally. Stakeholders have guided scope, identification of gaps, prioritization of clinical questions, review of evidence, and development of recommendations in the guideline.

The objective of the guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of PCOS to improve the lives of those affected worldwide. Participants included health professionals, consumers, and experts in various fields related to PCOS. Best practice, evidence-based guideline development involved extensive evidence synthesis and the GRADE framework.

Recommendations include using the revised Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis, addressing reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, dermatologic, sleep, and psychological features of PCOS, and emphasizing the importance of a healthy lifestyle. Screening and management for metabolic risk factors, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disorders are recommended. Shared decision making and self-empowerment are fundamental in care.

Treatment recommendations include lifestyle interventions, oral contraceptive pills, metformin, laser therapy, and antiandrogens. Letrozole is recommended as first-line pharmacological infertility therapy. In vitro fertilization may be considered for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility.

The guidelines emphasize the need for greater education, awareness, and shared decision making in PCOS care. The evidence for these recommendations is of low to moderate quality, highlighting the need for further research. Translation efforts will include multilingual education outputs and resources for consumers and healthcare professionals. The goal is to improve the health outcomes and experiences of those with PCOS worldwide.

The purpose of this international evidence-based guideline is to provide healthcare professionals, consumers, and policy makers with guidance on timely diagnosis, accurate assessment, and optimal treatment of PCOS. The guideline aims to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care by engaging multidisciplinary international expert representation, including international consumer and primary care representatives. It also aims to reduce variation in care, optimize prevention of complications, and improve health outcomes. Key principles include patient-centered care, recognizing individual differences and preferences, and promoting research and translation into practice and policy. The guideline is relevant to adolescents, those of reproductive age, and postmenopausal women with PCOS, encompassing all relevant complications and comorbidities. It is designed to apply in a broad range of healthcare settings and to a broad audience, including patients, healthcare professionals, policy makers, and the general public. The guideline does not address safety and usage information on pharmacological and surgical interventions, and recommendations should be considered in the context of regional regulations and resources. Extensive consumer engagement was a key driver for the development of this guideline, with consumers actively contributing throughout the process to prioritize consumer perspectives. The methods used to develop this guideline align with international best practice and follow comprehensive evidence-based processes.

Context statement on diagnosis: 
The guideline aims to facilitate timely and appropriate diagnosis for women with PCOS, while avoiding overdiagnosis, especially in adolescents. Specific recommendations include not using ultrasound and anti-mullerian (AMH) levels for diagnosis in those within 8 years of menarche, identifying young women 'at risk' with unclear diagnoses for follow-up reassessment, and refining diagnostic features to improve accuracy. Clinicians should consider individual patient preferences, psychosocial and cultural factors when discussing the value and timing of PCOS assessment and diagnosis. Education is essential at the time of diagnosis, emphasizing empowerment and considering personal characteristics and values.

1.2.4 EBR Laboratories should use LC-MS/MS assays over direct immunoassays for assessing total or free testosterone. 
1.2.5 PP For the detection of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is valuable in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. 
1.2.6 PP It is difficult to reliably assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the combined oral contraceptive pill. 
1.2.7 PP Repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role. 
1.2.8 PP In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age. 
1.2.9 PP If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, other causes of hyperandrogenaemia should be considered. 
1.3.1 EBR The presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults. 
1.3.2 EBR Female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation are weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism. 
1.3.3 CR A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism. 
1.3.4 CR Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism. 
1.3.5 CR A modified Ferriman Gallwey score of 4–6 should be used to detect hirsutism. 
1.3.6 CR Healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity. 
1.3.7 PP Healthcare professionals should use standardised visual scales when assessing hirsutism and consider various factors influencing the assessment of hyperandrogenism.

Healthcare professionals should recognize that PCOS is highly prevalent and has a significantly higher risk for diabetes. PCOS should be funded accordingly, and guidelines should consider PCOS as an independent risk factor for diabetes. Women with PCOS and their relatives should be aware of the increased risk of diabetes and the need for regular glycaemic assessment. Women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of PCOS, and screening should be considered. An OGTT is recommended as the most accurate test to assess glycaemic status in PCOS. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in women with PCOS and should screen for symptoms. Women with PCOS have a higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and preventative strategies should be discussed. Psychological features are common in PCOS and should be prioritized in care. Lifestyle interventions, including healthy eating and physical activity, should be recommended for all women with PCOS to improve metabolic health. Insulin resistance is a factor in PCOS, but clinically available insulin assays are not recommended for routine care. Behavioral strategies should be included in lifestyle interventions to optimize weight management and emotional wellbeing in women with PCOS.

Comprehensive healthy behavioral interventions may be considered to support women with PCOS in improving health outcomes. There is no evidence to support one specific diet composition over another for women with PCOS. Tailoring dietary changes to individual preferences is important. Physical activity consistent with population guidelines is recommended for health benefits. Weight stigma should be recognized and addressed in healthcare settings. Shared decision making is essential in prescribing medications for PCOS. The combined oral contraceptive pill may be recommended for management of hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. Metformin may be considered for adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Anti-obesity medications could be considered for managing higher weight in women with PCOS. Anti-androgens may be considered for treating hirsutism in women with PCOS.

Given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed. Whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses when anti-androgens are used. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism, with certain considerations for different types of anti-androgens. Inositol could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values. Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism in women with PCOS. Bariatric/metabolic surgery could be considered to improve various symptoms in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS have higher risk pregnancies and should receive appropriate monitoring and support. Metformin in pregnant women with PCOS has not been shown to prevent certain complications. Women with PCOS should be counseled on preconception risk factors and lifestyle interventions. Letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS. Metformin could be used alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than clomiphene citrate alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates. Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than metformin alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve live birth rates. Letrozole should be used rather than clomiphene citrate in certain cases.

Iphene citrate is recommended for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Gonadotrophins could be considered as an alternative to clomiphene citrate in therapy-naive women with PCOS to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be considered as second-line therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile with clomiphene citrate resistance. In vitro fertilization could be offered if first- or second-line ovulation induction therapies have failed in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Inositol as a therapy for PCOS is considered experimental. Anti-obesity agents in PCOS are recommended for research settings only.

-menarche, with 80% of cycles being within 21 - 45 days. By the third post-menarcheal year, 95% of cycles fall into this range, however cycles can remain irregular until the fifth year. A significant controversy remains regarding the application of identifying 95th centiles of cycle duration as abnormal in poorly screened populations, including those with PCOS. Recommendations for irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction include defining normal cycles in the first year post-menarche and considering a diagnosis of PCOS if irregular cycles are present. The mean age of menarche may differ across populations, and in adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles, the optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed. Biochemical hyperandrogenism should be assessed using total and free testosterone, with validated assays recommended for accurate measurements. Clinical hyperandrogenism can be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of androgen excess, such as hirsutism, acne, and female pattern hair loss. These features impact quality of life and treatment burden for women with PCOS.

Seven studies reported hirsutism, acne, and female pattern hair loss in patients with PCOS. Evidence suggests that hirsutism alone can predict biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism and consider reporting unwanted excess hair growth and female pattern hair loss as important. A modified Ferriman Gallwey score should be used to detect hirsutism, and healthcare professionals should monitor clinical signs of hyperandrogenism for improvement during therapy. 

Ultrasound criteria for diagnosing PCOS include follicle number per ovary, follicle number per cross-section, and ovarian volume. Follicle number per ovary should be considered the most effective ultrasound marker for detecting polycystic ovarian morphology in adults. Criteria for PCOM should be based on follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement. Ultrasound is not recommended for diagnosing PCOS in adolescents due to limitations in defining PCOM at a young age. 

Serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) has been proposed as an alternative marker for PCOM, but its diagnostic value is unclear and controversial. Studies have shown correlations between AMH levels and antral follicle count in PCOS, but further research is needed to determine its effectiveness for diagnosing PCOS and PCOM.

pooled sensitivity was 0.79 and pooled specificity was 0.87 for AMH in PCOS diagnosis. Excluding studies with high risk of bias did not change the results. Pooled sensitivity and specificity did not change between studies where PCOM was excluded from the control group and studies where PCOM was not excluded. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were significantly different between different types of assays. Recommendations include using serum AMH for defining PCOM in adults, not using serum AMH as a single test for PCOS diagnosis, and being aware of factors influencing AMH levels. Studies show variations in AMH thresholds for PCOS diagnosis in adolescents and adults. Ethnic variation in PCOS prevalence is noted globally, with a higher prevalence in certain regions. Recommendations include being aware of the high prevalence of PCOS in all ethnicities and regions, and that PCOS presentation may vary across ethnic groups. Postmenopausal women with PCOS may have persistent hyperandrogenism and a later menopause compared to women without PCOS. Recommendations include considering a diagnosis of PCOS as enduring/lifelong and further investigations for new-onset hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women. The risk of cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS remains uncertain, with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. It is important to consider cardiovascular health in women with PCOS.

Women with PCOS have higher risk of cardiovascular disease and potentially cardiovascular mortality. All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors and have a lipid profile at diagnosis. Blood pressure should be measured annually in women with PCOS. Consideration should be given to including PCOS as a cardiovascular risk factor in general population guidelines. Preventative strategies should be prioritized to reduce cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS. Consideration should be given to differences in cardiovascular risk factors across ethnicities and age. Healthcare professionals and women with PCOS should be aware of the increased risk of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes. Glycaemic status should be assessed at diagnosis and reassessed every one to three years. Prioritizing preventative strategies to reduce type 2 diabetes risk is important. Funding bodies should recognize the higher risk for diabetes in PCOS and provide appropriate funding. The 75g oral glucose tolerance test is recommended as the most accurate test to assess glycaemic status in PCOS. An OGTT should be considered in all women with PCOS when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment. Insulin resistance is a factor in PCOS, but insulin assays are not recommended in routine care.

OGTT is recommended for high-risk individuals despite its cost and inconvenience. Testing should be done at least every three years, with additional risk factors considered. Further research is needed to compare alternative diagnostic strategies to simplify glycaemic evaluation. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea and should be screened for symptoms. Treatment should target symptom burden. Women with PCOS have a higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and preventative strategies should be discussed. First-degree relatives of women with PCOS may have an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.

PCOS is highly prevalent and has significantly higher psychological disorders that should be prioritized and funded accordingly. Quality of life is reduced in women with PCOS across multiple dimensions, with depression and anxiety being common and impacting engagement in lifestyle interventions. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults and adolescents with PCOS and should screen for these using validated tools. Screening for mental health disorders should include assessment of risk factors, symptoms, and risk of self-harm. Routine screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms is recommended to improve wellbeing, facilitate appropriate referral and care, and optimize engagement with preventive strategies.

A pragmatic approach was recommended to screen all women and adolescents at the time of PCOS diagnosis and to use clinical judgment considering an individual woman’s risk factors and life events to inform additional screening. Targeted screening during the antenatal and postnatal periods in PCOS is aligned with recommendations in the general population. Psychosexual function and body image distress should be considered in PCOS, regardless of weight, and appropriate management and support should be offered if detected. Eating disorders and disordered eating should also be considered in PCOS, especially in the context of weight management and lifestyle interventions. Tailored information, education, and resources that are high-quality, culturally appropriate, and inclusive should be provided to all with PCOS. Entities responsible for health professional education should ensure that information and education on PCOS are systemically embedded at all levels of health professional training to address knowledge gaps. Women should be counseled on the risk of misinformation and guided to evidence-based resources.

Strong recommendations were made to enhance awareness, education, and information provision for healthcare professionals and those with PCOS. Models of care should prioritize equitable access to evidence-based primary care with pathways for escalation to integrated specialist and multidisciplinary services as required. Public health actors should consider increasing societal awareness and education on PCOS to reduce stigma and marginalization. Healthcare professionals should employ shared decision making and support patient agency in managing their health and care. Evidence-based strategies for shared decision making and sharing news should be used to inform PCOS care. Psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, has been shown to be effective in improving body image distress and self-esteem in women with PCOS.

3.2 Behavioural strategies

Lifestyle intervention is important in PCOS, with a strong focus on preventive strategies. Retention and sustainability of lifestyle interventions in PCOS are generally suboptimal, with behavior change interventions and support prioritized in this condition. Behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions are recommended by international general population guidelines. Given the need to improve adherence and impact of lifestyle interventions in PCOS, this question was prioritized. 

We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question, so the literature has been reviewed narratively. Overall, studies included overweight women, and results were heterogeneous, providing limited support for specific benefits of behavior change interventions. Consensus recommendations were made aligned to general population evidence and guidelines.

3.2.1 Lifestyle interventions for weight management and emotional wellbeing in women with PCOS include behavioural strategies. 
3.2.2 Behavioural support should include goal-setting, problem solving, self-monitoring, and SMART goals. 
3.2.3 Comprehensive healthy behavioural interventions may improve health outcomes in women with PCOS. 
3.3 Dietary interventions for women with PCOS show no evidence supporting any one type of diet over another. 
3.3.4 Tailoring dietary changes to individual preferences and goals is important for health benefits. 
3.4 Exercise interventions for women with PCOS should consider various types and intensities of exercise for overall health benefits. 
3.4.7 Self-monitoring with fitness tracking devices could support active lifestyles and minimize sedentary behaviors.

PCOS is associated with an increased risk of weight gain, particularly with excess central weight, which can worsen insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Excess weight is common in PCOS, with a higher prevalence of obesity in Caucasian women compared to Asian women. Factors contributing to weight gain in PCOS include suboptimal diet and physical activity. Intrinsic factors such as hormonal abnormalities may also play a role in weight gain. Women with PCOS may have differences in appetite-related hormones and lifestyle behaviors compared to women without PCOS. Prevention of weight gain is crucial in PCOS management. Weight stigma is a significant concern for women with PCOS, with negative attitudes and discrimination commonly experienced. More research is needed in this area to better understand the mechanisms contributing to weight gain in PCOS.

50% of participants reported weight stigma. Given the studies included here, further information can be found in the technical report. Weight stigma is associated with negative outcomes, such as exercise avoidance and increased food consumption. It is also linked to adverse mental health outcomes. Recommendations include promoting awareness of weight stigma and providing weight-inclusive care. Weight stigma is pervasive and healthcare professionals should be aware of their biases. Weight-neutral care is recommended to avoid stigma. Future research should consider cultural and ethnic subgroups. Weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors and should be recognized in healthcare settings. Weight stigma is linked to negative biopsychosocial outcomes and should be addressed in healthcare. Weight stigma is associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Practicing weight-inclusive care can significantly impact practice. Weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors and should be recognized in healthcare settings.

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) could be recommended in reproductive age adults with PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. The COCP could be considered in adolescents at risk or with a clear diagnosis of PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles. Health professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (≥ 30 μg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30 μg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS. General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended. The 35 μg ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate preparations should be considered as second-line therapy over other COCPs, balancing benefits and adverse effects, including venous thromboembolic risks. Progestin only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited. When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS, it is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies. Shared decision making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence. Natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses (such as 20-30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent), need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side-effects, cost and availability. The relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines. The relative and absolute contraindications and side-effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion. PCOS specific features such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors need to be considered.

In PCOS, COCP treatment may lower total testosterone levels with moderate certainty of evidence. Metformin may lower insulin levels and improve metabolic outcomes with low to moderate certainty of evidence. Combined therapy of COCP and metformin may offer little additional benefit over individual treatments in adults with PCOS. Anti-obesity pharmacological agents, such as liraglutide and orlistat, may be considered for weight management in adults with PCOS. The role of anti-androgen pharmacological agents in PCOS remains controversial.

Anti-androgen versus metformin: Fasting glucose improved in both groups at six months, with no difference at 12 months. The finasteride group had higher SHBG concentrations at 12 months.

Anti-androgen + COCP versus COCP +/- placebo: Total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were lower in COCP +/- placebo. No differences in weight, BMI, testosterone, SHBG, HDL, and adverse events were noted.

Anti-androgen + metformin versus COCP: SHBG levels were higher with COCP treatment. Anti-androgen + metformin lowered triglycerides and LDL.

Anti-androgen + COCP versus metformin: No differences were seen in BMI or HDL. FAI and androstenedione levels were lower after anti-androgen + COCP. Fasting glucose levels were lower after metformin.

Anti-androgen + lifestyle versus anti-androgen + metformin + lifestyle: No differences were apparent for BMI, hirsutism, total testosterone, insulin resistance. Fasting glucose was lower in the intervention with metformin.

Anti-androgen + metformin + lifestyle versus metformin + lifestyle: No differences in weight, BMI, WHR, hirsutism, SHBG, DHEAS, lipids, testosterone, and fasting insulin. 

Anti-androgen + metformin + pioglitazone versus COCP: Pioglitazone group had reduced hirsutism, SHBG, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL, CRP, and FAI. 

Recommendations: Anti-androgens could be considered for hirsutism in women with PCOS. Healthcare professionals should consider the risks and side effects of different anti-androgen agents. 

Inositol: Inositol could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values. Metformin should be considered over inositol for hirsutism and central adiposity. Specific types, doses, or combinations of inositol cannot currently be recommended due to a lack of quality evidence.

4.10 Pregnancy outcomes

Women with PCOS are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of these risks and provide appropriate management during pregnancy.

Women with PCOS have significantly higher odds of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, and caesarean section compared to women without PCOS. They also have higher gestational weight gain and BMI but lower birthweight. Metformin in pregnancy may be considered in certain circumstances to reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain. Side effects of metformin are mostly mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms. It is important for healthcare professionals to identify PCOS status during antenatal care and provide appropriate monitoring and support. Consideration of preconception BMI, hypertension, and diabetes status is recommended in screening for women with PCOS. Blood pressure measurement and OGTT should be performed when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment. Assisted reproductive technology in women with PCOS does not confer additional risk of certain pregnancy complications. Early lifestyle intervention should be offered to pregnant women with PCOS to reduce the risk of complications.

The benefits of metformin in pregnancy for women with PCOS are well-established, but more research is needed on specific subgroups. Preconception care for women with PCOS should focus on optimizing weight, lifestyle, and managing chronic conditions. Tubal patency testing should be considered on an individual basis for women with PCOS and infertility. Aromatase inhibitors like letrozole are effective for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS.

Meta-analysis showed that letrozole was superior for ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate per patient compared to clomiphene citrate. Letrozole + metformin was also more effective than clomiphene citrate + metformin for ovulation and pregnancy rates per patient. Letrozole was recommended as the first-line treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS. No differences were found in multiple pregnancy rates between different treatments.

Formin versus gonadotrophins: One study in clomiphene citrate-resistant women with PCOS showed a higher clinical pregnancy rate with FSH compared to clomiphene citrate + metformin. Certainty in these results is very low. 

Clomiphene citrate and metformin: Metformin could be used alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin in these women to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. 

Gonadotrophins: Gonadotrophins alone could be considered rather than clomiphene citrate in therapy-naive women with PCOS to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Gonadotrophins could be second-line therapy for women with PCOS who have failed first-line oral ovulation induction. 

Laparoscopic ovarian surgery: Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be second-line therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate resistance and no other infertility factors.

PP When using laparoscopic ovarian surgery, consider the comparative cost, expertise required, and risks for women above a healthy weight. 

In women with PCOS, IVF/ICSI can be effective for improving fertility outcomes when ovulation induction therapies have failed. Consider the risks, costs, and benefits of IVF compared to other treatments. 

In women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, the choice between a GnRH antagonist protocol and a GnRH agonist long protocol does not significantly impact clinical pregnancy or live birth rates. 

For women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing embryos is recommended to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. 

The choice of urinary or recombinant FSH for women with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI does not significantly impact fertility outcomes. 

There is insufficient evidence to recommend exogenous luteinising hormone treatment during IVF/ICSI for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS.

In PCOS, increased LH secretion or elevated LH/FSH ratio may influence fertility. Exogenous LH in IVF/ICSI has unclear benefits. LH supplementation is not recommended for women with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI. Metformin may be effective in improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI. In vitro maturation (IVM) could be considered as an alternative to stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles in women with PCOS. Inositol therapy for PCOS with infertility is considered experimental. Anti-obesity pharmacological agents should only be used in research settings to establish efficacy and safety for reproductive outcomes in PCOS.

This guideline was developed according to NHMRC standards and procedures and the GRADE approach. It builds on previous guidelines and aims to improve health outcomes for women with PCOS. The guideline development involved international health professionals and consumers to address key clinical areas. Governance included various committees and GDGs with multidisciplinary expertise. Consumer engagement was a priority, with input from various consumer bodies. Indigenous and CALD populations were also considered in the guideline development. Inclusive language and weight stigma were addressed in the guideline. Conflict of interest was managed, and GDG members received training in evidence review. Clinical questions addressed by each GDG were focused on screening, diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of PCOS.

Information was collected on general details such as title, authors, reference/source, country, year of publication, setting, participants, and results/outcomes. Data synthesis involved qualitative and quantitative methods, including meta-analyses. High-quality trials were used for more powerful meta-analyses. Research integrity assessments are important to ensure trustworthy results. The RIGID framework was developed to manage problematic studies in guideline development. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE evidence profiles. Recommendations were formulated using the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework, with strong and conditional recommendations. Public consultation was conducted for thirty days.

February to 30th of March 2023 in accordance with legislative requirements. Public consultation strategy included an online portal for feedback. External review by GDG members, international advisory panel, and professional societies. Guideline will be updated every five years based on new evidence. Research priorities for PCOS include studies on irregular cycles, hyperandrogenism, clinical features, ultrasound, AMH, and ethnic variation. Priorities also include studies on cardiovascular disease, glucose tolerance, obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial health, and psychological outcomes. Lifestyle interventions, behavioural interventions, dietary interventions, exercise interventions, weight gain, and weight stigma are also important research areas.

Algorithm 1: Screening, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment, and life stage

Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes) = diagnosis
Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes) = diagnosis
Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents: Ultrasound or AMH is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, adults: Ultrasound for PCOM OR Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) level if positive = diagnosis

Exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal tumors etc) Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism should also be excluded clinically and with LH and FSH levels

Irregular menstrual cycles: Normal in the first year post-menarche = pubertal transition. >1 to <3 years post-menarche: <21 or >45 days, >3 years post-menarche to perimenopause: <21 or >35 days or <8 cycles per year, >1 year post-menarche >90 days for any one cycle. Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or >3 years post-thelarche. With irregular cycles, PCOS should be considered and assessed according to guidelines. Ovulatory dysfunction can occur with regular cycles. If anovulation suspected, check progesterone levels.

Biochemical hyperandrogenism: Use total testosterone and free testosterone for diagnosis. Highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry assays recommended. Reliable assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism not possible on hormonal contraception. Consider withdrawal for ≥3 months with alternative contraception. Biochemical hyperandrogenism role is when clinical hyperandrogenism is unclear.

Clinical hyperandrogenism: Comprehensive history and physical examination needed. Standardized visual scales are preferred. Ultrasound and polycystic ovary morphology: With irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. Serum AMH could be used for defining PCOM in adults as an alternative to pelvic ultrasound.

Ethnic variation and prevalence: PCOS prevalence appears similar across ethnicities and is 10-13% globally by International guideline/Rotterdam criteria.

Menopause life stage: A diagnosis of PCOS is considered enduring. Postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism require further investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis.

Cardiovascular disease risk: Women with PCOS have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. All with PCOS should be assessed for individual cardiovascular risk factors and global CVD risk. All women with PCOS should have a fasting lipid profile and blood pressure measured annually.

Impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes: Regardless of age and BMI, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are increased in PCOS. Glycemic status should be assessed at baseline and every 1-3 years based on risk factors. OGTT should be offered in all with PCOS when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment.

Obstructive sleep apnea: Women with PCOS have a significantly higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea. Endometrial cancer: Women with PCOS have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Health professionals should have a low threshold for investigation with persistent thickened endometrium and risk factors.

Risk of PCOS and cardiometabolic risk in first-degree relatives: Fathers and brothers of women with PCOS may have an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.

Algorithm 2: Prevalence, screening, diagnostic assessment, and treatment of emotional wellbeing

Psychological domains, screening protocol/tools, and intervention are important for addressing quality of life, anxiety, depressive symptoms, psychosexual dysfunction, body image, eating disorders, and information needs in women with PCOS.

Algorithm 3: Lifestyle

Weight stigma, factors affecting weight gain, obesity and weight assessment, prevention of weight gain, effectiveness of lifestyle interventions, dietary intervention, exercise intervention, and behavioral strategies are key components of lifestyle management for women with PCOS.

In adolescents with a clear PCOS diagnosis or at risk of PCOS, COCP is recommended as first-line treatment. Consideration should be given to the lowest effective natural estrogen dose preparations. Additional therapy may be needed for hirsutism and other PCOS-related risk factors. Metformin is most beneficial in high metabolic risk groups. Lifestyle changes, including weight management, should be considered in adults with PCOS. Anti-androgens may be used to treat hirsutism if there is an inadequate response to other treatments. Ongoing monitoring is necessary for long-term use of metformin. Anti-obesity medications and inositol may also be considered for management. Laser and light therapies can be used for reducing facial hirsutism. Clomiphene citrate with metformin may be considered for infertility treatment in PCOS. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery and in vitro fertilization are options for those with infertility. Lifestyle changes and baseline investigations are recommended for all individuals with PCOS to optimize fertility outcomes and overall health. Off-label prescribing of medications is common in PCOS and should be discussed with patients. Second-line medical treatments may be considered if first-line options are ineffective. In vitro fertilization is a third-line option for infertility in PCOS. Management should follow evidence-based guidelines for best practices.
