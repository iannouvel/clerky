4.0 Background 
 
A collaboration led by MBRRACE-UK was appointed by the Healthcare Quality Improvement 
Partnership (HQIP) to develop and establish a national standardised Perinatal Mortality 
Review Tool (PMRT). The PMRT was designed with user and parent involvement to support 
high quality standardised perinatal reviews on the principle of 'review once, review well'.

Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
4.1 PMRT Criteria 
 
The PMRT has been designed to support the review of the following perinatal deaths: 
 
 Late fetal losses where the baby is born between 22+0 and 23+6 weeks of 
pregnancy showing no signs of life, irrespective of when the death occurred, or if 
the gestation is not known, where the baby is over 500g; 
 All stillbirths where the baby is born from 24+0 weeks gestation showing no signs 
of life, or if the gestation is not known, where the baby is over 500g; 
 All neonatal deaths where the baby is born alive from 22+0 but dies up to 28 days 
after birth, or if the gestation is not known, where the baby is over 500g; 
 Post-neonatal deaths where the baby is born alive from 22+0 but dies after 28 
days following neonatal care; the baby may be receiving planned palliative care 
elsewhere (including at home) when they die. 
 
The PMRT is not designed to support the review of the following perinatal deaths: 
 
 Termination of pregnancy at any gestation; 
 Babies who die in the community 28 days after birth or later who have not 
received neonatal care; 
 Babies with brain injury who survive. 
 
4.2 Aim of PMRT approach 
 
 Systematic, multidisciplinary, high quality reviews of the circumstances and care 
leading up to and surrounding each stillbirth and neonatal death, and the deaths of 
babies who die in the post-neonatal period having received neonatal care; 
 Active communication with parents to ensure they are told that a review of their 
care and that of their baby will be carried out and how they can contribute to the 
process; 
 A structured process of review, learning, reporting and actions to improve future 
care; 
 Coming to a clear understanding of why each baby died, accepting that this may 
not always be possible even when full clinical investigations have been 
undertaken; this will involve a grading of the care provided; 
 Production of a report for parents which includes a meaningful, plain English 
explanation of why their baby died and whether, with different actions, the death of 
their baby might have been prevented; 
 Other reports from the tool which will enable organisations providing and 
commissioning care to identify emerging themes across a number of deaths to 
support learning and changes in the delivery and commissioning of care to 
improve future care and prevent the future deaths which are avoidable; 
 Production of national reports of the themes and trends associated with perinatal 
deaths to enable national lessons to be learned from the nation-wide system of 
reviews.

 Parents whose baby has died have the greatest interest of all in the review of their 
baby's death. Alongside the national annual reports a lay summary of the main 
technical report will be written specifically for families and the wider public. This 
will help local NHS services and baby loss charities to help parents engage with 
the local review process and improvements in care. 
 
5.0  Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) 
 
Safety Action 1 outlines the requirements for local trusts in relation to MBRRACE-UK and 
PMRT. This is to provide assurance that the national PMRT is being used to review perinatal 
death to the required standard.  
 
Within the Year 4 CNST document, deadlines for each component of the Safety Action are 
given.  
 
In response to lessons learned, PMRT will be included as a mandatory item on the monthly 
divisional Governance agenda to align with the monthly reporting required by PMRT and 
CNST. A tracker will support this process of which an example template can be seen in 
Appendix 1 . Risk noted that if monthly governance meeting is postponed/stood down this 
may impact on the ability to pick up on issues with reporting deadlines relating PMRT and 
deadlines required of MBRRACE-UK - if this occurs SOP should address how this is 
reported within the management team. 
 
To further mitigate risk around potentially missed deadlines a PMRT item will be added to 
the daily call collection sheet, review every Friday to positively ascertain any events which 
relate to PMRT and escalate any issues which may impact on meeting PMRT reporting 
deadlines. This should include the neonatal matrons from each site updating on any recently 
deceased baby over the last 24-72 hours. 
 
hold overall responsibility for the PMRT processes including 
chairing the monthly MDT meetings. In their absence, a member of the Governance team or 
Matron team will support the running of the meeting, ensuring deadlines continue to be 
monitored.  
 
The administrative processes should be supported by a dedicated administrator, as per 
MBRRACE-UK recommendations. 
 
6.0  Identification of Incident 
 
Any death is reported by the health care professional to the online incident reporting system, 
Datix and also via the Bereavement email group. The Clinical Governance team will pick up 
reported incidents that meet the criteria for PMRT through this method. However, as a 
failsafe, a report is run via the Maternity Information System (MIS) to pick up any eligible 
cases that might not have been reported via Datix. This failsafe is carried out every week 
and cases not reported are done so in retrospect. Additionally the Badgernet Data  
UHS-SP-0003-2023 Local Requirements for PMRT Investigations SOP v1.1 Dec 2023 Page 7 of 27  
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
Coordinator will inform the Clinical Governance team of any cases of neonatal deaths (NND) 
at each month end. 
 
Any cases which may not have been reported via the incident reporting method, are those 
babies who die elsewhere. Local Clinical Governance teams do not have jurisdiction over 
this notification, however the team communicate regularly with the Child Death team who 
can also support notification of any deaths relevant to the trust should they become aware of 
them. 
 
7.0  Reporting to MBRRACE-UK  
 
7.1  MBRRACE-UK Notification 
 
The MBRRACE-UK online reporting form is a data collection tool for national surveillance. 
Deaths should be reported to MBRRACE-UK via the online reporting form within 7 working 
days of a death (in accordance with Safety Action 1 of CNST, year 4 standards).  
 
The MBRRACE-UK reporting form is completed by the trust where the baby died. Therefore, 
if a baby was transferred to another hospital outside of the trust whilst alive but they 
subsequently died under their care, they are responsible for notification. The local trust will 
support their PMRT review processes by completing the relevant questions around care 
provided locally, once they are notified and the transfer of the PMRT has occurred. 
 
Where this is not possible, due to delay in notification for example, surveillance should be 
completed as soon as possible, once it is known and has been communicated to the Clinical 
Governance team as described in section 5.0 . 
 
7.2  MBRRACE-UK Surveillance 
 
When a notification is complete the notification status will show whether surveillance (and 
review) is required for each case. Surveillance information must be completed within one 
month of the death. This is undertaken through the MBRRACE-UK reporting website. 
 
8.0  Duty of Candour (DOC) and communication to p  
 
Duty of Candour (DOC). The aim of this regulation is to ensure that health services are open 
and transparent, and was introduced in direct response to recommendation 181 of the 
Francis inquiry into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 
 
The trust is responsible for carrying out DOC to the family. Engaging bereaved parents in the 
review process and including their views and any concerns and questions they have about 
their care will enhance the process and ensure that from the outset the review addresses 
their questions. Parents, particularly mothers, are the only individuals who were present for 
the whole of the pregnancy and therefore have a unique perspective on everything that 
happened to them and their baby.  
UHS-SP-0003-2023 Local Requirements for PMRT Investigations SOP v1.1 Dec 2023 Page 8 of 27  
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
 
There is an expectation that DOC is completed within 72-hours where possible. 
 
The standard from Safety Action 1 of the Year 4 CNST requires 95% of all deaths of babies 
who have died within the local trust, the parents will have been told that a review of their 
concerns about their care and that of their baby has been sought. 
 
The flow chart for parent engagement during this process can be found in Appendix 2 . 
 
8.1  Verbal DOC 
 
As soon as reasonably possible, the Clinical Governance team will speak with the family, 
preferably face-to-face to inform them that the  will be investigated. The 
person carrying out DOC will explain the perinatal mortality review process and the offer of 
parent .  
 
Should the family have been discharged prior to verbal DOC, a telephone call can be 
attempted. Sensitivity must be ensured at all times and boundaries of the grieving parents 
respected. Appendix 3  and outlines the letter for making contact with parents after discharge 
and Appendix 4  and Appendix 5  are parent feedback forms which are designed to help 
parents think about any questions or comments they may have about aspects of their care. 
 
8.2  Written DOC 
 
Following verbal DOC, a letter or email (dependent on family preference) will be sent to the 
family outlining the discussion made. This will include written information leaflet about 
perinatal reviews for the family.  
 
Occasionally parents withdraw from any communication with the local trust. Their well-being 
is paramount so liaison with their community midwife and/or GP regarding this should be 
made to reassure the team that they remain as well as can be expected. A letter should be 
sent to parents when they cannot be reached and no other communication has been 
possible ( Appendix 6 ). 
 
Parents should :

(ox.ac.uk) 
 
8.3  Communication needs 
 
Families should receive high-quality services which meet their individual needs. This is at the 
regime. For many patients, English is not their first language or they may have specific 
communication needs because they are deaf, have a dual sensory loss or a learning  
UHS-SP-0003-2023 Local Requirements for PMRT Investigations SOP v1.1 Dec 2023 Page 9 of 27

disability. We have a duty of care to these patients to provide appropriate support to aid their 
communication when attending or liaising with our hospitals. 
 
The Clinical Governance team should review booking information to determine any 
communication difficulties for the family. If this is not easily apparent, the named community 
midwife should be contacted to determine communication needs. 
 
Easy access to appropriate British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters is available. This can 
also be delivered virtually through Action Deafness and Sign Live. Textphone and SMS text 
messaging are also available to help people with hearing and speech difficulties to 
communicate over the phone. Face-to-face overseas language interpreters are available 
from Sussex Interpreting Services, Language Line and Vandu Language Services. The 
ReciteMe and CardMedic Services also help people when they have a sensory impairment, 
learning disability or where English is not their first language. 
 
Using the interactive toolkit will help staff to decide which service to use and how to access 
it.

hment  
 
If a family cannot read English, the trust Communication team should be contacted to 
translate any letters sent to the family. 
 
8.4  Anticipated or unexpected delays  
 
Whilst every effort is made to ensure the outlined timeframe for completing a review given 
during the DOC process is adhered to, there are times where this may not be possible. This 
could be due to the availability of an external panel member; business continuity; additional 
information required to support the review process etc. Parents should be kept updated 
when it becomes evident that a delay in finalising the review is apparent. Appendix 7  outlines 
the letter template for this communication. 
 
9.0  Initial review process  
 
All bereavement cases that meet the criteria for PMRT review should be initially classified as 
serious incident 
review process. 
 
1. The medical record should be scanned and saved into a secure folder as soon as 
possible. Administration team will complete the disclosure of records check list 
(Appendix 8 ) to ensure all records are available electronically. 
2. An initial review of the case should be carried out within 72-hours where possible, 
requesting opinion from appropriate multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, to 
establish contributory factors and any immediate learning from the incident.  
UHS-SP-0003-2023 Local Requirements for PMRT Investigations SOP v1.1 Dec 2023 Page 10 of 27  
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
3. Complete Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG) Situation, Background, 
Assessment and Review (SBAR) document to present at the weekly SIRG 
meeting. 
4. Presentation to the SIRG meeting will review the information provided to establish 
an initial classification of harm. If there are concerns that the death was 
preventable at this point, the incident trigger the formal serious incident notification 
process. 
5. Complete SI notification form and 72-hour document, sending to the Director of 
Midwifery (or Head of Midwifery, if unavailable) for approval and submission by 
the trust Patient Safety Team via the Strategic Executive Information System 
(STEIS). 
 
9.1  Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) 
 
HSIB investigated cases of early neonatal deaths under the following criteria: 
 
 Babies born at term (at least 37 weeks gestation). 
 Early neonatal death, when the baby died within the first week of life (0-6 days) of 
any cause. 
 
Where cases meet the criteria for reporting to HSIB, the usual process for adding cases and 
fulfilling the requirements with the Surveillance, Factual Questions should be completed. The 
option should be chosen within the PMRT to ensure the deadlines for completion are 
paused. 
 
Once HSIB have completed their investigation, the lead investigator should complete the 
PMRT in collaboration with the Governance team.  
 
For detailed information on the HSIB reporting process, see Local Requirements for HSIB 
Investigations SOP. 
 
10.0  Multidisciplinary Review (MDT) 
 
Safety Action 1 of Year 4 CNST standards, states that 50% of babies who have died who 
are eligible for PMRT, including homebirths, will be reviewed by a MDT review team. Terms 
of Reference for the PMRT panel should be agreed on a annual basis and shared to the 
team, including any external panel members that are invited as part of their specialty. These 
can be found in Appendix 9 . 
 
Safety Action 1 of Year 4 CNST standards state that the team conducting the review should 
include at least one and preferably two professionals relevant to the care of the woman and 
her baby. This will include at least midwifery and obstetric representation. 
 
 
  
UHS-SP-0003-2023 Local Requirements for PMRT Investigations SOP v1.1 Dec 2023 Page 11 of 27  
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use.  
10.1  External Panel Reviewers 
 
Safety Action 1 of Year 4 CNST standards states that ideally the team should include a 
member from a relevant professional group who is external to the unit who can provide peer 
review as part of the PMRT review team. It may 
member for all reviews and you may need to be selective as to which deaths are reviewed 
by the team including an external member. Appendix 9  is the local LMNS, PMRT reporting 
process. 
 
It is recommended that the MDT PMRT panel involves an external member to provide a 
 challenge. The external 
member should be external to your trust with relevant clinical expertise. The Local Maternity 
additional external specialists may be sought to attend of offer a review of the notes to give 
their factual review and opinion of the case i.e. cardiologists; fetal medicine etc. 
 
10.2  PMRT Panel Review 
 
At least 1 week in advance of the meeting, scanned medical records will be provided to the 
PMRT panel to review ahead of the meeting. 
 
The important and relevant facts of the case will be presented via slide, along with sharing of 
local guidance which would have been applicable to the case. This information should assist 
the panel to explore causation and determine what learning there is to achieve from the 
review. 
 
10.3 Commencing and completing the PMRT online tool 
 
Those professionals who attended the MDT review should be registered within the tool. 
 
A review using PMRT should be made for 95% of all deaths of babies, suitable for review 
using the PMRT, and have been started within two months of each death. This includes 
deaths after home births where care was provided by the local trust. At a minimum all the 
ed as 
started. 
 
Each of these reviews will have been completed to the point that at least a PMRT draft 
report has been generated by the tool within four months of each death and the report 
published within six months of each death. 
 
11.0  Staff support 
 
11.1  Individual support 
 
Staff should be signposted to all possible support avenues that they may require.

can be contacted for immediate support. Their rota and telephone numbers are found in the 
clinical areas. Anyone is able to contact the MOC and there is no requirement to go through 
the labour ward coordinator to do this. 
 
Information can be found in the Psychological Support for Staff leaflet which identifies 
Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) practitioners in the trust. Support can also be obtained 
from Professional Midwifery Advocates (PMA) which are identified in each clinical area as 
well as the midwife counsellor. 
 
Access to Mental Health Escalation for Managers can be found on the link below, which can 
be used as a signposting resource for low mood and anxiety support as well as requirements 
for immediate assistance, including the suicide risk protocol.

10.pdf  
 
11.2  Group support 
 
Consideration by the senior team, PMA
the benefit of a group debrief. This decision should be made on a case by case basis. 
Should a debrief be required, then it is important to have a chairperson for the meeting who 
was not directly involved in the incident or who is responsible for investigating the incident. 
When planning a group debrief it is essential that all staff involved in the case are invited, 
including those that may have cared for the individual during pregnancy. 
 
At the time of 
contacted for immediate support. Their rota and telephone numbers are found in the clinical 
areas. 
 
11.3  Coronial requirements 
 
During the investigation staff may be asked for statements by the coroner. Support will be 
provided by the Legal Services Manager for Inquests, alongside support from the senior 
midwifery and obstetric team, during this process. 
 
12.0  On-going support for family 
 
As part of the DOC process, families are provided with 2 contacts from the Governance 
team to liaise with should they wish to. The bereavement lead will support the family, 
separate to the investigation process. etails are 
also given too.

12.1  Trust obligations 
 
The Governance team will keep in touch with the family should they wish contact from us. In 
some cases, families wishes will be respected during the investigation process. 
 
The trust will arrange a debrief appointment will the appropriate lead professional, usually 
the consultant obstetrician. This is to ensure they are physically well and to discuss any 
plans or concerns they may wish to consider should they want to get pregnant in the future.

13.0  PMRT Report 
 
The PMRT report is shared with the family. The preference is to share this face-to-face, 
especially where there is learning. This is to ensure that the family is supported in person 
when sharing information around findings. They may have further questions regarding the 
findings which should be answered and the family should be encouraged to contact the 
Governance team should questions arise some time later when they have had an 
opportunity to digest the information provided. 
 
The learning from the final report and action plan is shared at the Maternity Quality and 
Safety to the multidisciplinary team and embedded within the report for dissemination.

The findings are summarised and shared on the Safety Boards within the clinical areas.  
 
The actions are shared to the action tracker and monitored monthly for completion and to 
evidence embedding or any safety recommendations. 
 
14.0   Monitoring 
 
Monitoring is carried out by quarterly audit in line with NHS Resolution (CNST) Safety Action 
10 (Year 4) which states- 
 
 All perinatal deaths eligible to be notified to MBRRACE-UK must be notified within 
seven working days and the surveillance information where required must be 
completed within one month of the death. 
 A review using the Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT) of 95% of all deaths of 
babies, suitable for review using the PMRT, will have been started within two months 
of each death. This includes deaths after home births where care was provided by 
your Trust. 
 At least 50% of all deaths of babies (suitable for review using the PMRT) who were 
born and died in your Trust, including home births, will have been reviewed using the 
PMRT, by a multidisciplinary review team. Each of these reviews will have been 
completed to the point that at least a PMRT draft report has been generated by the 
tool within four months of each death and the report published within six months of 
each death. 
 For at least 95% of all deaths of babies who died in your Trust, the parents will have 
perspectives and any questions and/or concerns they have about their care and that 
of their baby have been sought. This includes any home births where care was 
provided by your Trust staff and the baby died either at home or in your Trust. If 
delays in completing reviews are anticipated parents should be advised that this is 
the case and be given a timetable for likely completion. 
 Quarterly reports will have been submitted to the Trust Board that include details of 
all deaths reviewed and consequent action plans. The quarterly reports should be 
discussed with the Trust maternity safety and Board level safety champions.

Dear [ ] 
 
I am/We are [ delete as appropriate ] sorry for the death of your [ insert son/daughter, or name 
if known]. I/We [delete as appropriate ] realise this letter comes at a very difficult time for you 
and your family. We have tried to reach you by phone/email [ delete as appropriate ] but have 
not been successful. 
 
I want/We wanted [ delete as appropriate ] to be in touch to reassure you that we take the 
death of a baby at [ insert name of Trust/Health Board ] seriously. It is important to find out as 
much as we can about what happened and why your baby/babies [ delete as appropriate ] 
has/have [ delete as appropriate ]  died. In the coming weeks, a hospital team will hold a 
meeting to review your care.  
 
Reviewing your care 
 
The hospital team discussing your care may include doctors who care for women in 
pregnancy (obstetricians), doctors who look after newborn babies (neonatologists), midwives 
and nurses. If there are any other health professionals specific to your care we will also 
invite them. The aim of the review is to try to understand as much as possible about what 
happened and why your baby/babies [ delete as appropriate ]  died. The team will: 
 
 Look at medical records, tests and results, including post mortem results if you have 
consented to one 
 Answer any questions you may have and address any concerns 
 Talk to staff involved  
 Look at guidance and policies to ensure the care you received was appropriate 
 
The team will do this using a national review process developed by a group including the 
parent charity Sands. The review may tell us that we need to change the way we do things 
or that good and appropriate care was given to your family.  
 
Involving you 
 
As [insert the name/s of the baby/babies ] parent/s [ if addressing only one parent keep 
singular], your thoughts and questions are important and it would be extremely helpful if you 
felt able to share your experience or any questions you have about your care with us before

is to ensure that all the information is available and that the right professionals can attend.

Appendix 9: PMRT Panel - Terms of Reference 
 
 
TEMPLATE FOR MODIFICATION 
 
Perinatal Mortality Review Meeting Terms of Reference* 
 
University Hospitals Sussex 
 
The aims of our stillbirth and neonatal mortality review meetings include: 
 
 
reviewing each case and the quality of care provided; 
 Working through the care for each baby who died to identify contributory factors 
where issues are identified and assessing whether different care may have made 
a difference to the outcome (grading of care); 
 Developing action plans that aim to address the contributory factors identified and 
achieve organisational change and service improvements; 
  
 any questions 
and concerns they have; 
 Providing parents with a robust explanation of why their baby died (accepting that 
in all instances, despite full clinical investigations, it is not always possible to 
determine this);  
 Improving the care we provide for mothers, babies and families in the future. 
 
The conduct of our stillbirth and neonatal mortality review meetings include: 
 
 Making every effort to gather the relevant information/evidence about each death 
in advance of the meeting; 
 Attending and arriving on time to the meeting; 
 Participating actively in discussions; 
  
 Accepting robust discussion and disagreement;  
 Agreeing to be comprehensive, open and transparent throughout;  
 Trying as much as possible (recognising this can be challenging) to accept that 
your own actions can be questioned;  
 Respecting the confidentiality of the documents and discussions that take place 
during the meetings and record/dispose of them appropriately; 
 If gaps are identified in the information there may be a need to go away and 
gather more information before completing the review; 
 Using the national Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT) to support the conduct 
of each review.  
 Monitoring deadlines for each Safety Action to ensure these are met.
