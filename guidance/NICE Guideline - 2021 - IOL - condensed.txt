Inducing labour 
NICE guideline 
Published: 4 November 2021 

The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences, and values of their patients or the people using their service. 

All problems related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. 

Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. 

Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible. 

Overview 
This guideline covers the circumstances for inducing labour, methods of induction, assessment, monitoring, pain relief, and managing complications. It aims to improve advice and care for pregnant women who are thinking about or having induction of labour. 

Who is it for? 
• Healthcare professionals 
• Commissioners and providers 
• Pregnant women, their families, and carers 

Recommendations 
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care. 

1.1 Information and decision making 
Discuss preferences about mode of birth with women early on in their pregnancy. Take into account their individual circumstances and discuss that options for birth can include expectant management, induction of labour, or planned caesarean birth. Record these discussions and the woman's preferences in her notes. 

Confirm a woman's preferences for birth at antenatal visits towards the end of pregnancy, as these may have changed since earlier discussions. 

Explain to women that induction of labour is a medical intervention that will affect their birth options and their experience of the birth process. 

Discuss with women being offered induction of labour the reasons for induction being offered, when, where, and how induction could be carried out, the arrangements for support and pain relief, the alternative options if the woman chooses not to have induction of labour, or decides at a later stage that she no longer wishes to proceed with the induction process, the risks and benefits of induction of labour in specific circumstances, and the proposed induction methods. 

When offering induction of labour, give women time to discuss this information with others if they wish to do so before making a decision, encourage women to look at other information, ensure women have the opportunity to ask questions, and recognize that women can decide to proceed with, delay, decline, or stop an induction. Respect the woman's decision, even if healthcare professionals disagree with it, and do not allow personal views to influence the care they are given. Record the woman's decision in her notes. 

Provide information on induction of labour in line with the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services. 

1.2 Induction of labour in specific circumstances 
Pregnancy lasting longer than 41 weeks 
Give women with uncomplicated pregnancies every opportunity to go into spontaneous labour. 

Explain to women that labour usually starts naturally before 42+0 weeks, based on the gestational age estimated by their dating scan. 

Using the information provided, explain to women that some risks associated with a pregnancy continuing beyond 41+0 weeks may increase over time, including an increased likelihood of caesarean birth, the baby needing admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and an increased likelihood of stillbirth and neonatal death. 

Discuss with women that induction of labour from 41+0 weeks may reduce these risks, but they will also need to consider the impact of induction on their birth experience when making their decision. 

Be aware that women from some minority ethnic backgrounds or who live in deprived areas have an increased risk of stillbirth and may benefit from closer monitoring and additional support. 

If a woman chooses not to have induction of labour, discuss the woman's options from this point on with her and record the woman's decision in her notes. 

Discuss with women who choose not to have their labour induced if they wish to have additional fetal monitoring from 42 weeks. Advise women that monitoring only gives a snapshot of the current situation and cannot predict reliably any changes after monitoring ends, but provides information on how their baby is at the moment and may help them make a decision on options for birth. 

Offer women who choose to await the spontaneous onset of labour the opportunity to make an informed decision.

Advise women to contact their midwife or maternity unit if they change their mind before their next appointment or have concerns about their baby. For preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, do not induce labor before 34 weeks unless there are additional obstetric indications. Offer expectant management until 37 weeks. Discuss the options of expectant management or induction of labor after 34 weeks but before 37 weeks. Consider risks to the woman and baby, local availability of neonatal intensive care facilities, and the woman's individual circumstances and preferences. If a woman has preterm prelabour rupture of membranes after 34 weeks and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or caesarean birth. For prelabour rupture of membranes at term, offer expectant management for up to 24 hours or induction of labor as soon as possible. Respect the woman's decision if she chooses to wait for spontaneous onset of labor for over 24 hours. If a woman has prelabour rupture of membranes at term and has had a positive group B streptococcus test, offer immediate induction of labor or caesarean birth. Discuss methods of induction with a woman who has had a previous caesarean birth to make an informed decision. Consider requests for induction of labor after discussing the benefits and risks with the woman. Induction of labor is not generally recommended if a woman's baby is in the breech position. Consider induction of labor for babies in the breech position if birth needs to be expedited and other options are not suitable. Do not induce labor if there is fetal growth restriction with confirmed fetal compromise. For women without diabetes and with suspected fetal macrosomia, discuss the options for birth and consider the impact of induction on their birth experience and their baby. In the event of an intrauterine fetal death, offer support and information about specialist support. If a woman with an intrauterine fetal death chooses induced labor, offer appropriate methods based on clinical circumstances and national protocols. Explain membrane sweeping and discuss with women if they would like a membrane sweep after 39 weeks. Discuss the risks and benefits of different methods to induce labor, including hyperstimulation risks with dinoprostone and misoprostol.

- Uterine activity and fetal condition must be monitored regularly
- Hyperstimulation during induction of labor should be treated promptly
- Different vaginal products have varying ease of removal
- Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation compared to pharmacological methods
- Follow manufacturers' guidance on the use of dinoprostone and misoprostol for induction of labor
- Consider induction methods based on Bishop score
- Offer induction of labor based on Bishop score
- Discuss pain relief options with women during induction of labor
- Consider outpatient induction of labor for women without medical conditions
- Monitor fetal well-being and uterine contractions during induction
- Take precautions to avoid cord prolapse during induction
- Check for low-lying placenta before membrane sweeping and induction of labor
- Immediate cesarean birth is required if uterine rupture is suspected during induced labor

Labour induction can lead to hyperstimulation of the uterus, which is defined as overactivity with increased contractions. Membrane sweeping involves separating the chorionic membrane from the uterus wall. MBRRACE-UK conducts audits to identify causes of maternal and perinatal mortality. A cervical dilator swells to dilate the cervix. Precipitate labor is a quick labor lasting less than 3 hours. Suspected fetal macrosomia is a large baby above the 95th percentile. Unsuccessful induction is when labor does not start after one cycle of treatment. Research recommendations include optimal timing of induction and management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Intrauterine fetal death after a previous cesarean birth requires induction of labor. Membrane sweeping effectiveness and acceptability should be studied further. Vaginal dinoprostone effectiveness and safety need more research. Outpatient induction of labor safety and effectiveness should be explored. Recommendations aim to reduce prolonged pregnancy and address specific clinical scenarios.

The committee recommends discussing different birthing options with women after intrauterine fetal death, especially those with a previous cesarean birth, and respecting their choice. Women with IUFD should be cared for on a one-to-one basis and monitored due to the increased risk of uterine rupture. The committee discussed the use of mifepristone for induction of labor after IUFD, but no evidence for its safety or efficacy in women with a previous cesarean birth was found. Mechanical methods of induction may be safe for women with a previous cesarean birth. Recommendations were made for induction after a previous cesarean birth for women with live babies or after intrauterine fetal death. 

The committee recommended offering a choice of vaginal dinoprostone preparations based on availability and patient preference. Misoprostol was also considered effective for induction of labor, especially for women who prefer an oral preparation. Mechanical methods, such as balloon catheters, were found to be safe for induction of labor. Amniotomy and intravenous oxytocin were identified as the most effective method for promoting vaginal birth within 24 hours for women with a Bishop score of more than 6. 

Induction of labor may impact the birth experience of women and is associated with increased pain and likelihood of additional interventions. Approximately a third of women in the UK undergo induction of labor, with various methods available based on cervical readiness and patient preferences. The guideline aims to provide advice to healthcare professionals and pregnant women on decision-making and effective methods for induction of labor.
