Management of Monochorionic Twin Pregnancy
All women with a twin pregnancy should have an ultrasound examination between 11+0 weeks and 13+6 weeks to assess fetal viability, gestational age, and chorionicity. Chorionicity should be determined based on the number of placental masses and membrane appearance before 14 weeks of gestation. Fetal ultrasound assessments should occur every 2 weeks from 16+0 weeks onwards until delivery. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities should be offered, with additional monitoring for specific complications such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Treatment for conditions like TTTS should be managed in fetal medicine centers with specialist expertise. Delivery of monochorionic twins should be discussed and elective delivery offered from 36+0 weeks. In cases of single twin demise, referral to a fetal medicine center is recommended for assessment and management. Monitoring for fetal anaemia after intrauterine death can be done using Doppler ultrasonography. MCMA twins should be delivered by caesarean section between 32+0 and 34+0 weeks. Higher order multiple pregnancies with monochorionicity have higher fetal loss rates and may require selective reduction. Discordant abnormalities in monochorionic pregnancies should be promptly assessed and managed in fetal medicine centers.

Meticulous mapping of the position of the twins within the uterus should be performed both at the time of prenatal diagnostic tests and invasive treatments. During amniocentesis, both amniotic sacs should be sampled in monochorionic twin pregnancies, unless monochorionicity is confirmed before 14 weeks and the fetuses appear concordant for growth and anatomy. Prior to invasive testing or in the context of twins discordant for an abnormality, selective reduction should be discussed and made available to those requesting the procedure after appropriate counseling. Monitoring for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is not indicated in monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing selective reduction. Selective feticide by intravascular injection of an abortifacient is not an option in monochorionic pregnancies because of the presence of placental anastomoses. The potential risks of intrafetal/umbilical cord ablative procedures should be discussed prospectively, including the risk of co-twin loss and neurological morbidity. Documentation and discussion of heterokaryotypic monozygotic karyotypic abnormalities should take place. Conjoined twins are exceedingly rare and prenatal assessment is required in a tertiary fetal medicine center for diagnosis and prognosis discussion with a multidisciplinary team. Sonographers must be trained to establish chorionicity and the correct labeling of twins. Sonographers should be aware of complications in monochorionic twins and refer patients to specialist centers if needed. Fetal medicine centers undertaking fetal therapy for rare complications of monochorionic twins should have experienced operators and a minimum number of cases per year to maximize outcomes and minimize morbidity.

Chorionicity determines the number of amniotic sacs and may identify fetal anomalies in twins. Screening for Down syndrome should be offered in monochorionic twins. Accurate assessment of chorionicity is important in the first trimester. Monochorionic twin pregnancies have a single placental mass, while dichorionic twins have two placental masses. Monochorionic twins have higher fetal loss rates and may have a higher risk of neurodevelopmental morbidity. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities and structural abnormalities should be offered in monochorionic twins. Routine ultrasound scans are recommended between 18 and 20+6 weeks of gestation. Detection rates of fetal anomalies on ultrasound scans for twin pregnancies are similar to singletons. Management of monochorionic pregnancies with abnormalities is complex and involves multidisciplinary specialists.

A single fetus in a monochorionic pregnancy should be assessed in a specialized center with expertise. Increased prenatal surveillance and potential referral to a tertiary specialist center must be discussed. Fetal ultrasound assessment should occur every 2 weeks from 16 weeks onwards. Liquor volume, fetal bladders, and umbilical artery pulsatility should be assessed at each examination. Screening for TTTS should be done regularly, with specific criteria for diagnosis. Screening for sGR should also be conducted, with EFW discordance and umbilical artery Doppler evaluation. TAPS should be screened for following fetoscopic laser ablation for TTTS. Discussed symptoms and criteria for diagnosis of TAPS are provided. Discordant growth in monochorionic twins is associated with increased perinatal risk and should be monitored closely. Various screening methods and criteria for sGR diagnosis are outlined.

A minimum two-fold increase in risk of perinatal morbidity exists even when both twin birthweights are appropriate for gestational age. A compromise 'cut-off' of a difference in estimated fetal weight of greater than 20% for monochorionic twins is recommended. Umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index measurements should be taken from 20 weeks of gestation. Different types of sGR are associated with varying risks of perinatal outcomes. TTTS should be staged using the Quintero system and managed in conjunction with fetal medicine centers. Fetoscopic laser ablation is recommended for TTTS presenting before 26 weeks of gestation. Randomized trials have shown the effectiveness of laser ablation in improving outcomes for TTTS. Recurrent TTTS can occur in up to 14% of pregnancies treated with fetoscopic laser ablation. Termination of pregnancy may be considered in severe cases of TTTS. Ultrasound surveillance is recommended after fetoscopic laser ablation. Functional cardiac studies may add to the prognosis of MCDA twins.

In monochorionic twin pregnancies previously complicated by TTTS, delivery should take place between 34+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation. Regular ultrasound surveillance is recommended even after successful treatment. Delivery of the surviving twin(s) should be considered between 34+0 and 36+6 weeks, or earlier if there are concerns. Prophylactic maternal steroids should be given if possible prior to delivery, and mode of delivery can be individualized, often by caesarean section.

In cases of selective growth restriction (sGR) in monochorionic twins, surveillance should be undertaken every 2 weeks with fetal Doppler assessment. Delivery should be planned based on the type of sGR and fetal growth velocity, with consideration given to the risk of acute transfusional events. Management of sGR should involve a regional fetal medicine center with expertise in managing the condition.

For monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated by single twin demise, clinicians should be aware of the risks to the surviving twin and should consider fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect neurological morbidity. Management should be overseen by fetal medicine experts, with a conservative approach often appropriate. Fetal anaemia may be monitored using Doppler ultrasonography.

In uncomplicated monochorionic pregnancies, elective delivery can be offered from 36+0 weeks with antenatal steroids, aiming for vaginal birth unless there are specific clinical indications for a caesarean section.

In monochorionic pregnancies, there is a higher risk of fetal demise, especially in monochorionic twins. Delivery should be considered from 36 weeks with elective birth and antenatal steroids. Planned caesarean section for delivery of twins between 32 and 38 weeks did not significantly decrease risks compared to vaginal delivery. Higher order multiple pregnancies with monochorionicity have higher fetal loss rates. Selective reduction should be discussed in all higher order pregnancies. Monochorionic twins discordant for fetal anomaly should be referred to a fetal medicine center. Conjoined twins are rare and require prenatal assessment in a tertiary fetal medicine center. Sonographers should be trained to establish chorionicity and recognize complications in monochorionic twins. Fetal medicine centers should have experienced operators for fetal therapy in monochorionic twins. Further research is needed on screening for complications in monochorionic pregnancies.
