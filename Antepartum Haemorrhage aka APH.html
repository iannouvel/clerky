        <h3>Summary: Antepartum Haemorrhage</h3>
        <p>Definitions: spotting is staining / streaking / wiping; minor is < 50 ml and not ongoing; major is 50-1000 ml without shock; massive is >1000mls and/or signs of shock</p>
        <p>Kleihauer if > 20 weeks</p>
        <p>Discharge at initial assessment if spotting only, no longer bleeding, and no concern of praevia if assessment reassuring, all other cases home after admission, senior review and bleeding settled</p>
        <p>Tocolysis can be considered by a senior obstetrician, shouldn't be used with significant concerns of maternal-fetal wellbeing</p>
        <p>Following single or recurrent episodes of APH from a cervical ectropion, subsequent antenatal care need not be altered.</p>
        <p>Serial scans for any cause of APH other than ectropion</p>
        <p>If maternal or fetal compromise from APH suspected, consider general anaesthetic</p>
        <p>Following APH, advise active 3rd stage to reduce blood loss, particularly syntometrine if no hypertension and APH due to abruption or praevia.</p>
        <p>If massive haemorrhage and/or abruption, consider DIC, send clotting and FBC and seek haem support, consider 4 units FFP and 10 units cryo</p>
