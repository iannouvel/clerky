          "original": "SITUATION: 32-year-old G2P1 at 36+4 weeks gestation presenting with severe preeclampsia requiring urgent delivery planning\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Jones has had an uncomplicated pregnancy until 34 weeks when routine antenatal bloods showed mild proteinuria. She was commenced on increased surveillance. Over the past week, she has developed progressively worsening headaches, described as severe, frontal, and not relieved by paracetamol. She also reports seeing 'flashing lights' and has had epigastric pain for 2 days. She denies previous history of hypertension or preeclampsia. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated with normal delivery at term. Family history significant for maternal preeclampsia and paternal hypertension. She works as a teacher, is a non-smoker, and takes only routine pregnancy vitamins.\n\nASSESSMENT: On examination, she appears unwell and anxious. BP consistently elevated at 168/112 mmHg despite rest. Hyperreflexia present with 3+ clonus at ankles. Significant pedal and facial edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein. CTG shows reactive pattern with baseline 150 bpm. Bloods reveal: Hb 11.2 g/dL, platelets 98 x10⁹/L (previously 245), ALT 89 U/L (normal <40), AST 76 U/L, creatinine 98 μmol/L (booking 65), uric acid 425 μmol/L. LDH elevated at 589 U/L. Fundal height appropriate for dates. Estimated fetal weight on recent scan 2.8kg (50th centile).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate admission to delivery suite for maternal stabilization and urgent delivery. IV labetalol commenced for blood pressure control. Magnesium sulfate infusion started for seizure prophylaxis. Betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Cross-match for 4 units of blood. Anesthetic consultation arranged. Plan for caesarean section within 6 hours given severity of condition. Intensive monitoring of maternal observations and fetal wellbeing. Partner informed of urgent nature and risks explained.",

          "original": "SITUATION: 32-year-old G3P3 experiencing primary postpartum hemorrhage 45 minutes after normal vaginal delivery\n\nBACKGROUND: Mrs Kumar delivered her third baby 45 minutes ago following a normal vaginal delivery at term. Labor was straightforward, lasting 6 hours total with second stage of 25 minutes. Baby weighed 3.8kg, delivered in good condition. Third stage was managed actively with syntometrine, placenta delivered complete within 10 minutes. Initially bleeding was normal but over the past 15 minutes she has had continuous heavy vaginal bleeding with large clots. Estimated blood loss now >800ml and continuing. She feels dizzy and nauseated. Previous deliveries were uncomplicated with no history of postpartum hemorrhage. This pregnancy was uncomplicated, she is normally fit and well. No anticoagulant medications, no bleeding disorders known. She is breastfeeding and wishes to continue.\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient appears pale and anxious, complaining of feeling faint. Vital signs: BP 95/58 mmHg (booking BP 120/75), HR 118 bpm, temp 36.7°C. Continuous heavy vaginal bleeding with clots visible. Abdomen: uterus palpable 2cm above umbilicus, soft and poorly contracted (boggy). Bladder palpable, patient has not passed urine since delivery. Perineum intact, no visible lacerations. Speculum examination shows bleeding from uterine cavity, cervix appears intact. Estimated blood loss now >1000ml. IV access in situ from labor, bloods sent for urgent FBC, coagulation screen, and cross-match for 4 units. Hemoglobin 2 hours ago was 11.8 g/dL.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Primary postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. Immediate management: bimanual uterine compression applied, uterine massage commenced. Syntocinon infusion (40 units in 500ml normal saline) started. Ergometrine 500mcg IM given (no contraindications). IV access secured, rapid fluid resuscitation with Hartmann's solution. Urgent cross-match for blood transfusion. Bladder catheterized (was contributing to atony). If bleeding continues, consider carboprost (Hemabate) 250mcg IM, tranexamic acid 1g IV. Anesthetist called for potential theatre transfer. Consultant obstetrician attending. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and blood loss. Blood products available if required. Intrauterine balloon tamponade prepared if medical management fails.",

OGTT was performed due to risk factors including BMI 32 at booking, family history of type 2 diabetes (both parents), and South Asian ethnicity.

Recent anomaly scan at 20 weeks was normal. Home glucose monitoring initiated showing morning readings 5.8-6.4 mmol/L, post-meal readings 8.2-9.8 mmol/L over past week.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Urgent diabetes team referral arranged for next week. Comprehensive dietary counselling provided with written information. Self-monitoring blood glucose recommended QDS (pre-meals and 2 hours post-meals). Growth and liquor scans arranged for every 4 weeks. Target glucose levels discussed: fasting <5.3 mmol/L, 2-hour post-meal <6.4 mmol/L. If dietary control inadequate after 2 weeks trial, metformin +/- insulin will be considered. Antenatal care intensified with 2-weekly visits.
