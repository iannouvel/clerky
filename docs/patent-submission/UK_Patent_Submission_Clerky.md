---

## 1. TECHNICAL FIELD

This invention relates to computer-implemented medical systems, specifically an artificial intelligence-powered clinical decision support platform that provides real-time analysis of clinical documentation against evidence-based medical guidelines to enhance healthcare decision-making and patient safety.

---

## 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals face increasing challenges in maintaining adherence to the rapidly expanding corpus of evidence-based medical guidelines. Current systems suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Manual Guideline Consultation**: Healthcare professionals must manually search through extensive guideline databases during patient consultations, causing delays and potential oversights.

2. **Fragmented Decision Support**: Existing clinical decision support systems typically address single guidelines or narrow clinical domains, failing to provide comprehensive multi-guideline analysis.

3. **Static Documentation Review**: Current systems lack real-time, intelligent analysis of clinical documentation against current best practice guidelines.

4. **Limited Learning Integration**: Existing solutions do not provide interactive learning mechanisms that adapt to user decisions and preferences.

5. **Poor Workflow Integration**: Most clinical decision support tools operate as standalone systems that disrupt clinical workflows rather than enhancing them.

### 2.2 Prior Art Limitations

Existing clinical decision support systems, while providing some guidance, fail to offer:
- Real-time, intelligent analysis of free-text clinical documentation
- Multi-guideline simultaneous analysis with parallel processing
- Interactive recommendation systems with comprehensive user decision tracking
- Multi-provider AI integration with automatic failover capabilities
- Structured clinical documentation enhancement based on AI-generated suggestions

---

## 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

### 3.1 Overview

The present invention provides a novel AI-powered clinical decision support platform ("Clerky") that addresses the aforementioned limitations through several innovative technical solutions:

### 3.2 Key Technical Innovations

**Innovation 1: Smart AI Service Management**
Instead of relying on a single AI service that might become unavailable or expensive, Clerky connects to multiple AI providers and allows users to specify their preferred AI model to optimise for price and accuracy. If one service is down or slow, the system instantly switches to another provider without interruption. This approach ensures doctors always get fast, reliable responses while keeping costs manageable by using the most efficient service available at any given time.

**Innovation 2: Comprehensive Medical Guideline Analysis**
When a doctor enters a clinical case, Clerky simultaneously checks it against hundreds of relevant medical guidelines rather than forcing the doctor to search through them manually. The system currently contains, at present, circa 300 guidelines focused on obstetrics and gynaecology, and can be expanded to other medical specialties. It intelligently identifies which guidelines are most relevant to the specific case and presents them in order of importance, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly access the most applicable evidence-based recommendations.

**Innovation 3: Interactive Decision Support Interface**
Rather than simply providing static recommendations, Clerky creates an interactive experience where doctors can review each AI-generated suggestion and choose to accept it, reject it, or modify it to better fit their clinical judgment. The system tracks these decisions to maintain a comprehensive record of how recommendations were applied. Each suggestion is presented with supporting evidence, and doctors can customize the recommendations in real-time to match their specific clinical context and patient needs.

**Innovation 4: AI-Generated Documentation Suggestions**
Clerky uses AI providers to analyse clinical notes against specific medical guidelines and generate categorised improvement suggestions. The system provides structured recommendations organised by importance level (Very Important to Unimportant) that healthcare professionals can review, accept, reject, or modify. When suggestions are accepted or modified, they are automatically applied to update the clinical documentation, helping ensure better alignment with evidence-based guidelines. The decisions of the user with respect to the particular context and guideline are stored to allow for iterative progress of advice generation.

**Innovation 5: Reliable Multi-Service Architecture**
The system is built with multiple backup systems to ensure it remains available when healthcare professionals need it most. By connecting to several different AI services simultaneously, Clerky can continue operating even if one or more services experience problems. The system monitors performance and costs across all providers, automatically routing requests to the most efficient service while maintaining backup options. This redundant approach ensures consistent availability and optimal performance for time-sensitive clinical decision-making.
