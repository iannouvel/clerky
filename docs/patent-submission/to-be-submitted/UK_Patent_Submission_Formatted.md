## 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

### 3.1 Overview

The present invention provides a novel AI-powered clinical decision support platform ("Clerky") that addresses the aforementioned limitations through several innovative technical solutions:

### 3.2 Key Technical Innovations

**Innovation 1: Privacy-Preserving Anonymisation at Source**
A breakthrough in healthcare data privacy, Clerky implements comprehensive anonymisation of clinical data before it ever leaves the healthcare provider's environment. Using advanced natural language processing and medical-context-aware algorithms, the system identifies and removes personally identifiable information (PII) while preserving all clinically relevant content. This includes specialized medical patterns, NHS numbers, hospital identifiers, and personal details, ensuring complete privacy protection without compromising clinical utility. The anonymisation process uses the @libretto/redact-pii-light library combined with custom medical patterns to achieve comprehensive PII detection while avoiding false positives with medical terminology.

**Innovation 2: AI Model-Agnostic Architecture with Intelligent Routing**
Rather than being locked into a single AI provider, Clerky implements a sophisticated AI model-agnostic architecture that intelligently routes requests across multiple AI service providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic (Claude), Mistral, and Google Gemini. The system automatically selects the optimal provider based on user preferences, cost considerations, performance metrics, and availability. When one service becomes unavailable or reaches quota limits, the system seamlessly switches to alternative providers without interruption. This approach ensures healthcare professionals always receive fast, reliable responses while maintaining optimal cost-efficiency and avoiding vendor lock-in.

**Innovation 3: Comprehensive Medical Guideline Analysis**
When a healthcare professional enters a clinical case, Clerky simultaneously checks it against hundreds of relevant medical guidelines rather than forcing manual searches. The system currently contains approximately 300 guidelines focused on obstetrics and gynaecology, with capability for expansion to other medical specialties. It intelligently identifies which guidelines are most relevant to the specific case and presents them in order of importance, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly access the most applicable evidence-based recommendations.

**Innovation 4: Interactive Decision Support Interface**
Rather than providing static recommendations, Clerky creates an interactive experience where healthcare professionals can review each AI-generated suggestion and choose to accept, reject, or modify it to better fit their clinical judgment. The system tracks these decisions to maintain a comprehensive record of how recommendations were applied. Each suggestion is presented with supporting evidence, and healthcare professionals can customise recommendations in real-time to match their specific clinical context and patient needs.

**Innovation 5: AI-Generated Documentation Suggestions**
Clerky uses multiple AI providers to analyse clinical notes against specific medical guidelines and generate categorised improvement suggestions. The system provides structured recommendations organised by importance level (Very Important to Unimportant) that healthcare professionals can review, accept, reject, or modify. When suggestions are accepted or modified, they are automatically applied to update the clinical documentation, helping ensure better alignment with evidence-based guidelines while maintaining the healthcare professional's clinical judgment.

**Innovation 6: Reliable Multi-Service Architecture**
The system is built with multiple backup systems to ensure it remains available when healthcare professionals need it most. By connecting to several different AI services simultaneously, Clerky can continue operating even if one or more services experience problems. The system monitors performance and costs across all providers, automatically routing requests to the most efficient service while maintaining backup options. This redundant approach ensures consistent availability and optimal performance for time-sensitive clinical decision-making.

Anonymised clinical data is processed against multiple medical guidelines simultaneously using parallel processing capabilities that ensure comprehensive clinical analysis while maintaining privacy protection.

**Recommendation Processing Stage**
AI-generated recommendations are processed and categorized by importance level, with supporting evidence and confidence levels attached to each recommendation.

**User Interface Stage**
Results are presented through an interactive interface that allows healthcare professionals to review, accept, reject, or modify AI-generated recommendations while maintaining comprehensive decision tracking.

**Audit Trail Stage**
The system maintains comprehensive audit trails throughout the entire process, recording all anonymisation decisions, AI provider selections, user interactions, and clinical outcomes for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.

### 10.3 AI Model-Agnostic Architecture with Failover

The AI model-agnostic architecture provides intelligent routing and automatic failover capabilities across multiple AI service providers:

**Clinical Query Processing**
When a clinical query is submitted, the system first processes the data through privacy-preserving anonymisation to ensure complete patient privacy protection.

**Provider Selection Algorithm**
The system evaluates multiple factors to select the optimal AI provider for each request, including user preferences, historical performance, current service availability, quota limits, cost considerations, and response time requirements.

**Availability Check**
The system continuously monitors all AI providers for availability, performance, and quota limits, automatically updating the provider selection based on real-time status information.

**Multi-Provider Routing**
The system maintains connections to five major AI providers simultaneously: OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Mistral, and Google Gemini. Each provider is evaluated based on multiple criteria including response quality, cost efficiency, and reliability.

**Automatic Failover**
When the primary AI provider becomes unavailable or reaches quota limits, the system automatically switches to alternative providers without user intervention, ensuring continuous service availability for critical clinical decision support.

**Response Validation**
AI responses are validated for quality and relevance before being presented to healthcare professionals, ensuring that only high-quality recommendations are provided for clinical decision-making.

**Response Processing**
Validated AI responses are processed and formatted for presentation through the interactive user interface, with supporting evidence and confidence levels attached to each recommendation.

### Example 1: Privacy-Preserving Obstetric Care Decision Support

**Clinical Scenario**: A healthcare professional enters a consultation note for a pregnant patient (Sarah Johnson, NHS: 123-456-7890, DOB: 01/15/1990) presenting with hypertension.

**Privacy Protection Processing**:
1. System detects PII: patient name, NHS number, date of birth
2. Interactive review interface presents anonymisation options
3. User confirms anonymisation: "Patient [NAME], NHS: [NHS_NUMBER], DOB: [DATE]"
4. Anonymised data: "Patient [NAME], NHS: [NHS_NUMBER], DOB: [DATE] presenting with hypertension"

**AI Provider Selection**:
1. System checks user's preferred AI provider (DeepSeek)
2. Verifies DeepSeek availability and quota limits
3. Routes request to DeepSeek with automatic failover to OpenAI if needed

**System Processing**:
1. AI provider analysis identifies: pregnancy, hypertension, blood pressure readings from anonymised data
2. Guideline matching identifies relevant protocols using privacy-protected content
3. Multi-guideline analysis detects potential preeclampsia risk
4. AI generates prioritized recommendations using anonymised clinical context
