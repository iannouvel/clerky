<h2>2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h2>
<h3>2.1 Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Healthcare professionals face increasing challenges in maintaining adherence to the rapidly expanding corpus of evidence-based medical guidelines while protecting patient privacy and managing AI service dependencies. Current systems suffer from several critical limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual Guideline Consultation</strong>: Healthcare professionals must manually search through extensive guideline databases during patient consultations, causing delays and potential oversights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fragmented Decision Support</strong>: Existing clinical decision support systems typically address single guidelines or narrow clinical domains, failing to provide comprehensive multi-guideline analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static Documentation Review</strong>: Current systems lack real-time, intelligent analysis of clinical documentation against current best practice guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and Security Vulnerabilities</strong>: Most systems transmit sensitive patient data to external AI services without adequate anonymisation, creating privacy risks and regulatory compliance issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Provider Dependency</strong>: Existing solutions rely on single AI providers, creating vulnerabilities when services become unavailable, expensive, or fail to meet performance requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Learning Integration</strong>: Existing solutions do not provide interactive learning mechanisms that adapt to user decisions and preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Poor Workflow Integration</strong>: Most clinical decision support tools operate as standalone systems that disrupt clinical workflows rather than enhancing them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.2 Prior Art Limitations</h3>
<p>Existing clinical decision support systems, while providing some guidance, fail to offer:
- Real-time, intelligent analysis of free-text clinical documentation
- Privacy-preserving anonymisation at source before data transmission
- AI model-agnostic architecture with automatic failover capabilities
- Multi-guideline simultaneous analysis with parallel processing

<h2>3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h2>
<h3>3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The present invention provides a novel AI-powered clinical decision support platform ("Clerky") that addresses the aforementioned limitations through several innovative technical solutions:</p>
<h3>3.2 Key Technical Innovations</h3>
<p><strong>Innovation 1: Privacy-Preserving Anonymisation at Source</strong>
A breakthrough in healthcare data privacy, Clerky implements comprehensive anonymisation of clinical data before it ever leaves the healthcare provider's environment. Using advanced natural language processing and medical-context-aware algorithms, the system identifies and removes personally identifiable information (PII) while preserving all clinically relevant content. This includes specialized medical patterns, NHS numbers, hospital identifiers, and personal details, ensuring complete privacy protection without compromising clinical utility. The anonymisation process uses the @libretto/redact-pii-light library combined with custom medical patterns to achieve comprehensive PII detection while avoiding false positives with medical terminology.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation 2: AI Model-Agnostic Architecture with Intelligent Routing</strong>
Rather than being locked into a single AI provider, Clerky implements a sophisticated AI model-agnostic architecture that intelligently routes requests across multiple AI service providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic (Claude), Mistral, and Google Gemini. The system automatically selects the optimal provider based on user preferences, cost considerations, performance metrics, and availability. When one service becomes unavailable or reaches quota limits, the system seamlessly switches to alternative providers without interruption. This approach ensures healthcare professionals always receive fast, reliable responses while maintaining optimal cost-efficiency and avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation 3: Comprehensive Medical Guideline Analysis</strong>
When a healthcare professional enters a clinical case, Clerky simultaneously checks it against hundreds of relevant medical guidelines rather than forcing manual searches. The system currently contains approximately 300 guidelines focused on obstetrics and gynaecology, with capability for expansion to other medical specialties. It intelligently identifies which guidelines are most relevant to the specific case and presents them in order of importance, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly access the most applicable evidence-based recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation 4: Interactive Decision Support Interface</strong>
Rather than providing static recommendations, Clerky creates an interactive experience where healthcare professionals can review each AI-generated suggestion and choose to accept, reject, or modify it to better fit their clinical judgment. The system tracks these decisions to maintain a comprehensive record of how recommendations were applied. Each suggestion is presented with supporting evidence, and healthcare professionals can customise recommendations in real-time to match their specific clinical context and patient needs.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation 5: AI-Generated Documentation Suggestions</strong>
Clerky uses multiple AI providers to analyse clinical notes against specific medical guidelines and generate categorised improvement suggestions. The system provides structured recommendations organised by importance level (Very Important to Unimportant) that healthcare professionals can review, accept, reject, or modify. When suggestions are accepted or modified, they are automatically applied to update the clinical documentation, helping ensure better alignment with evidence-based guidelines while maintaining the healthcare professional's clinical judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation 6: Reliable Multi-Service Architecture</strong>
The system is built with multiple backup systems to ensure it remains available when healthcare professionals need it most. By connecting to several different AI services simultaneously, Clerky can continue operating even if one or more services experience problems. The system monitors performance and costs across all providers, automatically routing requests to the most efficient service while maintaining backup options. This redundant approach ensures consistent availability and optimal performance for time-sensitive clinical decision-making.</p>
