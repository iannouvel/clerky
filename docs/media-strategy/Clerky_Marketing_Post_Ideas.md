# ClerkyAI Feature-Focused Marketing Post Ideas

1. **Anonymisation Launch:**
   ClerkyAI now features libretto-based anonymisation, ensuring that all clinical data processed is robustly de-identified in line with the latest data protection standards. This development helps users and organisations stay compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations, making it safer to handle sensitive information during testing and development.
