# Intended Use Statement

## Device Name

**Clerky: AI-Assisted Maternity Clinical Documentation and Decision Support Platform**

## Intended Purpose

Clerky is a software application intended to assist registered healthcare professionals involved in maternity care in preparing, reviewing, and maintaining clinical documentation.

The software analyses consultation notes and transcripts against relevant national (e.g. NICE, RCOG) and local NHS trust guidelines, identifying areas where documentation may be incomplete or could reference current best practice. It provides contextual prompts, references, and citations to aid users in producing accurate, comprehensive records that reflect recognised standards of care.

Clerky is designed to support documentation quality, audit readiness, and learning within maternity services.

It is an advisory tool and does not interpret clinical data, diagnose, or recommend treatment. All clinical decisions remain entirely under the control of the healthcare professional.

## Intended User

Qualified and registered healthcare professionals providing maternity care (such as doctors, midwives, and allied health practitioners) working within NHS or equivalent healthcare settings.

## Intended Use Environment

Clerky is intended for use on desktop or workstation computers within secure NHS healthcare IT infrastructures, including:

- Antenatal clinics
- Maternity triage units
- Labour wards and delivery suites
- Postnatal care settings

## Intended Patient Population

Pregnant and postnatal patients receiving maternity care within NHS or equivalent healthcare services.

The software is not intended for use directly with patients and does not analyse physiological or diagnostic data.

## Mode of Operation

The user enters or uploads clinical notes or transcripts.

Clerky applies natural-language processing to cross-reference the text with relevant national and local maternity guidelines.

The system highlights potential documentation gaps and provides guideline references for user consideration.

All outputs are non-directive and subject to user review; the software does not alter clinical decisions or patient records automatically.

## Clinical Benefits

- Improves documentation completeness and alignment with recognised maternity guidelines.
- Supports clinical governance and audit preparation through consistent record structures.
- Enhances training and awareness of best-practice standards.
- Reduces administrative effort in retrospective reviews.

## Limitations and Warnings

- Clerky is not intended for diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic decision-making.
- Outputs are advisory only and must always be verified by a qualified clinician.
- The software must be operated within secure, GDPR- and DTAC-compliant environments using anonymised or consented data.
- It is not a real-time patient monitoring or risk-assessment system.

## SaMD Classification (anticipated)

Clerky is intended to provide administrative and informational support for healthcare professionals by assisting with documentation completeness and guideline referencing.

It does not drive diagnostic or therapeutic decisions and therefore is expected to be classified as a UKCA Class I medical device (Software as a Medical Device) under the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (as amended) and MHRA guidance on SaMD.
