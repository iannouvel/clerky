Platform
 
Company
 
Structure
 
&
 
Registration
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
●
 
Choose
 
the
 
Right
 
Structure:
 
Form
 
a
 
private
 
limited
 
company
 
(Ltd)
 
in
 
the
 
UK.
 
An
 
Ltd
 
is
 
ideal
 
for
 
startups
 
seeking
 
investment
 
–
 
it
 
provides
 
limited
 
liability
 
and
 
allows
 
issuing
 
shares
 
to
 
founders
 
and
 
investors 
gov.uk
.
 
This
 
structure
 
is
 
more
 
suitable
 
than
 
sole
 
tradership
 
or
 
partnership
 
given
 
plans
 
to
 
raise
 
venture
 
capital.
 
 
●
 
Steps
 
to
 
Incorporate:
 
 
1.
 
Choose
 
a
 
Name:
 
Select
 
a
 
unique
 
company
 
name
 
and
 
verify
 
availability
 
via
 
Companies
 
House 
gov.uk
.
 
Avoid
 
names
 
that
 
conflict
 
with
 
existing
 
trademarks
 
or
 
companies.
 
 
2.
 
Appoint
 
Directors
 
&
 
Shareholders:
 
You
 
need
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
director;
 
both
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
can
 
be
 
directors.
 
List
 
yourselves
 
as
 
initial
 
shareholders
 
(owners)
 
with
 
an
 
agreed
 
share
 
split 
gov.uk
.
 
You
 
will
 
also
 
declare
 
Persons
 
with
 
Significant
 
Control
 
(anyone
 
over
 
25%
 
shares) 
gov.uk
 
–
 
likely
 
both
 
founders.
 
 
3.
 
Prepare
 
Documents:
 
Use
 
standard
 
“memorandum
 
and
 
articles
 
of
 
association”
 
(Companies
 
House
 
provides
 
model
 
articles) 
gov.uk
.
 
These
 
outline
 
how
 
the
 
company
 
is
 
governed.
 
 
4.
 
Register
 
with
 
Companies
 
House:
 
Provide
 
your
 
registered
 
office
 
address
 
(this
 
will
 
be
 
public)
 
and
 
select
 
a
 
SIC
 
code
 
(business
 
classification)
 
during
 
registration 
gov.uk
.
 
For
 
a
 
healthtech
 
software
 
company,
 
a
 
suitable
 
SIC
 
code
 
is
 
62012
 
–
 
Business
 
and
 
domestic
 
software
 
development
 
resources.companieshouse.gov.uk
.
 
You
 
can
 
complete
 
registration
 
online
 
with
 
a
 
small
 
fee
 
(~£12)
 
and
 
usually
 
get
 
incorporation
 
within
 
24
 
hours.
 
 
5.
 
Post-Incorporation
 
HMRC
 
Setup:
 
Within
 
3
 
months
 
of
 
starting
 
business
 
activities
,
 
register
 
the
 
company
 
with
 
HM
 
Revenue
 
&
 
Customs
 
for
 
Corporation
 
Tax
 
1stformations.co.uk
.
 
(Companies
 
House
 
often
 
notifies
 
HMRC,
 
but
 
you
 
should
 
ensure
 
you’re
 
registered).
 
Set
 
up
 
a
 
Government
 
Gateway
 
account
 
and
 
add
 
Corporation
 
Tax
 
to
 
your
 
business
 
tax
 
account 
gov.uk
.
 
If
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
hire
 
employees
 
(including
 
yourselves
 
drawing
 
salary),
 
also
 
register
 
for
 
PAYE
.
 
You
 
can
 
defer
 
VAT
 
registration
 
until
 
revenue
 
nears
 
the
 
£85k
 
threshold,
 
since
 
early
 
on
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
charge
 
VAT.
 
 
6.
 
Other
 
Compliance:
 
Once
 
registered,
 
note
 
your
 
company
 
number
 
and
 
Unique
 
Taxpayer
 
Reference
 
(UTR)
 
from
 
HMRC.
 
Mark
 
key
 
filing
 
deadlines:
 
annual
 
Confirmation
 
Statement,
 
annual
 
accounts,
 
and
 
company
 
tax
 
return.
 
Keep
 
proper
 
records
 
from
 
day
 
one 
gov.uk
 
gov.uk
.
 
 
●
 
Consider
 
Tax
 
Schemes:
 
As
 
a
 
UK
 
startup
 
engaged
 
in
 
R&D,
 
you
 
likely
 
qualify
 
for
 
R&D
 
Tax
 
Credits
,
 
which
 
can
 
refund
 
up
 
to
 
33%
 
of
 
eligible
 
development
 
costs 
seedlegals.com
 
seedlegals.com
.
 
Plan
 
to
 
track
 
R&D
 
expenses
 
(developer
 
fees,
 
cloud
 
services,
 
etc.)
 
to
 
reclaim
 
a
 
cash
 
credit
 
–
 
a
 
valuable
 
funding
 
boost
 
for
 
tech
 
startups.
 
Also
 
consider
 
applying
 
for
 
SEIS/EIS
 
(Seed
 
Enterprise
 
Investment
 
Scheme)
 
advance
 
assurance
 
to
 
attract
 
investors.
 
Under
 
SEIS,
 
angel
 
investors
 
can
 
get
 
50%
 
income
 
tax
 
relief
 
on
 
investments
 
(up
 
to
 
£200k
 
per
 
year),
 
which
 
hugely
 
incentivizes
 
them 
ukbaa.org.uk
.
 
Securing
 
SEIS/EIS
 
status
 
from
 
HMRC
 
in
 
advance
 
will
 
give
 
potential
 
investors
 
confidence
 
that
 
their
 
stake
 
in
 
Clerky
 
will
 
qualify
 
for
 
these
 
tax
 
reliefs

.
 
 
Co-Founder
 
Setup
 
and
 
Equity
 
Distribution
 
●
 
Co-Founder
 
Roles:
 
Legally,
 
you
 
can
 
appoint
 
your
 
wife
 
as
 
a
 
director
 
and
 
co-founder
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
company.
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
restriction
 
on
 
spouses
 
being
 
co-directors
 
–
 
“no
 
reasons
 
why
 
any
 
individual,
 
including
 
a
 
spouse,
 
cannot
 
be
 
a
 
director”
 
freelanceinformer.com
.
 
Both
 
of
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
as
 
directors
 
on
 
Companies
 
House
 
and
 
share
 
the
 
fiduciary
 
duties
 
(acting
 
in
 
the
 
company’s
 
best
 
interest,
 
keeping
 
records,
 
etc.).
 
 
●
 
Equity
 
Shareholding:
 
Allocate
 
shares
 
to
 
both
 
founders.
 
Many
 
husband-wife
 
startups
 
choose
 
a
 
50/50
 
split
 
for
 
simplicity
 
and
 
fairness,
 
but
 
you
 
may
 
adjust
 
based
 
on
 
roles
 
or
 
initial
 
contributions.
 
Ensure
 
that
 
the
 
share
 
allocation
 
gives
 
both
 
of
 
you
 
significant
 
ownership
 
and
 
that
 
each
 
holds
 
over
 
25%
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
joint
 
control
 
(this
 
will
 
also
 
list
 
both
 
as
 
PSCs
 
–
 
Persons
 
of
 
Significant
 
Control).
 
Document
 
the
 
share
 
issuance
 
in
 
the
 
cap
 
table
 
(e.g.
 
1000
 
shares
 
split
 
between
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
accordingly).
 
 
●
 
Founders’
 
Agreement:
 
Even
 
as
 
a
 
married
 
couple,
 
treat
 
the
 
business
 
professionally
 
–
 
draft
 
a
 
founders’
 
agreement
 
(co-founder
 
agreement)
 
to
 
define
 
each
 
person’s
 
role,
 
decision-making
 
powers,
 
and
 
handling
 
of
 
possible
 
future
 
disputes 
help.seedlegals.com
 
help.seedlegals.com
.
 
This
 
agreement
 
should
 
cover:
 
roles
 
and
 
responsibilities
 
in
 
day-to-day
 
operations,
 
what
 
happens
 
if
 
one
 
founder
 
leaves
 
or
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
disagreement,
 
non-compete
 
and
 
confidentiality
 
obligations,
 
and
 
equity
 
vesting
 
terms
 
if
 
applicable.
 
Having
 
such
 
an
 
agreement
 
“protects
 
each
 
founder's
 
interests…
 
and
 
sets
 
out
 
what’s
 
been
 
agreed”
 
about
 
the
 
business
 
structure
 
and
 
operations 
harperjames.co.uk
.
 
It
 
might
 
feel
 
unnecessary
 
now,
 
but
 
it’s
 
vital
 
to
 
“plan
 
for
 
the
 
worst
 
while
 
hoping
 
for
 
the
 
best,”
 
even
 
with
 
family 
help.seedlegals.com
.
 
(For
 
example,
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
divorce
 
or
 
one
 
founder
 
wanting
 
to
 
exit,
 
this
 
document
 
will
 
save
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
trouble.)
 
 
●
 
Employment
 
vs.
 
Founder
 
Status:
 
If
 
your
 
wife
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
an
 
employee
 
(drawing
 
a
 
salary
 
for
 
day-to-day
 
work),
 
you
 
can
 
formalize
 
that
 
with
 
an
 
employment
 
contract.
 
In
 
early
 
stages,
 
many
 
founders
 
forgo
 
salary
 
(or
 
take
 
a
 
minimal
 
salary)
 
until
 
funding
 
allows
 
–
 
in
 
such
 
cases,
 
a
 
“Founders’
 
Pledge”
 
agreement
 
can
 
be
 
used,
 
which
 
basically
 
sets
 
salary
 
as
 
£0
 
but
 
records
 
that
 
she’s
 
contributing
 
as
 
a
 
co-founder 
help.seedlegals.com
.
 
Once
 
you
 
raise
 
funds
 
and
 
decide
 
to
 
pay
 
yourselves,
 
you
 
can
 
update
 
to
 
a
 
proper
 
Founder
 
Service
 
Agreement
 
that
 
doubles
 
as
 
an
 
employment
 
contract
 
(with
 
defined
 
salary,
 
duties,
 
etc.) 
help.seedlegals.com
.
 
This
 
ensures
 
clarity
 
that
 
your
 
wife
 
is
 
both
 
an
 
owner
 
and
 
an
 
employee
 
with
 
defined
 
terms.
 
 
●
 
Issue
 
Share
 
Certificates
 
&
 
Filings:
 
After
 
incorporation,
 
issue
 
share
 
certificates
 
to
 
yourself
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
for
 
the
 
allotted
 
shares.
 
Update
 
the
 
company’s
 
statutory
 
register
 
of
 
members
 
with
 
both
 
founders.
 
If
 
you
 
didn’t
 
add
 
your
 
wife
 
during
 
initial
 
registration,
 
you
 
can
 
allot
 
shares
 
to
 
her
 
(and
 
file
 
a
 
return
 
of
 
allotment
 
(SH01)
 
to
 
Companies
 
House)
 
or
 
transfer
 
some
 
of
 
your
 
shares
 
to
 
her
 
(file
 
a
 
stock
 
transfer
 
form).
 
It’s
 
simplest
 
to
 
incorporate
 
with
 
both
 
of
 
you
 
as
 
initial
 
shareholders
 
to
 
avoid
 
extra
 
filings.
 
 
Banking
 
and
 
Financial
 
Setup
 
●
 
Business
 
Bank
 
Account:
 
Open
 
a
 
dedicated
 
business
 
bank
 
account
 
in
 
the
 
company’s
 
name
 
soon
 
after
 
incorporation.
 
This
 
keeps
 
personal
 
and
 
company
 
finances
 
separate
 
(a
 
legal
 
requirement
 
for
 
an
 
Ltd’s
 
accounting).
 
Many
 
UK
 
startups
 
choose
 
digital
 
challenger
 
banks
 
for
 
ease:
 
for
 
example,
 
Starling
 
Bank
 
offers
 
a
 
free
 
business
 
account
 
with
 
a
 
quick
 
online
 
setup 
wise.com
.
 
Starling
 
(and
 
similar
 
options
 
like
 
Monzo
 
Business,
 
Tide,
 
or
 
Revolut
 
Business)
 
have
 
benefits
 
such
 
as
 
instant
 
payment
 
notifications,
 
no
 
monthly
 
fees,
 
and
 
integration
 
with
 
accounting
 
tools 
wise.com
.
 
Traditional
 
banks
 
(Barclays,
 
HSBC,
 
NatWest)
 
also
 
offer
 
startup
 
accounts
 
(often
 
fee-free
 
for
 
12-18
 
months) 
wise.com
 
wise.com
,
 
but
 
app-based
 
banks
 
tend
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
convenient
 
for
 
a
 
small
 
tech
 
business.
 
Ensure
 
both
 
founders
 
(directors)
 
are
 
listed
 
as
 
authorized
 
signatories
 
on
 
the
 
account.
 
 
●
 
Accounting
 
&
 
Bookkeeping:
 
Set
 
up
 
a
 
cloud-based
 
accounting
 
software
 
to
 
manage
 
invoicing,
 
expenses,
 
and
 
tax
 
filings.
 
Solutions
 
like
 
Xero,
 
QuickBooks,
 
or
 
FreeAgent
 
are
 
popular
 
for
 
UK
 
startups 
virtue.accountants
.
 
These
 
tools
 
will
 
help
 
you
 
stay
 
compliant
 
with
 
HMRC
 
and
 
handle
 
VAT
 
if
 
you
 
register
 
later 
virtue.accountants
.
 
Many
 
online
 
banks
 
integrate
 
with
 
these
 
(for
 
example,
 
Starling
 
integrates
 
with
 
Xero/QuickBooks
 
for
 
automatic
 
transaction
 
syncing 
wise.com
).
 
Pick
 
one
 
and
 
begin
 
logging
 
all
 
expenses
 
related
 
to
 
Clerky
 
(software
 
subscriptions,
 
prototype
 
hosting
 
costs,
 
etc.)
 
from
 
day
 
one.
 
This
 
will
 
simplify
 
preparing
 
annual
 
accounts
 
and
 
R&D
 
tax
 
credit
 
claims.
 
You
 
may
 
also
 
consider
 
engaging
 
a
 
part-time
 
accountant
 
or
 
using
 
an
 
affordable
 
service
 
for
 
annual
 
filings,
 
but
 
initially
 
the
 
software
 
and
 
some
 
learning
 
should
 
suffice.
 
 
●
 
Payment
 
Processing
 
Setup:
 
Although
 
Clerky
 
will
 
initially
 
target
 
NHS
 
institutions
 
and
 
clinicians
 
(who
 
may
 
pay
 
via
 
invoices
 
or
 
institutional
 
procurement),
 
set
 
up
 
online
 
payment
 
accounts
 
in
 
advance
 
for
 
flexibility.
 
Create
 
a
 
Stripe
 
account
 
–
 
Stripe
 
is
 
a
 
developer-friendly
 
payment
 
gateway
 
widely
 
used
 
by
 
startups
 
for
 
handling
 
credit
 
card
 
transactions 
konnectify.co
 
konnectify.co
.
 
It’s
 
easy
 
to
 
integrate
 
into
 
web
 
platforms
 
and
 
“has
 
become
 
a
 
default
 
choice
 
for
 
businesses
 
looking
 
for
 
an
 
easy-to-integrate,
 
scalable
 
payment
 
system”
 
konnectify.co
.
 
Also
 
consider
 
setting
 
up
 
PayPal
 
Business
 
for
 
any
 
clients
 
who
 
prefer
 
it;
 
PayPal
 
is
 
straightforward
 
for
 
one-off
 
or
 
subscription
 
payments
 
and
 
some
 
customers
 
trust
 
it.
 
Even
 
if
 
these
 
payment
 
channels
 
won’t
 
be
 
used
 
until
 
you
 
start
 
charging
 
users,
 
having
 
them
 
ready
 
will
 
enable
 
you
 
to
 
quickly
 
pilot
 
paid
 
features
 
or
 
accept
 
early
 
revenues
 
(for
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
decide
 
to
 
charge
 
a
 
private
 
clinic
 
or
 
individual
 
clinicians
 
outside
 
the
 
NHS).
 
Keep
 
in
 
mind
 
transaction
 
fees
 
(Stripe
 
~1.4%+20p
 
for
 
UK
 
cards;
 
PayPal
 
~2.9%+30p)
 
when
 
pricing
 
your
 
service
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
 
●
 
Operational
 
Tools:
 
Leverage
 
other
 
low-cost
 
tools
 
to
 
streamline
 
operations.
 
For
 
example,
 
use
 
Gmail/Google
 
Workspace
 
or
 
Microsoft
 
365
 
for
 
your
 
company
 
email
 
(you
 
can
 
set
 
up
 
yourname@clerky.com
 
once
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
domain).
 
These
 
suites
 
also
 
provide
 
shared
 
calendars,
 
cloud
 
storage
 
for
 
documents
 
(business
 
plans,
 
technical
 
specs),
 
and
 
basic
 
collaboration
 
tools.
 
As
 
a
 
small
 
founding
 
team,
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
simple
 
project
 
management
 
tracker
 
(Trello
 
or
 
Asana
 
have
 
free
 
tiers)
 
to
 
organize
 
development
 
tasks
 
around
 
the
 
prototype.
 
Early
 
organization
 
will
 
pay
 
off
 
once
 
you
 
have
 
additional
 
developers
 
or
 
contractors
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
project.
 
 
●
 
Financial
 
Planning:
 
Open
 
a
 
business
 
savings
 
account
 
or
 
use
 
accounting
 
software
 
to
 
earmark
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
any
 
funds
 
you
 
put
 
in
 
as
 
founders
 
for
 
taxes
 
(e.g.
 
if
 
you
 
eventually
 
have
 
to
 
charge
 
VAT
 
or
 
pay
 
corporation
 
tax
 
on
 
profits).
 
Given
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
seek
 
funding,
 
also
 
maintain
 
a
 
cap
 
table
 
document
 
from
 
the
 
start
 
(listing
 
share
 
ownership)
 
and
 
keep
 
it
 
updated
 
with
 
any
 
new
 
equity.
 
This
 
will
 
be
 
needed
 
when
 
talking
 
to
 
investors.
 
A
 
tool
 
like
 
SeedLegals
 
or
 
Carta
 
can
 
help
 
manage
 
your
 
cap
 
table
 
and
 
even
 
handle
 
issuing
 
shares
 
to
 
investors
 
down
 
the
 
line,
 
but
 
an

Legal
 
Agreements
 
and
 
Compliance
 
●
 
Founders’
 
Agreement:
 
As
 
mentioned,
 
put
 
a
 
founders’
 
agreement
 
in
 
place
 
between
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife.
 
This
 
document
 
will
 
outline
 
how
 
major
 
decisions
 
are
 
made
 
(consensus,
 
or
 
perhaps
 
each
 
in
 
charge
 
of
 
certain
 
domains),
 
what
 
happens
 
if
 
one
 
founder
 
exits,
 
and
 
how
 
shares
 
or
 
IP
 
are
 
handled
 
in
 
that
 
case 
help.seedlegals.com
.
 
It’s
 
essentially
 
a
 
prenuptial
 
for
 
the
 
business
 
–
 
“a
 
baseline
 
for
 
how
 
your
 
co-founder
 
relationships
 
will
 
work”
,
 
clarifying
 
roles
 
and
 
protecting
 
against
 
future
 
disputes 
zoppi.co.uk
.
 
You
 
can
 
find
 
templates
 
or
 
use
 
startup
 
legal
 
services
 
(SeedLegals,
 
Cooley
 
GO,
 
etc.)
 
to
 
draft
 
this.
 
 
●
 
Shareholders’
 
Agreement:
 
As
 
soon
 
as
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
bring
 
on
 
outside
 
investors
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
issue
 
shares
 
to
 
anyone
 
beyond
 
the
 
two
 
of
 
you,
 
draft
 
a
 
shareholders’
 
agreement
.
 
This
 
will
 
include
 
provisions
 
on
 
pre-emption
 
rights
 
(existing
 
shareholders’
 
right
 
to
 
maintain
 
their
 
stake
 
in
 
new
 
funding
 
rounds),
 
drag-along
 
and
 
tag-along
 
rights
 
(ensuring
 
minority
 
shareholders
 
are
 
protected
 
or
 
can
 
be
 
forced
 
to
 
sell
 
under
 
certain
 
conditions
 
alongside
 
majority,
 
which
 
investors
 
will
 
expect),
 
and
 
founder
 
vesting
 
schedules
 
if
 
not
 
already
 
handled.
 
Since
 
initially
 
only
 
you
 
two
 
are
 
shareholders,
 
this
 
can
 
be
 
combined
 
with
 
the
 
founders’
 
agreement,
 
but
 
be
 
prepared
 
to
 
create
 
one
 
when
 
an
 
investor
 
comes
 
on
 
board.
 
 
●
 
Intellectual
 
Property
 
(IP)
 
Ownership:
 
Ensure
 
that
 
all
 
IP
 
created
 
for
 
Clerky
 
is
 
owned
 
by
 
the
 
company.
 
Since
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
are
 
founders,
 
formally
 
assign
 
any
 
pre-existing
 
IP
 
(the
 
prototype
 
code,
 
designs,
 
etc.
 
that
 
you’ve
 
created
 
in
 
your
 
spare
 
time)
 
to
 
the
 
company.
 
You
 
can
 
do
 
this
 
with
 
a
 
simple
 
IP
 
assignment
 
agreement.
 
This
 
way
 
the
 
company
 
clearly
 
owns
 
the
 
prototype
 
and
 
technology,
 
which
 
investors
 
and
 
partners
 
will
 
expect.
 
Going
 
forward,
 
anyone
 
who
 
contributes
 
to
 
the
 
product
 
(contract
 
developers,
 
designers,
 
etc.)
 
must
 
sign
 
agreements
 
to
 
transfer
 
IP
 
to
 
the
 
company.
 
Note
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
UK,
 
works
 
created
 
by
 
employees
 
in
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
their
 
job
 
automatically
 
belong
 
to
 
the
 
employer
 
(though
 
it’s
 
still
 
wise
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
IP
 
clause
 
in
 
employment
 
contracts) 
legalnodes.com
.
 
However,
 
contractors
 
retain
 
ownership
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
by
 
default
 
–
 
thus
 
you
 
need
 
a
 
contract
 
to
 
assign
 
their
 
work’s
 
IP
 
to
 
Clerky
 
legalnodes.com
 
legalnodes.com
.
 
When
 
engaging
 
any
 
freelancer
 
or
 
agency,
 
have
 
them
 
sign
 
an
 
Independent
 
Contractor
 
Agreement
 
with
 
clear
 
IP
 
assignment
 
and
 
confidentiality
 
clauses.
 
This
 
ensures
 
the
 
code
 
or
 
content
 
they
 
produce
 
is
 
legally
 
yours.
 
SeedLegals,
 
for
 
example,
 
offers
 
a
 
template
 
“Consultant/Contractor
 
agreement”
 
that
 
covers
 
IP
 
transfer 
seedlegals.com
.
 
 
●
 
Contractor
 
and
 
Employee
 
Agreements:
 
For
 
any
 
future
 
hires
,
 
even
 
short-term
 
contractors,
 
draft
 
basic
 
agreements.
 
Key
 
elements:
 
scope
 
of
 
work,
 
payment
 
terms,
 
confidentiality
 
(they
 
must
 
keep
 
patient
 
data
 
and
 
your
 
proprietary
 
info
 
secret),
 
and
 
IP
 
assignment
 
as
 
noted.
 
Also
 
include
 
that
 
contractors
 
must
 
abide
 
by
 
data
 
protection
 
laws
 
since
 
you’ll
 
handle
 
sensitive
 
medical
 
data.
 
For
 
employees
 
(when
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
budget
 
to
 
hire
 
developers
 
or
 
staff),
 
use
 
a
 
standard
 
UK
 
employment
 
contract
 
that
 
includes
 
confidentiality
 
and
 
invention
 
assignment
 
clauses 
legalnodes.com
.
 
Clearly
 
outline
 
roles
 
(e.g.
 
software
 
developer,
 
marketing
 
manager)
 
and
 
perhaps
 
create
 
an
 
employee
 
handbook
 
down
 
the
 
line
 
for
 
company
 
policies,
 
once
 
the
 
team
 
grows.
 
 
●
 
Non-Disclosure
 
Agreements
 
(NDAs):
 
Use
 
NDAs
 
when
 
sharing
 
sensitive
 
information
 
with
 
outside
 
parties
 
before
 
you’re
 
ready.
 
For
 
instance,
 
if
 
you
 
discuss
 
the
 
technology
 
with
 
a
 
hospital’s
 
innovation
 
department
 
or
 
another
 
company
 
for
 
integration,
 
or
 
when
 
interviewing
 
potential
 
hires/freelancers
 
who
 
will
 
see
 
the
 
prototype,
 
have
 
an
 
NDA
 
in
 
place.
 
This
 
ensures
 
they
 
can’t
 
misuse
 
your
 
idea
 
or
 
data.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
a
 
simple
 
one-page
 
mutual
 
NDA
 
template
 
(mutual
 
if
 
both
 
sides
 
share
 
info,
 
or
 
one-way
 
if
 
only
 
they
 
receive
 
info).
 
This
 
will
 
protect
 
any
 
unpublished
 
know-how
 
of
 
Clerky
.
 
Keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
while
 
NDAs
 
are
 
common,
 
some
 
investors
 
(VCs)
 
may
 
refuse
 
to
 
sign
 
NDAs
 
at
 
pitch
 
stage
 
–
 
typically
 
you
 
won’t
 
need
 
them
 
for
 
standard
 
pitches
 
that
 
don’t
 
reveal
 
source
 
code
 
or
 
secret
 
sauce.
 
 
●
 
Regulatory
 
Compliance
 
(Medical
 
Software):
 
Clerky
 
is
 
intended
 
for
 
clinical
 
use,
 
so
 
plan
 
early
 
for
 
regulatory
 
requirements.
 
In
 
the
 
UK,
 
software
 
that
 
provides
 
clinical
 
decision
 
support
 
can
 
be
 
classified
 
as
 
a
 
Medical
 
Device
 
(likely
 
Class
 
IIa
 
under
 
UKCA/CE
 
rules,
 
as
 
your
 
business
 
case
 
noted file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl).
 
This
 
means
 
eventually
 
you
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
MHRA
 
(Medicines
 
and
 
Healthcare
 
products
 
Regulatory
 
Agency)
 
for
 
approval/registration
 
of
 
the
 
software
 
as
 
a
 
medical
 
device.
 
Early
 
on,
 
you
 
can
 
engage
 
with
 
a
 
regulatory
 
consultant
 
or
 
explore
 
the
 
MHRA’s
 
guidance
 
for
 
stand-alone
 
software
.
 
As
 
a
 
startup,
 
you
 
might
 
leverage
 
initiatives
 
like
 
the
 
NHS
 
AI
 
Lab’s
 
Regulatory
 
Sandbox
 
(if
 
available)
 
to
 
get
 
advice
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
meet
 
requirements.
 
Key
 
things
 
to
 
implement
 
from
 
the
 
start:
 
a
 
quality
 
management
 
process
 
for
 
your
 
software
 
development
 
(document
 
your
 
testing
 
and
 
validation
 
of
 
the
 
AI
 
recommendations),
 
and
 
monitoring
 
for
 
safety
 
issues.
 
Also,
 
since
 
Clerky
 
will
 
deal
 
with
 
patient
 
data
 
(via
 
consultation
 
transcription
 
and
 
EHR
 
notes),
 
data
 
protection
 
is
 
paramount.
 
Ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
UK
 
GDPR
 
–
 
for
 
example,
 
any
 
patient
 
data
 
used
 
by
 
the
 
AI
 
must
 
be
 
stored
 
and
 
processed
 
securely.
 
If
 
using
 
cloud
 
services,
 
choose
 
providers
 
with
 
NHS-approved
 
security
 
standards
 
(such
 
as
 
Azure
 
or
 
AWS
 
with
 
UK
 
data
 
centers).
 
You
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
register
 
with
 
the
 
ICO
 
(Information
 
Commissioner’s
 
Office)
 
as
 
a
 
data
 
processor
 
once
 
you
 
handle
 
real
 
personal
 
health
 
data.
 
While
 
a
 
full
 
regulatory
 
approval
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
longer-term
 
step,
 
begin
 
building
 
these
 
considerations
 
(accuracy,
 
audit
 
trails,
 
data
 
security)
 
into
 
the
 
product
 
now
 
–
 
it
 
will
 
pay
 
off
 
when
 
conducting
 
NHS
 
trials.
 
Your
 
business
 
case
 
acknowledges
 
the
 
regulatory
 
challenge
 
but
 
suggests
 
leveraging
 
the
 
UK’s
 
AI-friendly
 
stance
 
and
 
possibly
 
targeting
 
markets
 
like
 
the
 
US
 
FDA’s
 
easier
 
pathways
 
in
 
parallel file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
The
 
launch
 
plan
 
should
 
include
 
a
 
regulatory
 
roadmap
:
 
e.g.
 
target
 
a
 
UKCA
 
mark
 
(or
 
CE
 
mark
 
for
 
EU)
 
by
 
a
 
certain
 
date,
 
perhaps
 
after
 
initial
 
pilot
 
data
 
is
 
gathered.
 
 
●
 
Basic
 
Policies:
 
As
 
you
 
prepare
 
to
 
operate,
 
draft
 
basic
 
terms
 
and
 
policies:
 
a
 
Privacy
 
Policy
 
and
 
Terms
 
of
 
Service
 
for
 
any
 
pilot
 
usage
 
of
 
the
 
platform
 
(even
 
if
 
it’s
 
a
 
closed
 
beta).
 
Clinicians
 
and
 
hospitals
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
you
 
handle
 
data
 
privacy.
 
Make
 
it
 
transparent
 
that
 
Clerky
 
maintains
 
patient
 
confidentiality
 
and
 
outline
 
measures
 
taken
 
(encryption,
 
anonymization
 
if
 
applicable,
 
etc.).
 
Also
 
prepare
 
a
 
clinical
 
safety
 
policy
 
if
 
required
 
by
 
NHS
 
(often
 
digital
 
health
 
tools
 
need
 
a
 
Clinical
 
Safety
 
Officer
 
overseeing
 
risks
 
–
 
initially,
 
as
 
an
 
NHS
 
clinician
 
yourself,
 
you
 
might
 
fill
 
this
 
role
 
informally).
 
These
 
documents
 
can
 
be
 
simple
 
at
 
first,
 
but
 
having
 
them
 
shows
 
professionalism
 
when
 
dealing
 
with
 
stakeholders.
 
 
Go-to-Market
 
Strategy
 
Clerky
’s
 
go-to-market
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
NHS
 
clinicians
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
users
,
 
starting
 
in
 
maternity
 
care
 
(Obstetrics
 
&
 
Gynaecology)
 
where
 
the
 
need
 
and
 
potential
 
impact
 
are
 
high.
 
The
 
approach
 
will
 
be
 
phased:
 
initial
 
pilot
 
with
 
a
 
small
 
group
 
of
 
clinicians
 
to
 
validate
 
the
 
solution,
 
then
 
broader
 
adoption
 
leveraging
 
results
 
and
 
endorsements.
 
●
 
Target
 
Customer
 
Profile:
 
The
 
immediate
 
target
 
users
 
are
 
NHS
 
doctors
 
(and
 
potentially
 
midwives
 
or
 
nurses)
 
working
 
in
 
clinical
 
settings
 
with
 
heavy
 
documentation
 
and
 
guideline
 
adherence
 
demands
 
–
 
notably
 
Obstetrics
 
&
 
Gynae,
 
as
 
per
 
your
 
specialty.
 
The
 
business
 
case
 
identifies
 
O&G
 
clinicians,
 
with
 
expansion
 
to
 
midwives,
 
nurses,
 
and
 
HCAs
 
as
 
possible
 
users file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
In
 
the
 
long
 
run,
 
Clerky
 
can
 
be
 
applied
 
to
 
other
 
specialties
 
(e.g.
 
emergency
 
medicine,
 
surgery)
 
that
 
face
 
similar
 
documentation
 
burdens.
 
However,
 
concentrating
 
on
 
maternity
 
services
 
first
 
is
 
strategic:
 
Obstetrics
 
has
 
high
 
medicolegal
 
risks
 
and
 
significant
 
documentation
 
requirements,
 
meaning
 
Clerky
 
can
 
deliver
 
clear
 
value
 
(saving
 
time
 
and
 
reducing
 
errors).
 
The
 
NHS
 
is
 
incurring
 
£1.6
 
billion/year
 
in
 
obstetric
 
negligence
 
costs
 file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl
 
–
 
a
 
figure
 
you
 
can
 
quote
 
to
 
potential
 
NHS
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
underscore
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
consistency
 
in
 
guidelines
 
and
 
documentation.
 
Clerky
’s
 
value
 
proposition
 
for
 
clinicians
 
is
 
to
 
“focus
 
more
 
on
 
patient
 
care
 
while
 
reducing
 
documentation
 
burden
 
and
 
mitigating
 
negligence
 
risks”
 file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
For
 
NHS
 
managers,
 
the
 
pitch
 
is
 
improved
 
efficiency
 
and
 
reduced
 
costly
 
errors/omissions.
 
 
●
 
Initial
 
Pilot
 
Implementation:
 
Begin
 
with
 
a
 
pilot
 
program
 
in
 
a
 
high-need,
 
controlled
 
environment.
 
For
 
example,
 
aim
 
to
 
pilot
 
Clerky
 
in
 
an
 
NHS
 
maternity
 
triage
 
unit
 
(as
 
suggested
 
in
 
your
 
business
 
case file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl).
 
Maternity
 
triage
 
is
 
an
 
ideal
 
setting:
 
it’s
 
a
 
critical
 
workflow
 
(deciding
 
priority
 
of
 
pregnant
 
patients),
 
requires
 
adherence
 
to
 
guidelines,
 
and
 
produces
 
documentation
 
that
 
goes
 
into
 
records.
 
By
 
piloting
 
here,
 
you
 
can
 
show
 
how
 
Clerky
 
transcribes
 
interactions,
 
prompts
 
clinicians
 
with
 
real-time
 
guidelines
 
(e.g.
 
NICE
 
or
 
RCOG
 
guidelines
 
for
 
maternity),
 
and
 
generates
 
structured
 
notes.
 
Identify
 
a
 
specific
 
NHS
 
hospital
 
or
 
trust
 
willing
 
to
 
collaborate.
 
Leverage
 
your
 
position
 
as
 
an
 
NHS
 
clinician:
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
the
 
maternity
 
department
 
in
 
your
 
own
 
hospital
 
or
 
contacts
 
you
 
have
 
in
 
other
 
trusts.
 
Clinical
 
champions
 
are
 
key
 
–
 
find
 
a
 
respected
 
obstetrician
 
or
 
midwife
 
lead
 
who
 
is
 
enthusiastic
 
about
 
innovation
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
pilot
 
internally.
 
Offer
 
the
 
pilot
 
at
 
no
 
cost,
 
positioning
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
trial
 
that
 
could
 
demonstrate
 
efficiency
 
gains
 
and
 
patient
 
safety
 
improvements.
 
The
 
pilot
 
plan
 
should
 
outline
 
duration
 
(perhaps
 
3-6
 
months),
 
the
 
scope
 
(#
 
of
 
users
 
or
 
shifts
 
covered),
 
and
 
metrics
 
to
 
track
 
(e.g.
 
reduction
 
in
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
paperwork,
 
number
 
of
 
guideline
 
deviations
 
caught
 
by
 
Clerky
,
 
user
 
satisfaction
 
feedback).
 
 
●
 
Stakeholder
 
Engagement:
 
Prior
 
to
 
and
 
during
 
the
 
pilot,
 
engage
 
broader
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
build
 
buy-in.
 
Meet
 
with
 
the
 
hospital’s
 
Digital
 
Transformation
 
or
 
Innovation
 
lead
,
 
and
 
the
 
Clinical
 
Governance
 
team,
 
to
 
ensure
 
Clerky
 
aligns
 
with
 
their
 
needs
 
and
 
safety
 
standards.
 
Also
 
involve
 
the
 
IT
 
department
 
early
 
–
 
Clerky
 
will
 
likely
 
need
 
access
 
to
 
their
 
EHR
 
(Electronic
 
Health
 
Record)
 
system
 
or
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
sandbox
 
environment
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
EHR
 
note
 
integration.
 
Highlight
 
Clerky
’s
 
ability
 
to
 
produce
 
EHR-compatible
 
notes
 
and
 
your
 
plan
 
for
 
“seamless
 
EHR
 
integration”
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
development
 
phase file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
On
 
a
 
regional
 
level,
 
connect
 
with
 
your
 
local
 
AHSN
 
(Academic
 
Health
 
Science
 
Network)
 
or
 
initiatives
 
like
 
DigitalHealth.London
 
(if
 
you’re
 
in
 
London
 
or
 
a
 
similar
 
program
 
in
 
your
 
region).
 
These
 
bodies
 
help
 
bridge
 
startups
 
and
 
the
 
NHS,
 
often
 
supporting
 
pilot
 
matchmaking
 
and
 
providing
 
advice
 
on
 
NHS
 
procurement.
 
Another
 
avenue
 
is
 
the
 
NHS
 
Clinical
 
Entrepreneur
 
Programme
 
(if
 
not
 
already
 
involved,
 
consider
 
applying)
 
–
 
it’s
 
specifically
 
designed
 
to
 
help
 
NHS
 
staff
 
like
 
you
 
develop
 
innovations,
 
providing
 
mentorship
 
and
 
networking
 
with
 
NHS
 
stakeholders.
 
 
●
 
Demonstrating
 
Value:
 
Collect
 
data
 
and
 
testimonials
 
from
 
the
 
pilot.
 
Aim
 
to
 
show
 
quantifiable
 
improvements:
 
e.g.,
 
“
Clerky
 
saved
 
clinicians
 
an
 
average
 
of
 
30%
 
of
 
time
 
on
 
note-taking
 
per
 
consultation,”
 
or
 
“100%
 
of
 
clinicians
 
felt
 
more
 
confident
 
they
 
hadn’t
 
missed
 
any
 
guideline-recommended
 
steps.”
 
Also
 
capture
 
any
 
anecdotal
 
success
 
stories
 
(e.g.
 
a
 
case
 
where
 
Clerky
’s
 
prompt
 
prevented
 
an
 
oversight).
 
These
 
will
 
be
 
gold
 
when
 
convincing
 
other
 
NHS
 
departments
 
or
 
investors.
 
Additionally,
 
track
 
the
 
reduction
 
in
 
potential
 
error
 
rates
 
or
 
improved
 
compliance
 
with
 
protocols.
 
If
 
possible,
 
involve
 
the
 
hospital’s
 
audit
 
or
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
independently
 
evaluate
 
the
 
pilot
 
outcomes
 
–
 
an
 
endorsement
 
or
 
published
 
case
 
study
 
adds
 
credibility.
 
 
●
 
Iterate
 
with
 
Feedback:
 
Use
 
pilot
 
feedback
 
to
 
refine
 
the
 
product
 
(your
 
business
 
case
 
calls
 
this
 
“Phase
 
1:
 
Enhance
 
prototype
 
with
 
user
 
feedback”
 file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl).
 
For
 
example,
 
clinicians
 
might
 
want
 
a
 
tweak
 
in
 
the
 
UI
 
or
 
find
 
certain
 
guideline
 
suggestions
 
too
 
intrusive
 
–
 
fine-tune
 
these
 
aspects.
 
Early
 
users
 
might
 
also
 
suggest
 
new
 
features
 
(maybe
 
integration
 
with
 
a
 
specific
 
maternity
 
risk
 
score
 
or
 
printing
 
a
 
patient
 
summary).
 
Prioritize
 
the
 
changes
 
that
 
improve
 
user
 
experience
 
and
 
clinical
 
relevance.
 
This
 
not
 
only
 
improves
 
Clerky
 
before
 
broader
 
rollout
 
but
 
also
 
turns
 
those
 
clinicians
 
into
 
advocates
 
as
 
they
 
see
 
their
 
input
 
incorporated.
 
 
●
 
Business
 
Model
 
&
 
Pricing
 
(Initial):
 
For
 
NHS,
 
typically
 
the
 
model
 
could
 
be
 
B2B
 
–
 
the
 
hospital
 
or
 
trust
 
pays
 
for
 
licenses
 
or
 
subscription.
 
However,
 
adoption
 
in
 
NHS
 
can
 
be
 
slow,
 
so
 
consider
 
a
 
freemium
 
or
 
tiered
 
model
 
to
 
get
 
initial
 
traction file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
For
 
instance,
 
Clerky
 
could
 
offer
 
a
 
free
 
basic
 
version
 
to
 
individual
 
clinicians:
 
they
 
can
 
sign
 
up
 
and
 
use
 
the
 
transcription
 
and
 
note-generation
 
for
 
their
 
own
 
practice
 
(with
 
general
 
guidelines)
 
for
 
free.
 
Premium
 
features
 
(or
 
institutional
 
use)
 
could
 
then
 
be
 
monetized
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
a
 
paid
 
tier
 
for
 
hospitals
 
that
 
includes
 
integration
 
into
 
EHR,
 
customization
 
to
 
local
 
guideline
 
libraries,
 
and
 
admin
 
dashboards.
 
The
 
business
 
case
 
suggests
 
a
 
“tiered
 
subscription
 
model,
 
including
 
freemium
 
options
 
for
 
initial
 
use”
 file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
This
 
strategy
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
user
 
base
 
and
 
collect
 
data
 
even
 
before
 
big
 
contracts.
 
Clinicians
 
who
 
love
 
the
 
free
 
tool
 
can
 
become
 
internal
 
champions
 
who
 
push
 
their
 
NHS
 
trust
 
to
 
purchase
 
the
 
enterprise
 
version
 
for
 
seamless
 
workflow
 
integration.
 
 
●
 
Regulatory
 
&
 
Safety
 
Clearance
 
for
 
Market:
 
Before
 
scaling
 
beyond
 
pilots,
 
ensure
 
you
 
address
 
any
 
regulatory
 
approvals.
 
For
 
instance,
 
after
 
a
 
successful
 
pilot,
 
you
 
might
 
seek
 
an
 
MHRA
 
stamp
 
or
 
UKCA
 
Class
 
IIa
 
certification
 
for
 
the
 
software.
 
Also,
 
conduct
 
a
 
clinical
 
risk
 
assessment
 
(per
 
NHS
 
DCB0129
 
standard
 
for
 
clinical
 
risk
 
management
 
of
 
health
 
IT,
 
which
 
is
 
often
 
required
 
for
 
health
 
software
 
in
 
NHS).
 
Having
 
these
 
in
 
hand
 
makes
 
procurement
 
much
 
easier.
 
If
 
full
 
regulatory
 
approval
 
is
 
still
 
in
 
progress,
 
you
 
can
 
potentially
 
deploy
 
under
 
research
 
or
 
evaluation
 
exemptions,
 
but
 
clear
 
transparency
 
about
 
status
 
is
 
needed.
 
 
●
 
Expand
 
to
 
Other
 
Sites:
 
After
 
proving
 
in
 
one
 
site,
 
plan
 
to
 
expand
 
pilots
 
to
 
others.
 
Perhaps
 
target
 
a
 
second
 
hospital’s
 
maternity
 
unit,
 
ideally
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
NHS
 
Trust
 
to
 
test
 
Clerky
 
in
 
a
 
new
 
environment.
 
Leverage
 
any
 
connections
 
via
 
professional
 
networks
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
Royal
 
College
 
of
 
Obstetricians
 
&
 
Gynaecologists
 
could
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
innovative
 
tools
 
for
 
their
 
members).
 
Present
 
at
 
relevant
 
NHS
 
forums
 
or
 
conferences:
 
for
 
example,
 
submit
 
to
 
speak
 
at
 
the
 
Digital
 
Health
 
Rewired
 
conference
 
or
 
NHS
 
Innovation
 
events,
 
focusing
 
on
 
how
 
AI
 
can
 
improve
 
front-line
 
clinician
 
workflows.
 
Getting
 
exposure
 
in
 
NHS
 
circles
 
will
 
attract
 
interested
 
clinicians
 
who
 
might
 
volunteer
 
their
 
department
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
pilot.
 
 
●
 
Partnerships:
 
Consider
 
partnerships
 
that
 
ease
 
market
 
entry.
 
For
 
example,
 
working
 
with
 
an
 
EHR
 
vendor
 
(like
 
Cerner
 
or
 
Epic
 
which
 
are
 
used
 
in
 
some
 
NHS
 
hospitals)
 
to
 
integrate
 
Clerky
 
as
 
an
 
add-on
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
route
 
–
 
though
 
this
 
might
 
be
 
longer-term
 
due
 
to
 
big
 
vendors’
 
slow
 
processes.
 
Alternatively,
 
partner
 
with
 
an
 
existing
 
NHS
 
digital
 
service
;
 
for
 
instance,
 
if
 
there’s
 
a
 
popular
 
maternity
 
app
 
or
 
digital
 
documentation
 
system,
 
Clerky
 
could
 
integrate
 
with
 
it
 
to
 
add
 
AI
 
capabilities.
 
Early
 
partnership
 
discussions
 
can
 
open
 
doors
 
and
 
possibly
 
funding
 
(some
 
EHR
 
companies
 
run
 
startup
 
programs).
 
 
●
 
International
 
Strategy
 
(optional):
 
While
 
the
 
UK
 
NHS
 
is
 
the
 
focus,
 
keep
 
an
 
eye
 
on
 
other
 
markets
 
as
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
business
 
case.
 
The
 
US
 
market
 
could
 
be
 
attractive
 
(large
 
and
 
faster-moving
 
with
 
private
 
hospitals).
 
You
 
might
 
pursue
 
FDA’s
 
Software
 
Pre-Cert
 
program
 
concurrently file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl,
 
especially
 
if
 
you
 
raise
 
enough
 
funds.
 
Similarly,
 
consider
 
Australia
 
or
 
New
 
Zealand
 
where
 
approval
 
processes
 
might
 
be
 
faster file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
A
 
strategy
 
could
 
be:
 
prove
 
the
 
concept
 
in
 
the
 
NHS
 
(as
 
a
 
prestigious
 
use-case),
 
then
 
use
 
that
 
success
 
to
 
sign
 
on
 
a
 
few
 
international
 
hospital
 
customers
 
or
 
get
 
into
 
an
 
accelerator
 
in
 
those
 
regions.
 
This
 
diversification
 
can
 
also
 
appeal
 
to
 
investors
 
(global
 
market
 
potential).
 
 
In
 
summary,
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
NHS
 
clinicians
 
who
 
need
 
it
 
most
 
(maternity)
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
strong
 
case
 
study.
 
Use
 
a
 
pilot
 
->
 
iterate
 
->
 
expand
 
approach file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl
 
to
 
gradually
 
grow
 
adoption.
 
The
 
NHS
 
is
 
a
 
huge
 
system,
 
so
 
showing
 
alignment
 
with
 
its
 
priorities
 
(e.g.
 
safer
 
maternity
 
care,
 
efficiency,
 
digitization
 
goals)
 
is
 
critical.
 
In
 
fact,
 
Clerky
 
can
 
be
 
pitched
 
as
 
supporting
 
the
 
NHS
 
Long
 
Term
 
Plan’s
 
goals
 
of
 
digital
 
transformation
 
and
 
patient
 
safety
 
–
 
your
 
business
 
case
 
summary
 
states
 
it
 
is
 
“aligned
 
with
 
NHS
 
priorities…
 
poised
 
to
 
deliver
 
significant
 
benefits”
 file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
This
 
narrative
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
both
 
marketing
 
to
 
the
 
NHS
 
and
 
pitching
 
to
 
investors.
 
Funding
 
and
 
Investor
 
Outreach
 
To
 
turn
 
Clerky
 
from
 
a
 
prototype
 
into
 
a
 
fully
 
developed
 
platform,
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
seek
 
external
 
funding
.
 
A
 
combined
 
approach
 
of
 
pursuing
 
non-dilutive
 
grants
 
and
 
angel/VC
 
investment
 
will
 
be
 
wise,
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
healthtech
 
domain
 
where
 
grant
 
support
 
is
 
strong
 
in
 
the
 
UK.
 
Below
 
is
 
a
 
strategy
 
to
 
identify
 
funding
 
sources
 
and
 
approach
 
investors:
 
●
 
Grant
 
Programs:
 
Start
 
with
 
grants
 
to
 
bolster
 
your
 
R&D
 
without
 
immediately
 
giving
 
up
 
equity.
 
In
 
the
 
UK,
 
several
 
grant
 
programs
 
target
 
healthcare
 
innovation:
 
 
○
 
NHS
 
AI
 
in
 
Health
 
and
 
Care
 
Award:
 
This
 
government-backed
 
program
 
(through
 
NHSX/NHS
 
AI
 
Lab
 
and
 
NIHR)
 
provides
 
staged
 
funding
 
for
 
AI
 
healthcare
 
solutions.
 
For
 
example,
 
Phase
 
1
 
awards
 
~£100k-£150k
 
for
 
feasibility,
 
Phase
 
2
 
larger
 
amounts
 
for
 
development,
 
etc. 
england.nhs.uk
.
 
Many
 
digital
 
health
 
startups
 
(including
 
those
 
focusing
 
on
 
clinical
 
AI)
 
have
 
won
 
these
 
awards.
 
Winning
 
such
 
an
 
award
 
would
 
not
 
only
 
fund
 
development
 
but
 
also
 
provide
 
credibility
 
and
 
NHS
 
validation.
 
Keep
 
an
 
eye
 
on
 
the
 
application
 
calls
 
(usually
 
annually);
 
tailor
 
your
 
application
 
to
 
how
 
Clerky
 
meets
 
NHS
 
priorities
 
(e.g.
 
reducing
 
documentation
 
burden,
 
improving
 
patient
 
safety).
 
 
○
 
SBRI
 
Healthcare
 
(Accelerated
 
Access
 
Collaborative):
 
SBRI
 
runs
 
themed
 
competitions
 
for
 
healthcare
 
challenges.
 
For
 
instance,
 
they
 
recently
 
awarded
 
£2.5m
 
across
 
five
 
maternity
 
care
 
innovations
 
(average
 
~£500k
 
each)
 
to
 
improve
 
outcomes 
sbrihealthcare.co.uk
.
 
If
 
a
 
competition
 
call
 
aligns
 
(e.g.
 
“Improving
 
Clinician
 
Efficiency”
 
or
 
“Patient
 
Safety
 
through
 
AI”),
 
Clerky
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
strong
 
contender.
 
SBRI
 
Phase
 
1
 
awards
 
are
 
often
 
~£100k
 
for
 
6-month
 
projects,
 
with

Phase
 
2
 
follow-on
 
funding 
sbrihealthcare.co.uk

Keep
 
track
 
of
 
SBRI
 
competitions
 
(they
 
announce
 
specific
 
themes
 
such
 
as
 
maternity,
 
primary
 
care,
 
etc.).
 
 
○
 
Innovate
 
UK
 
Smart
 
Grants:
 
Innovate
 
UK
 
(part
 
of
 
UKRI)
 
regularly
 
offers
 
Smart
 
Grants
 
for
 
any
 
innovative
 
technology.
 
These
 
can
 
provide
 
£100k–£500k
 
for
 
R&D
 
projects.
 
A

highlighting
 
Clerky
’s
 
technical
 
innovation
 
(AI
 
NLP
 
engine
 
for
 
real-time
 
support)
 
and
 
commercial
 
potential
 
could
 
score
 
well.
 
Success
 
may
 
depend
 
on
 
demonstrating
 
a
 
strong
 
team
 
and
 
feasibility;
 
having
 
a
 
working
 
prototype
 
and

will
 
help.
 
 
○
 
NIHR
 
i4i
 
(Invention
 
for
 
Innovation):
 
NIHR
 
offers
 
grants
 
for
 
medical
 
technology
 
development.
 
The
 
i4i
 
program
 
has
 
funding
 
streams
 
for
 
early-stage
 
and
 
late-stage
 
innovations.
 
As
 
Clerky
 
involves
 
patient
 
care,
 
NIHR
 
funding
 
(which
 
often
 
requires
 
an
 
NHS
 
partner
 
on
 
the
 
application)
 
could
 
be
 
accessible,
 
especially
 
if
 
you
 
involve
 
your
 
hospital
 
as
 
a
 
partner
 
in
 
the
 
research
 
aspect
 
of
 
Clerky
’s
 
development
 
(like
 
evaluating
 
clinical
 
outcomes).
 
 
○
 
Other
 
Grants/Competitions:
 
Look
 
out
 
for
 
regional
 
funds
 
(some
 
Local
 
Enterprise
 
Partnerships
 
have
 
innovation
 
grants),
 
the
 
Small
 
Business
 
Research
 
Initiative
 
(
SBRI
 
as
 
above),
 
or
 
even
 
UK
 
Research
 
Council
 
grants
 
if
 
you
 
partner
 
with
 
an
 
academic
 
institution
 
(for
 
example,
 
an
 
AI
 
research
 
grant
 
in
 
collaboration
 
with
 
a
 
university
 
computing
 
department).
 
Also,
 
the
 
Accelerated
 
Access
 
Collaborative
 
and
 
NHS
 
Innovation
 
Accelerator
 
(NIA)
 
–
 
the
 
NIA
 
itself
 
doesn’t
 
give
 
funding
 
but
 
provides
 
support
 
and
 
high-profile
 
endorsement
 
for
 
scaling
 
in
 
the
 
NHS.
 
Getting
 
onto
 
programs
 
like
 
NIA
 
or
 
DigitalHealth.London
 
Accelerator
 
can
 
indirectly
 
lead
 
to
 
funding
 
opportunities
 
and
 
investor
 
attention.
 
 
●
 
Angel
 
Investors:
 
On
 
the
 
private
 
investment
 
side,
 
start
 
with
 
angel
 
investors
 
who
 
are
 
familiar
 
with
 
healthtech.
 
Angel
 
investors
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
might
 
be
 
clinicians
 
with
 
entrepreneurial
 
experience
 
(e.g.
 
members
 
of
 
MedTech
 
investor
 
networks),
 
or
 
general
 
tech
 
angels
 
intrigued
 
by
 
AI
 
in
 
healthcare.
 
You
 
and
 
your
 
wife’s
 
personal
 
network
 
as
 
NHS
 
professionals
 
could
 
turn
 
up
 
doctors
 
interested
 
in
 
investing
 
(for
 
example,
 
consultants
 
who
 
often
 
invest
 
in
 
promising
 
medtech).
 
Additionally,
 
consider
 
approaching
 
angel
 
networks
 
like
 
Cambridge
 
Angels
 
or
 
Oxford
 
Angels
,
 
which
 
often
 
invest
 
in
 
health
 
startups 
shizune.co
.
 
There
 
are
 
also
 
specialized
 
angel
 
groups
 
for
 
healthcare
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
Angels
 
in
 
MedCity
 
in
 
London
 
or
 
health-focused
 
syndicates
 
on
 
platforms
 
like
 
SyndicateRoom 
shizune.co
.
 
When
 
pitching
 
to
 
angels,
 
emphasize
 
the
 
real-world
 
clinical
 
problem
 
you
 
are
 
solving
 
(burnout
 
and
 
negligence
 
risk
 
from
 
documentation
 
overload)
 
and
 
your
 
domain
 
expertise
 
as
 
a
 
practicing
 
doctor
 
(this
 
gives
 
you
 
credibility
 
that
 
many
 
tech
 
founders
 
lack).
 
Also
 
highlight
 
early
 
traction
 
(the
 
working
 
prototype,
 
any
 
pilot
 
commitments)
 
and
 
the
 
large
 
NHS
 
market
 
potential.
 
Remember
 
to
 
mention
 
the
 
SEIS/EIS
 
benefits
 
–
 
many
 
UK
 
angels
 
seek
 
SEIS-qualifying
 
startups
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
for
 
the
 
50%
 
tax
 
break 
ukbaa.org.uk
.
 
Since
 
Clerky
 
is
 
new,
 
it
 
should
 
qualify
 
for
 
SEIS
 
(companies
 
<2
 
years
 
old,
 
<£200k
 
raised,
 
etc.),
 
so
 
ensure
 
you’ve
 
obtained
 
Advance
 
Assurance
 
from
 
HMRC
 
for
 
SEIS/EIS
 
before
 
approaching
 
angel
 
networks 
seedlegals.com
.
 
This
 
assurance
 
signals
 
to
 
investors
 
that
 
their
 
investment
 
“is
 
likely
 
to
 
qualify
 
for
 
tax
 
relief”
 
seedlegals.com
,
 
making
 
them
 
more
 
inclined
 
to
 
commit
 
funds.

●
 
When
 
targeting
 
VCs,
 
craft
 
a
 
compelling
 
pitch
 
deck
.
 
Emphasize:
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
problem
 
(NHS
 
and
 
global
 
clinician
 
burnout,
 
negligence
 
costs),
 
Clerky
’s
 
unique
 
solution
 
(
“no
 
current
 
solution
 
offers
 
Clerky’s
 
integrated
 
real-time
 
guidance
 
and
 
documentation”
 
–
 
first-mover
 
advantage file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl),
 
evidence
 
of
 
demand
 
(feedback
 
from
 
clinicians,
 
pilot
 
plans),
 
and
 
the
 
strength
 
of
 
the
 
founding
 
team
 
(domain
 
expertise
 
+
 
a
 
working
 
prototype
 
built
 
while
 
working
 
full-time
 
shows
 
dedication
 
and
 
skill).
 
Include
 
your
 
roadmap
 
that
 
leads
 
to
 
significant
 
revenue
 
(VCs
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
scale
 
beyond
 
the
 
NHS
 
to
 
a
 
global
 
health
 
IT
 
market
 
worth
 
billions,
 
even
 
if
 
initial
 
focus
 
is
 
NHS).
 
Also
 
address
 
regulatory
 
strategy
 
upfront,
 
turning
 
a
 
potential
 
concern
 
into
 
a
 
strength
 
(e.g.,
 
“We
 
recognize
 
this
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
regulated
 
device
 
–
 
our
 
plan
 
to
 
achieve
 
approval
 
by
 
doing
 
X,
 
Y,
 
Z
 
and
 
thus
 
we
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
high
 
barrier
 
to
 
entry
 
for
 
competitors”).
 
 
 
Prepare
 
to
 
discuss
 
competition:
 
e.g.,
 
how
 
you
 
differ
 
from
 
Nuance
 
(Microsoft)
 
and
 
others
 
–
 
the
 
business
 
case
 
notes
 
that
 
Nuance
 
does
 
transcription
 
but
 
lacks
 
real-time
 
decision
 
support file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl,
 
and
 
Medwise.ai
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
search
 
engine file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
Use
 
such
 
points
 
to
 
show
 
Clerky
’s
 
edge.
 
VCs
 
will
 
also
 
ask
 
about
 
exit
 
potential
 
–
 
possible
 
acquirers
 
could
 
be
 
big
 
tech
 
in
 
healthcare
 
(Microsoft,
 
Google)
 
or
 
EHR
 
companies,
 
or
 
even
 
medical
 
device
 
firms
 
expanding
 
into
 
software.
 
 
●
 
Pitching
 
&
 
Networking:
 
Begin
 
networking
 
well
 
before
 
you
 
need
 
the
 
funds.
 
Attend
 
healthtech
 
meetups
 
(e.g.
 
Healthcare
 
Hub
 
events,
 
HealthTech
 
Investor
 
Forum
 
if
 
available).
 
Use
 
LinkedIn
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
partners
 
at
 
the
 
funds
 
mentioned,
 
especially
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
track
 
record
 
in
 
health
 
investments
 
–
 
for
 
instance,
 
partners
 
at
 
Octopus
 
Ventures
 
healthtech
 
team
 
(Octopus
 
is
 
very
 
active
 
in
 
UK
 
health
 
investments
 
and
 
often
 
leads
 
seed/Series
 
A 
sifted.eu
),
 
or
 
Episode1
 
etc.
 
Prepare
 
a
 
concise
 
elevator
 
pitch
 
highlighting
 
the
 
mission
 
(“Clerky
 
uses
 
AI
 
to
 
let
 
doctors
 
be
 
doctors
 
again,
 
by
 
handling
 
their
 
paperwork
 
and
 
guiding
 
best
 
practices
 
in
 
real
 
time,
 
potentially
 
saving
 
the
 
NHS
 
millions
 
and
 
improving
 
patient
 
care”).
 
Leverage
 
any
 
accelerator
 
programs:
 
consider
 
applying
 
to
 
Entrepreneur
 
First
 
(EF)
 
in
 
London
 
–
 
though
 
you
 
already
 
have
 
a
 
team,
 
EF
 
sometimes
 
takes
 
single
 
founders;
 
or
 
other
 
programs
 
like
 
AWRC
 
Wellbeing
 
Accelerator
 
(if
 
relevant),
 
etc.,
 
which
 
often
 
come
 
with
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
funding
 
and
 
investor
 
demo
 
days.
 
 
●
 
Timeline
 
for
 
Fundraising:
 
Align
 
your
 
fundraising
 
timeline
 
with
 
product
 
milestones.
 
A
 
logical
 
plan
 
could
 
be:
 
secure
 
some
 
grant
 
or
 
angel
 
funding
 
soon
 
(next
 
3-6
 
months)
 
to
 
hire
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
developers
 
and
 
build
 
out
 
the
 
product
 
for
 
pilot,
 
then
 
after
 
demonstrating
 
pilot
 
success
 
(~6-9
 
months
 
from
 
now),
 
raise
 
a
 
larger
 
seed
 
round
 
from
 
VCs
 
to
 
scale.
 
Many
 
successful
 
healthtech
 
startups
 
do
 
a
 
pre-seed
 
from
 
angels
 
(say
 
£150k
 
SEIS)
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
pilot,
 
then
 
seed
 
from
 
institutional
 
investors
 
(£1-2M)
 
to
 
expand.
 
Ensure
 
you
 
target
 
the
 
SEIS
 
window
 
(you
 
can
 
only
 
raise
 
up
 
to
 
£250k
 
under
 
SEIS,
 
which
 
is
 
extremely
 
attractive
 
to
 
investors)
 
–
 
try
 
to
 
utilize
 
that
 
for
 
your
 
angel/pre-seed
 
round.
 
For
 
the
 
seed
 
VC
 
round
 
(which
 
could
 
be
 
late
 
2025
 
or
 
2026),
 
having
 
pilot
 
data
 
and
 
possibly
 
an
 
NHS
 
contract
 
or
 
at
 
least
 
an
 
MOU
 
for
 
rollout
 
will
 
greatly
 
strengthen
 
your
 
pitch.
 
 
●
 
Use
 
of
 
Funds:
 
Be
 
clear
 
in
 
your
 
plan
 
for
 
using
 
investor
 
funds
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
“This
 
£500k
 
will
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
achieve:
 
integrate
 
with
 
2
 
major
 
EHR
 
systems,
 
comply
 
with
 
MHRA
 
Class
 
IIa
 
requirements,
 
and
 
run
 
3
 
hospital
 
pilots,
 
leading
 
to
 
5
 
paid
 
contracts
 
in
 
18
 
months.”
 
Investors
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
their
 
capital
 
fuels
 
growth
 
(team
 
hires,
 
product
 
dev,
 
and
 
sales/BD
 
to
 
sign
 
on
 
NHS
 
customers
 
or
 
private
 
hospitals)
 
and
 
not
 
wasted.
 
Given
 
your
 
mention
 
of
 
leveraging
 
AI
 
agents
 
to
 
remain
 
lean,
 
highlight
 
that
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
team
 
efficient
 
and
 
use
 
technology
 
(like
 
AI
 
automation)
 
to
 
punch
 
above
 
your
 
weight
 
–
 
meaning
 
their
 
investment
 
can
 
go
 
further
 
than
 
in
 
a
 
typical
 
startup.
 
 
●
 
Early
 
Revenue
 
Strategy:
 
Even
 
while
 
seeking
 
funding,
 
think
 
about
 
small-scale
 
revenue
 
opportunities
 
that
 
validate
 
the
 
willingness
 
to
 
pay.
 
For
 
example,
 
perhaps
 
a
 
private
 
fertility
 
clinic
 
or
 
urgent
 
care
 
center
 
could
 
pay
 
a
 
pilot
 
fee
 
for
 
Clerky
.
 
Any
 
such
 
paying
 
pilot,
 
even
 
a
 
modest
 
amount,
 
is
 
proof
 
that
 
the
 
product
 
has
 
market
 
value.
 
Alternatively,
 
if
 
direct
 
NHS
 
contracts
 
are
 
slow,
 
consider
 
offering
 
Clerky
 
to
 
GP
 
practices
 
or
 
specialist
 
clinics
 
on
 
a
 
subscription
 
basis
 
(GPs
 
are
 
under
 
similar
 
documentation
 
pressure).
 
If
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
clinics
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
monthly
 
fee,
 
it
 
provides
 
a
 
revenue
 
story
 
to
 
tell
 
investors
 
(“We
 
have
 
paying
 
users
 
and
 
a
 
pipeline
 
of
 
X
 
more”).
 
 
●
 
Keep
 
Investors
 
Updated:
 
Once
 
you
 
start
 
engaging,
 
even
 
if
 
someone
 
isn’t
 
ready
 
to
 
invest
 
immediately,
 
put
 
them
 
on
 
an
 
email
 
update
 
list.
 
Send
 
brief
 
updates
 
every
 
quarter
 
on
 
your
 
progress
 
(new
 
pilot
 
started,
 
product
 
version
 
released,
 
key
 
hire
 
made,
 
etc.).
 
This
 
keeps
 
potential
 
investors
 
warm
 
and
 
shows
 
execution.
 
By
 
the
 
time
 
you
 
formally
 
pitch
 
for
 
seed
 
round,
 
they’ve
 
already
 
seen
 
you
 
hitting
 
milestones.
 
 
In
 
summary,
 
combine
 
grants
 
and
 
equity
 
funding
 
to
 
de-risk
 
the
 
venture.
 
UK
 
grants
 
can
 
effectively
 
subsidize
 
your
 
R&D
 
(non-dilutive),
 
and
 
the
 
SEIS/EIS
 
schemes
 
plus
 
strong
 
healthtech
 
investor
 
community
 
will
 
help
 
in
 
raising
 
equity.
 
Identify
 
health-focused
 
investors
 
(like
 
those
 
“making
 
the
 
biggest
 
impact
 
on
 
healthtech”
 
in
 
the
 
UK 
startupmag.co.uk
 
startupmag.co.uk
)
 
and
 
tailor
 
your
 
pitch
 
to
 
them.
 
By
 
showcasing
 
clinical
 
impact,
 
a
 
credible
 
prototype,
 
and
 
a
 
scalable
 
plan,
 
you’ll
 
maximize
 
your
 
chances
 
of
 
funding
 
success.
 
Marketing
 
Strategy
 
(Low-Cost
 
&
 
AI-Powered)
 
With
 
a
 
tight
 
budget
 
and
 
small
 
team,
 
your
 
marketing
 
must
 
be
 
cost-effective,
 
targeted,
 
and
 
leverage
 
automation/AI
 
wherever
 
possible.
 
The
 
initial
 
target
 
market
 
(NHS
 
clinicians
 
and
 
stakeholders)
 
requires
 
a
 
professional,
 
trust-building
 
approach
 
–
 
content
 
that
 
demonstrates
 
thought
 
leadership
 
and
 
addresses
 
their
 
pain
 
points.
 
At
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
modern
 
digital
 
marketing
 
hacks
 
and
 
AI
 
tools
 
to
 
amplify
 
your
 
reach
 
without
 
big
 
spend.
 
●
 
Branding
 
and
 
Online
 
Presence:
 
Ensure
 
Clerky
 
has
 
a
 
simple,
 
informative
 
website
.
 
Even
 
if
 
it’s
 
just
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
to
 
start,
 
clearly
 
communicate
 
what
 
Clerky
 
is
 
and
 
the
 
value
 
proposition
 
(e.g.
 
“AI
 
Assistant
 
for
 
Clinical
 
Consultations
 
–
 
saving
 
doctors
 
time
 
and
 
improving
 
patient
 
safety”).
 
Include
 
a
 
way
 
for
 
interested
 
users
 
or
 
partners
 
to
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
updates
 
or
 
request
 
a
 
demo
.
 
You
 
can
 
build
 
a
 
professional-looking
 
site
 
on
 
a
 
low
 
budget
 
using
 
tools
 
like
 
Webflow
 
or
 
WordPress
 
templates.
 
If
 
design
 
isn’t
 
your
 
forte,
 
use
 
Canva
 
(free
 
tier)
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
clean
 
logo
 
and
 
some
 
graphics
 
(Canva
 
has
 
templates
 
for
 
tech
 
logos
 
and
 
social

banners).
 
A
 
consistent
 
visual

(colors,

Content
 
Marketing:
 
Establish
 
Clerky
 
as
 
an
 
expert
 
voice
 
in
 
the
 
intersection
 
of
 
AI
 
and
 
clinical
 
practice.
 
Start
 
a
 
blog
 
on
 
your
 
site
 
or
 
publish
 
articles
 
on
 
LinkedIn
.
 
Possible
 
topics:
 
“The
 
Burden
 
of
 
Clinical
 
Documentation
 
–
 
Can
 
AI
 
Help?”,
 
“How
 
Real-Time
 
Decision
 
Support
 
Prevents
 
Medical
 
Errors”,
 
“A
 
Day
 
in
 
the
 
Life
 
of
 
a
 
Doctor
 
with
 
an
 
AI
 
Scribe”.
 
These
 
topics
 
educate
 
your
 
audience
 
(clinicians
 
and
 
health
 
IT
 
managers)
 
and
 
naturally
 
introduce
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
Clerky
.
 
AI
 
writing
 
assistants
 
can
 
help
 
generate
 
drafts
 
for
 
these
 
articles
 
–
 
for
 
example,
 
using
 
ChatGPT
 
or
 
Jasper
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
first
 
draft,
 
then
 
editing
 
it
 
with
 
your
 
medical
 
expertise
 
for
 
accuracy
 
and
 
tone.
 
This
 
saves
 
time
 
and
 
ensures
 
you
 
regularly
 
put
 
out
 
content
 
without
 
hiring
 
a
 
content
 
writer.
 
Over
 
time,
 
these
 
posts
 
improve
 
SEO
 
so
 
that
 
people
 
searching
 
for
 
solutions
 
to
 
clinical
 
documentation
 
or
 
guideline
 
compliance
 
find
 
you.

so
 
perhaps
 
you
 
as

–
 
follow
 
and
 
interact
 
with

Such
 
posts,
 
if
 
seen
 
by
 
the
 
right
 
people,
 
can
 
spark
 
interest.
 
Use
 
AI
 
tools
 
to

:
 
for
 
example,
 
Buffer
 
or
 
Hootsuite
 
(with
 
free
 
plans)
 
can
 
schedule
 
your
 
posts
 
in
 
advance.
 
You
 
could
 
even
 
use
 
an
 
AI
 
like
 
ChatGPT
 
to
 
suggest
 
variations
 
of
 
a

AI-Generated
 
Marketing
 
Content:
 
Embrace
 
AI
 
to
 
produce
 
marketing
 
collateral
 
quickly.
 
For
 
instance:
 
 
○
 
Use
 
Generative
 
AI
 
for
 
images
 
when
 
needed
 
(tools
 
like
 
DALL-E
 
or
 
Midjourney)
 
to
 
create
 
illustrative
 
images
 
for
 
blog
 
posts
 
(e.g.
 
a
 
doctor
 
interacting
 
with
 
a
 
futuristic
 
AI
 
assistant).
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
tools
 
have
 
free
 
or
 
cheap
 
options
 
for
 
a
 
limited
 
number
 
of
 
images.
 
 
○
 
Use
 
AI
 
copywriting
 
tools
 
(Copy.ai,
 
Jasper)
 
to
 
generate
 
catchy
 
taglines,
 
social
 
media
 
captions,
 
or
 
even
 
Google
 
ad
 
copy
 
(for
 
later
 
when
 
you
 
might
 
run
 
ads).
 
For
 
example,
 
these
 
tools
 
can
 
generate
 
multiple
 
versions
 
of
 
a
 
slogan
 
like
 
“Spend
 
more
 
time
 
with
 
patients,
 
let
 
AI
 
handle
 
the
 
paperwork”
 
–
 
you
 
can
 
refine
 
the
 
best
 
one.
 
 
○
 
Email
 
marketing
:
 
If
 
you
 
start
 
a
 
newsletter
 
to
 
update
 
interested
 
clinicians,
 
AI
 
can
 
help
 
draft
 
the
 
content.
 
Tools
 
like
 
HubSpot’s
 
content
 
assistant
 
or
 
simple
 
use
 
of
 
ChatGPT
 
can
 
turn
 
bullet
 
points
 
of
 
your
 
updates
 
into
 
a
 
nicely
 
worded
 
email.
 
 
●
 
Low-Budget
 
Outreach:
 
Direct
 
outreach
 
can
 
be
 
effective
 
in
 
healthcare,
 
where
 
personal
 
touch
 
matters.
 
Compile
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
contacts
 
(or
 
ask
 
for
 
introductions)
 
to
 
heads
 
of
 
departments,
 
clinicians
 
involved
 
in
 
NHS
 
innovation,
 
or
 
managers
 
at
 
target
 
hospitals.
 
Send
 
personalized
 
emails
 
introducing
 
Clerky
.
 
Here,
 
AI
 
can
 
also
 
assist:
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
GPT
 
to
 
draft
 
initial
 
email
 
templates
 
and
 
then
 
personalize
 
each
 
with
 
a
 
sentence
 
about
 
that
 
hospital
 
or
 
person.
 
Keep
 
the
 
tone
 
professional
 
and
 
focused
 
on
 
solving
 
their
 
problem
 
(e.g.
 
“I’m
 
a
 
fellow
 
NHS
 
clinician
 
who
 
got
 
tired
 
of
 
spending
 
evenings
 
on
 
paperwork
 
–
 
so
 
I
 
built
 
an
 
AI
 
tool
 
that
 
drafts
 
notes
 
and
 
ensures
 
guidelines
 
are
 
followed.
 
Would
 
[Hospital
 
Name]
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
a
 
free
 
pilot
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
benefits?…”).
 
Since
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
are
 
doing
 
this
 
part-time,
 
automate
 
follow-ups
 
with
 
tools
 
like
 
Mailshake
 
or
 
even
 
Gmail’s
 
schedule
 
send,
 
but
 
ensure
 
each
 
email
 
feels
 
individual.
 
 
●
 
PR
 
and
 
Media:
 
Getting
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
media
 
coverage
 
can
 
greatly
 
boost
 
credibility.
 
Identify
 
journalists
 
or
 
bloggers
 
who
 
cover
 
NHS
 
tech
 
or
 
healthcare
 
innovation
 
(e.g.
 
writers
 
at
 
Sifted
,
 
Digital
 
Health
 
News
,
 
or
 
Med-Tech
 
Innovation
).
 
Send
 
them
 
a
 
concise
 
pitch
 
about
 
Clerky
 
–
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
human
 
interest
 
angle
 
(“NHS
 
doctor
 
develops
 
AI
 
assistant
 
to
 
cut
 
doctors’
 
admin
 
workload,
 
inspired
 
by
 
his
 
own
 
frustrations
 
on
 
the
 
wards”).
 
Since
 
clinician
 
burnout
 
and
 
AI
 
are
 
hot
 
topics,
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
interest.
 
Also,
 
leverage
 
any
 
big
 
events:
 
for
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
apply
 
for
 
an
 
award
 
or
 
competition
 
(like
 
HSJ
 
Awards
 
or
 
AXA
 
Health
 
Tech
 
awards),
 
a
 
shortlisting
 
or
 
win
 
can
 
be
 
PR
 
fodder.
 
Local
 
news
 
might
 
also
 
be
 
interested
 
(e.g.
 
“Brighton
 
doctor
 
launches
 
AI
 
platform
 
for
 
hospitals”
 
could
 
feature
 
in
 
local
 
press,
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
then
 
share
 
on
 
social
 
media).
 
 
●
 
Conferences
 
and
 
Webinars:
 
With
 
minimal
 
budget,
 
you
 
can
 
still
 
increase
 
visibility
 
by
 
speaking
 
at
 
events.
 
Many
 
conferences
 
offer
 
startup
 
showcase
 
slots
 
or
 
discounts.
 
Look
 
at
 
events
 
like
 
NHS
 
Innovation
 
Expo
,
 
CogX
 
(for
 
AI)
,
 
or
 
specialty
 
conferences
 
(RCOG
 
conference)
 
–
 
perhaps
 
you
 
can
 
present
 
a
 
poster
 
or
 
a
 
talk
 
about
 
Clerky
’s
 
pilot
 
results.
 
If
 
travel
 
or
 
costs
 
are
 
an
 
issue,
 
consider
 
hosting
 
a
 
webinar
 
yourself.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
webinar
 
on
 
“How
 
AI
 
can
 
streamline
 
clinical
 
consultations
 
–
 
lessons
 
from
 
the
 
front
 
line”
 
where
 
you
 
demo
 
Clerky
.
 
Promote
 
it
 
through
 
LinkedIn
 
and
 
perhaps
 
relevant
 
forums
 
(like
 
the
 
Future
 
NHS
 
collaboration
 
platform,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
access).
 
Use
 
free
 
tools
 
like
 
Zoom
 
(up
 
to
 
100
 
participants
 
free)
 
or
 
YouTube
 
Live.
 
Webinars
 
help
 
gather
 
interested
 
folks;
 
you
 
can
 
then
 
follow
 
up
 
with
 
them
 
individually.
 
 
●
 
Community
 
Engagement:
 
Engage
 
in
 
communities
 
where
 
clinicians
 
or
 
healthtech
 
people
 
gather
 
online.
 
For
 
instance,
 
the
 
r/medicine
 
or
 
r/healthIT
 
subreddits
 
on
 
Reddit
 
might
 
be
 
places
 
to
 
softly
 
discuss
 
the
 
idea
 
(without
 
being
 
too
 
promotional
 
initially).
 
Or
 
join
 
the
 
NHS
 
Digital
 
Academy
 
Alumni
 
or
 
similar
 
LinkedIn
 
groups.
 
When
 
appropriate,
 
mention
 
Clerky
 
and
 
what
 
it
 
does.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
become
 
known
 
in
 
the
 
community
 
so
 
that
 
when
 
you
 
fully
 
launch,
 
people
 
have
 
heard
 
of
 
it.
 
You
 
could
 
also
 
answer
 
questions
 
on
 
forums
 
(Stack
 
Exchange,
 
Reddit)
 
about
 
medical
 
documentation
 
or
 
mention
 
your
 
project
 
in
 
relevant
 
discussions,
 
positioning
 
it
 
as
 
“something
 
I’m
 
working
 
on
 
that
 
might
 
help”.
 
 
●
 
Marketing
 
with
 
Data
:
 
As
 
you
 
collect
 
data
 
from
 
pilots
 
or
 
early
 
users,
 
turn
 
that
 
into
 
marketing
 
material.
 
For
 
example,
 
publish
 
an
 
infographic
 
“One
 
month
 
with
 
Clerky
 
in
 
[Hospital]:
 
120
 
hours
 
of
 
doctor
 
time
 
saved,
 
15%
 
increase
 
in
 
guideline
 
compliance.”
 
Visual
 
content
 
like
 
infographics
 
can
 
be
 
made
 
easily
 
on
 
Canva.
 
Share
 
these
 
on
 
social
 
media
 
and
 
your
 
site.
 
Data-driven
 
stories
 
are
 
persuasive
 
to
 
both
 
clinicians
 
and
 
administrators.
 
 
●
 
Leverage
 
AI
 
for
 
Marketing
 
Analytics:
 
As
 
you
 
increase
 
marketing
 
activities,
 
use
 
tools
 
(some
 
with
 
AI)
 
to
 
analyze
 
what’s
 
working.
 
For
 
example,
 
use
 
Google
 
Analytics
 
on
 
your
 
website
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
many
 
visitors
 
your
 
content
 
draws
 
and
 
from
 
where.
 
Many
 
modern
 
analytics
 
platforms
 
have
 
AI
 
insights
 
that
 
automatically
 
highlight
 
unusual
 
traffic
 
spikes
 
or
 
user
 
behavior.
 
For
 
social
 
media,
 
tools
 
like
 
Shield
 
AI
 
for
 
LinkedIn
 
can
 
give
 
advanced
 
metrics
 
(paid,
 
but
 
maybe
 
unnecessary
 
early
 
on).
 
If
 
you
 
send
 
emails,
 
track
 
open
 
and
 
click
 
rates
 
(Mailchimp’s
 
free
 
tier
 
can
 
manage
 
a
 
few
 
hundred
 
contacts
 
and
 
provides
 
such
 
analytics).
 
AI
 
can
 
also
 
help
 
in
 
A/B
 
testing
 
your
 
messaging
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
you
 
might
 
run
 
two
 
versions
 
of
 
a
 
LinkedIn
 
ad
 
copy
 
(if
 
you
 
experiment
 
with
 
small-budget
 
ads
 
later)
 
and
 
the
 
platforms
 
often
 
use
 
machine
 
learning
 
to
 
optimize
 
which
 
one
 
shows
 
more.
 
Even
 
without
 
ads,
 
you
 
can
 
manually
 
observe
 
engagement
 
and
 
ask
 
an
 
AI
 
tool
 
like
 
ChatGPT
 
to
 
suggest
 
why
 
one
 
post
 
might
 
have
 
performed
 
better
 
than
 
another,
 
to
 
refine
 
your
 
strategy.
 
 
●
 
Building
 
Trust:
 
In
 
healthcare,
 
credibility
 
is
 
key.
 
Use
 
your
 
content
 
and
 
social
 
proof
 
to
 
build
 
trust.
 
For
 
instance,
 
publish
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
testimonial
 
quotes
 
from
 
clinicians
 
who
 
try
 
Clerky
:
 
“As
 
an
 
Ob/Gyn,
 
Clerky
 
felt
 
like
 
having
 
a
 
personal
 
assistant
 
taking
 
notes
 
and
 
double-checking
 
guidance.
 
It
 
freed
 
me
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
my
 
patient.”
 
(You
 
can
 
initially
 
simulate
 
such
 
testimonials
 
from
 
friendly
 
colleagues
 
who
 
try
 
the
 
prototype).
 
When
 
you
 
have
 
pilot
 
results,
 
ask
 
the
 
department
 
head
 
or
 
a
 
senior
 
consultant
 
for
 
a
 
short
 
endorsement.
 
Display
 
these
 
on
 
the
 
website
 
and
 
marketing
 
materials.
 
Trust
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
built
 
by
 
association:
 
highlight
 
any
 
grants
 
you
 
win,
 
any
 
affiliations
 
(e.g.
 
“Supported
 
by
 
[Local
 
AHSN]”
 
or
 
“Member
 
of
 
DigitalHealth.London
 
Accelerator
 
2025
 
Cohort”
 
if
 
it
 
happens).
 
These
 
signals
 
reduce
 
perceived
 
risk
 
for
 
others
 
considering
 
your
 
product.
 
 
●
 
Budget
 
Considerations:
 
The
 
above
 
strategies
 
require
 
time
 
more
 
than
 
money.
 
Allocate
 
a
 
small
 
budget
 
for
 
essential
 
items:
 
perhaps
 
a
 
few
 
hundred
 
pounds
 
for
 
website
 
hosting
 
and
 
domain,
 
design
 
software
 
subscriptions,
 
and
 
a
 
one-off
 
cost
 
for
 
logo
 
design
 
if
 
needed.
 
You
 
might
 
allocate
 
a
 
tiny
 
experimental
 
ad
 
budget
 
(even
 
£50
 
on
 
LinkedIn
 
or
 
Google
 
Ads
 
targeted
 
at
 
NHS
 
managers)
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
that
 
generates
 
any
 
leads,
 
but
 
be
 
cautious
 
–
 
direct
 
advertising
 
to
 
NHS
 
is
 
often
 
less
 
effective
 
than
 
relationship-based
 
marketing.
 
One
 
high-ROI
 
area
 
could
 
be
 
targeted
 
LinkedIn
 
ads
 
to
 
job
 
titles
 
like
 
“Chief
 
Medical
 
Information
 
Officer”
 
or
 
“Digital
 
Programme
 
Lead”
 
in
 
NHS
 
trusts,
 
showcasing
 
a
 
case
 
study
 
and
 
inviting
 
them
 
to
 
a
 
demo.
 
You
 
can
 
set
 
a
 
very
 
tight
 
budget
 
and
 
duration
 
for
 
such
 
an
 
experiment
 
to
 
gauge
 
interest.
 
 
●
 
AI
 
“Marketing
 
Bots”:
 
The
 
concept
 
of
 
agentic
 
AI
 
can
 
extend
 
to
 
marketing
 
as
 
well.
 
You
 
could
 
deploy
 
a
 
chatbot
 
on
 
your
 
website
 
to
 
engage
 
visitors
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
an
 
AI-driven
 
chat
 
widget
 
that
 
can
 
answer
 
basic
 
questions
 
about
 
Clerky
.
 
Tools
 
like
 
Drift
 
or
 
Intercom
 
offer
 
chatbots,
 
or
 
you
 
could
 
integrate
 
an
 
open-source
 
GPT-based
 
chatbot
 
fine-tuned
 
on

Also
 
consider
 
using
 
an
 
AI-driven
 
tool
 
like
 
Albert.ai
 
for
 
digital
 
ads
 
if
 
in
 
future
 
you
 
run
 
larger
 
campaigns
 
–
 
platforms
 
like
 
Albert
 
“autonomously
 
manage
 
and
 
optimize
 
digital
 
advertising
 
campaigns”
 
across
 
Google/Facebook 
zoomd.com
,
 
which
 
could
 
save
 
you
 
from
 
hiring
 
a
 
marketing
 
agency.
 
For
 
now,
 
keep
 
note
 
of
 
these
 
advanced
 
options
 
as
 
you
 
scale
 
the
 
marketing
 
efforts.
 
 
Overall,
 
focus
 
your
 
marketing
 
on
 
educating
 
the
 
market
 
and
 
building
 
credibility
,
 
rather
 
than
 
overt
 
selling.
 
By
 
sharing
 
valuable
 
content
 
and
 
using
 
AI
 
to
 
amplify
 
your
 
productivity,
 
you
 
can
 
punch
 
above
 
your
 
weight
 
in
 
marketing.
 
Each
 
piece
 
of
 
content
 
or
 
social
 
outreach
 
should
 
subtly
 
reinforce
 
Clerky
’s
 
message:
 
that
 
you
 
understand
 
the
 
pain
 
of
 
clinicians
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
novel
 
solution.
 
This
 
way,
 
when
 
you
 
approach
 
hospitals
 
or
 
investors,
 
they
 
might
 
already
 
recognize
 
Clerky
 
or
 
have
 
seen
 
your
 
insights
 
online,
 
warming
 
them
 
up
 
to
 
your
 
vision.
 
Leveraging
 
Agentic
 
AI
 
for
 
Development
 
&
 
Operations
 
One
 
of
 
your
 
goals
 
is
 
to
 
use
 
agentic
 
AI
 
(autonomous
 
AI
 
agents)
 
to
 
accelerate
 
development
 
and
 
operations
.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
smart
 
strategy
 
to
 
keep
 
your
 
startup
 
lean
 
while
 
moving
 
fast.
 
By
 
harnessing
 
tools
 
like
 
Auto-GPT
 
and
 
others,
 
you
 
can
 
automate
 
tasks
 
in
 
coding,
 
testing,
 
marketing,
 
customer
 
support,
 
and
 
more.
 
Below
 
is
 
how
 
you
 
can
 
apply
 
AI
 
in
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
Clerky
’s
 
growth:
 
●
 
Product
 
Development
 
Acceleration:
 
Writing
 
code
 
and
 
developing
 
complex
 
AI
 
features
 
can
 
be
 
sped
 
up
 
with
 
AI
 
assistance.
 
For
 
example,
 
use
 
GitHub
 
Copilot
 
or
 
OpenAI’s
 
Codex
 
while
 
coding
 
–
 
these
 
tools
 
autocomplete
 
code
 
and
 
can
 
generate
 
boilerplate
 
functions,
 
saving
 
time.
 
For
 
larger
 
tasks,
 
experiment
 
with
 
Auto-GPT
 
(an
 
autonomous
 
AI
 
agent
 
that
 
can
 
iteratively
 
work
 
towards
 
a
 
goal
 
you
 
set).
 
You
 
can
 
assign
 
Auto-GPT
 
a
 
task
 
like
 
“Improve
 
the
 
prototype’s
 
UI
 
for
 
better
 
usability”
 
or
 
“Find
 
optimization
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
speech-to-text
 
pipeline”.
 
It
 
will
 
generate
 
ideas,
 
attempt
 
code,
 
and
 
even
 
debug
 
within
 
limits 
neilpatel.com
 
neilpatel.com
.
 
Keep
 
expectations
 
realistic
 
–
 
as
 
an
 
“AI
 
intern,”
 
it
 
might
 
produce
 
usable
 
snippets
 
or
 
suggestions
 
which
 
you
 
then
 
refine.
 
For
 
instance,
 
you
 
could
 
have
 
it
 
draft
 
a
 
piece
 
of
 
code
 
to
 
integrate
 
a
 
certain
 
API,
 
or
 
generate
 
test
 
cases
 
for
 
your
 
code.
 
According
 
to
 
a
 
guide
 
by
 
Neil
 
Patel,
 
“you
 
can
 
give
 
Auto-GPT
 
a
 
project…and
 
it
 
takes
 
the
 
necessary
 
steps
 
to
 
finish
 
the
 
task”
 
neilpatel.com
,
 
even
 
breaking
 
it
 
into
 
subtasks
 
autonomously.
 
Concretely,
 
you
 
might
 
instruct:
 
“Auto-GPT,
 
as
 
a
 
Python
 
developer
 
agent,
 
improve
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
our
 
medical
 
text
 
summarization
 
module.”
 
It
 
could
 
then
 
fetch
 
medical
 
text
 
processing
 
info,
 
suggest
 
code
 
changes,
 
and
 
attempt
 
to
 
implement
 
them.
 
Always
 
review
 
and
 
test
 
AI-produced
 
code
 
–
 
it
 
can
 
speed
 
you
 
up,
 
but
 
it’s
 
not
 
foolproof.
 
Also
 
consider
 
using
 
other
 
agent
 
frameworks
 
like
 
BabyAGI
 
or
 
LangChain
 
agents
 
for
 
specific
 
tasks
 
(LangChain
 
can
 
help
 
create
 
an
 
agent
 
that,
 
say,
 
reads
 
a
 
medical
 
guideline
 
and
 
tests
 
if
 
Clerky
’s
 
output
 
aligns
 
with
 
it).
 
 
●
 
Technical
 
Research
 
and
 
Problem-Solving:
 
When
 
you
 
hit
 
a
 
technical
 
challenge
 
(e.g.
 
determining
 
the
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
ensure
 
data
 
privacy
 
or
 
figuring
 
out
 
how
 
to
 
meet
 
a
 
specific
 
NHS
 
interoperability
 
standard),
 
unleash
 
an
 
AI
 
agent
 
to
 
research.
 
Instead
 
of
 
manually
 
scouring
 
documents,
 
an
 
agentic
 
AI
 
could
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
“find
 
UK
 
NHS
 
FHIR
 
API
 
specifications
 
and
 
summarize
 
integration
 
steps”.
 
It
 
can
 
crawl
 
the
 
web
 
(or
 
your
 
provided
 
documents)
 
and
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
distilled
 
answer
 
with
 
references
 
much
 
faster.
 
Reddit
 
users
 
have
 
reported
 
using
 
Auto-GPT
 
for
 
“automating
 
research
 
tasks”
,
 
finding
 
it
 
“super
 
helpful
 
for
 
streamlining
 
repetitive
 
work.”
 
reddit.com
 
This
 
means
 
while
 
you’re
 
busy
 
with,
 
say,
 
a
 
meeting,
 
an
 
AI
 
agent
 
could
 
be
 
compiling
 
a
 
report
 
on
 
“all
 
Class
 
IIa
 
medical
 
device
 
requirements
 
relevant
 
to
 
Clerky”
 
or
 
comparing
 
various
 
speech-to-text
 
libraries
 
performance.
 
 
●
 
Documentation
 
and
 
Knowledge
 
Base:
 
Keeping
 
documentation
 
up-to-date
 
is
 
often
 
tedious.
 
Use
 
AI
 
to
 
help
 
write
 
developer
 
docs,
 
user
 
manuals,
 
and
 
compliance
 
documentation
.
 
For
 
example,
 
after
 
coding
 
a
 
new
 
feature,
 
you
 
can
 
prompt
 
an
 
AI:
 
“Explain
 
in
 
simple
 
terms
 
how
 
the
 
new
 
feature
 
X
 
works
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
it.”
 
This
 
can
 
produce
 
a
 
draft
 
user
 
guide
 
section.
 
You
 
can
 
also
 
maintain
 
an
 
internal
 
knowledge
 
base
 
(like
 
Notion
 
or
 
Confluence
 
pages)
 
and
 
have
 
an
 
AI
 
agent
 
periodically
 
summarize
 
recent
 
changes
 
from
 
your
 
commit
 
logs
 
or
 
meeting
 
notes
 
into
 
that
 
knowledge
 
base.
 
This
 
ensures
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
bring
 
on
 
new
 
team
 
members
 
or
 
contractors,
 
they
 
can
 
get
 
up
 
to
 
speed
 
quickly
 
by
 
reading
 
AI-curated
 
documentation.
 
Additionally,
 
consider
 
using
 
Auto-GPT
 
to
 
generate
 
documentation
:
 
one
 
of
 
its
 
use
 
cases
 
is
 
“report
 
generation”
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
break
 
down
 
tasks
 
like
 
documenting
 
an
 
API
 
into
 
sub-tasks
 
and
 
execute
 
them 
medium.com
.
 
 
●
 
Customer
 
Support
 
(Automated):
 
As
 
you
 
start
 
having
 
users
 
(clinicians
 
using
 
Clerky
 
in
 
pilots
 
or
 
later,
 
potentially
 
on
 
a
 
wider
 
scale),
 
provide
 
support
 
without
 
needing
 
a
 
24/7
 
team
 
by
 
using
 
AI
 
chatbots.
 
You
 
can
 
fine-tune
 
a
 
language
 
model
 
on
 
an
 
FAQ
 
about
 
Clerky
 
and
 
deploy
 
it
 
on
 
your
 
site
 
or
 
within
 
the
 
app
 
to
 
answer
 
questions
 
like
 
“How
 
do
 
I
 
edit
 
a
 
note
 
the
 
AI
 
drafted?”
 
or
 
“Is
 
patient
 
data
 
secure?”.
 
Tools
 
like
 
Dialogflow
 
or
 
IBM
 
Watson
 
Assistant
 
can
 
create
 
a
 
chatbot
 
that
 
handles
 
common
 
queries.
 
There
 
are
 
also
 
newer
 
solutions
 
like
 
Intercom’s
 
Fin
 
AI
 
or
 
Zendesk
 
Answer
 
Bot
 
that
 
plug
 
into
 
your
 
support
 
system
 
and
 
automatically
 
draft
 
answers
 
from
 
your
 
knowledge
 
base.
 
Ensure
 
the
 
AI’s
 
answers
 
are
 
accurate
 
(test
 
it
 
thoroughly
 
and
 
update
 
the
 
training
 
data
 
frequently).
 
This
 
way,
 
if
 
a
 
clinician
 
user
 
asks
 
a
 
question
 
at
 
10pm,
 
the
 
bot
 
can
 
respond
 
instantly.
 
If
 
it
 
cannot
 
handle
 
an
 
issue,
 
it
 
can
 
collect
 
the
 
info
 
and
 
assure
 
them
 
of
 
a
 
follow-up,
 
which
 
you
 
or
 
your
 
team
 
handle
 
the
 
next
 
day.
 
Over
 
time,
 
as
 
you
 
log
 
more
 
support
 
questions,
 
train
 
the
 
AI
 
better
 
on
 
those
 
answers.
 
Neil
 
Patel
 
notes
 
that
 
Auto-GPT
 
can
 
“manage
 
customer
 
support
 
responses”
 
autonomously 
neilpatel.com
 
–
 
this
 
implies
 
you
 
could
 
have
 
an
 
agent
 
monitor
 
incoming
 
support
 
emails
 
or
 
chats
 
and
 
draft
 
replies
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
approve.
 
As
 
volume
 
grows,
 
that
 
draft-and-approve
 
flow
 
could
 
save
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
time.
 
 
●
 
Marketing
 
&
 
Sales
 
Automation:
 
We
 
touched
 
on
 
AI
 
in
 
marketing
 
content;
 
here
 
let’s
 
consider
 
an
 
AI
 
marketing
 
agent
.
 
For
 
example,
 
use
 
Auto-GPT
 
for
 
marketing
 
tasks
 
like:
 
“research
 
the
 
top
 
50
 
NHS
 
trust
 
contacts
 
for
 
digital
 
innovation
 
and
 
provide
 
a
 
spreadsheet”
 
–
 
an
 
agent
 
might
 
crawl
 
public
 
NHS
 
directories
 
to
 
find
 
names/emails
 
of
 
CCIOs
 
or
 
innovation
 
leads.
 
Another
 
task:
 
“draft
 
a
 
personalized
 
LinkedIn
 
message
 
for
 
each
 
of
 
these
 
50
 
contacts
 
highlighting
 
how
 
Clerky
 
addresses
 
their
 
trust’s
 
needs.”
 
The
 
AI
 
could
 
iterate
 
over
 
a
 
list
 
and
 
produce
 
tailored
 
blurbs
 
(though
 
you’d
 
still
 
check
 
them).
 
In
 
essence,
 
you
 
can
 
chain
 
tasks:
 
research
 
+
 
create
 
outreach
 
content
 
+
 
even
 
schedule
 
it
 
(some
 
auto-agents
 
could
 
interface
 
with
 
email
 
or
 
LinkedIn
 
via
 
APIs
 
if
 
set
 
up
 
securely).
 
There
 
are
 
also
 
AI
 
services
 
like
 
Reply.io
 
or
 
Apollo.ai
 
that
 
help
 
automate
 
sales
 
outreach
 
with
 
AI-crafted
 
emails.
 
Just
 
be
 
cautious
 
to
 
keep
 
messages
 
human-like
 
and
 
avoid
 
spammy
 
feel.
 
 
●
 
Internal
 
Operations
 
and
 
Planning:
 
Use
 
AI
 
as
 
a
 
virtual
 
operations
 
assistant
.
 
Administrative
 
tasks
 
like
 
preparing
 
meeting
 
agendas
 
or
 
summarizing
 
meeting
 
notes
 
can
 
be
 
offloaded.
 
For
 
instance,
 
record
 
your
 
team
 
meetings
 
(even
 
if
 
it’s
 
just
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife
 
planning)
 
and
 
use
 
an
 
AI
 
service
 
(like
 
Otter.ai
 
or
 
Zoom’s
 
built-in
 
AI)
 
to
 
transcribe
 
and
 
summarize
 
action
 
items.
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
project
 
plan
 
or
 
timeline
 
(like
 
parts
 
of
 
this
 
document),
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
ChatGPT
 
or
 
an
 
Auto-GPT
 
agent
 
to
 
draft
 
a
 
project
 
plan
 
given
 
certain
 
milestones
 
–
 
it
 
will
 
outline
 
tasks
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
then
 
adjust.
 
For
 
HR
 
things
 
like
 
drafting
 
contractor
 
agreements
 
or
 
workplace
 
policies,
 
you
 
can
 
feed
 
an
 
AI
 
a
 
template
 
and
 
ask
 
it
 
to
 
customize
 
or
 
check
 
consistency.
 
Basically,
 
treat
 
AI
 
as
 
a
 
junior
 
admin
 
employee:
 
scheduling,
 
drafting
 
routine
 
communications,
 
creating
 
Excel
 
reports
 
(you
 
can
 
even
 
ask
 
AI
 
to
 
analyze
 
small
 
datasets
 
or
 
make
 
charts).
 
Some
 
entrepreneurs
 
use
 
AI
 
assistants
 
for
 
email
 
management:
 
tools
 
that
 
prioritize
 
your
 
inbox
 
or
 
draft
 
responses
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
past
 
writing
 
style.
 
 
●
 
Auto-GPT
 
and
 
Agents
 
–
 
Practical
 
Caution:
 
The
 
promise
 
of
 
Auto-GPT
 
is
 
huge
 
–
 
“a
 
cutting-edge
 
AI
 
tool
 
that
 
can
 
revolutionize
 
day-to-day
 
tasks
 
by
 
automating
 
them”
 
neilpatel.com
.
 
For
 
example,
 
you
 
could
 
tell
 
Auto-GPT:
 
“You
 
are
 
an
 
agent
 
helping
 
improve
 
my
 
startup’s
 
online
 
presence.
 
Goal:
 
increase
 
website
 
traffic
 
by
 
50%
 
in
 
3
 
months.
 
Steps:
 
perform
 
SEO
 
audit,
 
create
 
content
 
plan,
 
execute
 
it.”
 
It
 
might
 
then
 
perform
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
actions
 
like
 
analyzing
 
your
 
site,
 
searching
 
for
 
keywords,
 
suggesting
 
content
 
topics
 
and
 
even
 
writing
 
some
 
content.
 
However,
 
in
 
practice,
 
these
 
agents
 
are
 
still
 
early-stage.
 
They
 
sometimes
 
get
 
stuck
 
or
 
produce
 
errors
 
(as
 
Neil
 
Patel
 
notes,
 
“Auto-GPT
 
isn’t
 
perfect…
 
sometimes
 
generates
 
inaccurate
 
responses”
 
neilpatel.com
 
and
 
can
 
incur
 
cost
 
if
 
running
 
many
 
queries 
neilpatel.com
).
 
So
 
use
 
them
 
with
 
supervision
 
–
 
treat
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
collaborator
 
that
 
still
 
needs
 
oversight.
 
Start
 
with
 
small
 
experiments:
 
one
 
specific
 
task
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
and
 
watch
 
the
 
outputs.
 
Over
 
time,
 
you’ll
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
prompt
 
these
 
agents
 
effectively
 
(prompt
 
engineering)
 
to
 
get
 
better
 
results.
 
Also,
 
always
 
guard
 
sensitive
 
data
 
–
 
do
 
not
 
accidentally
 
feed
 
actual
 
patient
 
data
 
or
 
proprietary
 
code
 
into
 
external
 
AI
 
services
 
without
 
ensuring
 
privacy
 
(if
 
needed,
 
self-hosted
 
models
 
might
 
be
 
an
 
option
 
for
 
sensitive
 
tasks).

Continuous
 
Learning:
 
The
 
AI
 
landscape
 
evolves
 
rapidly.
 
Dedicate
 
time
 
each
 
month
 
to
 
scan
 
for
 
new
 
AI
 
tools
 
that
 
could
 
benefit
 
you.
 
For
 
example,
 
recently
 
Auto-GPT
 
might
 
get
 
improved
 
or
 
new
 
specialized
 
agents
 
may
 
appear
 
for
 
coding
 
or
 
design.
 
Being
 
an
 
early
 
adopter
 
of
 
these
 
can
 
give
 
you
 
an
 
edge
 
(and
 
fits
 
Clerky
’s
 
innovative
 
ethos).
 
Join
 
communities
 
like
 
the
 
AutoGPT
 
Discord
 
or
 
follow
 
AI
 
blogs
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
others
 
are
 
applying
 
agents.
 
Often,
 
entrepreneurs
 
share
 
automation
 
recipes
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
adopt.
 
 
By
 
integrating
 
these
 
AI
 
and
 
agentic
 
approaches,
 
you
 
essentially
 
augment
 
your
 
one/two-person
 
team
 
with
 
a
 
squad
 
of
 
digital
 
assistants.
 
This
 
will
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
accomplish
 
tasks
 
in
 
parallel
 
that
 
normally
 
would
 
require
 
a
 
larger
 
team
 
–
 
whether
 
it's
 
writing
 
code,
 
conducting
 
research,
 
or
 
engaging
 
users.
 
It
 
aligns
 
with
 
your
 
vision
 
of
 
leveraging
 
cutting-edge
 
AI
 
not
 
just
 
in
 
your
 
product
 
but
 
in
 
how
 
you
 
build
 
the
 
company.
 
As
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
validate
 
the
 
outputs,
 
this
 
strategy
 
will
 
speed
 
up
 
development,
 
reduce
 
costs,
 
and
 
let
 
you
 
focus
 
human
 
effort
 
on
 
the
 
highest-level
 
decisions
 
and
 
creative
 
aspects
 
that
 
truly
 
need
 
your
 
expertise.
 
Timeline
 
and
 
Milestones
 
Below
 
is
 
a
 
high-level
 
timeline
 
outlining
 
the
 
key
 
phases
 
and
 
milestones
 
for
 
launching
 
Clerky
.
 
This
 
assumes
 
you
 
continue
 
working
 
part-time
 
initially,
 
with
 
ramp-up
 
after
 
securing
 
funding.
 
The
 
timeline
 
is
 
itemized
 
in
 
phases
 
with
 
target
 
outcomes:
 
●
 
Months

○
 
Incorporation
 
&
 
Admin:
 
Register
 
the
 
company
 
(Complete
 
by

1).
 
Set
 
up
 
the
 
business
 
bank
 
account
 
and
 
essential
 
tools
 
(accounting
 
software,
 
website
 
domain)
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
few
 
weeks.
 
 
○
 
Legal
 
Basics:
 
Finalize
 
the
 
founders’
 
agreement
 
between
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
wife.
 
Draft
 
standard
 
NDA
 
and
 
contractor
 
templates.
 
 
○
 
Prototype
 
Enhancement:
 
In
 
parallel,
 
spend
 
these
 
weeks
 
improving
 
the
 
prototype’s
 
core
 
functionality
 
with
 
any
 
“quick
 
wins.”
 
Incorporate
 
initial
 
feedback
 
from
 
friendly
 
colleagues
 
who
 
try
 
it.
 
For
 
example,
 
ensure
 
the
 
speech
 
recognition
 
and
 
note
 
generation
 
are
 
working
 
reliably
 
for
 
a
 
demo
 
scenario.
 
 
○
 
Initial
 
Outreach:
 
Quietly
 
start
 
conversations
 
with
 
potential
 
pilot
 
sites.
 
By
 
end
 
of
 
Month
 
2,
 
aim
 
to
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
verbal
 
interest
 
from
 
an
 
NHS
 
department
 
(e.g.
 
your
 
own
 
hospital’s
 
O&G
 
department)
 
to
 
pilot
 
Clerky
 
once
 
it’s
 
ready.
 
 
○
 
Grant
 
Applications:
 
Identify
 
relevant
 
grant
 
opportunities
 
(AI
 
Award,
 
SBRI
 
etc.)
 
and
 
mark
 
their
 
deadlines.
 
Begin
 
drafting
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
grant
 
application
 
if
 
the
 
timing
 
aligns
 
(some
 
calls
 
might
 
be
 
quarterly
 
or
 
annual).
 
For
 
instance,
 
if
 
an
 
SBRI
 
competition
 
is
 
due
 
Month
 
3,
 
you
 
should
 
start
 
the

Team
 
Augmentation:
 
If
 
an
 
angel/SEIS
 
round
 
is
 
in
 
progress,
 
close
 
a
 
small
 
pre-seed
 
funding
 
(perhaps
 
from
 
savings
 
or
 
an
 
angel)
 
by
 
Month

to
 
allow
 
hiring
 
a
 
freelance
 
developer
 
or
 
AI
 
engineer.
 
Onboard
 
them
 
with
 
contractor
 
agreements
 
(or
 
if
 
no
 
hires
 
yet,
 
dedicate
 
your
 
evenings
 
to
 
coding
 
sprints).
 
 
○
 
Minimum
 
Viable
 
Product
 
(MVP):
 
Develop
 
Clerky
 
to
 
a
 
pilot-ready
 
state.
 
This
 
means
 
it’s
 
usable
 
end-to-end
 
by
 
a
 
clinician:
 
real-time
 
transcription,
 
guideline
 
lookup
 
and
 
prompt,
 
note
 
generation,
 
and
 
a
 
simple
 
user
 
interface.
 
By
 
Month
 
4,
 
target
 
an
 
enhanced
 
prototype
 
(MVP)
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
start
 
testing
 
in
 
a
 
live
 
environment file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
Also,
 
ensure
 
basic
 
security
 
(data
 
encryption,
 
user
 
login)
 
is
 
in
 
place
 
for
 
pilot.
 
 
○
 
Internal
 
Testing:
 
Conduct
 
a
 
small
 
alpha
 
test
 
with
 
2-3
 
clinician
 
colleagues
 
(perhaps
 
in
 
a
 
non-live
 
setting:
 
have
 
them
 
use
 
Clerky
 
on
 
some
 
mock
 
patient
 
cases
 
or
 
parallel
 
to
 
real
 
consults,
 
not
 
as
 
official
 
record
 
yet).
 
Gather
 
their
 
feedback
 
systematically.
 
 
○
 
Pilot
 
Logistics:
 
With
 
pilot
 
site
 
confirmed,
 
work
 
on
 
paperwork
 
needed:
 
Data
 
processing
 
agreements
 
with
 
the
 
hospital,
 
ethics
 
approval
 
if
 
needed
 
(or
 
confirmation
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
service
 
trial
 
it’s
 
okay),
 
and
 
integration
 
setup
 
(e.g.
 
VPN
 
access
 
or
 
dummy
 
EHR
 
environment).
 
Aim
 
to
 
have
 
all
 
approvals
 
and
 
IT
 
setup
 
ready
 
by
 
end
 
of
 
Month
 
5.
 
 
○
 
Grant/Accelerator
 
Outcomes:
 
Around
 
this
 
time,
 
you
 
might
 
hear
 
back
 
from
 
any
 
quick-turn
 
grant
 
applications.
 
Hopefully,
 
secure
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
small
 
grant
 
(e.g.
 
£50k
 
from
 
an
 
innovation
 
fund)
 
–
 
if
 
so,
 
factor
 
this
 
into
 
hiring
 
plans.
 
If
 
you
 
applied
 
to
 
an
 
accelerator
 
(like
 
DigitalHealth.London),
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
acceptance
 
around
 
Month
 
4-5
 
if
 
the
 
cycle
 
fits.

Go-Live:
 
Begin
 
the
 
pilot
 
in
 
the
 
NHS
 
maternity
 
triage
 
(or
 
chosen
 
unit)
.
 
For
 
the
 
first
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks,
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
hands-on
 
approach:
 
one
 
of
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
present
 
or
 
readily
 
available
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
clinicians
 
using
 
Clerky
.
 
This
 
is
 
effectively
 
a
 
beta
 
in
 
production.
 
 
○
 
Monitoring
 
&
 
Support:
 
Set
 
up
 
daily
 
or
 
weekly
 
check-ins
 
with
 
pilot
 
users
 
to
 
gather
 
feedback
 
and
 
issues.
 
Use
 
your
 
AI
 
support
 
chatbot
 
on
 
the
 
side
 
to
 
capture
 
any
 
real-time
 
questions
 
they
 
have.
 
Ensure
 
any
 
critical
 
bugs
 
or
 
needed
 
tweaks
 
are
 
addressed
 
rapidly
 
(same-day
 
fixes
 
if
 
possible)
 
to
 
keep
 
users
 
engaged.
 
 
○
 
Data
 
Collection:
 
Start
 
collecting
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
pilot.
 
By
 
end
 
of
 
Month
 
6,
 
aim
 
to
 
have
 
initial
 
stats
 
(even
 
if
 
small
 
sample)
 
like
 
“X
 
number
 
of
 
consultations
 
processed
 
by
 
Clerky
,
 
Y
 
hours
 
saved”.
 
Also
 
track
 
any
 
errors
 
or
 
near-misses
 
averted.
 
 
○
 
Visibility:
 
Publicize
 
the
 
pilot
 
kickoff
 
in
 
a
 
modest
 
way
 
–
 
maybe
 
a
 
LinkedIn
 
post
 
or
 
a
 
local
 
news
 
blurb.
 
This
 
sets
 
the
 
stage
 
that
 
Clerky
 
is
 
moving
 
to
 
real-world
 
testing.
 
 
●
 
Months
 
7-9:
 
Iterate
 
and
 
Validate
 
 
○
 
Pilot
 
Ongoing:
 
Continue
 
the
 
pilot
 
for
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
~3
 
months
 
(typical
 
Phase
 
1
 
pilot
 
duration).
 
Throughout,
 
iterate
 
on
 
Clerky
:
 
release
 
improvements
 
or
 
new
 
versions
 
perhaps
 
every
 
2-4
 
weeks
 
based
 
on
 
feedback
 
(agile
 
approach).
 
This
 
might
 
correspond
 
to
 
Phase
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
in
 
your
 
strategy
 
(enhancing
 
prototype,
 
then
 
developing
 
needed
 
infrastructure
 
as
 
you
 
go) file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl.
 
For
 
example,
 
by
 
Month
 
8
 
you
 
might
 
implement
 
an
 
EHR
 
export
 
function
 
that
 
pilot
 
users
 
requested.
 
 
○
 
Analysis:
 
By
 
Month
 
9,
 
analyze
 
the
 
pilot
 
results
 
in
 
depth.
 
Compile
 
a
 
pilot
 
report
 
with
 
outcomes,
 
user
 
testimonials,
 
and
 
case
 
studies
 
(this
 
will
 
be
 
useful
 
for
 
both
 
internal
 
learning
 
and
 
external
 
pitching).
 
Ideally,
 
have
 
concrete
 
evidence
 
of
 
Clerky
’s
 
benefits
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
phase.
 
 
○
 
Regulatory
 
Steps:
 
If
 
not
 
already,
 
around
 
Month
 
7
 
start
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
regulatory
 
compliance
 
(engage
 
a
 
consultant
 
or
 
begin
 
documentation
 
for
 
UKCA
 
marking).
 
Also,
 
if
 
planning
 
to
 
raise
 
a
 
seed
 
round
 
soon,
 
consider
 
initiating
 
SEIS/EIS
 
advance
 
assurance
 
now
 
(if
 
not
 
done)
 
so
 
it’s
 
ready
 
to
 
show
 
investors.
 
 
○
 
Community
 
Building:
 
At
 
this
 
stage,
 
consider
 
creating
 
a
 
small
 
advisory
 
board
 
or
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
network
 
of
 
supporter
 
clinicians.
 
Perhaps
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
pilot
 
users
 
or
 
your
 
mentors
 
can
 
formally
 
agree
 
to
 
be
 
advisors
 
–
 
this
 
adds
 
credibility
 
and
 
they
 
can
 
help
 
champion
 
Clerky
 
elsewhere.

If
 
you
 
win
 
any,
 
incorporate
 
that
 
–
 
if
 
not,
 
plan
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
cycle
 
or
 
alternate
 
funding
 
accordingly.
 
Possibly
 
apply
 
for
 
the

qualifies
 
you.
 
 
○
 
Expansion
 
Planning:
 
Identify
 
the
 
next
 
target
 
sites
 
or
 
markets.
 
For
 
example,
 
have
 
conversations
 
with
 
1-2
 
other
 
NHS
 
trusts
 
about
 
starting
 
a
 
pilot
 
in
 
their
 
departments
 
(perhaps
 
emergency
 
medicine
 
in
 
one
 
trust,
 
or
 
the
 
maternity
 
unit
 
of
 
another
 
region
 
to
 
replicate
 
results).
 
These
 
conversations,
 
even
 
if
 
tentative,
 
are
 
good
 
to
 
mention
 
to
 
investors
 
(“We
 
have
 
pipeline
 
opportunities
 
with
 
Trust
 
A
 
and
 
B
 
pending
 
results”).
 
Also
 
line
 
up
 
a
 
plan
 
for
 
a
 
fee-based
 
trial
 
or
 
early
 
adopter
 
sale
 
–
 
e.g.,
 
a
 
private
 
hospital
 
or
 
an
 
NHS
 
site
 
ready
 
to
 
move
 
from
 
pilot
 
to
 
paid
 
usage
 
(maybe
 
starting
 
Month
 
12
 
or
 
next
 
year).
 
Having
 
even
 
a
 
small
 
revenue
 
contract
 
in
 
pipeline
 
by
 
this
 
time
 
is
 
a
 
huge
 
validation.

Month
 
12
 
(one
 
year
 
in),
 
aim
 
to
 
close
 
a
 
seed
 
round
 
(could
 
be
 
£500k
 
to
 
£1.5M
 
depending
 
on
 
ambition
 
and
 
investor
 
appetite).
 
This
 
assumes
 
your
 
outreach
 
in
 
prior
 
months
 
went
 
well.
 
The
 
funding
 
will
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
go
 
full-time
 
on
 
Clerky
 
(you
 
and
 
your
 
wife)
 
and
 
hire
 
a
 
core
 
team
 
(developers,
 
maybe
 
a
 
machine
 
learning
 
specialist,
 
and
 
a
 
business
 
development
 
person).
 
If
 
the
 
raise
 
is
 
still
 
ongoing,
 
try
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
secure
 
bridge
 
funding
 
to
 
keep
 
momentum.

Regulatory
 
Submission:
 
Initiate
 
or
 
submit
 
your
 
medical
 
device
 
approval
 
application
 
around
 
this
 
time
 
if
 
aiming
 
for
 
UKCA
 
or
 
an
 
FDA
 
510(k)
 
(depending
 
on
 
strategy).
 
Class
 
IIa
 
software
 
might
 
take
 
a
 
few
 
months
 
for
 
approval,
 
so
 
starting
 
by
 
Month
 
12
 
means
 
you
 
could
 
have
 
a
 
certified
 
product
 
by
 
Month
 
18
 
or
 
so.
 
If
 
you
 
got
 
an
 
“Innovation
 
Passport”
 
or
 
sandbox
 
from
 
MHRA
 
due
 
to
 
being
 
novel
 
AI,
 
leverage
 
that
 
to
 
expedite.

Marketing
 
Push:
 
With
 
new
 
funding,
 
month
 
12
 
is
 
also
 
when
 
you
 
can
 
ramp
 
up
 
marketing.
 
Perhaps
 
attend
 
a
 
major
 
conference
 
with
 
a
 
booth,
 
revamp
 
the
 
website,
 
and
 
issue
 
a
 
press
 
release
 
about
 
the
 
funding
 
and
 
pilot
 
success.
 
This
 
will
 
set
 
the
 
stage
 
for
 
broader
 
market
 
launch.

by
 
early
 
in
 
this

Get

using
 
the
 
AI-curated

Product
 
V2:
 
Build
 
out
 
the
 
robust,
 
scalable
 
version
 
of
 
Clerky
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
team
 
(addressing
 
any
 
architecture
 
improvements,
 
adding
 
features
 
like
 
multi-specialty
 
support).
 
Aim
 
for
 
a
 
Version
 
2
 
launch
 
around
 
Month
 
18
 
that
 
is
 
market-ready
 
for
 
multiple
 
deployments
 
(this
 
aligns
 
with
 
“Phase
 
3:
 
Launch
 
a
 
fully
 
operational
 
platform
 
with
 
pilot
 
sites”
 
in
 
your
 
business
 
case file-2cw9tcjlojpxy6vu9chyzl).
 
Essentially,
 
move
 
from
 
pilot
 
prototype
 
to
 
a
 
polished
 
platform.
 
 
○
 
Multi-site
 
Deployments:
 
Turn
 
the
 
initial
 
pilot
 
site
 
into
 
a
 
paying
 
customer
 
if
 
possible
 
(convert
 
the
 
pilot
 
into
 
a
 
contract).
 
Simultaneously
 
deploy
 
Clerky
 
in
 
at
 
least
 
2-3
 
new
 
sites
 
(some
 
could
 
be
 
paid,
 
some
 
might
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
grant-funded
 
trial).
 
These
 
are
 
your
 
early
 
adopters
.
 
Provide
 
excellent
 
support
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
document
 
new
 
use
 
cases
 
(like
 
how
 
it
 
works
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
specialty
 
if
 
applicable).

Broader
 
Marketing
 
&
 
Sales:
 
Now
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
proven
 
product
 
and
 
some
 
funding
 
for
 
runway,
 
do
 
a
 
concerted
 
push
 
into
 
the
 
NHS
 
market.
 
This
 
may
 
involve
 
responding
 
to
 
NHS
 
tenders/frameworks
 
(get
 
onto
 
procurement
 
frameworks
 
like
 
G-Cloud
 
or
 
NHS
 
Supply
 
Chain
 
if
 
relevant
 
for
 
software),
 
hosting
 
webinars
 
aimed
 
at
 
NHS
 
leadership,
 
and
 
leveraging
 
any
 
NHS
 
connections
 
from
 
your
 
investors
 
or
 
advisors.
 
Also,
 
begin
 
exploring
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
private
 
sector
 
or
 
abroad
 
(for
 
instance,
 
a
 
demo
 
with
 
a
 
US
 
hospital
 
chain’s
 
innovation
 
team)
 
as
 
a
 
precursor
 
to
 
international
 
expansion.

○
 
Outcomes
 
Data:
 
By
 
around
 
Month
 
24
 
(2
 
years
 
in),
 
you
 
should
 
have
 
solid
 
data
 
on
 
Clerky
’s
 
performance
 
from
 
multiple
 
sites.
 
This
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
a
 
white
 
paper
 
or
 
publication
 
in
 
a
 
medical
 
journal
 
about
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
Clerky
.
 
Publishing
 
results
 
will
 
further
 
establish
 
credibility.
 
 
○
 
Next
 
Funding
 
or
 
Growth:
 
If
 
revenue
 
is
 
growing,
 
you
 
might
 
not
 
need
 
immediate
 
further
 
funding.
 
Otherwise,
 
plan
 
for
 
a
 
Series
 
A
 
raise
 
around
 
18-24
 
months
 
if
 
scaling
 
rapidly
 
(especially
 
for
 
international
 
expansion).
 
Use
 
the
 
achievements
 
(regulatory
 
approval,
 
X
 
number
 
of
 
hospitals
 
using
 
Clerky
,
 
proven
 
ROI
 
metrics)
 
to
 
justify
 
this
 
larger
 
raise.

Agentic
 
AI
 
Integration:
 
By
 
this
 
time,
 
ideally
 
your
 
use
 
of
 
agentic
 
AI
 
internally
 
has
 
given
 
you
 
a
 
competitive
 
edge
 
(faster
 
dev
 
cycles,
 
lower
 
burn).
 
Continue
 
to
 
integrate
 
AI
 
deeply
 
in
 
both
 
product
 
and
 
operations
 
–
 
making
 
it
 
a
 
selling
 
point
 
that
 
Clerky
 
itself
 
is
 
built
 
by
 
leveraging
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
AI
 
efficiencies
 
it
 
offers
 
to
 
clients
 
(a
 
nice
 
narrative
 
for
 
press
 
and
 
perhaps
 
for
 
an
 
eventual
 
acquisition
 
by
 
a
 
tech
 
giant).
 
 
Each
 
of
 
these
 
phases
 
builds
 
on
 
the
 
previous,
 
de-risking
 
the
 
venture
 
step
 
by
 
step:
 
first
 
establishing
 
the
 
company
 
and
 
prototype,
 
then
 
validating
 
in
 
the
 
field,
 
then
 
scaling
 
up
 
with
 
investment.
 
The
 
timeline
 
should
 
remain
 
flexible
 
–
 
unexpected
 
challenges
 
or
 
opportunities
 
will
 
arise
 
(for
 
example,
 
a
 
pandemic
 
wave
 
or
 
a
 
sudden
 
NHS
 
initiative
 
might
 
shift
 
schedules),
 
but
 
this
 
roadmap
 
provides
 
a
 
structured
 
path.
 
By
 
following
 
this
 
plan,
 
at
 
the
 
1-2
 
year
 
mark,
 
Clerky
 
should
 
transition
 
from
 
a
 
side
 
project
 
into
 
a
 
fully-fledged
 
startup
 
with
 
real-world
 
impact,
 
a
 
growing
 
user
 
base,
 
and
 
a
 
trajectory
 
for
 
nationwide
 
adoption
 
and
 
beyond.
