        <ul>
            <li>Any creatinine > 90 µmol/l in pregnancy should be considered diagnostic of AKI.</li>
            <li>AKI complicates 1.4% of UK obstetric admissions.</li>
            <li>Pre-eclampsia is the most common cause.</li>
            <li>Pre‐eclampsia leads to AKI in only 1.5–2% of cases.</li>
            <li>Management involves careful fluid management, drug review, and in severe cases, renal replacement therapy.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Acute kidney injury most commonly occurs in women without pre‐existing renal disease.</p>
        <p>Magnesium sulphate infusion may be appropriate to manage pre-eclampsia. There are cautions to be aware of, however. If urine output falls to < 20 ml/hour or creatinine is > 90 µmol/l, a 50% dose reduction in magnesium sulphate infusion should be considered (1 g/hour to 0.5 g/hour). The usual loading dose of 4 g is given in severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.</p>
        <p>A serum urea above 17 mmol/l despite medical management is a pregnancy‐specific indicator for renal replacement therapy.</p>
        <p>IV hydration is associated with increased risks of pulmonary oedema, and aggressive fluid management does not have good evidence for improved maternal or fetal outcomes in pregnancy. Women with pre‐eclampsia should therefore have a fluid restriction of 80 ml/hour peripartum to reduce these risks.</p>
