This is the second edition of this guideline. The ﬁrst edition was published in 2010 as a joint guideline with the
Centre of Maternal and Child Enquiries under the title ‘Management of Women with Obesity in Pregnancy’.
Executive summary
Prepregnancy care
What care should be provided in the primary care setting to women of childbearing age with obesity who wish to
become pregnant?
Primary care services should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to
optimise their weight before pregnancy. Advice on weight and lifestyle should be given duringpreconception counselling or contraceptive consultations. Weight and BMI should be measuredto encourage women to optimise their weight before pregnancy.P
Women of childbearing age with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should receive information and
advice about the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and be supported to lose
weight before conception and between pregnancies in line with National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical guideline (CG) 189.D
Women should be informed that weight loss between pregnancies reduces the risk of stillbirth,hypertensive complications and fetal macrosomia. Weight loss increases the chances ofsuccessful vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) section.B
What nutritional supplements should be recommended to women with obesity who wish to become pregnant?
Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take
5 mg folic acid supplementation daily, starting at least 1 month before conception andcontinuing during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.D
Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D de ﬁciency. However, although vitamin D
supplementation may ensure that women are vitamin D replete, the evidence on whetherroutine vitamin D should be given to improve maternal and offspring outcomes remainsuncertain.B

Provision of antenatal care
How and where should antenatal care be provided?
Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear
local policies and guidelines for care available.D
What are the facilities, equipment, and personnel required?
All maternity units should have a documented environmental risk assessment regarding theavailability of facilities to care for pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m
2or greater.
This risk assessment should address the following issues:
/C15circulation space
/C15accessibility, including doorway widths and thresholds
/C15safe working loads of equipment and ﬂoors
/C15appropriate theatre gowns
/C15equipment storage
/C15transportation
/C15stafﬁng levels
/C15availability of, and procurement process for, speci ﬁc equipment, including large blood pressure
cuffs, appropriately sized compression stockin gs and pneumatic compression devices, sit-on
weighing scale, large chairs without arms, lar ge wheelchairs, ultraso und scan couches, ward and
delivery beds, mattresses, theatre t rolleys, operating theatre tables and lifting and lateral transfer
equipment.
Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide
safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater. The list should include
details of safe working loads, product dimensions, as well as where speci ﬁc equipment is
located and how to access it.P
Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2for whom moving and handling are likely to prove
unusually dif ﬁcult should have a moving and handling risk assessment carried out in the third
trimester of pregnancy to determine any requirements for labour and birth. Clearcommunication of manual handling requirements should occur between the labour and theatresuites when women are in early labour.D
Some women with a booking BMI less than 40 kg/m2or greater may also bene ﬁt from assessment of
moving and handling requirements in the third trimester. This should be decided on an individual basis.PP

Measuring weight, height and BMI
When and how often should maternal weight, height and BMI be measured?
All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate
equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. Measurements should berecorded in the handheld notes and electronic patient information system.D
For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing womenduring the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnelrequired during labour and birth.P
What is the acceptable gestational weight gain in obese women?
There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain. Until further evidence is available,a focus on a healthy diet may be more applicable than prescribed weight gain targets.P
Information giving during pregnancy
What are the clinical risks of maternal obesity to maternal and fetal health in pregnancy?
All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should be provided with accurate
and accessible information about the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and how theymay be minimised. Women should be given the opportunity to discuss this information.D
What dietetic and exercise advice should be offered in pregnancy?
Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in thepregnancy where possible in line with NICE Public Health Guideline 27.P
What is the role of anti-obesity drugs in pregnancy?
Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy.C
Risk assessment during pregnancy in women with obesity
What speciﬁc risk assessments are required for anaesthetics?
Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should be referred to an obstetric
anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment.D
Difﬁculties with venous access and regional and general anaesthesia should be assessed. In
addition, an anaesthetic management plan for labour and birth should be discussed anddocumented. Multidisciplinary discussion and planning should occur where signi ﬁcant potential
difﬁculties are identi ﬁed.D

What speciﬁc risk assessments are required for prevention of pressure sores?
Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should have a documented risk assessment in
the third trimester of pregnancy by an appropriately quali ﬁed professional to consider tissue
viability issues. This should involve the use of a validated scale to support clinical judgement.D
Special considerations for screening, diagnosis and management of maternal disease in women withobesity
What special considerations are recommended for screening, diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes in
women with obesity?
All pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should be screened for
gestational diabetes according to NICE or Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidelines.B
What special considerations are recommended for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertensive
complications of pregnancy in women with obesity?
An appropriate size of cuff should be used for blood pressure measurements taken at the
booking visit and all subsequent antenatal consultations. The cuff size used should bedocumented in the medical records.C
Clinicians should be aware that women with class II obesity and greater have an increased riskof pre-eclampsia compared with those with a normal BMI.B
Women with more than one moderate risk factor (BMI of 35 kg/m2or greater, ﬁrst pregnancy,
maternal age of more than 40 years, family history of pre-eclampsia and multiple pregnancy)may bene ﬁt from taking 150 mg aspirin daily from 12 weeks of gestation until birth of the
baby.B
Women who develop hypertensive complications should be managed according to the NICECG107.P
What special considerations are recommended for prevention, screening, diagnosis and management of venous
thromboembolism in women with obesity?
Clinicians should be aware that women with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater, prepregnancy or at
booking, have a pre-existing risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) duringpregnancy.B
Risk assessment should be individually discussed, assessed and documented at the ﬁrst
antenatal visit, during pregnancy (if admitted or develop intercurrent problems), intrapartumand postpartum. Antenatal and post-birth thromboprophylaxis should be considered inaccordance with the RCOG GTG No. 37a.D

Acute VTE in pregnant women with obesity should be treated according to RCOG GTG No. 37b .P
What special considerations are recommended for screening, diagnosis and management of mental health problems
in women with obesity?
Women with BMI 30 kg/m2or greater are at increased risk of mental health problems and
should therefore be screened for these in pregnancy.D
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend a speci ﬁc lifestyle intervention to prevent
depression and anxiety in obese pregnant women.P
Antenatal screening
What special considerations does maternal obesity have for screening for chromosomal anomalies during pregnancy?
All women should be offered antenatal screening for chromosomal anomalies. Women shouldbe counselled, however, that some forms of screening for chromosomal anomalies are slightlyless effective with a raised BMI.B
Consider the use of transvaginal ultrasound in women in whom it is dif ﬁcult to obtain nuchal
translucency measurements transabdominally.P
What special considerations does maternal obesity have for screening for structural anomalies during pregnancy?
Screening and diagnostic tests for structural anomalies, despite their limitations in the obesepopulation, should be offered. However, women should be counselled that all forms ofscreening for structural anomalies are more limited in obese pregnant women.C
Fetal surveillance
How and when should the fetus be monitored antenatally?
As recommended by RCOG GTG No. 31, serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) isrecommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation as this improves theprediction of a small-for-gestational-age fetus.B
Women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2are more likely to have inaccurate SFH
measurements and should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound.P
Where external palpation is technically dif ﬁcult or impossible to assess fetal presentation,
ultrasound can be considered as an alternative or complementary method.P

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
How and when should the fetus be monitored during labour?
In the absence of good-quality evidence, intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women in
labour should be provided in accordance with NICE CG190 recommendations.P
How and when should the fetus be monitored post dates in women with obesity?
There is a lack of de ﬁnitive data to recommend routine monitoring of post dates pregnancy.
However, obese pregnant women should be made aware that they are at increased risk ofstillbirth.D
Planning labour and birth
What should be discussed with women with maternal obesity regarding labour and birth?
Women with maternal obesity should have an informed discussion with their obstetrician andanaesthetist (if clinically indicated) about a plan for labour and birth which should bedocumented in their antenatal notes.P
Women who are multiparous and otherwise low risk can be offered choice of setting forplanning their birth in midwifery-led units (MLUs), with clear referral pathways for early
recourse to consultant-led units (CLUs) if complications arise.C
Active management of the third stage should be recommended to reduce the risk of
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).A
Is maternal obesity an indication for induction of labour?
Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birthwithout increasing the risk of adverse outcomes; the option of induction should be discussedwith each woman on an individual basis.B
Is maternal obesity an indication for caesarean section?
The decision for a woman with maternal obesity to give birth by planned caesarean sectionshould involve a multidisciplinary approach, taking into consideration the individual woman ’s
comorbidities, antenatal complications and wishes.C
Is macrosomia and maternal obesity an indication for induction of labour and/or caesarean section?
Where macrosomia is suspected, induction of labour may be considered. Parents should have adiscussion about the options of induction of labour and expectant management.B

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
What care should women with obesity and a previous caesarean section receive?
Women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should have an individualised decision for
VBAC following informed discussion and consideration of all relevant clinical factors.P
Care during childbirth
Where should obese women give birth?
Class I and II maternal obesity is not a reason in itself for advising birth within a CLU, butindicates that further consideration of birth setting may be required.D
The additional intrapartum risks of maternal obesity and the additional care that can beprovided in a CLU should be discussed with the woman so that she can make an informedchoice about planned place of birth.P
What lines of communication are required during labour and birth in women with maternal obesity?
The on-duty anaesthetist covering the labour ward should be informed of all women with classIII obesity admitted to the labour ward for birth. This communication should be documented bythe attending midwife in the notes.P
What midwifery support should be available during labour to obese women?
Women with class III obesity who are in established labour should receive continuous midwifery care,with consideration of additional measures to prevent pressure sores and monitor the fetal condition.P
What speciﬁc interventions may be required during labour and birth for women with maternal obesity?
In the absence of current evidence, intrapartum care should be provided in accordance withNICE CG190.P
Women with a BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should have venous access established early in labour
and consideration should be given to the siting of a second cannula.P
Although active management of the third stage of labour is advised for all women, the increasedrisk of PPH in those with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m
2makes this even more important.B
What speciﬁc surgical techniques are recommended for performing caesarean section on the obese woman
(including incision, closure)?
There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support the use of one surgical approach over
another. Surgical approaches should therefore follow NICE CG132 but clinicians may decidealternative approaches are merited depending on individual circumstances.P

What postoperative wound care is recommended following caesarean section in women with obesity?
Women with class 1 obesity or greater having a caesarean section are at increased risk of
wound infection and should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery .A
Women undergoing caesarean section who have more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have
suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space in order to reduce the risk of wound infection andwound separation.A
There is a lack of good-quality evidence to recommend the routine use of negative pressuredressing therapy, barrier retractors and insertion of subcutaneous drains to reduce the risk ofwound infection in obese women requiring caesarean sections.B
Postnatal care and follow-up after pregnancy
How can the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding in women with maternal obesity be optimised?
Obesity is associated with low breastfeeding initiation and maintenance rates. Women with abooking BMI 30 kg/m
2or greater should receive appropriate specialist advice and support
antenatally and postnatally regarding the bene ﬁts, initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.P
What ongoing care, including postnatal contraception advice, should be provided to women with maternal obesity
following pregnancy?
Maternal obesity should be considered when making the decision regarding the most
appropriate form of postnatal contraception.P
What information should be given postnatally to obese women about their long-term health risks and those of their
children?
Refer to NICE CG189. Women with class I obesity or greater at booking should continue to be
offered nutritional advice following childbirth from an appropriately trained professional, with aview to weight reduction in line with NICE Public Health Guideline 27.D
Women who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes should have postnatal follow-up inline with NICE Guideline 3.D
What support can be given in the community to ensure minimal interpregnancy weight gain or to minimise risks of a
future pregnancy?
Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight
management services where these are available.P

Management of pregnancy following bariatric surgery
What are the clinical risks of previous bariatric surgery to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy?
A minimum waiting period of 12 –18 months after bariatric surgery is recommended before
attempting pregnancy to allow stabilisation of body weight and to allow the correctidenti ﬁcation and treatment of any possible nutritional de ﬁciencies that may not be evident
during the ﬁrst months.D
How should women with previous bariatric surgery be cared for during pregnancy?
Women with previous bariatric surgery have high-risk pregnancies and should have consultant-
led antenatal care.P
Women with previous bariatric surgery should have nutritional surveillance and screening for
deﬁciencies during pregnancy.D
Woman with previous bariatric surgery should be referred to a dietician for advice with regard
to their specialised nutritional needs.D
1. Purpose and scope
Obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent in the UK population and has become one of the most commonly
occurring risk factors in obstetric practice, with 21.3% of the antenatal population being obese and fewer than one-half of pregnant women (47.3%) having a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range.
1According to World
Health Organization criteria,2adults can be classiﬁed according to BMI as shown below in Table 1.

While the majority of the recommendations within this guideline pertain to women with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater, some
recommendations are speciﬁc to women in the higher classes of obesity only. Obese women with a BMI below a speciﬁed
threshold may also beneﬁt from recommendations in a higher BMI group, depending on individual circumstances.However, the chosen BMI cut-offs reﬂect careful consideration given to the balance of medical intervention versus risk,differences in local prevalence of maternal obesity and resource implications for local healthcare organisations.
The recommendations cover interventions prior to conception, and during and after pregnancy.
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
The prevalence of obesity in the general population in the UK has increased markedly since the early 1990s. The
prevalence of obesity in pregnancy has also been seen to increase, rising from 9 –10% in the early 1990s to 16 –19%
in the 2000s.3,4
Pregnant women who are obese are at greater risk of a variety of pregnancy-related complications compared withwomen of normal BMI, including pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who are obese are also atincreased risk of caesarean birth. Maternal size can make the assessment of fetal size, presentation and externalmonitoring of fetal heart tracing more challenging during pregnancy. Initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding arealso more difﬁcult in the women with obesity.
1,5–17High prepregnancy BMI is associated with a small but statistically
signiﬁcant increase in severe maternal morbidity or mortality, with the adjusted rate difference per 10 000 womencompared with normal BMI being 24.9 (95% CI 15.7 –34.6) for women with class I obesity, 35.8 (95% CI 23.1 –49.5)
for women with class II obesity and 61.1 (95% CI 44.8 –78.9) for women with class III obesity.
18These US data are
supported by the 2015 MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Conﬁdential Enquiriesacross the UK) review into maternal deaths, which reported that 30% of women who died were obese and 22%were overweight.
19In recognition of the excess in deaths and additional risks, the Conﬁdential Enquiry on Maternal
and Child Health (CEMACH 2003 –5) recommended that women with a BMI 30 kg/m2or more should be seen for
prepregnancy counselling.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodology for developing RCOG Green-top Guidelines (GTGs). The
Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews ofEffects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Trip weresearched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all relevant articles published until May 2016. A top-up literaturesearch was performed in January 2018. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)terms, including all subheadings and synonyms, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included‘obesity’, ‘bariatric surgery’, ‘anti-obesity agents’, and ‘(prepregnancy or pre-pregnancy or preconception *or pre-
conception *or pregestation *or pre-gestation *)a d j 3( o b e s *or weight or bmi)’. The search was limited to studies on
humans and papers in the English language. Relevant guidelines were also searched for using the same criteria in theNational Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations can be found in Appendix I.

4. Prepregnancy care
4.1 What care should be provided in the primary care setting to women of childbearing age with
obesity who wish to become pregnant?
Primary care services should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to
optimise their weight before pregnancy. Advice on weight and lifestyle should be given duringpreconception counselling or contraceptive consultations. Weight and BMI should be measuredto encourage women to optimise their weight before pregnancy.P
Women of childbearing age with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should receive information and
advice about the risks of obesity during pregnancy and childbirth, and be supported to loseweight before conception and between pregnancies in line with NICE Clinical guideline (CG)189.D
Women should be informed that weight loss between pregnancies reduces the risk of stillbirth,hypertensive complications and fetal macrosomia. Weight loss increases the chances ofsuccessful vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) section.B
Compared with women of a healthy prepregnancy BMI, pregnant women with obesity are at increased
risk of miscarriage,20gestational diabetes,16pre-eclampsia,21venous thromboembolism (VTE),22,23induced
labour,24dysfunctional or prolonged labour,25caesarean section,26anaesthetic complications,27–31
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH),32wound infections15and mortality.33Women over their ideal weight are
less likely to initiate and maintain breastfeeding than women of normal weight.34Evidence
level 2 –
to 2++
Infants of obese mothers are at increased risk of congenital anomalies,35stillbirth,12,36prematurity,8
macrosomia9,15and neonatal death.9,36Intrauterine exposure to maternal obesity is also associated with
an increased risk of developing obesity and metabolic disorders in childhood.37Women should be
supported to lose weight before conception and between pregnancies in line with NICE CG189.38Please
see Appendix II for further information on risks.Evidence
level 2 ++
There is evidence that in women with obesity, weight loss between pregnancies reduces the risk of
stillbirth,39–42hypertensive complications40and macrosomia. Weight loss also increases the chances of
successful VBAC43in a linear manner.Evidence
level 2 ++
4.2 What nutritional supplements should be recommended to women with obesity who wish to
become pregnant?
Women with a BMI 30 kg/m2or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take
5 mg folic acid supplementation daily, starting at least 1 month before conception andcontinuing during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.D

Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D de ﬁciency. However, although vitamin D
supplementation may ensure that women are vitamin D replete, the evidence on whether routinevitamin D should be given to improve maternal and offspring outcomes remains uncertain.B
In the general maternity population, a systematic review of ﬁve trials, including 7391 pregnancies (2033
with a history of a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect [NTD] and 5358 with no history of NTDs),demonstrated that daily folic acid supplementation in doses ranging from 0.36 mg (360 micrograms) to4 mg (4000 micrograms) a day, with and without other vitamins and minerals, before conception and up
to 12 weeks of gestation, prevents the recurrence of these defects. However, there is insufﬁcient
evidence to determine whether folic acid reduces the risk of other birth defects.
44Evidence
level 1 ++
Women with a raised BMI are at increased risk of NTDs, with a meta-analysis of 12 observational cohort
studies reporting an OR of 1.70 (95% CI 1.34 –2.15) and 3.11 (95% CI 1.75 –5.46) for women deﬁned as
obese and severely obese, respectively, compared with women of healthy weight.35Evidence
level 2 ++
Evidence from cross-sectional data shows that compared with women with a BMI less than 27 kg/m2, women
with a BMI 27 kg/m2or greater are less likely to use nutritional supplements and less likely to receive folate
through their diet. In addition, they had lower serum folate levels even after controlling for folate intake.45Evidence
level 2 +
The ﬁndings from the studies above suggest that obese women should receive higher doses of folate
supplementation in order to minimise the increased risk of fetal NTDs. Although there have been somestudies which have suggested a link between high-dose folic acid supplementation and longer termoutcomes, including asthma in the offspring
46,47and maternal malignancy, causality has not been

Prepregnancy BMI is inversely associated with serum vitamin D concentrations among pregnant women.
Women with obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2or greater) are at increased risk of vitamin D deﬁciency compared
with women of a healthy weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m2). Cord serum vitamin D levels in infants of
obese women have also been found to be lower than infants born to non-obese women.50Evidence

The main source of vitamin D is synthesis on exposure of the skin to sunlight. However, in the UK there is limited
sunlight of the appropriate wavelength, particularly during winter. A survey in the UK showed that approximatelyone-quarter of UK women aged between 19 and 24 years, and one-sixth of those aged between 25 and 34 years,
are at risk of vitamin D deﬁciency.
51Maternal skin exposure alone may not always be enough to achieve the optimal
vitamin D status needed for pregnancy, and the recommended oral intake of 10 micrograms vitamin D daily for allpregnant and breastfeeding women cannot usually be met from diet alone.
A Cochrane review concluded that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D in a single or
continued dose increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term and may reduce the risk of low birthweight,preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. However, when calcium and vitamin D are combined, the risk ofpreterm birth is increased. The clinical signiﬁcance of the increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin Dconcentrations therefore remains unclear.

5. Provision of antenatal care
5.1 How and where should antenatal care be provided?
Care of women with obesity in pregnancy can be integrated into all antenatal clinics, with clear
local policies and guidelines for care available.D
The Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) Maternity Risk Management Standards54recommend that
maternity services must develop and implement robust processes to manage the risks associated with obesity,and consistently provide sensitive, comprehensive, and appropriate multidisciplinary care. Speciﬁcrecommendations include a requirement for all women with a BMI 30 kg/m
2or greater to have
multidisciplinary care, a documented antenatal consultation about the intrapartum risks and to be advised todeliver in a consultant-led unit (CLU) for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m
2or greater. This may not be feasible in
areas of high prevalence due to capacity and resources. It is therefore important that all health professionalsproviding maternity care are aware of the maternal and fetal risks, and the speciﬁc interventions required tominimise these.
55Provision of care should be organised depending on the local need and available services.Evidence

5.2 What are the facilities, equipment and personnel required?
All maternity units should have a documented environmental risk assessment regarding the
availability of facilities to care for pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater.
This risk assessment should address the following issues:P
/C15circulation space
/C15accessibility, including doorway widths and thresholds

Maternity units should have a central list of all facilities and equipment required to provide
safe care to pregnant women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater. The list should include
details of safe working loads, product dimensions, as well as where speci ﬁc equipment is
located and how to access it.P
Women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2for whom moving and handling is likely to prove
unusually dif ﬁcult should have a moving and handling risk assessment carried out in the third
trimester of pregnancy to determine any requirements for labour and birth. Clearcommunication of manual handling requirements should occur between the labour and theatresuites when women are in early labour.D
Some women with a booking BMI less than 40 kg/m2or greater may also bene ﬁt from assessment
of moving and handling requirements in the third trimester. This should be decided on an individual
basis.P
A minimum requirement for maternity services within the NHS Litigation Authority’s CNST Maternity
Risk Management Standards is the availability of suitable equipment for women with a high BMI. It isrecommended that units should have a documented process to assess this on a regular basis.
54It is also
recognised as good practice for maternity units to have an ultrasound machine, and extra-long spinal andepidural needles available at all times on the labour ward.
Five areas have been identiﬁed in the risk assessment of the bariatric patient journey: patient factors;
equipment; communication; building space; and organisational and staff issues.
56Available moving and
handling equipment should be listed along with its weight limit and storage location.57This will include chairs,
beds, theatre operating tables and transfer equipment, such as hoists and lateral transfer equipment. Movingand handling courses and updates should be mandatory and include the management of class III obesity.

6. Measuring weight, height and BMI
6.1 When and how often should maternal weight, height and BMI be measured?
All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate
equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. Measurements should be
recorded in the handheld notes and electronic patient information system.D
For women with obesity in pregnancy, consideration should be given to reweighing womenduring the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made for equipment and personnelrequired during labour and birth.P
Appropriate care of women with maternal obesity can only be possible with consistent identiﬁcation of
those women who are at risk. NICE CG62 Antenatal care for uncomplicated pregnancies58recommends that
maternal height and weight is measured at the booking appointment (ideally by 10 weeks of gestation) andthe woman’s BMI is calculated. Semi-structured interviews of health professionals in the North EastGovernment Ofﬁce Region of England suggested that self-reported rather than measured height andweight are used at some community booking visits due to lack of availability of appropriate equipment.

However, the magnitude of error was small and did not largely bias associations between pregnancy-related weight and birth outcomes. The review concluded that although measured weight is preferable,self-reporting is a cost-effective and practical measurement approach.

Mandatory height and weight data ﬁelds in electronic patient information systems, and functionality allowing theautomatic calculation of BMI, may be useful to enable local organisations to achieve 100% compliance with this standard.
6.2 What is the acceptable gestational weight gain in obese women?
There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain. Until further evidence is available,
a focus on a healthy diet may be more applicable than prescribed weight gain targets.P
There is a lack of consensus on optimal gestational weight gain.60The Institute of Medicine (IoM)
guidelines (USA) recommend different ranges of weight gain for normal weight, overweight and obesewomen.
61These guidelines are the most widely used but are not adopted routinely in clinical
practice.60,62,63The original recommendations were focussed on strong evidence supporting the need for
adequate maternal gestational weight gain to prevent fetal growth restriction. The guidelines were laterextended to include advice for overweight and obese pregnant women. However, due to a lack ofcontrolled trials, the recommended ranges of weight gain for each BMI category were devised usingavailable evidence from observational studies considering prevention of small -and large -for-gestational -age
infants, reduction in caesarean section rates and reducing postpartum weight retention. Notably, therewas insufﬁcient evidence for the IoM to include gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, common adverseoutcomes in obese pregnant women, when preparing these guidelines. Studies have suggested that theIoM guidelines should be modiﬁed according to obesity class.

Preconception counselling provides a unique opportunity to inform obese women who are planning a
pregnancy about the potential beneﬁts of achieving a healthy weight prepregnancy and of the increasedrisk associated with maternal obesity. Although preconception advice and care is the ideal scenario, manywomen present for the ﬁrst time during pregnancy. These women should be given an early opportunity todiscuss potential risks and management options with a healthcare professional.

7.2 What dietetic and exercise advice should be offered in pregnancy?
Dietetic advice by an appropriately trained professional should be provided early in the
pregnancy where possible in line with NICE Public Health Guideline 27.P
Many women and their partners have pre-existing social and cultural beliefs about pregnancy diet and weight gain.67
These views should be considered when discussing the importance of healthy eating and appropriate exercise during
pregnancy to prevent excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes.63
7.3 What is the role of anti-obesity drugs in pregnancy?
Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy.C
Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are used for the management of obesity in women of reproductive age. Currently,
there is a paucity of information about the effect of anti-obesity drugs on the fetus and access to most anti-obesitydrugs (with the exception of orlistat) is limited.
Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats. Although data are limited,
using the Swedish Medical Birth Register, during the years 1998 –2011 and among 392 126 infants born,
248 were exposed to orlistat in early pregnancy and no increase in major malformation risk was seen(relative risk [RR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 –1.07).

Phentermine/topiramate promotes appetite reduction and decreases food consumption. The exact
mechanism of action of topiramate on weight loss is not known but may be related to appetite
suppression and increased satiety.69Use of topiramate in pregnancy is linked to oral clefts. A meta-
analysis of all studies reporting on women exposed to topiramate during pregnancy included 3420 patientsand 1 204 981 controls. The odds ratio of oral cleft following ﬁrst trimester exposure to topiramate was6.26 (95% CI 3.13 –12.51; P=0.00001).

Topiramate and phentermine are also individually excreted in breast milk and, therefore, the combination of
phentermine/topiramate may also be present in breast milk. Treatment with either medication is therefore notrecommended during lactation due to unknown risks on the infant.

Lorcaserin hydrochloride is a serotonin receptor agonist that is highly selective for the speciﬁc serotonin
receptor, 5-HT 2C, which is involved in the regulation of appetite.70It is believed that lorcaserin promotes
satiety and results in weight loss from decreased overall food consumption. There are no data on the
safety of lorcaserin in human pregnancy. In animal studies, although exposure to lorcaserin duringembryogenesis has not demonstrated teratogenicity or embryolethality, exposure in late pregnancy didresult in lower birthweight of offspring, which persisted to adulthood. Lorcaserin is thereforecontraindicated in pregnancy.

8.1 What speciﬁc risk assessments are required for anaesthetics?
Pregnant women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should be referred to an obstetric
anaesthetist for consideration of antenatal assessment.D
Difﬁculties with venous access, and regional and general anaesthesia should be assessed. In
addition, an anaesthetic management plan for labour and birth should be discussed anddocumented. Multidisciplinary discussion and planning should occur where signi ﬁcant potential
difﬁculties are identi ﬁed.D
The Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association and Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland
guideline on obstetric anaesthetic services66recommends that antenatal assessment for all pregnant
women with a booking BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should be made by an obstetric anaesthetist.Evidence

Obesity is a risk factor for many anaesthetic-related complications and has been identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant risk
factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. A study of UK Obstetric Surveillance System data showed thatone-quarter of maternal cardiac arrests were related to anaesthesia. Of this number, 75% of the women wereobese.
27Epidural resite rate in the women with class III obesity (greater than 136 kg in weight) was 17% in a
cohort study compared with 3% in the control group (less than 113 kg in weight).31Obesity in pregnancy is
associated with an increased risk of difﬁculties with airway management, including difﬁcult bag mask ventilation73
and failed intubation,28,29a higher risk of desaturation when difﬁculty is encountered28and postoperative
atelectasis. Guidelines from the Difﬁcult Airway Society and Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association highlight theimportance of thoughtful formation of both primary and secondary airway plans.
74,75Obesity is also associated
with a signiﬁcantly higher gastric volume in labouring parturients.76The increased difﬁculties associated with the
provision of general and regional anaesthesia in the obese can lead to an increased decision-to-delivery time in
women who require a category 1 or 2 caesarean section.30Women with class III obesity will be at highest risk
and it is recommended that anaesthetic resources locally are focused on this group of women. Maternityservices may decide to use a lower BMI threshold, taking into consideration the local prevalence of maternalobesity. Each woman should be given advice on labour analgesia after individual risk assessment.Evidence

10. Antenatal screening
In the UK, pregnant women are offered antenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy, including trisomy 21 (Down
syndrome), using either ﬁrst trimester combined screening or second trimester biochemical screening. In addition,women are offered a fetal anomaly scan between 18
+0and 20+6weeks of gestation to detect structural
abnormalities.
A comprehensive meta-analysis by Stothard et al.113has shown that obese pregnant women (BMI 30 kg/m2
or greater) are at increased risk of a range of structural anomalies (Table 2). Data from the Consortium on
Safe Labour study has further divided obese pregnant women into two groups (those with gestationaldiabetes and those without) and have shown that even in the absence of gestational diabetes, obese pregnantwomen remain at risk of developing congenital cardiac defects (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 –1.36).

The First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk trial114has demonstrated that maternal BMI has a
signiﬁcant impact on the success of obtaining accurate NT measurements. Other studies115,116have
supported this ﬁnding and have shown that additional time is required to obtain measurements, and even
then, these women have a higher chance of unsuccessful attempts at NT measurements requiring repeatvisits.Evidence

A retrospective cohort study by Tsai et al.117has shown that the proportion of pregnant women who
completed ﬁrst trimester screening is inversely proportional to their BMI (64% of women with BMI18–24.9 kg/m
2versus 61% of women with BMI greater than 30 kg/m2and 47% if BMI greater than 40 kg/m2;
P<0.001). However, further analyses of those who completed screening with speciﬁc ultrasonographic soft
markers did not show any difference in detection rates between the groups (47% for normal or overweightwomen versus 17% for obese women; P=0.20).Evidence

Those with unsuccessful ﬁrst trimester screening should be offered second trimester screening with serum markers.
Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) involves detecting free fetal DNA fractions in the maternal serum for
results. These have been shown to decrease with increasing maternal weight. Obesity-speciﬁc tests arenot available and women should be informed of the limitations of these tests.
118,119Results of screening
for trisomies with NIPT may therefore be less effective for obese pregnant women.Evidence

Diagnostic testing may be offered, considering the limitations of screening tests in obese women, after full
counselling. A retrospective cohort study concluded that women with a BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m2do
not have increased risk of fetal loss associated with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Higher lossrates were observed for women with class III obesity following amniocentesis (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 –3.9).

10.2 What special considerations does maternal obesity have for screening for structural
anomalies during pregnancy?
Screening and diagnostic tests for structural anomalies, despite their limitations in the obese
population, should be offered. However, women should be counselled that all forms ofscreening for structural anomalies are more limited in obese pregnant women.C
Maternal obesity is a limiting factor in screening for structural anomalies during pregnancy due to difﬁculty in
accurate visualisation of fetal structures with increasing BMI.121The increased echogenicity of adipose tissue
and increased absorption of the ultrasonic sound beam by abdominal fat results in reduced image clarity andpoor image quality. This leads to fewer anomalies being detected at the midtrimester fetal anomaly scan inobese pregnant women, with an increased risk of missed antenatal diagnoses of fetal anomalies (aOR 0.7,95% CI 0.7 –0.9; P=0.001).
114,122Data from the FaSTER trial has shown a lower sensitivity and higher
false-negative rate of detection of multiple aneuploidy markers (BMI less than 25 kg/m2, 32% sensitivity and
68% false-negative rate versus BMI greater than 30 mg/m2, 22% sensitivity and 78% false-negative rate).Evidence

This may result in the need for extra time for fetal anomaly scans. Repeat scans, including consideration of the
transvaginal approach, may also be required to complete the screening process. A case –control study by
Hendler et al.123looking at repeat examination of cardiac structures in obese versus non-obese pregnant
women found that repeat ultrasound visualisation at a later gestation can improve identiﬁcation of cardiacstructural abnormalities. However, rates of suboptimal views remained signiﬁcantly higher in the obese group.Evidence

11. Fetal surveillance
11.1 How and when should the fetus be monitored antenatally?
As recommended by RCOG GTG No. 31, serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) is
recommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation as this improves theprediction of a small-for-gestational-age fetus.B
Women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2are more likely to have inaccurate SFH
measurements and should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound.P
Where external palpation is technically dif ﬁcult or impossible to assess fetal presentation,
ultrasound can be considered as an alternative or complementary method.P
The following methods of estimating fetal growth have been assessed in the NICE CG62 Antenatal care for
uncomplicated pregnancies58and RCOG GTG No. 31 Investigation and Management of the Small -for-Gestational -
Age Fetus :124
/C15SFH with or without the use of customised SFH measurements.125,126
/C15Ultrasound scanning with or without the use of customised charts.
/C15Clinical judgement and abdominal palpation.
In women with obesity, all of these methods are technically more difﬁcult, increasing the risk of false-
negative results. This is particularly the case for women with class III obesity.
In the absence of good-quality evidence, it is advised that NICE CG6258and RCOG GTG No. 31124
recommendations are followed for women with obesity to ensure safe and standard provision of care.Evidence
level 4
11.2 How and when should the fetus be monitored during labour?
In the absence of good-quality evidence, intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women in
labour should be provided in accordance with NICE CG190 recommendations.P
There is no evidence to support continuous fetal monitoring during labour in the absence of other
comorbidities, or medical or obstetric complications. NICE CG190 Intrapartum care for healthy women and
babies127recommends that intermittent fetal heart monitoring should be offered to low-risk women in
labour using the Pinard stethoscope or Doppler ultrasound.Evidence

11.3 How and when should the fetus be monitored post dates in women with obesity?
There is a lack of de ﬁnitive data to recommend routine monitoring of post dates pregnancy.
However, obese pregnant women should be made aware that they are at increased risk ofstillbirth.D
Perinatal mortality and fetal compromise increase progressively beyond 37 weeks of gestation128and
women with obesity are at increased risk of stillbirth (BMI greater than 35 kg/m2versus 20 –25 kg/m2;O R
3.9, 95% CI 2.44 –6.22).12Women with obesity are also at increased risk of prolonged pregnancy.12A
retrospective cohort study of 29 224 women concluded that women with higher BMIs had increased risk
of prolonged pregnancy and induction of labour with aOR 1.24 (95% CI 1.14 –1.34) for overweight
women, aOR 1.52 (95% CI 1.37 –1.10) for class I obesity, aOR 1.75 (95% CI 1.48 –2.07) for class II obesity
and aOR 2.27 (95% CI 1.78 –2.89) for class III obesity. Approximately 60% of obese primiparous women
and 90% of obese multiparous women achieved vaginal birth following induction of labour.129Evidence
level 2 +
Deﬁnitive recommendations for fetal surveillance are hampered by the lack of randomised controlled
trials demonstrating that antepartum fetal surveillance decreases perinatal morbidity or mortality in late-term and post-term gestations. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests that basedon epidemiological data linking advancing gestational age to stillbirth, antepartum fetal surveillance at orbeyond 41 weeks of gestation should be indicated.
130There are no deﬁnitive studies determining the
optimal type or frequency of such testing and no evidence speciﬁc for women with obesity.Evidence

12. Planning labour and birth
Planning for labour and birth is a dynamic process, which requires ongoing review of the woman’s antenatal progress
and development of complications during the antenatal period. When discussing labour with the woman, it isimportant to consider maternal comorbidities, fetal complications, and access to services for emergency birth andneonatal resuscitation if required.
This requires a multidisciplinary, individualised approach, with consideration of the woman’s and her
partner’s views, and may involve the obstetrician, midwife and anaesthetist, and early anticipation ofpotential maternal and fetal complications that may arise during the intrapartum period.
125Evidence
level 4
12.1 What should be discussed with women with maternal obesity regarding labour and birth?
Women with maternal obesity should have an informed discussion with their obstetrician and
anaesthetist (if clinically indicated) about a plan for labour and birth which should bedocumented in their antenatal notes.P
Women who are multiparous and otherwise low risk can be offered choice of setting forplanning their birth in MLUs with clear referral pathways for early recourse to CLUs ifcomplications arise.C

Active management of the third stage should be recommended to reduce the risk of PPH.A
Maternal obesity is associated with an increased incidence of induction of labour (OR 1.70, 95% CI
1.64–1.76),15augmentation of labour (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16 –1.37)14and intrapartum caesarean
section (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.30 –1.79).14In addition, this group of women are also at increased risk
of complications, including shoulder dystocia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4 –5.8),24and have a higher prevalence
of requesting additional analgesia in labour (aOR of requesting for epidural 1.20, 95% CI 1.18 –1.23).9
The Birthplace in England national prospective cohort study131reported that low-risk women should be
offered a choice of birthplace, including CLUs and MLUs. The risk of adverse events is uncommon andinterventions are low. Planned birth in midwifery-led units is supported by NHS trained midwives workingwith referral pathways to CLUs in case complications arise, liaising with a comprehensive network ofambulance services.
A secondary analysis of the Birthplace study looking at the impact of maternal obesity on intrapartum
outcomes in otherwise low-risk women concluded that the intrapartum risks may be lower thanpreviously anticipated (adjusted RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 –1.23 for BMI greater than 35 kg/m
2relative to low-
risk women of normal weight).14Evidence
level 2 +
NICE CG190127recommends that women with a booking BMI greater than 35 kg/m2have planned labour
and birth in an obstetric unit. Those who have a BMI of between 30 kg/m2and 35 kg/m2at booking
should have individualised assessment of place of birth.Evidence

NICE CG6258recommends that healthcare providers should discuss labour and birth with pregnant
women before 36 weeks of gestation. This discussion should include the labour plan, pain managementand management of prolonged pregnancy.
Women with maternal obesity should be made aware of potential intrapartum complications when
discussing labour and birth. Issues that should be discussed include potential anaesthetic and obstetriccomplications, availability of senior obstetrician and anaesthetist, immediate access to theatre and neonatalresuscitation facilities. However, in recognition of the secondary analysis of the Birthplace study looking atthe intrapartum risks of maternal obesity, parity should be taken into account when assessing place ofbirth and risk for giving birth in MLUs.Evidence

Sebire et al.15have shown that obese pregnant women are at increased risk of PPH (OR 1.39, 95% CI
1.32–1.46) even after correcting for mode of birth. Active management of the third stage of labour should
be recommended to women with maternal obesity. The use of prophylactic uterotonics for themanagement of the third stage of labour has been shown to reduce the risk of PPH.

12.2 Is maternal obesity an indication for induction of labour?
Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birth
without increasing the risk of adverse outcomes; the option of induction should be discussedwith each woman on an individual basis.B
A retrospective cohort study of 74 725 obese women compared the perinatal outcomes of elective
induction of labour at 37 weeks of gestation and expectant management. The odds of caesarean birthwere lower among nulliparous women with elective induction of labour at 37 weeks of gestation (OR0.55, 95% CI 0.34 –0.90) and 39 weeks of gestation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 –0.95) compared with
expectant management. Among multiparous women with a prior vaginal birth, elective induction oflabour at 37 (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 –0.64), 38 (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 –0.82) and 39 (OR 0.67, 95% CI
0.56–0.81) weeks of gestation was associated with lower odds of caesarean section. Additionally,
elective induction of labour at 38, 39 and 40 weeks of gestation was associated with lower odds ofmacrosomia. There were no differences in the odds of operative vaginal birth, lacerations, brachialplexus injury or respiratory distress syndrome. This study concluded that elective induction of labour ofobese women at term may reduce the risk of caesarean birth, without increasing the risks of adverseoutcomes.
133Evidence
level 2 +
A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, retrospective, cohort and case –control studies,
including 1 443 449 pregnant women in upper and middle income countries, concluded that maternal obesityis associated with fetal overgrowth and macrosomia, with an overall, unadjusted OR 2.42 (95% CI 2.16 –2.72)
for large-for-gestational-age infants more than the 90
thcentile; OR 2.17 (95% CI 1.92 –2.45) for birthweight

A 2016 Cochrane database systematic review of randomised trials for induction of labour for suspected
fetal macrosomia concluded that elective induction of labour did not reduce the risk of brachial plexusinjury. However, induction of labour results in lower mean birthweight, and fewer fractures and cases ofshoulder dystocia. The authors concluded that while further trials are needed to identify the optimalgestation for induction and diagnosis of macrosomia, induction of labour may be considered wheremacrosomia can be identiﬁed conﬁdently and options of induction and expectant management should bediscussed.

comorbidities, antenatal complications and wishes.C

Pregnant women with a higher BMI have an increased risk of caesarean birth. A systematic review and
meta-analyses of 11 cohort studies136concluded that the risk of caesarean section increased by 50% in
overweight women and more than doubled in obese women (pooled OR in overweight women 1.53,
95% CI 1.48 –1.58; obese women 2.26, 95% CI 2.04 –2.51; class III obesity 3.38, 95% CI 2.49 –4.57).
However, the decision regarding mode of birth should be individualised and consider the woman’scomorbidities, circumstances and wishes. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended and a discussionbetween the consultant obstetrician, anaesthetist, midwife and woman during the antenatal period isencouraged. Assessment of cervical favourability should be taken into account, as it has been shown thatnulliparous obese pregnant women with an unfavourable cervix are more likely to have a failed induction,resulting in caesarean section.
137However, a retrospective cohort study by Subramaniam et al.138showed
that planned caesarean section in women with class III obesity is not associated with reduced morbiditycompared with induction of labour.Evidence
level 2 /C0
Women with maternal obesity who require birth by emergency caesarean section are at increased risk of signiﬁcant
morbidity and mortality. This should be taken into consideration when planning labour and mode of birth. Thosewith class III obesity may require additional specialist equipment. A detailed plan for obstetric and anaestheticmanagement should be put in place antenatally and documented in the woman’s notes.
12.4 Is macrosomia and maternal obesity an indication for induction of labour and/or caesarean
section?
Where macrosomia is suspected, induction of labour may be considered. Parents should have a
discussion about the options of induction of labour and expectant management.B
A Cochrane review135of evidence on near-term or term induction of labour for fetal macrosomia has
shown a reduction in the risk of shoulder dystocia and fetal fractures, irrespective of maternal BMI. Theﬁndings also showed no change in the risk of caesarean section. In order to prevent one fracture, itwould be necessary to induce 60 women. Evidence
level 2 +
This ﬁnding was supported by a randomised controlled trial by Boulvain et al.139which studied obese
pregnant women. This trial compared induction of labour between 37+0and 38+6weeks of gestation
versus expectant management of large-for-dates fetuses which was deﬁned by an estimated fetal weightgreater than the 95
thcentile. This trial has shown a decreased incidence of shoulder dystocia in the
induction of labour group (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 –0.86), but there were no reported cases of brachial
plexus injuries or intracranial haemorrhage in either group.
A meta-analysis by Magro-Malosso et al.140of nondiabetic women did not show that induction of labour
at term for fetal macrosomia, as diagnosed using antenatal ultrasonographic-estimated fetal weight,prevents shoulder dystocia (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.30 –1.08). It did, however, show a reduced risk of fetal
fractures (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 –0.79).Evidence

12.5 What care should women with obesity and a previous caesarean section receive?
Women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should have an individualised decision for
VBAC following informed discussion and consideration of all relevant clinical factors.P
The risks and beneﬁts of VBAC are outlined in RCOG GTG No. 45 Birth after Previous Caesarean Birth .141 Evidence
level 4
Compared with non-obese pregnant women, obese pregnant women have additional risks which need to
be considered during decision making. Obesity is a risk factor for unsuccessful VBAC. A retrospectivecohort study by Durnwald et al.
142showed that only 54.6% of obese pregnant women had successful
VBAC compared with 70.5% of those with a normal BMI ( P=0.003). Notably, those who had a normal
BMI at booking but subsequently had an obese BMI at birth also had reduced VBAC success comparedwith those who maintained a normal BMI during pregnancy (56.6% versus 74.2%; P=0.006). This ﬁnding
has been replicated by several other studies.
143,144
Class III obesity is associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labour143–145and
neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is associated with an increased riskof serious maternal morbidity because anaesthetic
146and operative difﬁculties are more prevalent in these
women than in women with a healthy BMI. This should also be taken into account when discussing therisks and beneﬁts of VBAC.Evidence

13. Care during childbirth
13.1 Where should obese women give birth?
Class I and II maternal obesity is not a reason in itself for advising birth within a CLU, but
indicates that further consideration of birth setting may be required.D
The additional intrapartum risks of maternal obesity and the additional care that can beprovided in a CLU should be discussed with the woman so that she can make an informedchoice about planned place of birth.P
Women with obesity are at signiﬁcantly higher risk of shoulder dystocia, emergency caesarean section and
atonic PPH after vaginal but not caesarean birth.147Immediate obstetric intervention is vital in these
situations. In addition, babies born to mothers with obesity are up to 1.5 times more likely to be admitted toa neonatal intensive care unit than babies born to mothers of a healthy weight.

13.2 What lines of communication are required during labour and birth in women with
maternal obesity?
The on-duty anaesthetist covering the labour ward should be informed of all women with class
III obesity admitted to the labour ward for birth. This communication should be documented bythe attending midwife in the notes.P
An opportunity for early assessment will allow the on-duty anaesthetist to review documentation of the antenatal
anaesthetic consultation, identify potential difﬁculties with regional and/or general anaesthesia, and alert seniorcolleagues if necessary. An early epidural may be advisable, depending on the clinical scenario.
13.3 What midwifery support should be available during labour to obese women?
Women with class III obesity who are in established labour should receive continuous
midwifery care, with consideration of additional measures to prevent pressure sores andmonitor the fetal condition.P
Continuous midwifery care is recommended for all women in established labour as per NICE CG190.127
Women with class III obesity need extra vigilance regarding care of pressure areas and ensuring normal
labour progress. Fetal heart rate monitoring can be a challenge and close surveillance is required withrecourse to fetal scalp electrode or ultrasound assessment of the fetal heart if necessary.Evidence

13.4 What speciﬁc interventions may be required during labour and birth for women with
maternal obesity?
In the absence of current evidence, intrapartum care should be provided in accordance with
NICE CG190.P
Women with a BMI 40 kg/m2or greater should have venous access established early in labour
and consideration should be given to the siting of a second cannula.P
Although active management of the third stage of labour is advised for all women, theincreased risk of PPH in those with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m
2makes this even more
important.B
A systematic review of eight studies149including 364 771 women concluded that healthy nulliparous
women with obesity are subject to increased interventions during labour and birth compared withnormal-weight women. Interventions included early hospitalisation, artiﬁcial rupture of membranes,epidural analgesia, induction of labour and augmentation of labour. Future studies are needed to evaluatematernal and neonatal outcomes with and without the use of interventions. Intrapartum care should beprovided in accordance with NICE CG190.

Establishing venous access in women with class III obesity is more likely to be difﬁcult than in women with class I
and II obesity. It is important that this is not attempted for the ﬁrst time in an emergency situation when urgent
venous access is required for intravenous medication or for resuscitation.
Women with obesity are at increased risk of PPH. There is strong evidence from the general maternity
population that active management of the third stage of labour reduces the risk of PPH, postpartumanaemia and the need for blood transfusion.

13.5 What speciﬁc surgical techniques are recommended for performing caesarean section on the
obese woman (including incision, closure)?
There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support the use of one surgical approach over
another. Surgical approaches should therefore follow NICE CG132 but clinicians may decide
alternative approaches are merited depending on individual circumstances.P
Surgical access to the uterus can be very challenging in some women with obesity due to the presence of a large
panniculus. It is important that an additional experienced assistant is present during the surgical procedure. Severaldifferent surgical approaches have been described in obese women, including vertical and transverse suprapannus skinincisions, to avoid pannus retraction.
151–157Compared with transverse infrapanniculus incisions, vertical
suprapanniculus incisions are associated with increased operative morbidity, including bleeding and classical
hysterotomy,144and prolonged postoperative hypoxaemia and respiratory compromise.158,159Evidence is conﬂicting
about whether the risk of surgical site infections is increased,151,157,160,161decreased155or unchanged154,162 –164with
vertical suprapanniculus incisions. The alternative suprapanniculus approach is to use a transverse as opposed to avertical skin incision
165but there is a paucity of evidence on clinical outcomes following this approach.
13.6 What postoperative wound care is recommended following caesarean section in women
with obesity?
Women with class I obesity or greater having a caesarean section are at increased risk of
wound infection and should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery .A
Women undergoing caesarean section who have more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have
suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space in order to reduce the risk of wound infection andwound separation.A
There is a lack of good-quality evidence to recommend the routine use of negative pressuredressing therapy, barrier retractors and insertion of subcutaneous drains to reduce the risk ofwound infection in obese women requiring caesarean sections.B

A retrospective observational study of 287 213 singleton pregnancies15reported an aOR of 2.24 (99% CI,
1.91–2.64) for wound infection in obese women compared with healthy weight women. In the general
maternity population, a systematic review of randomised trials in women undergoing elective ornonelective caesarean sections
166showed that the incidence of wound infections was signiﬁcantly reduced
with antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. Compared with placebo or no treatment,the use of prophylactic antibiotics in women undergoing caesarean section reduced the incidence ofwound infection (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 –0.46; 82 studies; 14 407 women), endometritis (RR 0.38, 95% CI
0.34–0.42; 83 studies; 13 548 women) and maternal serious infectious complications (RR 0.31, 95% CI
0.20–0.49; 32 studies; 6159 women). Suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space should be performed as
recommended by NICE CG13 Caesarean section .

Two controlled trials168,169randomised 76 and 91 women, respectively, who had at least 2 cm
subcutaneous fat to closure or nonclosure of the subcutaneous tissue space. Meta-analysis167of these
randomised controlled trials showed that closure of the subcutaneous space decreased the incidence ofwound complications (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 –0.81).Evidence
level 1 ++
A systematic review and meta-analysis in the nonobstetric population,170including nine randomised
controlled trials and 15 observational studies, concluded that the use of negative pressure wound therapysigniﬁcantly reduced surgical site infections in randomised controlled trials (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 –0.96;
P=0.04) and observational studies (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.32 –0.42; P<0.00001). These results were found
to be consistent in clean and clean-contaminated surgery with different types of procedures, but not inorthopaedic or trauma surgery.Evidence

However, there is insufﬁcient evidence for negative pressure dressings in the obese obstetric
population,156,157other practices to reduce surgical site infections, including insertion of subcutaneous

14. Postnatal care and follow-up after pregnancy
14.1 How can the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding in women with maternal obesity
be optimised?
Obesity is associated with low breastfeeding initiation and maintenance rates. Women with a
booking BMI 30 kg/m2or greater should receive appropriate specialist advice and support
antenatally and postnatally regarding the bene ﬁts, initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.P
Maternal obesity is associated with a physiological delay in lactogenesis, lower rates of breastfeeding
initiation, earlier cessation of breastfeeding and earlier introduction of solids.40,175,176Evidence
level 2 ++
This is likely to be multifactorial in origin and may be due to women’s perceptions of breastfeeding, difﬁculty
with correct positioning of the baby and the possibility of an impaired prolactin response to suckling.177Evidence

Evidence derived from randomised controlled trials178,179in the general maternity population shows that
breastfeeding education and support is associated with higher breastfeeding initiation rates and, in some
instances, longer durations of breastfeeding.Evidence
level 1 +
Dedicated breastfeeding support during the postnatal period is needed as the onset of breastfeeding is likely to be
more complicated than for other women. Extra help is needed to ensure frequent and effective milk removal tostimulate lactogenesis, and assistance with physical difﬁculties attaching the newborn infant to large breasts.
180–182
14.2 What ongoing care, including postnatal contraception advice, should be provided to women
with maternal obesity following pregnancy?
Maternal obesity should be considered when making the decision regarding the most
appropriate form of postnatal contraception.P
Postnatal contraception advice should be given according to the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive
Healthcare guidelines183,184which recognise that women with obesity are at increased risk of VTE if they
take the hormonal contraceptive pill.Evidence
level 2 /C0
to 2++
14.3 What information should be given postnatally to obese women about their long-term health
risks and those of their children?
Refer to NICE CG189. Women with class I obesity or greater at booking should continue to be
offered nutritional advice following childbirth from an appropriately trained professional, with aview to weight reduction in line with NICE Public health guideline 27.D
Women who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes should have postnatal follow-up inline with NICE Guideline 3.D
Clinicians should refer to NICE CG189.38A small number of randomised controlled trials185–187have
assessed the effect of postnatal lifestyle interventions on weight reduction. Modiﬁcation of dietary andphysical activity behaviours are associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in body weight compared with nolifestyle intervention. Maternity services need to identify what services are available locally to provide thisfollow-up.Evidence
level 1 /C0
A systematic review and meta-analysis188found that women with gestational diabetes mellitus had an
increased risk of developing type II diabetes compared with those who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy(RR 7.43, 95% CI 4.79 –11.51).
In an earlier systematic review,
189there was a steep increase in incidence of type II diabetes within the
ﬁrst 5 years following a pregnancy with gestational diabetes. However, after 5 years, the conversion ofgestational diabetes to type II diabetes appeared to plateau.Evidence

Data from an observational cohort study of 330 Danish women with diet-treated gestational diabetes
showed that 41% of these women developed diabetes during a median of 10 years follow-up.80This
reﬂected a doubling of the risk compared with an earlier cohort of 241 women with gestational diabetes
followed by the same research group 10 years previously. Being overweight (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 –3.4) or
obese (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5 –4.5) prepregnancy was found to be a signiﬁcant risk factor for the
development of type II diabetes in these women.Evidence
level 2 +
14.4 What support can be given in the community to ensure minimal interpregnancy weight gain
or to minimise risks of a future pregnancy?
Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight
management services where these are available.P
Even modest postpartum weight retention is associated with a heightened risk of adverse outcomes in
subsequent pregnancies, including hypertensive disease, diabetes and stillbirth.190Greater attention should
be paid to interventions to help women reduce their weight following pregnancy to achieve a healthy BMI.Evidence
level 4
15. Management of pregnancy following bariatric surgery
15.1 What are the clinical risks of previous bariatric surgery to maternal and fetal health during
pregnancy?
A minimum waiting period of 12 –18 months after bariatric surgery is recommended before
attempting pregnancy to allow stabilisation of body weight and to allow the correctidenti ﬁcation and treatment of any possible nutritional de ﬁciencies that may not be evident
during the ﬁrst months.D
A meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies191compared obese women who had undergone bariatric surgery
with obese women who had not undergone bariatric surgery. The analysis concluded that women whohad undergone bariatric surgery had lower odds of gestational diabetes (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 –0.65),
hypertensive disorders (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 –0.78) and macrosomia (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 –0.67).
However, the odds for small-for-gestational-age newborns was increased (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.38 –2.66).Evidence
level 2 +
Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 nonrandomised cohort and case –control studies192
concluded that obese women who had bariatric surgery had a lower incidence of pre-eclampsia (OR 0.45,
95% CI 0.25 –0.80; P=0.007), gestational diabetes (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.40 –0.56; P<0.001) and large-for-
gestational-age neonates (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 –0.62; P<0.001), while a higher incidence of small-for-
gestational-age neonates (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.52 –2.44; P<0.001), preterm birth (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 –
1.58; P=0.006), admission for neonatal intensive care (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02 –1.72; P=0.03) and
maternal anaemia (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.56 –7.44; P=0.002) was identiﬁed.Evidence

A review of the current evidence193concluded that there is a better overall obstetric outcome after
bariatric surgery compared with women with class III obesity who are managed conservatively. A
reduction in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorders,
macrosomia and congenital defects were observed. However, the risk of potential maternal nutritionaldeﬁciencies and newborn small for gestational age cannot be overlooked. Results concerning the incidenceof preterm birth and the number of caesarean sections are less consistent.Evidence
level 2 ++
15.2 How should women with previous bariatric surgery be cared for during pregnancy?
Women with previous bariatric surgery have high-risk pregnancies and should have consultant-
led antenatal care.P
Women with previous bariatric surgery should have nutritional surveillance and screening fordeﬁciencies during pregnancy.D
Woman with previous bariatric surgery should be referred to a dietician for advice with regard
to their specialised nutritional needs.D
Pregnancy can exacerbate nutritional deﬁciencies that predate pregnancy. Women, particularly those with
malabsorptive procedures involving anatomical changes in the gastrointestinal tract, are at high risk of
micronutritional deﬁciencies (including vitamin B12, iron, folate and fat-soluble vitamins) and macronutritionaldeﬁciencies (mainly fat and protein).
A few studies
194–197have evaluated the nutritional state of women during pregnancy following bariatric
surgery. Although these are limited by small sample sizes and lack of appropriate controls, these womenare at increased risk of anaemia and low B12 levels. Relevant information should be requested from theparent bariatric surgery team. Women who have undergone previous gastric band insertion should haveconsideration of deﬂation for the duration of pregnancy dependent upon the circumstances of the woman.Hyperemesis may be pathological and related to an internal hernia or gastric band slip. Certain
procedures are associated with an increased risk of reﬂux and aspiration –gastric band and sleeve
gastrectomy. The major thrust of care will be vitamin and mineral supplementation during pregnancy,which requires specialist dietetic support.
198Based on this evidence, joint guidelines generated by the
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, The Obesity Society, and American Society for Metabolicand Bariatric Surgery recommend that women with previous surgery have nutritional surveillance andscreening every trimester.
199However, although supplementation may partially correct nutritional
deﬁciencies,200there is a paucity of evidence about what the optimal basal supplementation should be in
clinical practice.Evidence

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classi ﬁcation of evidence levels Grades of recommendation

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
