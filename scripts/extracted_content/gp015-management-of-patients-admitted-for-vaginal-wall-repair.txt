Date of Issue : 31st October 2014 Review Date: 31st October 2017 OBJECTIVE STANDARDS 
 
1.0 VAGINAL WALL PROLAPSE 
 
1.0.1 Vaginal wall prolapse or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the herniation 
of the bladder, rectum or uterus due to a failure of ligamentous & 
fascial support of these organs. 
 
1.0.2 It is a common problem. In the women’s health initiative (WHI) trial in 
USA 40 % of the participants had some degree of prolapse, 14 % of 
them had uterine prolapse. 
 
1.0.3 In UK, it accounts for 20% of women waiting for gynaecology surgery. 
 
1.0.4 Vaginal wall repairs can be done for the anterior and/ or posterior 
vaginal wall. It is also known as Pelvic Floor Repair. It involves fascial 
support of the prolapsed organ (Perivesical or pub cervical fascia in 
case of prolapsed urinary bladder or perirectal fascia in case of 
prolapsed rectum). 
 
1.0.5 The surgical repair can be done under general anaesthesia (GA), 
spinal anaesthesia or local anaesthetic infiltration (LA) either with or 
without sedation. 
 
1.0.6 The patient can go home on the same day of the procedure unless 
there is a medical or social reason to keep her in over night, which 
should be identified before the procedure in the urogynaecology clinic, 
during the booking process. 
 
1.0.7 This guideline should be read in conjunction with other guidelines 
relating to the management of patients admitted for operative 
proce dures, such as thromboprophylaxis and consent guidelines. 
 
1.0.8 These guidelines are applicable to patients who are admitted to 
gynaecology ward or those who are fulfilling the criteria for day surgery 
unit (DSU) admission.

Urogynaecology Protocol: GP015 Management of Patients Admitted for Vaginal Wall Repair 
Date of Issue : 31st October 2014 Review Date: 31st October 2017 1.1 PRE-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT 
 
1.1.1 Not a ll cases admitted for vaginal wall repair require rectal enema or 
perineal s having . 
 
1.1.2 All cases admitted for vaginal wall repair need to be fasted for six 
hours . 
 
1.1.3 The patient will ha ve the routine observation, r outine checks and the 
routine enhanced re covery programme (ERP) whether she is on 
gynaecology ward or on the day surgery unit. 
 
1.1.4 Enhanced Recovery Programme . http://nww.bsuh.nhs.uk/the -
trust/safety -and-quality/safety/initiatives/enhanced -recovery -
programme/ 
 
1.1.5 The patient will be seen by the consultant for preoperative counselling 
and consenting 
 
1.1.6 Cases admitted for repair under Local Anaesthesia 
 
- Ibuprofen 400mg PO 
 
- If Ibuprofen is contraindicated then, Cocodamol 30/500 two tablets 
PO 
 
- To facilitate the administration of the medications on time, the 
prescriptions should be written in clinic. 
 
- If no prescriptions available at the time of admission then the 
consultant or one of his team will prescribe it during the 
preoperative ward round, otherwise the SHO on -call for 
Gynaecology is to be called no later than 8:00am to prescribe it. 
 
1.2 POST -OPERATIVE BLADDER CARE 
 
1.2.1 Insertion of a catheter should be at the discretion of the surgeon. 
 
1.2.2 That applies regardless of the type of anaesthesia, unless it is stated 
clearly in the post operative care plan. 
 
1.2.3 Ensure patient passes urine before discharge. No need for bladder 
scan, especially if the patient passes more than 200 - 250mls of urine. 
 
1.2.4 If the patient does not pass urine but feels an urge to do so, then a 
Foley’s catheter is to be inserted with flip flow valve. 
 
1.2.5 Record the amount of urine drained and allow home on the same day 
unless there is another indica tion to keep her over night.

Urogynaecology Protocol: GP015 Management of Patients Admitted for Vaginal Wall Repair 
Date of Issue : 31st October 2014 Review Date: 31st October 2017 1.2.6 The patient who goes home on the same day with a catheter in, should 
be reassured that this is a rare complication and is self limiting in most 
of the cases. 
 
1.2.7 These patients should be seen either on gynaecology w ard or at VLH 
according to the patient’s preference, to try passing urine without a 
catheter (TWC) 48 hours later. 
 
1.2.8 If the voiding difficulty continues after 48 hours, then the catheter with 
valve should be left in for another week. Alternatively, the patient could 
be taught intermittent clean self catheterisation (ICSC) under the care 
community continence nurses or uro logy nurse specialist at BSUH and 
review the nurse weekly until the problem resolves. 
 
1.2.9 Please keep the surgeon informed. 

1.3 POST -OPERATIVE PRESCRIPTION AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
1.3.1 Patients who had the repair under LA infiltration or spinal can eat & 
drink o nce they are on gynaecology ward or the DSU recovery. 
 
1.3.2 Patients who had repair under GA can eat & drink once they are fully 
conscious and after assessment by the nursing staff. 
 
1.3.3 It is acceptable for the patients to have a mild blood loss follow ing the 
repair (similar to what would be expected at the end of a period) 
especially if vaginal pack was not used. The patient would have been 
informed about this loss preoperatively and should be reassured. 
 
1.3.4 The patient can go home once she passes u rine and feels well enough 
to go home. 
 
1.3.5 Regular analgesia for 48 hours then PRN for 5 days: 
Ibuprofen 400mg PO tds 
And 
Paracetamol 1 gm tds 
 
1.3.6 Lactulose 10mls bd for 3 weeks 
 
1.3.7 Follow up in GOPD in 3 months
