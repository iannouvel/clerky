RECOMMENDED CHANGES IN PRACTICE
1. Postmenopausal women without bleeding or risk factors do
not need investigations if they are found to have
endometrial thickness <11 mm on ultrasound.
2. Further endometrial investigations should be decided on an
individual basis, based on speci ﬁc ultrasound ﬁndings and
the patient ’s personal risk for endometrial cancer.
KEY MESSAGES
1. Routine pelvic ultrasound is not recommended to screen for
endometrial cancer.
2. Most patients who have endometrial cancer present with
postmenopausal bleeding.
3. Asymptomatic endometrial thickening is common, and an
endometrium <11 mm is associated with an extremely low
risk of malignancy.
4. Patients who have endometrial thickening and other risk
factors may be considered for further endometrialassessments based on their individual risk factors and
ultrasound ﬁndings.
5. Hormone therapies, if given in a continuous combined
formulation, do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
6. Patients on tamoxifen should not have routine ultrasound
assessment if they are asymptomatic.
7. Endometrial biopsy in a patient with global thickening on
ultrasound has a high rate of accuracy, if an adequate
sample and pathological result is obtained.
8. Invasive endometrial procedures have a low but not
insigni ﬁcant complication risk.
ABSTRACT
Objective: To formulate strategies for clinical assessments for
endometrial thickening on ultrasound in a postmenopausal woman
without bleeding.Target population: Postmenopausal women of any age.
Outcomes: To reduce unnecessary invasive interventions and
investigations in women with asymptomatic endometrial
thickening while selectively investigating women at risk for
endometrial cancer.
Bene ﬁts, harms, and costs: It is anticipated that the adoption of these
recommendations would save postmenopausal women
unnecessary anxiety, pain, and risk of procedural complications. Itis also expected to decrease the cost to the health care system byeliminating unnecessary interventions.
Evidence: English language articles from Medline, Cochrane, and
PubMed databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles dating from1995 to 2022 (e.g., asymptomatic endometrial thickness,endometrial cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, transvaginal
ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, cervical stenosis, hormone
therapies and the endometrium, tamoxifen, tibolone, aromataseinhibitors). Results were restricted to systematic reviews and meta-
analyses, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and
observational studies.
Validation Methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and
strength of recommendations using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach. See Appendix A (Tables A1 for de ﬁnitions and
A2for interpretations of strong and conditional [weak]
recommendations).
Intended Audience: Physicians, including gynaecologists,
obstetricians, family physicians, radiologists, pathologists, andinternists; nurse practitioners and nurses; medical trainees,including medical students, residents, and fellows; and other
providers of health care of the postmenopausal population.
Social Media Abstract: Postmenopausal women often have a
thickening of the lining of the uterus found during ultrasound.
Without bleeding, an endometrium <11 mm is rarely a serious
problem but should be evaluated by a health care provider.
SUMMARY STATEMENTS
1. Asymptomatic endometrial thickening >5 mm is found in 3% e15%
of postmenopausal women depending on the population studied(moderate ).
2. Ninety percent of postmenopausal women with endometrial cancer
present with bleeding ( high).
3. In postmenopausal women without bleeding and an endometrium
<11 mm, the incidence of endometrial cancer is approximately 1%
(high).
4. Endometrial biopsy is an accurate procedure if an adequate tissue
sample is obtained in a patient with global thickening ( high).
5. Hormone replacement therapies, if used in a continuous combined
formulation, do not increase the risk of uterine cancer ( high).
6. Women prescribed tamoxifen do not require screening ultrasound
examinations ( high).
7. Cervical stenosis may complicate the ability to obtain an adequate
endometrial pathological sample ( high).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Indications for endometrial tissue sampling in patients presenting
with postmenopausal bleeding should not be extrapolated toasymptomatic women ( strong, high ).
2. A woman who has an endometrial thickness >11 mm and/or other
positive ﬁndings on ultrasound, such as increased vascularity, in-
homogeneity of the endometrium, or particulate ﬂuid, should have
endometrial sampling or be referred to a gynaecologist for further
investigations ( strong, moderate
).

asymptomatic women with increased endometrial thickening andrisk factors for endometrial cancer, such as obesity, hypertension,
late menopause, unopposed estrogen use, and genetic cancer
risks ( conditional, moderate ).
4. Postmenopausal women without bleeding, no risk factors, and a

and insuf ﬁcient endometrial sampling, further investigations
should include hysterosonogram, diagnostic hysteroscopy,dilation and curettage, or watchful monitoring ( conditional,
low).
7. Women taking hormone therapy in a continuous combined
formulation without bleeding do not require screening ultrasounds
(strong, high ).
8. Women who are amenorrheic on hormone therapies and develop
new bleeding should be investigated ( strong, low ).
9. Asymptomatic women on tamoxifen should not receive routine/
screening ultrasound ( strong, high ).
10. Women with cervical stenosis and no bleeding should be managed
individually depending on the endometrial thickness, appearance
of the endometrium on ultrasound, and the patient ’s individual risk
factors ( strong, low ).

SOGC guideline no. 249, Asymptomatic Endome-
trial Thickening, was published in the JOGC in
October 20101and updated in 2018.2This guideline
has been one of the most requested SOGC guidelines
because of widespread use of pelvic and abdominal
ultrasound for investigation of common clinical sce-
narios, such as lower abdominal pain, bloating andevaluation of the adnexa, and the prevalence of
asymptomatic thickening ( >4e5 mm) in the general
postmenopausal population
3,4(3%e15% or higher,
depending on the study).
Theﬁnding of asymptomatic endometrial thickening on
ultrasound represents a clinical management dilemma
and constitutes a frequent reason for referral to gynae-
cologists. The primary reason to conduct further in-vestigations in women with asymptomatic endometrial
thickening is to rule out endometrial malignancy. The
2018 guideline
2concluded that the ri sk of malignancy in
women who are not bleeding with an endometrium
thickness <11 mm was extremely low and that further
investigations should be individualized based on patient
risk factors.5,6
This current guideline was developed to re-evaluate the
literature on asymptomatic thickening since the publication
of the 2010 guideline and its re-approval in 2018. Asendometrial polyps account for a large proportion of
thickening, a separate new document has been written for
this clinical entity.

Deﬁnition
Asymptomatic endometrial thickening is de ﬁned as an
endometrial thickness >5 mm discovered in a post-
menopausal woman who is not experiencing vaginal
bleeding. The measurement combines the width of the
anterior and posterior layers of the endometrium of the
midline sagittal image on transvaginal ultrasound.
In a menstruating woman, this thickness re ﬂects the
endometrial changes associated with the phase of the
menstrual cycle that occur due to hormonal ﬂuctuations.
The endometrium ranges from 3 mm after menses to 15mm in the luteal phase. In the ﬁrst year after the last
menstrual period, the normal endometrium is often
thicker than it will be several years after menopause,
reﬂecting declining residual levels of estrogen.
8In a
postmenopausal woman several years after the last men-
strual period, the endometrium is typically less than
4e5 mm thick.9,10Ultrasound Characterization, Anatomy, and
Pathology of Endometrial Thickening in
Postmenopausal Women
Characteristics of the endometrium on ultrasound exami-
nation include global or diffuse thickening, heterogeneity,
ﬂuid collections, increased vascularity, and focal areas of
thickening with or without feeding vessels.
Ultrasound measurement over 4 e5 mm may also re ﬂect
structural abnormalities such as a uterine septum, sub-
mucous myomas, polyps, synechiae or scars, or adeno-
myosis. Ultrasound technology, by identifying vascular ﬂow,
allows differentiation of polyps from other abnormalities.11
Findings of increased vascularity and ﬂuid accumulation
(especially particulate) in association with endometrial
thickening may warrant further investigations.11
After menopause, the range of biopsy results for endo-metrial thickening include atrophic endometrium, prolif-
erative endometrium, secretory endometrium, polyps,
endometritis, cystic atrophy, cystic hyperplasia, complex
hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, or carcinoma of the
endometrium.

RISK FACTORS FOR ENDOMETRIAL CANCER/
HYPERPLASIA IN WOMEN WITH ASYMPTOMATICENDOMETRIAL THICKENING
Certain clinical characteristics, namely BMI >30, use of
antihypertensive medication, and use of estrogen andprogesterone therapy are associated with endometrial
thickening.
13e16
In patients presenting with endometrial thickening, several
risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer should
be considered. Increasing age,17,18nulliparity,19,20
obesity,17e19,21,22hypertension,19,20,22,23diabetes,17,19,20,22
and tamoxifen use19,22,24have consistently been associ-
ated with increased risk of hyperplasia. Other clinicalcharacteristics, such as menopausal status,
17polycystic
ovary syndrome,25a long menstrual history (early
menarche, late menopause),22and infertility22may also
increase the risk of hyperplasia, based on results from
select studies. Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary non-
polyposis colorectal cancer) is an inherited risk factor for
hyperplasia and endometrial cancer,26and patients with
this syndrome should be managed in clinics with special
expertise, as these guidelines do not apply to them.26
Exposure to estrogen and progesterone hormone ther-apy post menopause has been demonstrated to increasethe risk of hyperplasia in some studies
19,22but not in
others.27Regimens for hormone therapy including long

sequential formulation) have been associated with a higher
risk of endometrial cancer.28In the Women ’s Health
Initiative randomized trial, women receiving hormone
therapy demonstrated a nonsigni ﬁcant lower incidence of
endometrial cancer diagnoses, compared with those not
receiving hormone therapy (13 fewer cases per 10 000).27
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecologicmalignancy. The incidence and mortality of endometrial
cancer in Canada is 36.8 and 5.9 per 100 000.
29Endometrial
cancer is typically diagnosed in postmenopausal women,
who usually present with postmenopausal bleeding. The
incidence of endometrial cancer in women between ages 30
and 49 years who present with irregular bleeding is on the
rise in Ontario, consistent with trends in other countries30
(see SOGC guidelines 390 and 291).31,32Approximately
90% of women with endometrial cancer will present withpostmenopausal (or abnormal) uterine bleeding.
27,33In
postmenopausal women without bleeding, the absolute risk
of endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia is low (0.62%
and 0.59%, respectively).34For asymptomatic endometrial
thickness, an individualized risk assessment that considers
patient and imaging risk factors balanced against the
possible complications and cost of investigations, is neces-
sary. Endometrial cancer typically presents with signi ﬁcantly
elevated endometrial thickness (mean ¼20±4m m
compared to mean ¼4±1 mm in women with normal
endometrium).35These estimates are for women presenting
with bleeding. A recent retrospective study involving non-
bleeding women with endometrial thicknesses >10 mm
and<10 mm found that the prevalence of endometrial
malignancy was 6.3% and 1.7%, respectively ( P¼0.023).7
It is important to consider that type 2 endometrial cancer,
which is more virulent (e.g., papillary serous, clear cell,
mucinous, carcinosarcoma, and poorly differentiated sub-
types), tends to arise from atrophic endometrium and is not
associated with hormonal stimulation.
There does not appear to be a survival advantage in
diagnosing endometrial cancer in women who are
asymptomatic versus those who are bleeding.36

Recommendations 1, 2, and 3
INCIDENCE OF ASYMPTOMATIC ENDOMETRIAL
THICKENING ON ULTRASOUND
An incidental ﬁnding of thickened endometrium ( >4m m )m a y
be detected in approximately 3% e15% of postmenopausalwomen,3,37e39though ﬁgures vary widely depending on pa-
tient selection in the research and clinical setting. While an
incidental ﬁnding of a thickened endometrium is not uncom-
mon, it is not on its own diagnostic of endometrial pathology,
and endometrial sampling is required for precise pathologic
diagnosis.
The American Cancer Society; European Society for
Medical Oncology; European Society for Radiotherapyand Oncology and European Society of Gynaecological
Oncology;
40and American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists10do not recommend routine endometrial
cancer screening for average-risk asymptomatic patients.
There is no evidence that this screening reduces mortality
from endometrial cancer. Screening asymptomatic women
increases anxiety and complications from biopsies.
Most cases of endometrial cancer are identi ﬁed because of
symptoms, especially bleeding. A high proportion of these
cases are diagnosed at an early stage, with high rates of survival.
STUDIES ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
ASYMPTOMATIC ENDOMETRIAL THICKENING
There is a lack of consensus on the signi ﬁcance and
management of an incidental ﬁnding of endometrial
thickening in asymptomatic postmenopausal women, and
studies have sought to determine the ideal threshold forendometrial thickness at which additional investigation
with endometrial sampling is recommended.
41
Smith-Bindman et al. performed a decision analysis to
estimate the endometrial thickness threshold that should
be considered abnormal in asymptomatic postmenopausal
women, incorporating published and unpublished data to
model outcomes in a theoretical cohort of postmenopausal
women aged 50 years or older, not receiving hormonetherapy.
5They calculated that in postmenopausal women
without vaginal bleeding, the risk of cancer is approxi-
mately 0.002% when the endometrium is /C2011 mm thick
and 6.7% when the endometrium is thicker than 11 mm.
This is similar to the risk differential in the setting of
postmenopausal bleeding when the endometrial thickness
cutoff of 5 mm is used.
Alcazar et al. published a systematic review and meta-
analysis that included 9 studies and 4751 post-
menopausal women not on hormone replacement therapy,tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitors. The mean prevalence
of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia with atypia among
women with endometrial thicknesses /C2111 mm was 6.5%
(range 0% e15%), while the mean prevalence in women

0.1%e5.1%). Compared with women with an endometrial
thickness <11 mm, those with a thickness >11 mm had a
2.59-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer or hyper-
plasia with atypia.42
Since the publication of this systematic review, additional
studies have proposed similar endometrial thickness
thresholds for endometrial sampling. Using receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholds of /C2110
mm (n ¼1995)
38and/C2112 mm (n ¼488)43have been
separately proposed, with no conclusive threshold found
in another study.39
Another study involved 602 postmenopausal women with
vaginal bleeding or asymptomatic thickened endometrium
who were evaluated and divided into 2 groups of symp-
tomatic or bleeding women (n ¼274) and asymptomatic
or non-bleeding women with an incidental ﬁnding of
thickened endometrium ( >5 mm; n ¼328). Women in
both groups underwent endometrial biopsy for histo-
pathologic examination. Endometrial carcinoma was
detected in 8 women (2.9%) in group 1 and in 3 (0.9%) in
group 2. The best cutoff point for endometrial thickness in
predicting endometrial carcinoma in group 1 was 8.2 mm,
which provided 75% sensitivity (95% CI 40.9% e92.9%)
and 74% speci ﬁcity (95% CI 68% e78.5%). In group 2,
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.76 (95% CI
0.46e1.00; P¼0.114); the evidence was inconclusive as to
the relationship between endometrial thickness and
malignancy.39
Another recent systematic review re-examined the optimal
endometrial thickness threshold for diagnosing endome-
trial cancer.44Although the authors of that study cautioned
that there are signi ﬁcant limitations in the studies currently
available, a review of 7 studies (n ¼2986), found that 12
mm was the optimal diagnosis threshold for endometrialcancer in asymptomatic postmenopausal women (AUC
0.716; 95% CI 0.534 e0.897, P¼0.019).
An observational study of 1024 women in Austria not on
tamoxifen and without Lynch syndrome with thickened
endometrium on ultrasound who underwent histological
assessment surgically con ﬁrmed this thickness cutoff of 11
mm.
45
While asymptomatic endometrial thickening may be re-
ported as an isolated incidental ﬁnding, several studies
have suggested increased risk for endometrial cancer or
hyperplasia with atypia when increased vascularity is
present.43In summary, women with endometrial thickening /C2111 mm
or increased vascularity on ultrasound warrant additional
investigation by a gynaecologist for consideration of
endometrial biopsy.

INVESTIGATIONS: ACCURACY OF BLIND
ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY
Endometrial biopsy is required for assessment of endo-
metrial tissue, and options include blind outpatient endo-
metrial biopsy, dilation and curettage, or preferably
hysteroscopy-guided biopsy. Advantages of blind outpa-
tient endometrial biopsy compared with dilation and
curettage and hysteroscopy include cost savings and its
minimally invasive nature. Interestingly, agreement rate on
tumour grade from preoperative endometrial sampling to
ﬁnal diagnosis in patients found to have endometrial car-
cinoma was not signi ﬁcantly higher in hysteroscopic biopsy
versus of ﬁce endometrial biopsy in one systemic review.46
The Pipelle suction-piston device was found to be the best
and most frequently evaluated device in several systemic
reviews and meta-analyses, with a sensitivity of 99.6% in
detecting endometrial carcinoma and a 81% sensitivity in
detecting atypical endometrial hyperplasia (speci ﬁcity
>98%).47,48Diagnostic accuracy was higher in post-
menopausal women compared with premenopausal
women (sensitivity 99.6% vs. 91%, respectively).47In a
systematic review of 1013 patients, the overall failure rate
of outpatient biopsy was 7% (95% CI 5% e8%) with 6
devices tested (Accurette, Gynoscann, Novak curette,
Vabra aspirator, Z-sampler, and Pipelle), compared with
8% (95% CI 6% e11%) in studies using only the Pipelle.48
Overall, 15% of samples procured with all devices were
histologically inadequate (95% CI 12% e17%), compared
with 13% of samples procured with the Pipelle (95% CI
10%e16%).48Postmenopausal women had increased
failure rates for outpatient biopsy along with increased
rates of inadequate tissue samples (12% and 22%,
respectively).48With the Pipelle device, the post-test
probability of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal
women was calculated to be 82.7% for a positive test and
0.8% for a negative test (pretest probability 6.9%, (CI
4.4e10)).48Hence, a negative test result has high negative
predictive value in someone with low pretest probability.
Endometrial biopsy is a successful procedure with a high
overall accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer when

endometrial thickening. If inadequate tissue is found (i.e.,
determined by the pathologist to be insuf ﬁcient for eval-
uation) or scant tissue is retrieved after several Pipelle
passes, additional diagnostic tests or watchful evaluation
with repeat ultrasound imaging after 4 months may be
necessary, depending on the clinical scenario, the concern
on initial ultrasound appearance, and the patient ’s wishes,
if the risk of malignancy is calculated to be low.44See
Figure 1 for an algorithm of suggested management.
Summary Statement 4 and Recommendation 6
ENDOMETRIAL EFFECTS OF MENOPAUSAL
HORMONE THERAPIES
Systemic Menopausal Hormone Treatments
The thickness of the endometrium in a postmenopausal
woman should be <4e5 mm. Various menopausal hor-
mone products have been shown to affect endometrial
thickness, depending on the type, dosage, and regimen.
The use of unopposed systemic estrogen has been shown
to increase endometrial thickness.49,50One prospectiverandomized controlled trial studying the effects of conju-
gated equine estrogen at a dosage of 0.625 mg daily re-
ported an increase of 5.5 mm in endometrial thickness
after 52 weeks of use.50
A Cochrane review51,52reported both a dose-response and
duration-of-use-response relationship between the use of
oral estrogen alone and the risk of hyperplasia over 1 e3
years of use. With the lowest dose regimens (i.e., conju-gated equine estrogens at 0.45 mg and estradiol at 1 mg) a
marginally nonsigni ﬁcant increase in hyperplasia was re-
ported at 1 year; however, signi ﬁcant increases were seen
at both years 2 and 3 in this group, and an even more
striking increased risk was observed for the moderate-
(odds ratio [OR] 11.86) and high-dose estrogen groups
(OR 13.6). This same review reported no clinically sig-
niﬁcant increase in endometrial thickness or endometrial
hyperplasia for both continuous and sequential estrogen-progestin therapy regimens, although there is mixed evi-
dence for a variety of long cycle regimens.
28,51,52
Newer estrogen-progestin therapies and related products
continue to be developed for which either endometrial
thickness or endometrial biopsy hyperplasia data have
been collected. In prospective randomized controlled trials

0.25/50) for 12 months53;
/C15estradiol 1 mg þdrospirenone 2 mg for 12 months;

/C15the tissue selective estrogen complex tablet containing
conjugated equine estrogen 0.45 mg and bazedoxifene
20 mg once daily for 12 months.59
A Cochrane review of studies involving tibolone usersconcluded that there was no clear evidence of differences
in the risk of endometrial cancer between tibolone and
placebo. A recent prospective cohort study from Denmark
in a larger database of patients treated with tibolone be-
tween 1995 and 2009 did ﬁnd an increased risk of endo-
metrial cancer.
60,61
Not all selective estrogen receptor modulator and estrogen
combinations offer endometrial safety. A 1-year random-
ized controlled trial studying raloxifene 40 mg þestradiol
1 mg (oral, once daily) reported a signi ﬁcant increase in
endometrial thickness of 0.74 mm ( P<0.05). In this trial,
2 patients were found to have endometrial hyperplasia, 1
with atypia.62One study on the use of conjugated equine
estrogens 0.3 mg þraloxifene reported no change in
endometrial thickness.63
The use of transdermal testosterone as an adjunct to
estradiol has been studied, and no increase in endometrial
thickness or endometrial hyperplasia were reported.64,65
Complementary Treatments
There are limited quality studies exploring the effect of
herbal or complementary menopausal products on endo-
metrial thickness, and most are of short duration. A meta-
analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials related to a
variety of phytoestrogens (iso ﬂavone, genistein, daidzein,
lignans, S-equol and equol) used for up to 104 weeks re-
ported no increase in endometrial thickness. Data for
endometrial hyperplasia were not reported.66Treatments for Genitourinary Syndrome of
Menopause
Local (vaginal) hormone therapies contain estradiol; con-
jugated equine estrogen or estrone; dehydroepiandroster-
one (DHEA); or testosterone in a variety of preparations
and delivery systems.
A 2020 systematic review of 22 trials assessing endometrial
thickness and 15 trials with endometrial biopsies found no
clear evidence of endometrial proliferation after vaginal
estrogen therapy used for up to 52 weeks. No change in
endometrial thickness was reported for vaginal tablets, ring
or inserts with estradiol 4 mg, 10 mgo r2 5 mg, In head-to-
head studies, although a higher percentage of conjugated
equine estrogen cream users versus ring users were found
to have an endometrial thickness >5 mm (12% vs. 6%);
this difference was not statistically signi ﬁcant. A higher rate
of proliferative endometrium was also reported with theuse of vaginal conjugated equine estrogen cream; however,
the authors opined that these differences were attributable
to a higher dose of conjugated equine estrogen cream used
in the studies (1.25 mg 3 /C2wk vs. 0.3 e0.625 g 2 /C2wk).
Overall, there was no clear ﬁnding of endometrial prolif-
eration after vaginal estrogen therapy; however, not all
studies included endometrial biopsy.
67
Studies of a new low-dose vaginal estradiol soft gel (4 mg
and 10 mg dosages) did not assess changes in endometrial
thickness, but there was no hyperplasia.68
Studies of a DHEA vaginal insert, Prasterone 6.5 mg daily,
and of intravaginal testosterone69also reported either no
increase in endometrial thickness or endometrial
hyperplasia.70
Ospemifene is an oral selective estrogen receptor modu-
lator approved for the treatment of genitourinary syn-
drome of menopause. In studies, up to 52 weeks ofospemifene 60 mg daily, was associated with a modest
mean increase in endometrial thickness of 0.62 e0.81 mm,
but this ﬁnding was deemed clinically insigni ﬁcant. The
incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was found to be
<1%, with no cases of endometrial hyperplasia with atypia
reported.
71
Nonhormonal Options for Vasomotor Symptoms
In a phase 2b randomized controlled trial, fezolinetant, aneurokinin-3 receptor antagonist, at a variety of doses was
shown to have no impact on endometrial thickness, based
on 12 weeks of data.

First reported in the 1990s, postmenopausal patients on
tamoxifen therapy were found to have a thicker endome-
trium (10.4 [SD 5.2] mm vs. 4.2 [SD 2.8] mm; P¼0.0001)
compared with controls.73These ﬁndings were rapidly
conﬁrmed in other studies.73e76Average endometrial
thickness was 11.5 (SD 5.2) mm after 2.8 years of therapywith tamoxifen 20 mg daily.
77
The percentage of patients on tamoxifen having an
endometrial thickness >5 mm on transvaginal ultrasound
was found to be 53% e71% in women taking tamoxifen
compared with 12% in a control group.76,78,79Increase in
endometrial thickness was only signi ﬁcant in post-
menopausal or amenorrheic patients and not in premen-
opausal ones.75,76,80
On transvaginal ultrasound examination, the endometrium
of patients on tamoxifen is often described as irregular and
containing multiple cystic areas resembling “swiss cheese ”
or as a cystically thickened endometrium. In 50% e90% of
patients, this ultrasound ﬁnding is not associated with any
cavitary lesion, with both endometrial biopsy and hyster-
oscopy con ﬁrming an atrophic endometrium and histology
showing a condensated stroma and ﬂuid-ﬁlled, cystically
dilated glands lined with ﬂattened epithelium.80e82In most
studies, transvaginal ultrasound was unable to differentiatebetween signi ﬁcant endometrial pathology and endome-
trial glandulocystic atrophy.
80,82
Endometrial thickening on transvaginal ultrasound was
signiﬁcantly associated with postmenopausal bleeding79as
well as endometrial pathology, particularly endometrial
cancer.73,77,83No correlation between endometrial thick-
ness and duration of tamoxifen treatment was found.76
In multiple studies using 5 mm as the cutoff for further
investigation in women taking tamoxifen, the sensitivityand speci ﬁcity for positive histological ﬁndings varied
from 87.5% to 91% and from 19% to 96%, respec-
tively.
79,84,85Other studies have recommended against the
use of a single cutoff based on transvaginal ultrasound
alone, since some patients with thicknesses <5m mw e r e
found to have signi ﬁcant endometrial pathology, including
endometrial cancer.86
Endometrial thickness signi ﬁcantly decreased 6 months
after tamoxifen was ceased, and no difference in endo-
metrial thickness was noted between women on tamoxifen
and controls 1 year after the end of tamoxifen
treatment.81,87As stated in the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists ’2014 committee opinion, routine screening
of asymptomatic women on tamoxifen with transvaginal
ultrasound and/or endometrial sampling demonstrated no
beneﬁts, and it is not currently recommended.88,89Women
on tamoxifen should promptly report any abnormal
vaginal bleeding. Symptomatic women should be investi-
gated, and transvaginal ultrasound alone is not suf ﬁcient to
eliminate signi ﬁcant endometrial pathology in this higher
risk population.76,90Therefore, the management of
endometrial thickening, if found in an asymptomatic pa-
tient on tamoxifen, should be determined by a case-by-
case evaluation.
Aromatase Inhibitors
In one study, postmenopausal patients treated with ful-
vestrant were found to have signi ﬁcantly lower endome-
trial thicknesses than patients receiving placebo, even after
a 14-day course of ethinyl estradiol.91
In a study comparing endometrial thickness in patients
taking exemestane versus tamoxifen, patients on tamoxifen
were twice as likely to have endometrial thicknesses >5
mm compared with patients on exemestane after 24
months of treatment (35.5% vs. 61.8%; P¼0.004). This
difference appeared as early as 6 months of treatment and
was no longer visible 12 months after treatment comple-
tion. Patients who switched from tamoxifen to exemestane
had a rapid decrease in endometrial thickness within 6
months, mostly due to losing the stimulatory effect of
tamoxifen.92

APPROACH TO A STENOTIC CERVIX
An endometrial biopsy may be challenging to obtain in the
presence of a stenotic, tortuous cervix; extremes of uterine
ﬂexion or version; congenital anomalies; or scarring of the
cervix from previous surgery or radiation.93In these sit-
uations, it may be dif ﬁcult to obtain an adequate sample,
and attempts at biopsy may lead to increased patient
discomfort, as well as complications such as creation of
false passage, uterine perforation, and bleeding.94Cervical
stenosis is characterized as narrowing of the endocervicalcanal preventing passage of a 2.5 mm Hegar or Pratt
dilator.
93Stenosis of the external cervical os is described as
an external os diameter <4.5 mm.93,95Common risk
factors for cervical stenosis include nulliparity and

endometrial curettage and treatment of cervical
dysplasia.96,97
Medical Management
Prostaglandin E 1(misoprostol) has been suggested as a
treatment option for cervical stenosis. Although its
mechanism of action is not completely understood, it is
thought to be mediated by estrogen.93Misoprostol dos-
ages of 400 mg orally or 200 mg vaginally 9 to 12 hours
prior to hysteroscopy may be of bene ﬁt, as evidenced by
shorter procedure times and use of fewer dilators.98,99
Alternatively, 10 mg of vaginal prostaglandin E 2(dino-
prostone) can be considered.100Studies examining use of
misoprostol prior to attempted of ﬁce endometrial biopsy
or IUD insertion have not demonstrated a bene ﬁt.47,101,102
Furthermore, misoprostol is associated with several
adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, vaginal
bleeding, and abdominal/pelvic pain.103,104It is important
to consider that misoprostol may also be ineffective as a
cervical-ripening agent in postmenopausal women and
those treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone ana-
logs because of the hypoestrogenic state in these pa-
tients,105unless they have been pretreated with systematic
estrogen for 2 weeks prior.106
Osmotic dilators (laminaria tents) may facilitate cervicaldilation during operative hysteroscopy; however, place-
ment of laminaria requires some degree of cervical os
dilation, thereby limiting their use.
107
Operative Techniques
Cervical dilation may be associated with a few complica-tions. The overall risk of dilation and curettage and hys-
teroscopy is less than 1%, with uterine perforation
reported in 0.12% e0.76% of cases, depending on the
series reviewed.
108e110
Typically, cervical stenosis is managed with gradual dilation
using successively larger rigid dilators. This method may
lead to the creation of false passage or uterine perforation,
especially if uterine orientation is unknown or with ex-
tremes of uterine ﬂexion. Ultrasound guidance may miti-
gate this risk.111Use of intracervical dilute vasopressin
(0.05 U/mL) has been reported to reduce the force
required for cervical entry, but caution must be used, as
systematic in ﬁltration of vasopressin may result in car-
diovascular compromise.112
In certain cases, blind dilation of the cervical canal maylead to cervical laceration, creation of false passage, or
uterine perforation. A vaginoscopic approach may avoidthese complications, in which a small diameter (preferably
<5 mm) hysteroscope is used to directly visualize the
vagina and cervical canal before entering the uterus. This
approach may be used in an outpatient hysteroscopy
setting or in the operating room. At times, it may be
necessary to revise the cervical canal to gain access to the
uterus. This may be done with sharp dissection using
microscissors and/or blunt dissection with micro-
graspers.
113Other alternatives are using the cutting loop
electrode or laser to excise a small segment of the internal
os or using the hysteroscopic morcellator to access the
uterine cavity.113,114Bettocchi et al. described successful
approaches to accessing the uterine cavity in 98.5% of 10
156 cases of cervical stenosis, using hysteroscopic tech-
niques such as the push/spread technique, the micro-
scissor, micrograsper, and bipolar electrode.96
Hammoud et al. recently described ultrasound-guidedendometrial biopsy for patients with cervical stenosis
that involved bypassing the cervix.
115Under general
anesthetic, when cervical dilation failed, they describe ac-
cess through the anterior uterine wall by a 20 cm, 18- or
20-gauge needle inserted through the vaginal vault. This
technique is done under transabdominal ultrasound guid-
ance. Once intrauterine access is con ﬁrmed, the endo-
metrium is sampled.
Summary Statement 7 and Recommendation 10
CONCLUSION
Theﬁnding of endometrial thickening and the possibility
of uterine cancer causes anxiety in patients. Asymptomatic
endometrial thickening in postmenopausal women is
commonly found on an ultrasound examination. Hyper-
plasia is a pathological diagnosis made after tissue biopsy,
not a diagnosis that can be made on ultrasound. Although
the risk of endometrial cancer is relatively low in women
with no bleeding, the disease has the best outcomes when
found at an early stage, usually when postmenopausalwomen present with bleeding. There is no evidence of
improved outcomes before a woman presents with
bleeding. Routine ultrasound screening for asymptomatic
women is not recommended. Current evidence supports
our previous guideline, which recommended a conserva-
tive approach with a 10 e11mm endometrium in a non-
bleeding woman. However, it is recommended that
certain subsets of women with higher risks of developing
endometrial cancer or who have other positive ﬁndings
(e.g., increased vascularity, inhomogeneity of the endo-
metrium, particulate ﬂuid) as well as women with clinical

Investigations for asymptomatic endometrial thickening
are not risk free, and serious complications such as
infection, uterine perforation, and bowel injury have been
reported in the literature. Endometrial biopsy should be a
keyﬁrst step in evaluating those suspected to have pa-
thology or at high risk for cancer, though the ﬁnding of
insufﬁcient tissue necessitates more invasive testing.
Watchful monitoring with repeat ultrasound over4 months may be an option if the patient is counselled with
respect to her individual endometrial cancer risk. Newer
literature continues to support the extremely low risk of
malignancy in women with asymptomatic global endo-
metrial thickening <10e11 mm.

Table A1. Key to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Quality of Evidence
Grade Deﬁnition
Strength of
recommendation
Strong High level of con ﬁdence that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects (strong recommendation for) or
the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects (strong recommendation against)
Conditional (weak)aDesirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (weak recommendation for) or the undesirable effects
probably outweigh the desirable effects (weak recommendation against)
Quality of evidence
High High level of con ﬁdence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate Moderate con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially
different
Low Limited con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low Very little con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
Adapted from GRADE Handbook (2013), Table 5.1.

Perspective Strong Recommendation
/C15“We recommend that .”
/C15“We recommend to not .”Conditional (Weak) Recommendation
/C15“We suggest .”
/C15“We suggest to not .”
Authors The net desirable effects of a course of action outweigh the
effects of the alternative course of action.It is less clear whether the net desirable consequences of
a strategy outweigh the alternative strategy.
Patients Most individuals in the situation would want the
recommended course of action, while only a small
proportion would not.The majority of individuals in the situation would want the
suggested course of action, but many would not.
Clinicians Most individuals should receive the course of action.
Adherence to this recommendation according to the
guideline could be used as a quality criterion orperformance indicator.Recognize that patient choices will vary by individual and
that clinicians must help patients arrive at a care
decision consistent with the patient ’s values and
preferences.
Policy makers The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most
settings.The recommendation can serve as a starting point for
debate with the involvement of many stakeholders.
