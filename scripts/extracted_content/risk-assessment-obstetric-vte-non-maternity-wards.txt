UH Sussex Risk Assessment for 
Obstetric Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
(Adapted from RCOG No. 37 a guidelines ) 
For use on all non-maternity wards at UH Sussex Hospitals for obstetric patients 
 
As a minimum, all pregnant women and birthing people should have a VTE 
risk assessment completed at their Booking Appointment and at 28 weeks after 
re-weighing has been offered. 
Repeat VTE assessments should be completed for ALL admissions to any 
hospital ward or at any time where new risks are noted including propos ed 
long distance travel >4 hours or if excessive weight gain at any stage of the 
pregnancy. 
 
(Please complete daily risk assessment using the described risk factors and score(s). The total score is used whether 
antenatal or postnatal & the associated suggestive management plan on page 2).

 Antenatal R isk Assessment for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
• If total score 4 or more antenatally, consider thromboprophylaxis from the first trimester. 
• If total score 3 antenatally, consider thromboprophylaxis from 28 weeks. 
• Re-weigh and reassess for thromboprophylaxis at 28 weeks . If already on thromboprophylaxis, check correct 
dose for weight at 28 weeks has been prescribed. 
• If admitted to hospital antenatally , consider thromboprophylaxis. 
• Reassess for thromboprophylaxis any time where new risks are noted, including proposed long distance travel 
>4 hours or if excessive weight gain, at any stage of the pregnancy. 
For patients with an identified bleeding risk, the balance of risks of bleeding and thrombosis should be discussed in 
consultation with a haematologist with expertise in thrombosis and bleeding in pregnancy. 
Postnatal Risk Assessment for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 
• If total score 2 or more postnatally, consider thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days. NB: If persisting or more 
than 3 risk factors consider extending thromboprophylaxis with LMWH 
• If prolonged admission (3 days or more ) or readmission to hospital within the puerperium consider 
thromboprophylaxis. 
• Calculate dose on current weight. If the woman or birthing person is immobile post birth (for instance post 
caesarean birth), use the 28 -week weight to calculate LMWH dose. Re -weigh and recalculate dose as soon as 
able to mobilise. 
• Previous VTE, anyone requiring AN LMWH, High risk thrombophilia, low risk thrombophilia + FHx = High Risk – 
should have at least 6 weeks PN prophylactic LMWH 
For patients with an identified bleeding risk, the balance of risks of bleeding and thrombosis should be discussed 
in consultation with a haematologist with expertise in thrombosis and bleeding in pregnancy. 
Antenatal and Postnatal Prophylactic Dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) 
Current weight Enoxaparin Dose (Inhixa) 
< 50 kg 20 mg daily subcutaneously 
50 – 90 kg 40 mg daily subcutaneously 
91 – 130 kg 60 mg daily subcutaneously 
131 – 170 kg 80 mg daily subcutaneously 
> 170 kg Seek specialist advice 
High prophylactic dose for people weighing 
50 – 90 kg 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously
