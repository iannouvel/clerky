Introduction and Methodology 
 
Objectives 
This guideline offers recommendation on the management of a range of vulval 
disorders who may present to Genitourinary Medicine clinics. Vulval disorders 
represent a disparate group of conditions with a variety of causes, affecting a 
particular anatomical site and may affect women of any age . 
These guidelines concentrate on a selecte d group of conditions, which may be 
managed by Genitourinary Physicians, either alone or in conjunction with other 
specialists , dependant on local expertise . Guidance for onward referral is also 
included. It is not intended as a comprehensive review of t he treatment of all 
vulval disease. The main categories of non -infective vulval diseases are 
dermatoses, pain syndromes and pre -malignant conditions. 
This guideline offers recommendations on the diagnostic tests and treatment 
regime ns needed for the effec tive management of the following vulval 
conditions: 
Vulval lichen sclerosus 
Vulval lichen planus 
Vulval eczema 
Vulval lichen simplex 
Vulval psoriasis 
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia 
Vulval pain syndromes 
It is aimed primarily at people aged 16 years or older presenting to 
Genitourinary Medicine clinics. 

NHS Evidence has accredited the process used by the British Association for Sexual Health & 
HIV (BASHH) to produce UK national guidelines. Accreditation is valid for 3 years from January 
2011 and is retrospectively applicable to guidance produced using the processes described in 
the BASHH Framework for Guideline Development and Assessment dated September 2010. 
More information on accreditation can be viewed at www.evidence.nhs.uk 2

Methods 
Article titles and abstracts were reviewed and if relevant the full text article 
obtained. Priority was given to randomised controlled trial and systematic review 
evidence, and recommendations made and graded on the basis of best available 
evidence . (Appendix 1) 
 
Piloting and Feedback 
The guidelines have been reviewed and approved b y an expert patient , and also 
by the BASHH patient and public engagement panel . 
 
Management 
General advice for delivery of vulval care 
Vulval conditions may present to Genitourinary Medicine Physicians, 
Dermatologists and Gynaecologists and treatment modal ities also span 
across this spectrum. Care of patients with vulval conditions is therefore 
best managed by a multidisciplinary approach1. This includes clear 
working arrangements between disciplines or access to a specialist 
multidisciplinary vulval serv ice. The service should also have access to 
clinicopathological discussion and review of histology results. 
 
General Advice for all vulval conditions 
 Avoid contact with soap, shampoo and bubble bath. Simple emollients 
can be used as a soap substitute and general moisturiser 
 Avoid tight fitting garments which may irritate the area 
 Avoid use of spermicidally lubricated condoms 
 Patients should be given a detailed explanation of their condition with 
particular emphasis on any long-term implications for the health of 
themselves and their partner(s). This should be reinforced by giving 
them clear and accurate written information. (The British Society for 
the Study of Vulval Disease produces some patient information leaflets 3 www.bssvd.org/leaflets.asp , also include BAD leaflets, ISSVD, Vulval 
Pain Society and NZ Dermnet ) 
 The patient’s GP should be informed. 
 STI screening should be considered in all patients and vulvovaginal 
candidiasis excluded if the patient p resents with vulval itch. 
 All patients should be assessed for sexual dysfunction 
 
Sexual partners 
 Partner tracing is not required unless screening detects a sexually 
transmitted infection. 

Vulval lichen sclerosus 2 
 
These guidelines relate to the managem ent of lichen sclerosus in adult females. 
Additional guidelines have been produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians 
and Gynaecologists1 and the British Association of Dermatologists3. 
 
Aetiolog y 
Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory dermatosis of unknown aetiology. 
There is evidence to suggest that auto -immu ne factors may be involved in it s 
pathogenesis and recent evidence has shown autoantibodies to extracellular 
matrix protein 14. There is an increased frequency of other autoimmune 
disorders in fe males with lichen sclerosu s5 
 
Clinical Features 
 
Symptoms 
 Itch 
 Soreness 
 Dyspareunia if introital narrowing 
 Urinary symptoms 
 Other symptoms, e.g. constipation, can occur if there is peri -anal 
involvement 
 Can be asymptomatic , but this is rare 
 
Signs 
 Pale, white atrophic a reas affecting the vulva 
 Purpura (ecchymosis) is common 
 Fissuring 
 Erosions, but blistering is very rare 
 Hyperkeratosis can occur 
 Changes may be localised or in a ‘figure of eight’ distribution including 
the perianal area 
 Loss of architectur e may be manifest as loss of the labia minora and/or 
midline fusion. The clitoral hood may be sealed over the clitoris so that 
it is buried 
 
Complications 
 Development of squamous cell carcinoma (actual risk <5%6) 
 Development of clitoral pseudo cyst 
 Sexual dysfunction 4  Dysaesthesia 
 
Diagnosis 
 Characteristic clinical appearance 
 Histology of vulval biopsy: thinned epidermis with sub -epidermal 
hyalinization and deeper inflammatory infiltrate. In early disease 
histology can be difficult .7 
 
Management 
 Further in vestigation 
 Biopsy: is mandatory if the diagnosis is uncertain , there are atypical 
features or coexistent vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) / squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC) is suspected 
 Investigation for autoimmune disease if clinically indicated , espe cially 
thyroid dysfunction ( i.e. T4 and TSH) as it is often asymptomatic and 
has been found be associated (IV,C)5 
 Skin swab : only useful to exclude co-existing infection if there are 
symptoms or signs suggestive of this 
 Patch testing : rarely required and only if secondary medicament 
allergy suspected . The advice of a dermatologist should be sought. 
 
Treatment 
 General Advice 
 Patients should be informed about the condition and given 
written information. Patients should be made aware of the small 
risk of n eoplastic change. They should be advised to contact the 
doctor if they notice a change in appearance or texture (e.g. 
lump or hardening of skin) , or if there is a major change in 
symptoms. 
 
 Recommended Regimen 
 Ultra-potent topical steroids8 e.g. Clobet asol proprionate (I A). 
Various regimens are used one of the most common being daily 
use for one month, alternate days for one month, twice weekly 
for one month with review at 3 months. It can then be used as 
needed depending on symptoms. There is no evide nce on the 
optimal regimen. 
 30gm of an ultra -potent steroid should last at least 3 months 
 Ointment bases are much better to use on the ano -genital skin 
because of the reduced need for preservatives in an ointment 
base, and hence less risk of a secondary contact allergy. 
 
Alternative regimens 
 An ultra -potent topical steroid with antibacterial and antifungal 
e.g. Dermovate NN ® or generic equivalent (Clobetasol with 
neomycin and nystatin) or an alternative preparation that 
combats secondary infection ( such a s Fucibet ® cream ) may be 
appropriate if secondary infection is a concern. These should 
only be used for a short period of time to clear infection (IV, C). 
 5 Research findings and unlicensed treatments 
 Topical calcineurin inhibitors. This is not a licensed i ndication 
and long -term safety and efficacy is not established. 
Tacrolimus 0.1% has been shown to be effective when used for 
16 to 24 weeks (IIb B) 9. This study, which included males and 
females and genital and extra genital lichen sclerosus, showed 
that 77% of evaluable patients responded to treatment with 
43% showing a complete response (absence of symptoms and 
skin findings excepting induration and atrophy) at 24 weeks. 
The follow up period was 18 months and whilst no patient was 
shown to have skin mali gnancy or dysplastic change the long -
term risks need to be studied in view of concerns about the 
possibility of topical immunosuppression increasing susceptibility 
of malignancy. A study of the related agent, pimecrolimus, 
showed that 42% of patients were in ‘complete remission’ after 
6 months application10. (IIb B) Local irritancy was the most 
common side effect with both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus but 
usually improved after the initial period of use. Cases of 
malignancy have been reported11,12 and it is recommended that 
these agents should not be used first line. 
 Oral retinoids, e.g. acitretin13 – these may be effective in severe 
recalcitrant disease (Ib A) but should only be given by a 
dermatologist , experienced in the use of these agents. They are 
severely teratogenic and pregnancy must be avoided for 2 years 
after finishing treatment. 
 UVA1 phototherapy has been reported as successful in a small 
number of cases.14 (III,B) 
 
Pregnancy and Breast -feeding 
 Topical steroids are safe to use while pregnant or breast -feeding 
 Topical calcineurin inhibitors are contra -indicated whilst 
pregnant or breast -feeding. 
 Retinoids are absolutely contra -indicated during pregnancy and 
for at least 2 years before. They should be used with caution in 
females of child -bearing age. 

Onward referral criteria 
 Those with a ctive disease which has not responded adequately to 
treatment should be referred to a specialised Vulval Clinic 
 Any patient who develops differentiated or undifferentiated VIN or an 
SCC on a background of LS shou ld be seen and follow -up in a 
specialised Vulval Clinic . Surgery15 – should only be used for the 
treatment of coexistent VIN / SCC or fusion. Disease tends to recur 
around the scar . (III, B). 
 
Follow -up 
 After 3 months to assess response to treatment 
 Stable disease should be reviewed annually and this can be done by 
the General Practitioner in those with well controlled disease. This 
must be communicated to the patient and GP by the clinic. 6  Patients should be informed that if they notice the development of a 
lump, sore area, change in symptoms or change in appearance they 
should prompt medical review. 
 
Auditable outcome measures 
 Biopsy should be performed in patients not responding to an initial 
course of steroid treatment and if raised lesions devel op Target 
100% 
 Written information should be given to all patients Target 100% 
 
Vulval Lichen Planus 
 
Aetiology 
Lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder with manifestations on the skin, 
genital and oral mucous membranes. More rarely it affects the lacrimal duct , 
oesophagus and external auditory meatus . It is an inflammatory condition of 
unknown pathogenesis b ut it is probably an immunological response by T cells 
activated by, as yet, unidentified antigens. Weak circulating basement 
membrane zone antibodies have b een shown to be present in 61% of patients 
with erosive lichen planus of the vulva16. In some cases there is overlap between 
lichen sclerosus and lichen planus. 
 
Clinical Features 
 
Symptoms 
 Itch / irritation 
 Soreness 
 Dyspareunia 
 Urinary symptoms 
 Vaginal di scharge 
 Can be asymptomatic 
 
Signs 
The anogenital lesions of lichen planus may be divided into three main 
groups according to their clinical presentation: 
1. Classical: typical papules will be found on the keratinised anogenital 
skin, with or without stria e on the inner aspect of the vulva. 
Hyperpigmentation frequently follows their resolution, particularly 
those with dark -skin. This type of lichen planus may be asymptomatic. 
Vulval lesions were found in 19 out of 37 women with cutaneous lichen 
planus, wit h four of the 19 having had no symptoms17 
2. Hypertrophic: these lesions are relatively rare and can be difficult to 
diagnose. They particularly affect the perineum and perianal area, 
presenting as thickened warty plaques which may become ulcerated, 
infected and painful. Because of these features , they can mimic 
malignancy. They do not appear to be accompanied by vaginal lesions. 
3. Erosive: the most common subtype to cause vulval symptoms. The 
mucosal surfaces are eroded. At the edges of the erosions the 
epithelium is mauve and a pale network (Wickham’s striae) is 
sometimes seen. The vaginal lesions in erosive lichen planus are 
important to recognise early and start treatment as they can lead to 
scarring and complete stenosis. The lesions consist of friab le 7 telang iectasia with patchy erythema which are responsible for the 
common symptoms of postcoital bleeding, dyspareunia and a variable 
discharge which is often serosanguinous. As erosions heal synaechiae 
and scarring can develop.18 This type is also seen in the oral mucosa 
although synaechia are uncommon. The term vulvo -vaginal gingival 
syndrome is used when erosive disease occurs in these three sites . The 
presenting symptom is usually of pain and soreness. 
 
Complications 
 Scarring, including vaginal synec hiae 
 Development of squamous cell carcinoma .. In one study the incidence 
was as high as 3%.19 
 
Diagnosis 
 Characteristic clinical appearance. Involvement of the vagina excludes 
lichen sclerosus. Skin changes elsewhere can be helpful but overlap 
between lic hen planus and lichen sclerosus is described . 
Immunobullous disorders such as pemphigus can look clinically similar 
to erosive lichen planus. 
 Histology of vulval biopsy: irregular saw -toothed acanthosis, increased 
granular layer and basal cell liquefaction . Band -like dermal infiltrate 
mainly lymphocytic. 
 
Management 
 Further investigation 
 Biopsy: is a necessity if the diagnosis is uncertain or coexistent vulval 
intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) / squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is 
suspected. Direct immunofluor escence should be performed if an 
immunobullous disease is considered in the differential diagnosis. Only 
25% are classic on biopsy and clinicopathological discussion is 
important 
 Investigation for autoimmune disease especially of the thyroid (i.e T4 
and T SH if there is any suspicion of abnormality) (IV C)5 
 Skin swab: to exclude secondary infection especially of excoriated 
lesions 
 Patch testing: if secondary medicament allergy suspected 
 Whilst a link with hepatitis C and sometimes B has been noted in some 
countries there is no evidence of increased incidence in the UK and 
routine screening is not thought necessary.20 
 
Treatment 
 General Advice 
 Patients should be informed about the condition and given 
written information. Patients should be made aware of the small 
risk of neoplastic change. They should be advised to contact the 
doctor if they notice a change in appearance or texture (e.g. 
lump or hardening of skin). 
 
 Recommended Regimen 
 Ultrapotent topical steroids e.g. Clobetasol proprionate . (Iib,B) 
In a study of 114 patients in a vulval clinic, 89 used ultra potent 
topical steroids as first line treatment of whom 75% improved 8 and 54% were symptom free. However in only 9% was there 
resolution of signs of inflammation.19 There is no evidence on 
the opti mal regimen. 
 Maintenance treatment may be required and can either be with 
weaker steroid preparations or less frequent use of potent 
steroids. 
 Vaginal corticosteroids: Delivery of corticosteroids to the vagina 
is not easy. A proprietary preparation contain ing hydrocortisone 
(Colifoam), introduced with an applicator, is useful. Prednisolone 
suppositories may be used in more severe cases (IV,C) . 
 
Alternative regimens 
 An ultra -potent topical steroid with antibacterial and antifungal 
e.g. Dermovate NN® or gener ic equivalent (Clobetasol with 
neomycin and nystatin) or an alternative preparation that 
combats secondary infection (such as Fucibet® cream ) may be 
appropriate if secondary infection is a concern. These should 
only be used for a short period of time to cl ear infection (IV, C). 
 
Pregnancy and Breast -feeding 
 Topical steroids are safe to use while pregnant or breast -
feeding. 
 Topical calcineurin inhibitors are contra -indicated whilst 
pregnant or breast -feeding. 
 Retinoids are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy and 
for at least 2 years before. They should be used with caution in 
females of child -bearing age. 
 
Onward referral 
Referral to a multidisciplinary vulval clinic is recommended for erosive disease 
and any recalcitrant cases, or those in whom syst emic therapy is considered. 
Systemic treatments: There is no consensus and little evidence base for the use 
of systemic agents. In the vulvovaginal –gingival syndrome there is general 
agreement that azathioprine, dapsone, griseofulvin, chloroquine and 
minoc ycline, all tried empirically, are of little or no benefit; 
● Oral ciclosporin may be considered . 
● Retinoids can be very helpful in hypertrophic cases. 
● Oral steroids are used, for example prednisolone 40 mg/day, tapered 
off over a few weeks; courses can be repeated as necessary for severe 
flares. 
● The new biological agents have been used in oral and cutaneous 
disease. Basiliximab21 has been found to be effective but its’ use has 
not been evaluated in vulval disease. All these potentially toxic 
therapies need careful monitoring and are best supervised by a 
dermatologist in the context of a speciali sed clinic (IV, C). 
 
Follow -up 
 At 2-3 months to assess response to treatment 
 Active disease should be assessed as clinically required . Erosive lichen 
planus needs lo ng term specialised follow -up (IV, C). 
 Stable disease should be reviewed annually except in well -counselled 
patients who control their symptoms well. If review is by the General 9 Practitioner this should be communicated to the patient and GP by the 
clinic. 
 Patients should be informed that if they notice the development of a 
lump or change in appearance they should seek medical advice 
urgently. 
 
Auditable outcome measures 
● Biopsy should be performed in patients not responding to an initial 
course of treatment and if raised lesions develop

Vulval eczema 
 
Aetiology 
Eczematous and lichenified diseases , as classified by ISSVD ,22 includes: 
 Atopic : the ‘allergic’ t ype often seen in people who also have hay fever or 
asthma . 
 Allergic contact : due to skin contact to a substance to which the 
individual is sensitive. 
 Irritant contact : due to skin contact with irritating chemica ls, powders, 
cleaning agents, etc. 
 
Clinical Features 
 
Symptoms 
 Vulval itch 
 Soreness 
 
Signs 
 Erythema 
 Lichenification and excoriation 
 Fissuring 
 
Complications 
 Secondary infection 
 
Diagnosis 
 Clinical presentation (as above). 
 General examination of the skin to look for other signs of dermatitis 
 
Management 
 Further Investigation 
 Patch testing23,24 – standard battery and medicaments (III,B) 
 Biopsy (IV,C) – only if atypical features or failure to respond to 
treatment 
 
Treatment 
 Recommended Regimens 
 Avoidance of precipitating factor (IV,C) 
 Use of emollient soap substitute (aqueous cream should not be 
applied as a moisturiser due to the risk of irritant effects , 
Hydramol can be a suitable alternative ) 10  Topical corticosteroid – the choice of preparation will depe nd on 
severity, 1% Hydrocortisone ointment in milder cases, or 
betamethasone valerate 0.025% or clobetasol propionate 0.05% 
for limited periods if severe or lichenified . A combined 
preparation containing antifungal and/or antibiotic may be 
required if sec ondary infection suspected. Apply once 
daily.(IV,C) 
 
Follow -up 
 As clinically required 
 Long-term follow up and psychological support may be needed 
 
Auditable Outcomes 
 Patients should be given a full explanation of their condition with 
written information Target 100% 
 
Lichen simplex 
 
Aetiology 
Categorised into 4 main groups. 
 Underlying dermatoses , i.e. atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, 
superficial fungal (tinea and candidiasis) infections 
 Systemic conditions causing pruritus , i.e. renal f ailure, obstructive biliary 
disease (primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis), 
Hodgkin's lymphoma, hyper - or hypothyroidism, and polycythaemia rubra 
vera 
 Environmental factors: heat, sweat, rubbing of clothing, and other 
irritants suc h as harsh skincare products. 
 Psychiatric disorders: anxiety, depression, obsessive -compulsive disorder, 
and dissociative experiences are often associated with the condition. 
Emotional tensions in predisposed people (i.e., those with an underlying 
predispo sition for atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis) can 
induce itch and thus begin the chronic itch -scratch cycle25,26. 
 
Clinical Features 
 
Symptoms 
 Vulval itch 
 Soreness 
 
Signs 
 Lichenification i.e. thickened, slightly scaly, pale or earthy -colour ed 
skin with accentuated markings, maybe more marked on the side 
opposite the dominant hand. 
 Erosions and fissuring. 
 Excoriations as a result of scratching may be seen 
 The pubic hair is often lost in the area of scratching 
 
Complications 11  Secondary infecti on 
 
Diagnosis 
 Clinical presentation (as above). Psoriasis of the vulva is usually less 
itchy and lesions are bright red, often glazed and well demarcated and 
frequently involves natal cleft 
 History including mental state examination where indicated 
 Gener al examination of the skin to look for other signs of psoriasis or 
lichen simplex elsewhere 
 
Management 
 Further Investigation 
 Screening for infection (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans ) 
 Dermatological referral for consideration of patch testing23 – standard 
battery and medicaments (III,B) 
 Ferritin27 (III,B) 
 Biopsy (IV,C) 
 
Treatment 
 Recommended Regimens 
 Avoidance of precipitating factor (IV,C) 
 Use of emollient soap (some people may have a reaction to 
Aqueous cream when it is used as an emollie nt. For this reason 
it is recommended only as a soap substitute and not an 
emollient ). 
 Topical corticosteroid – potent topical steroids are required when 
treating lichenified areas e.g. betamethasone or clobetasol for 
limited periods . A combined prepara tion containing antifungal 
and/or antibiotic may be required if secondary infection 
suspected. Apply once or twice daily.(IV,C) 
 A mildly anxiolytic antihistamine such as hydroxyzine or doxepin 
at night is helpful 
 The symptoms of pruritus often respond fair ly quickly to a 
topical steroid but, unless the lichenification resolves, the itch –
scratch cycle will remain and the symptoms will recur. A 
graduated reduction in the frequency of application of the topical 
steroid is helpful , over about 3 -4 months 
 Cogniti ve behavioural therapy may be helpful if there are co -
existing mental health issues 
 
Follow -up 
 Mild disease – as clinically required 
 Severe disease (i.e. when using potent topical steroids) – 1 month 
then as required 
 
Auditable Outcome Measures 
 Patients sh ould be given a full explanation of their condition with 
written information Target 100% 

 12 Vulval psoriasis 
 
Aetiology 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory epidermal skin disease affecting 
approximately 2% of the general population. Genital psoriasis may present as 
part of plaque or flexural psoriasis or, rarely, as the only area affected. 
 
Clinical Features 
 
Symptoms 
 Vulval itch 
 Soreness 
 Burning sensation 
 
Signs 
 Well demarcated brightly erythematous plaques 
 Often symmetrical 
 Frequently affects nata l cleft 
 Usually lacks scaling due to maceration 
 Fissuring 
 
Complications 
 May be worsened due to Koebner effect by irritation from urine, tight-
fitting clothes or sexual intercourse. 

Diagnosis 
 Clinical presentation [as above.] 
 General examination of the skin and nails to look for other signs of 
psoriasis 
 
Management 
 Further Investigation 
 Skin punch biopsy if the diagnosis is in doubt 
 
Treatment28 
 Recommended Regimens 
 Avoidance of irritating factors 
 Use of emollient soap substitute 
 Topical corticost eroid - weak to moderate steroids are preferred 
but if insufficient to induce a response then intensive short term 
potent steroid such as clobetasol propionate 0.05% may be 
used. A combined preparation containing antifungal and/or 
antibiotic may be require d if secondary infection suspected (e.g. 
Trimovate®) .(IV, C) 
 Coal-tar preparations – may be used alone or combined or 
alternated with topical steroids. However, these preparations 
can cause irritation and folliculitis. (IV, C) 
 Vitamin D analogues such as T alcalcitol – alone or in 
combination with corticosteroid, however their usefulness may 
be limited by causing irritation. (IV, C) 
 13 Onward referral 
 Referral to a multidisciplinary vulval clinic is recommended for 
unresponsive or recalcitrant cases, or those in whom systemic therapy 
is considered. 
 Systemic treatments: if required for severe and extensive psoriasis 
may help genital lesions but not recommended for isolated genital 
psoriasis. 
 
Follow -up 
 Mild disease – as clinically required 
 Severe disease – (i.e. when using potent topical steroids) 1 month 
then as required 
 
Auditable Outcome Measures 
 Patients should be given a full explanation of their condition with 
written information Target 100% 

Other Vulval Dermatoses 
Many other skin conditions can a ffect the vulva. Where the diagnosis is not 
obvious patients should be referred to a combined vulva l clinic or to a 
dermatologist. 
 
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)2 
 
Aetiology 
This is a vulval skin condition which may become cancerous if left untrea ted. It 
is confirmed by histological diagnosis . In Genitourinary Medicine clinics the 
commonest aetiological agent is Human papillomavirus (HPV) this is known as 
usual type and is mainly associated with HPV 1629. A second type, generally not 
HPV re lated occurs in conjunction with lichen sclerosus or lichen planus (known 
as differentiated type)30. The risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma is 
much greater with the differentiated type of VIN and needs specialised 
management. VIN is commoner in immuno compromised women .31 Smoking is 
also a risk factor. 
 
Clinical Features 
Symptoms 
 Lumps 
 Burning and itch / irritation 
 Asymptomatic 
 Pain 
 
Signs 
 Clinical appearance is very variable 
 Raised white, erythematous or pigmented lesions occur and these may 
be warty, moist or eroded (pigmented lesions were previously known 
as Bowenoid papulosis) 
 Multifocal lesions are common 
 
Complications 14  Development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been reported in 
between 9%32 and 18.5% of women33 
 Recurrence is common and progr ession to cancer can occur following 
previous treatment 33 
 Psychosexual consequences have also been described (especially 
following surgical treatment)34 
 
Diagnosis 
 Biopsy – histology shows loss of organisation of squamous epithelium 
with a variable degree of cytological atypia which is graded as 
undifferentiated or differentiated30 and by depth. Multiple biopsies may 
be required as there is a risk of missing invasive disease35 
 
Management 
 Further investigation 
 Ensure that cervical cytology remains up to date - there is an 
association with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)36 (this is 
probably only applicable to those due to HPV) (IV,C) 
 All patients with VIN should be referred for up -to date colposcopy to 
exclude CIN and VIN. If there are any peri -anal lesions, referral for 
anoscopy is recommended (IV, C). 
 
Treatment 37,38 
Most studies and research relate to full thickness VIN. Multifocal lesions 
can be treated in the same manner as single lesions, but may have a 
higher recurrence rate28. 
. Recommended Regimen 
 Local excision39 – this is the treatment of choice for small well 
circumscribed lesions as it has the lowest rate of recurrence on 
follow up.(III,B) 
 Imiquimod cream 5 % - partial and complete clinical and 
histological regression has been sho wn in small studies but 
treatment limited by side effects. Only short term follow up 
data is available. This is an unlicensed indication. (I b,A)40,41 
 Vulvectomy – this has been effective but recurrence may occur 
and function and cosmesis will be impaired (IV,C)34,39 
 
Alternative Regimens 
1. Local destruction – a variety of techniques have been evaluated 
30, 32, including carbon dioxide laser and ultrasonic surgical 
aspiration 42, photodynamic therapy39, cryotherapy 32, 
laser39.(IIa, B) There are anecdotal r eports of treatment with 
diathermy. Involvement of skin appendages can occur and 
recurrence may ensue if the appropriate depth of treatment is 
not achieved. The recurrence rates at follow -up tend to be 
higher than for excision, but cosmesis is usually goo d. 
2. 5 fluorouracil cream 43 – may lead to resolution of some lesions 
but results are variable and side effects are common. No 
consensus on usefulness or regimen. This is an unlicensed 
indication. (IV,C). 
3. Supervision35 – some lesions will spontaneously regr ess. This 
may be the best policy for partial thickness VIN . However there 15 is a risk of progression and patients should be made aware of 
this (IV , C). 
 
Pregnancy and Breast -feeding 
 Imiquimod and 5 fluorouracil cream s are not licensed in 
pregnancy 
 
Onward referral 
● Cases of VIN should be assessed in a multidisciplinary vulval clinic, or 
have input from gynaecology regarding assessment for surgical 
excision1. 
Follow -up 
 Close follow -up is mandatory. Although resolution may occur VIN III 
particularly has a s ignificant rate of progression (6.5% in one study)33 
 
Auditable Outcome Measures 
 Follow up of cases until 5 years after resolution Target 80% 

Vulval pain 
International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Diseases [ISSVD] defines 
vulvodynia as ‘vulvar discomfort, most often described as burning pain, 
occurring in the absence of relevant visible findings or a specific, clinically 
identifiable, neurologic disorder’. 44 
Vulvodynia is categorised, by the ISSVD, as generalised or localised; provoked, 
unprovo ked or a mixture of the two. 
Localised provoked vulvodynia [vestibulodynia] 
 
Aetiology 
Likely to be multifactorial; a history of vulvovaginal candidiasis, usually 
recurrent, is the most commonly reported feature. Experimental animal study 
supports this ass ociation .45 
 
Clinical Features 
 
 Symptoms 
 Vulval pain – frequently felt at the introitus at penetration during 
sexual intercourse or on insertion of tampons. There is usually a long 
history. 
 
Signs 
 Focal tenderness elicited by gentle application of a cott on wool tip bud 
at the introitus or around the clitoris 
 There are no signs of an acute inflammatory process 
 
Complications 
 Sexual dysfunction 
 Psychological morbidity 
 16 Diagnosis 
● Clinical diagnosis made on history and examination 
 
Management 
 
Further inves tigation 
 After exclusion of other treatable causes no further investigation is 
required 
 
Treatment 
The British Society for the Study of Vulval Disease [BSSVD] recommends 
a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and that combining 
treatments can be help ful in dealing with different aspects of vulval pain. 
46,47 

Recommended regimens 
● Avoidance of irritating factors 
● Use of emollient soap substitute 
● Topical local anaesthetics e.g. 5% lidocaine ointment or 2 % lidocaine 
gel should be used with caution as i rritation may be caused. The 
application should be made 15 -20 minutes prior to penetrative sex and 
washing off the lidocaine just before sex or the use of condom by the 
partner can reduce the risk of transfer resulting in penile numbness. 
Oral contact should be avoided (IVC) 
 
● Physical therapies 
 Pelvic floor muscle biofeedback48 (III,B) 
 Vaginal transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] (Ib ,A) 49 
 Vaginal trainers (III ,B) 50 
 
 Cognitive behaviour therapy (III ,C) 51 
 
Alternative Regimens 
● Pain modifiers – the benefit of drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, 
gabapentin and pregabalin is not clear. Amitriptyline gradually titrated 
from 10mg up to 100 mg according to response and side effects may 
be beneficial in some women (IVC) 
 Surgery – Modified vestib ulectomy may be considered in cases where 
other measures have been unsuccessful. Patients who have responded 
to topical lidocaine prior to sex have a better outcome. (IIIB) 52,53 
 
Follow -up 
● As clinically required 
● Long-term follow -up and psychological supp ort may be needed 
 
Auditable Outcomes 
 Patients should be given a full explanation of their condition with 
written information Target 100% 

 17 Unprovoked Vulvodynia 
 
Aetiology 
The aetiology is unknown and the condition is best managed as a chronic pain 
syndrome. 
 
Clinical Features 
 
 Symptoms 
 Pain that is longstanding and unexplained. 
 May be associated with urinary symptoms such as interstitial cystitis54 
 
Signs 
 The vulva appears normal 
. 
Complications 
 Sexual dysfunction 
 Psychological morbidity 
 
Diagn osis 
 Clinical diagnosis made on history and examination having excluded 
other causes. 
 
Management 
Further investigation 
 After exclusion of other treatable causes no further investigation is 
required 
 
Treatment 
The British Society for the Study of Vulval D isease [BSSVD] recommends 
a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and that combining 
treatments can be helpful in dealing with different aspects of vulval pain. 
46 
 
Treatment resistant unprovoked vulvodynia may require referral to a pain 
clinic. 
 
Recommended regimens 
 Use of emollient soap substitute 
 Pain modifiers – tricyclic antidepressants are well established in chronic 
pain management. Few studies have specifically examined the effect in 
vulvodynia however amitriptyline is frequently first line t reatment; 
dosage should be increased by small increments starting at 10mg up 
to 100mg daily according to the patient’s response55 (III,B) 
 Note: a recent randomised study has not confirmed the beneficial 
effect of amitriptyline. (Ib, A)56 
 If unresponsi ve or unable to tolerate the side eff ects, 
gabapentin57(III,B) or pregabalin58 may be used (IIb,B) 
 
 18 Alternative regimens 
 Topical local anaesthetic e.g. 5% lidocaine ointment or 2% lidocaine 
gel. A trial of local anaesthetic may be considered although irri tation is 
a common side effect. (IV,C) 
 Cognitive behavioural therapy and psychotherapy59 (IIb,B) 
 Acupuncture60 (IIb, C) 
 
Follow up 
 As clinically required 
 
Auditable outcomes 
 Patients should be given a full explanation of their condition with

Declarations of interest 
All members of the guideline writing committee completed the BASHH 
conflict of interest declaration detailed below at the time the guidelines 
final draft was submitted to the CEG. 
 
Cost implications 
These guidelines have been revised to include a much wider group of conditions 
than included in previous guidance. Ma ny of these conditions already do present 
to GUM setting initially. Where appropriate, onward referral to Dermatology is 
recommended and is therefore unlikely to impact greatly on the cost of 
managing these chronic conditions
