GUIDELINES FOR UTERINE ARTERY EMBOLISATION (UAE) 
 
Author: Dr Bhaskar Ganai (consultant interventional radiologist) Issue number: 1

Location: Imaging Shared Drive – Nursing Page 1 of 4 
UAE OVERVIEW 
 
 Prospective randomised studies such as EMMY (Volkers et al. 2008) and REST (Edwards 
et al. 2007) have proven the role of UAE in the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. 
 UAE should be considered as one of the treatment options alongside surgical treatments, 
endometrial ablation, medical management and conservative measures (RCOG/RCR 
2013) . 
 
 Indication : 
o Significant lifestyle -altering symptoms, specif ically heav y menstrual bleeding, severe 
dysmenorrhoea or anaemia (level 1 evidence) 
o Further indication in fibroids causing pain or mass effect on bladder or bowel (level 3 
evidence) 
o UAE can also be undertaken for control of symptoms from adenomyosis (Nijenhuis 
et al. 2015) . 
 Contraindications : 
o Viable pregnancy 
o Gynaecological malignancy 
o Active uterine infect ion 
 Outcomes : 
o Technical success: 95 -97% (REST & EMMY) 
o Clinical outcome: 92% satisfactory at 24 months (EMMY) 
o Secondary hysterectomy: 11% at 32 months (REST) 

GYNAECOLOGICAL REVIEW 
 Review by gynaecologist in clinic, with aim to confirm diagnosis of fibroid , exclude viable 
pregnancy and exclude infective or malignant gynaecological p athology . 
 Discussion of appropriate alternative treatments including hysterectomy, myomectomy and 
ablation therapies 
 If patient is keen to be referred for consideration of UAE, gynaecology team to write clinic 
letter to interventional radiology department . 
 Gynaecology team to request gadolinium enhanced MRI pelvis (fibroid protocol) at time of 
writing UAE referral letter. 

INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY REVIEW 
 Review in IR clinic 
 Detai led discussion regarding procedure 
 Review of MRI including anatomical suitability for embolisation 
 Risks of embolisation reviewed including:

Issue Date: January 2016 Review Date: January 2018 
Location: Imaging Shared Drive – Nursing Page 2 of 4 o Infection 
o Hysterectomy 
o Ovarian failure/early menopause 
o Non-target embolisation 
o Pain, including use of PCA 
o Post embo lisation syndrome 
o PV discharge 
o Future gynaecological D&C (particularly pedunculated intra-cavitatory fibroids) 
o Implications for future fertility 
 Clinic letter to referring gynaecologist and GP (+/ - patient if appropriate). Copy of letter to 
be filed with I R department. 
 IR will fill in radiology request form if proceeding to UAE. 

PRE-PROCEDURE PLANNING 
 Consent by IR consultant 
 Nursing pre -assessment, including explanation of PCA and theatre recovery 
 Removal of IUCD pre -procedure by GP practice nurse. Pati ent to arrange. 
 Appointment for first 10 days of woman’s menstrual cycle. 
 Bed booked on level 11 
 Theatre recovery notified of date of procedure. 

DAY OF PROCEDURE 
 Patient arrived at IR suite at 0800 
 Pregnancy test 
 IV cannulation 
 PCA education 
 Pre-procedur e medication: 
o Gentamicin 160mg iv 
o Paracetamol 1g iv 
o Diclofenac 50mg PO (OR PR) 
o Oramorph 20mg PO 

PROCEDURE SUMMARY 
 Generally right common femoral artery (CFA) access only, occasionally bilateral CFA 
access. 
 Selective catheterisation of bilateral IIA and uterine arteries , with or without microcatheter 
use. 
 Embolisation with particles – PVA or calibrated microspheres - usually in the 500 -
700micron range, but can be smaller or larger at discretion of operator.

Location: Imaging Shared Drive – Nursing Page 3 of 4  Arterial closure devices generally used. 
 Intrapr ocedural medication : 
o Fentanyl 25micrograms iv aliquots, titrated to manage pain 
o Ondasetron 4mg iv 6 hourly 
o Midazolam 1mg iv aliquots, if require d 

THEATRE RECOVERY 
 Initial recovery in theatre recovery suite, with IR nurse 
 Analgesia with PCA , which continu es on ward. 
 Bed rest 4 -6 hours. 
 15 minutes observations for first 2 hours, 30 minutes observations for subsequent 2 hours, 
routine observations thereafter. 
 Observation of arterial access site for haematoma. If haematoma develops, contact IR for 
review. 

WARD CARE 
 Monitoring of PCA . 
 Arterial access site should be checked for ha ematoma. If haematoma develops, direct 
manual compression for 15 -20 minutes . 
 Can have light dinner on evening of procedure . 
 Aim to mobilise the following morning with cessation of PC A. 
 IR review the following morning post procedure. 
 Aim to discharge home the following morning/ afternoon post procedure (after IR review) if 
pain controlled with oral analgesia . 
 Patient must have passed urine pre discharge . 
 Discharge drugs (7 day supply) to be prescribed by gynaecology junior doctors: 
o Paracetamol 1g 6 hourly 
o Ibuprofen 400mcg 6 hourly OR Diclofenac 75mg 8 hourly 
o Dihydrocodeine 30mg 6 hourly 

POST PROCEDURE 
 Interventional radiology will arrange follow up gadolinium enhanced MRI pelvis for 3-6 
months . 
 If post discharge concerns, particularly of infection, urgent gynaecological review and 
liaison with interventional radiology.
