• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance 
• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol 
 
Management Team: 
• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations

 Introduction 
 
This document provides guidance on maternity management of women and their families 
through a pregnancy loss. The maternity service care for women after 14 weeks of 
pregnancy - prior to that gestation, care is given by the gynaecology service , please refer to 
management of miscarriage protocol for under 14 weeks. 
 
The protocol has been divided into two parts to assist in the care for these women. Part one 
outlines the clinical care; Part Two details the support and arrangements families may need. 

Women can present in a variety of ways: 
 
• Spontaneous miscarriage - non-viable fetus below 24 weeks 
• Intrauterine death – >24 weeks no fetal heart detected . 
• Termination of pregnancy 
• Loss of one or more babies in a multiple pregnancy 
 
This guideline combines and replaces maternity guidelines, 
• MP073 Management of pregnancy losses above 14 weeks (2015 ) 
• MP074 Sensitive handling disposal of products of conception and non -viable fetus 
under 23+6 weeks of gestation (2012 ) 
 
And should be read in conjunction with gynaecology guidelines, 
 
• GP001 Early Pregnancy Unit Clinical Guidelines (2016 ) 
• GP010 Termination of Pregnancy (Under 14 Weeks) (2016 ) 
• GP001 M anagement of Miscarriage

 Part One 
Section One - Over 14 weeks 
 
Clinical and emotional care for pregnancy losses are primarily the same regardless of 
gestation. The difference is with the paper work and registering baby. Therefore this guide is 
laid out for all gestations over 14 weeks and breaks down the differenc es under the 
paperwork section. 
 
An unexpected intrauterine death over 14 weeks 
1.0 Inform the Registrar / Consultant on call. 
1.1 Perform or arrange an ultrasound scan to confirm no heart beat and presentation. 
1.2 When diagnosing a fetal loss if practitioner is in any doubt a second opinion should 
 be immediate this is to inc lude calling in a consultant. 
1.3 Women should be prepared for the possibility of passive fetal movement. If the 
woman reports passive fetal movement after the scan to diagnose IUD, a repeat 
scan should be offered. 
1.4 If the woman is unaccompanied, an immediate o ffer should be made to call her 
 partner, relatives or friends. 
1.5 Discussions should aim to support maternal/parental choice and should be 
 supported with written information - give SANDS Bereavement Pack. 
1.6 Obtain appropriate checklist (Under 24, Over 24 or TOP) and commence. 
1.7 Laboratory blood tests to be taken as per relevant checklist, and documented. 
1.8 As a minimum a kleihau er must be taken for all women and sent on the day of 
 diagnosis. This is to identify if feto -maternal haemorrhage is the cause and enables 
sufficient anti - D to be administered within 72 hours. If feto -maternal haemorrhage 
is identified repeat kleihauer in 48 hours. 
1.9 Inform pregnancy loss midwives by email on the day of diagnosis, this will enable 
support for women prior to induction. 
1.10 Discussions to be had with woman during this time 
• Options available including expectant management ( Section Three ) 
• Mode of delivery ( Section Two ) 
• Induction of labour process (Section Four) 
• Post Mortem – supported with written lit erature - SANDS deciding on 
Post mortem (Section Fourteen ) 
1.11 Ensure contact details for pregnancy loss midwives are given to parents. ( Appendix 1) Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 8 of 82 
 Section Two - Mode of delivery 
 
Recommendations about labour and birth should take into account the mother’s preferences as well 
as her medical condition and previous intrapartum history. Vaginal birth is the recommended mode 
of delivery for most women, but caesarean birth will need to be considered with some If the woman 
is 24 weeks gestation or more and requests delivery by caesarean section, there should be a full 
discussion about the risks of caesarean section and the impact on any future pregnancies. If after full 
discussion of risks the woman wants to proceed with a caesarean section, her wishes should be 
respected, after discussion with the consultant on -call. 
Section Three - Expectant Management 
 
3.0 If expectant management is chosen this should be supported as long as there are no signs of 
complications such as sepsis, pre -eclampsia, abruption or ruptured membranes. 
3.1 85% of women with an IUD labour spontaneously within three weeks of diagnosis. 
3.2 She should be advised that she is at an increased risk o f complications if the delay is 
prolonged (such as sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC). 
3.3 If the delay is more than 48 hours, the woman should be o ffered twice -weekly blood tests 
for DIC and warned that the risk of developing DIC incr eases with continuing expectant 
management: 10% within 4 weeks after the date of late IUFD, rising to 30% thereafter. 
3.4 The woman should be told that she may continue to experience passive fetal movement 
3.5 Women contemplating prolonged expectant manage ment should be advised that the 
appearance of the baby may deteriorate, and the value of post mortem may be reduced. 
Section Four - Inducing labour 
4.0 For an intrauterine death above 14 weeks induction of labour should be arranged in 
consultation with the woman and labour ward coordinator. 
4.1 A full explanation should be given to ensure that the w oman is aware of the procedure, 
details of when she should return to labour ward and th e contact number of labour ward 
should she have any concerns. 
4.2 Prescribe the misoprostol and mifepristone at same time, the drug chart needs to be sent to 
Pharmacy for the misoprostol to be dispensed prior to returning for induction . The dosage 
will depend on gestation and whether the woman has previ ously had a caesarean section. 
(see flow charts below ) 
4.3 Appropriate analgesia MUST be prescribed with the misoprostol ready for admission. 
4.4 If the woman vomits within 30 minutes of taking mifepriston e give an antiemetic and repeat 
mifepristone does 30 minutes later. 
4.5 If gastrointestinal side effects occur with oral misoprostol doses can be administered 
vaginally as side -effects are less with this route of administration. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073

 This practice guidance is derived from statute and code of practice. 
Section A - Legal Definitions : Birth and D eath 
Registration 
 
A stillborn baby is defined in law as “a child which has issued forth from its mother after the 
twenty -fourth week of pregnancy and did not at any time after being completely expelled 
from tis mother breathe or show any other signs of life.” (Births and Deaths Registration Act 
1953 s 441, amended by Stillbirth Definition Act 1992) 
 
● Stillbirth must be medically certified by a fully registered doctor or midwife; the 
doctor or midwife must have been present at the birth or examined the baby after 
birth. (Statute) 
 
● HM Coroner must be contacted if there are signs of life or any doubt about signs of 
life. (Statute) 
 
● Police should be contacted if there is suspicion of deliberate action to cause 
stillbirth. (Statute) 
 
● Fetal deaths that had clearly occurred before the end of the 24th week but deliver 
after 24 weeks do not have to be certified or registered. (Code of Practice) 
 
● The baby can be registered as indeterminate sex if uncertain awaiting further 
tests. (Code of Practice) 
 
● The parents are responsible in law for registering the birth but can delegate the 
task to a healthcare professional. (Statute) 
 
In the 1990s there was an addition to practice, not a change in law, to avoid registration of 
babies that might have died in early pregnancy (usually a multiple pregnancy). There is also 
a discrepancy over babies born before 24 weeks who show signs of life, if recorded as a live 
birth the parents must register the birth. 
 
Non -Registerable Births 
Any baby born below 24 weeks gestation and not showing any signs of life does not need to 
be registered with the registry office. 
 Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 22 of 82 
 Parents may find it upsetting that they do not receive legal acknowledgment of their baby in 
these circumstances. SANDS provide certificates of birth for these baby’s ( Appendix 10 ), and 
many varieties can be found on their website www.sands.org , including those for single 
parents and same sex parents. Copies are available across site, or may be printed onto 
coloured pape r directly from this guideline. 
 
Registering a Stillbirth 
Any baby born dead over 24 weeks gestation must be registered as a stillbirth. At the time 
of birth, a doctor of middle grade or above must complete the stillbirth certificate in full – to 
include their GMC number. A sticker must be placed i n the notes and signed by the doctor 
to confirm this has been filled out in full and instructions have been given to parents 
(Stickers are kept with Stillbirth certificates at both sites – please inform pregnancy loss 
midwives if unavailable). 
 
Parents should be supported to understand that they are responsible for registering their 
baby’s stillbirth within 42 days . Healthcare providers should check their understanding of 
this before discharging from hospital. 
 
When the parents have registered the stillbirth, they will be given a certificate which they 
must give to their funeral director (If they’re having their own funeral) or the bereavement 
office (if they are having a hospital cremation). This will allow the baby’s body to be released 
from the hospital for funeral. 
 
Registering a Neonatal Death – Including babies born wit h signs of life at ANY gestation 
If a baby is born alive and lives for any period of time, the birth and death must be 
registered, irrespective of the baby’s gestation. At the time of death, a doctor of middle 
grade or above must complete the death certificate in full – to include their GMC number. A 
sticker must be placed in the notes and signed by the doctor to confirm this has been filled 
out in full and instructions have been given to parents (Stickers are kept with death 
certificates at both sites – please inform pregnancy loss midwives if unavailable). 
 
It is the doctors responsibility to inform the coroner of the death at the time of the event (A 
coroner is on call 24/7 and available via switchboard at both sites). The hospital doctor and 
the coroner must agree on the appropriate wording of the death certificate, this is usually 
done verbally and confirmed by fax. 
 
Parents should be advised that the death should be registered within five working days, 
except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. if maternal condition prevents). The birth and 
death may be registered at the same appointment. 
 Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 23 of 82 
 When the parents have registered the death , they will be given a certificate which they 
must give to their funeral director (If they’re having their own funeral) or the bereavement 
office (if they are having a hospital cremation). This will allow the baby’s body to be released 
from the hospital for funeral. 
Section B – Going home after Diagnosis 
 
Most women will be advised to go home after their initial assessment and administration of 
Mifepristone. Women should be given the leaflet “ Pregnancy loss – giving birth ” )Appendix 
20) prior to this, and the midwife should ensure she has a clear understanding of when to 
return. 
The pregnancy loss midwives should be informed of the loss by email, and will endeavour to 
contact the woman during this period to make introductions and offer support. This may 
not always be possible; therefore it is advisable to offer advice to parents about how they 
may cope with this difficult period of time, for example, arranging 
clothing/blankets/keepsakes that they may like to bring in for their baby. Advise women to 
bring snacks and home comforts if they wish. 
Ensure women are encouraged to contact the maternity unit with any worries during this 
time, and make them aware that they are welcome to return to the hospital if they feel they 
cannot cope at home. 
See section C – religious and cultural beliefs. It may a good time for families to access the 
hospital chaplain for telephone support at home. The chaplain may be able to make plans 
for a blessing if this is their wish, or may just be a listening ear. They are a very valuable 
resource and are happy to be contacted in these circumstances. Ensure parents receive the 
information leaflet and are advised that this service is available regardless of religious or 
cultural beliefs. 
The midwife should also ensure that the woman is advised to call the maternity unit if she 
experiences any of the following: 
• Onset of contractions 
• Spontaneous rupture of membranes 
• Feeling unwell 

 Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 24 of 82 
 Section C - Understanding Grief 
 
Grief and mourning are powerful emotions and behaviours that can be disturbing both for 
the bereaved person and for all midwives, doctors, and support staff. As with all human 
emotions, grief is made up of a complex combination of feelings, physical sensations, 
thoughts and behaviours 
 
Understanding the ways in which grief manifests itself and how this changes over time can 
be helpful. It can help normalise what might otherwise seem like unusual behaviour and 
experiences. It can also be useful to have some idea about when and how things are likely to 
change. 
 
The course of grief has been broken down into different st ages or phases, and the process 
involves a number of tasks for the mourner. This process is not smooth or predictable and 
some people never reach acceptance. Many factors influence the course of grief but the 
general path and direction is the same. 
 
The four phases of Grief: 
 
Phase Features Task 
DENIAL 
 Shock; disbelief; sense of 
unreality, questioning 
results and treatment 
 To accept the reality of the 
loss 
Helped by: traditional 
rituals, involvement of family 
in care of baby after death. 
 
PAIN/DISTRESS Hurt; anger; guilt; 
searching; worthlessness 
 To experience the pain of 
grief 
Helped by: understanding 
that different people grieve 
in different ways and for 
different periods of time. 
 
REALISATION Depression; apathy; 
exhaustion; tearfulness; 
experiencing the loved one: 
smelling, hearing, seeing, 
feeling 
 To adjust to life without the 
person 
Helped by acceptance that 
changeable emotional states 
are normal. 
 
ACCEPTANCE Readiness to engage in new To relocate emotional Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 25 of 82 
 activities and relationships 
 energy elsewhere 

When parents leave the hospital following the death of their child they will have only just 
started on their journey through grief. Staff can help prepare them for this by mentioning: 
 
• Triggers – sights, sounds and smells associated with their pregnancy and baby may make 
them unexpectedly distressed. This is very natural and thinking ahead can sometimes help 
parents cope better. Families are often prepared for the difficulty of seeing unused baby 
clothes and equipment but may not have thought about how they might be affected by 
other things such as songs that were popular during their confinement or smells of toiletries 
they used during pregnancy. Women who go on to try for another baby are often surprised 
by how distressed they can become with the onset of a period. 
 
• Anniversary effects – for parents who have lost a child the year is peppered with 
meaningful dates. These include not only the baby’s date of birth and death but also special 
times of year such as Christmas and Mother’s Day. It is helpful for parent to know that it is 
not unusual to feel more upset around these times of year. 
 
• Other losses and separations – routine experiences such as being left alone when a 
partner returns to work or goes away for the first time following the death of a baby can 
reawaken feelings of loss and abandonment. 
 
• Differences -- in grieving and seeking comfort and consolation can be trying for some 
relationships. Couples need to be aware that their way of dealing with their baby’s death 
may not be the same as their partner’s. It does not mean that they do not feel as sad about 
their loss. Similarly couples may differ in their need for physical comfort. On the one hand 
they may want the comfort of being held closely and the reassurance of still being attractive 
to their partner. On the other hand they may not want this to move onto intercourse. If 
couples are not aware of these differences misunderstandings can occur and relationships 
suffer 
Section D - Religious and Cultural Beliefs 
 
1. Patients admitted to the BSUH NHS Trust come from a variety of ethnic and religious 
backgrounds. In the event of a death, grief may easily be increased if staff members do 
not comply with the dictates or preferences of individual religious or cultural beliefs. 
2. Muslim, Jewish and other religions’ relatives may request that the death be processed 
immediately. Guidance for this is via the chaplaincy contact list or via switchboard 
(Appendix 10) Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 26 of 82 
 3. The trust offers 24 hour access to an on -call chaplain, who may contacted via 
switchboard. 
4. Chaplaincy is an invaluable resource regardless of religious denomination, and should be 
offered to all women/families affected by bereavement. 
5. There is a Book of Remembrance in the chapel. This is accessible 24 hours a day and is 
available to all parents. If parents complete the book of remembrance they will be 
informed of memorial services arranged by the chaplaincy team. 
6. See Appendix B. 
Section E - Creating Memories 
 
Many parents feel a strong desire to cherish and remember their baby and to preserve his 
or her continuing presence in their lives. Physical items connected to their baby may help to 
confirm the reality of his or her short existence and provide comfort as well as a fo cus for 
their grief. (SANDS 2016 ) 
Some parents may only wish to see or hold their baby for a short period of time; however 
others may wish to hold or keep the baby in the room with them for long er or overnight. 
Babies should be placed in cuddle cots (provided at each site) when they spend time w ith 
their parents and family. Parents can take as long as they need with their baby and a cold 
cot can be set up in their room. They will be placed into a casket when they are 
subsequently taken to the mortuary. 
Carers should avoid persuading parents to have contact with their stillborn baby, but should strongly 
suppo rt and facilitate such desires when expressed. SANDS (2016) recommend that parents are 
offered opportunities more than once, as they may change their mind at various stages. 
Parents who are considering naming their baby should be advised that after registration a 
name cannot be entered at a lat er date, nor can it be changed. If parents do decide to name 
their baby, all carers should refer to the baby by name where possible , including at follow –
up meetings. 
 
Parents should be offered, but not persuaded, to retain artifacts of remembrance. 
 
Verbal consent should be sought from the parents and information governance regulations 
should be complied with for clinical photography and their storage in the notes . 
 
Memory boxes are provided by SANDS and 4LOUIS. Smaller boxes are provided for losses < 
24/40; however please use your discretion when deciding which box to offer. 
 
A. Hand & Foot prints Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 27 of 82 
 
Inkless wipes and paper are provided at both RSCH and PRH sites and are stored in the 
pregnancy loss room on each labour ward. Please inform the pregnancy loss midwives if 
any restocking is required. 
 
It is easier to achieve good quality prints if ta ken by two people. One person should hold 
the h and/foot steady and the other may ‘roll’ the paper onto it. 
 
Please secure in an envelope with the woman’s hospital number in the hospital notes if 
parents do not wish to have them, as may change their mind in future. 
 
Our memory boxes are provided by SANDS and 4LOUIS. These contain clay impression 
sets which can be used for hand and foot prints in addition to the paper prints. 
 
B. Photographs 
Cameras and colour printers are provided at both sites . Individual SD cards are provided 
within the memory boxes. These can be given to parents in addition to prints. 
 
Take as many photographs as you feel appropriate. Blankets, knitted nests, clothes and 
hats are available in the pregnancy loss rooms at each site. Please inform the pregnancy 
loss midwives if there is low stock of anything you need. 
 
Offer to take photographs of parents with their baby if they are spending time with 
them. These moments are precious and should be captured if possible. 
 
Some, but not all Bounty photographers are able to assist with photography. During 
working hours, approach bounty staff directly if they are on site. 
 
C. Other Mementoes 
• A lock of hair if possible – place in small jewelry box provided. 
• Name bands 
• Cot card 
• Certificate of birth for non-registerable babies ( if born under 24 weeks) 
• Teddy’s – give one to parents and one to stay with baby. 
 
D. Chestnut Tree House Neonatal Services 
Chestnut Tree House is a children’s charity providing hospice care services and community 
support for children and young people with progressive life -shortening conditions 
throughout East and West Sussex, Brighton and Hove and South East Hampshire. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 28 of 82 
 When a baby dies, families are offered the use of the bereavement suite, ’Stars’. There is a 
cool room where their baby can remain for a period of time. Support is offered whilst 
planning a funeral, in saying their goodbyes and continues with optional counselling and 
remembrance events in the future. 
Midwives may refer families to Chestnut Tree House in instances where parents and 
extended family members would like to spend some extra time with their baby, but may not 
wish to return to their own home or stay in hospital. 
To make a referral, call the Community Nurse Manager on 01903 871803, or contact the 
hospice via their switchboard on 01903 871800. 
The hospice is located at: Dover Lane 
Arundel 
West Sussex 
BN18 9PX 
Nb: if the baby is over 24 weeks gestation, it will be necessary to liaise with the mortuary for 
advice to arrange the release of the baby from our hospitals. 
Below 24 weeks gestation (if not born showing signs of life), it is acceptable to release the 
baby directly from the maternity unit using form ‘release of baby’s body to parents’ 
The bereavement midwives will be able to help you with this. 
Section F - Pregnancy Loss in Multiple Pregnancy 
 
Families who have lost a baby from a twin/ triplet pregnancy face the difficult challenge of 
dealing with the bereavement, while often simultaneously feeling anxious about the 
prognosis for a surviving baby. 
 
Parents generally appreciate it when staff recognise that their surviving baby is a twin. 
Parents usually welcome the opportunity to discuss the loss of the twin who died. Parents 
really value the empathy they receive from staff when one of their twins dies. Offer 
memory making . Parents find comfort in mementoes of both their twins. Parents can find 
the discharge from hospital of their surviving twin difficult. The neonatal team can provide 
Butterfly stickers that can be placed on or next to the cot when a baby has died , to alert 
staff that the baby is a survivor of a multiple pregnancy. These are available on TMBU and 
SCBU on request. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 29 of 82 
 Section G - Legal Entitlements 
 
Parents who have suffered a stillbirth above 24 weeks or a neonatal death at any gestation 
are entitled to their full maternity/paternity rights, including maternity leave and pay. 
 
Parents who have suffered a miscarriage before 24 weeks are only entitled to 
maternity/paternity rights if there baby was born with signs of life and was registered as a 
live birth and subsequent death. 
 
Sick leave related to a miscarriage before 24 weeks is protected in the same way as sick 
leave for a pr egnancy related illness, so women are not limited in how much they can take 
and it must be recorded separately from oth er sick leave . 
 
See the leaflet “Your entitlements following the loss of your baby ” for more information 
from my pregnancy matters. This can be found in both bereavement rooms in hard copy, 
and is in the SANDS packs. 
Section H - Taking baby home 
 
Som e parents find it comforting to have time with their baby outside of the clinical setting. 
This may also be an opportunity for siblings and other relatives to see the baby and create 
memories. Please use the form “ Taking baby home ” (Appendix 8 ) and ensure parents are 
advised to keep baby cool. Parents should be loaned a cold cot and shown how to use it – 
there are two at each site. Please contact the pregnancy loss midwives if you need advice. 
There is no legal reason why the parents may not take the baby home unless the case has 
been referred to the coroner. 
Parents who do not wish to take their baby home should be offered the opportunity to stay in 
hospital for long enough to spend time with their baby . Parents should not feel rushed to leave. 
Section I - Funeral arrangements 
 
According to the coroner products of conception below 23 weeks plus 6 days which at no 
stage have shown signs of independent viability are the property of the parents and if 
parents so wish they can remove them from the hospital. If parents wish to remove the 
baby /products of conception then a copy of the letter (Appendix J) stating that they have 
taken the baby can be signed before they leave the hospital. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 30 of 82 
 
By law, all babies born at or after 24 weeks gestation must be formally buried or cremated. 
 
Private Funerals 
 
Parents can arrange the funeral themselves and this should be supported . Most funeral 
directors do not charge for babies and children, however parents should be advised to 
check this when they make contact . A list of funeral directors for each site can be found in 
Appendix 7 . 
 
A list of local funeral directors should be given to parents with their SANDS information 
pack. These are available at both sites, and are found in all folders regardless of gestation. 
 
Parents should be aware that if they are having a post -mortem, the funeral can take place 
when the baby is returned to the mortuary from St Thomas’s. This is usually no longer 
than 10 days, but may be longer in some cases such as when an inquest is indicated. 
 
Funeral directors will not usually charge for a basic funeral for a baby (of any gestation or 
age). Parents should be encouraged to contact a funeral director as soon as they are ready, 
as they are best placed to assist them with the process. 
 
Parents have 30 days to instruct a funeral director, after which time the hospital will 
arrange cremation. It is important that parents are aware of this. The pregnancy loss 
midwives are able to help them with this. 
 
Hospital Funerals 
The trust will provide a funeral for parents if they choose. These are cremations; burials 
cannot be arranged by the trust. 
 
Currently at our hospitals there is no opportunity for parents to be invo lved in hospital 
funerals. Thes e are communal service s which are not publically attended. Current 
arrangements for ashes are as follows: 
 
PRH – Crematorium will provide ashes for babies cremated above 24 weeks gestation if 
parents would like them. The bereavement office will assist with these arrangements 
 
RSCH – No ashes are made available regardless of gestation if the hospital is arranging the 
cremation. If parents would like ashes they should be encouraged to use a funeral director. 
They will not be under any obligation to arrange or attend a service if they do not wish to. 
 
Local information for crematoriums can be found here: Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073

Section J - Bereavement Support for Parents 
 
BSUH has responsibility to provide sensitive support at the time of death and immediately 
following, as well as clear and accurate information to relatives and close friends. 
In the maternity wards parents can be offered further support from the Chaplain by direct 
referrals from the midwives or doctors 24/7 via switchboard . We can also offer parents 
referral by the midwives/doctors to local support groups. 
Parents need to be advised that bereavement support may also fall to voluntary and 
religious organisations and staff in Pr imary health care, See appendix 3 for a comprehensive 
list of leaflets & support group s. 
There is currently no bereavement counselling provided by BSUH for pregnancy loss. The 
pregnancy loss midwives are able to assist with signposting to local charities for counselling 
and/or group support. 
Section K - Care of Family Members 
 
Fathers grieve too. Most fathers value the opportunity to be with the baby after death and 
the chance to receive mementoes and say “goodbye”. The natural tendency for staff to 
concentrate attention on the bereaved mother often leaves fathers feeling somewhat 
neglected. They are expected and to take on the practical role of decision -making and 
informing relatives and friends. Fathers may welcome that responsibility but they also need 
the same concern and sympathy afforded to their partners. 
 
In most families where there are other children, parents will have started to involve them in 
the pregnancy. When the baby dies the parents may be unable to think about the effect on 
the other children or how they might best help and support them. Children can mourn Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 32 of 82 
 unseen if they do not have an adult to turn to and are not involved in the rites and rituals of 
death. Children are aware of death from a very early age although their understanding 
varies according to their personal development. By around the age of 7 most children have a 
fairly good grasp of what death entails. Younger children are not so logical in their thinking. 
They find it hard to understand that all functions and sensations cease when a person dies. 
Parents and staff should be prepared when a young child says something that indicates they 
do not fully appreciate what has happened, or the whereabouts of the baby. Young children 
commonly feel guilty about the death of a sibling and the parents need to discuss this with 
them. 
Grandparents may feel distressed at the distress of their own children as well as their own 
sadness at the loss of a new baby in the family. Leaflets are available in the SANDS packs, 
and as separate booklets which are available in both Hummingbird rooms. 
Section L - Support for Staff 
 
Professionals involved in caring and supporting bereaved families are likely to need support 
themselves. They may find it difficult to manage their personal reactions at the same time as 
performing a professional role – particularly if the event brings up emotions to do with their 
own experience of loss. 
All staff involved with caring for a woman with pregnancy loss should be offered the 
opportunity for a ‘debrief’ or After Action Review (AAR) may need to be considered in some 
situations. Other colleagues, Supervisors of Midwives, Chaplains or the Occupational Health 
staff may also be approached to allow opportunities to talk over the events. 
The pregnancy loss midwives are available to support staff with any support or training 
needs they may have on a one to one or group basis. Please contact them by email to 
arrange a time if you feel you would benefit from this. 
Some further resources for support for professionals can be found in in Appendix 4. 
Section M – Datix 
 
Ensure a Datix is completed (and document this number in the notes) to ensure the case is 
reviewed in a multi -professional meeting using a standardized approach.

 Buddhism 
 
Special considerations for Buddhist s 
• Access to a day room or a single room may be required to provide the peace and quiet for 
meditation and chanting. 
• The Chapel can be used for visiting Buddhists to pray with the mother and/or the use of a side 
room is valued. 
• Hand washing facilities will be needed prior to meditation. 
• The mother may wish to sleep on the floor. 
• The image of a Buddha brings comfort together with flowers and an incense stick. These must be 
handled respectfully. 
• It is important to treat the scriptures and Spiritual Writings with respect. Do not place any books or 
other objects on top of them. 
• Many Buddhists are vegetarians. 
 
Requirements following death 
• When fetal or neonatal death is anticipated, the parent or a representative should contact the 
Buddhist monk to pray or chant a blessing. 
• After the death a Buddhist monk should attend before the baby is placed in the coffin. There are 
no restrictions on who should handle the body and there is no objection, on religious grounds, to 
post -mortem examination. 
• There are no time requirements for the funeral however the bodies are cremated not buried. 

Christianity 
 
Special considerations for Christian s 
• There are many branches of the Christian religion, sharing the same beliefs but with different 
traditions and practices. 
• The Hospital Chaplain, or the parents’ own Minister or Priest, can provide spiritual support. 
• A Bible may be requested. 
 
Requirements following death 
• Parents may wish prayers to be said by the Chaplain or by their own Minister or Priest. 
• There are no restrictions on who should handle the body and there is unlikely to be any objection 
on religious grounds to a post -mortem. 
 
Emergency Baptism Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 38 of 82 
 • In the case of serious neonatal illness/prematurity, the possibility of emergency baptism should be 
put to Christian parents. With their consent the Chaplain, or the parent’s local minister, should be 
informed as soon as possible. In an emergency, any lay person may be the minister for Baptism, 
preferably in the presence of at least one other member of staff. 

Hinduism 
 
Special considerations Hindu s 
• Hinduism is defined by what people do rather than what they really think. Consequently there is 
more uniformity of behaviour than belief. 
• There is a preference for women to be cared for by women and to preserve modesty as far as 
possible. 
• Personal hygiene is very important, a bowl of water should be provided when a bedpan is to be 
used. 
• Many Hindus do not eat meat and some do not eat eggs. Most drink cows milk. Care must be 
taken about using plates that have previously been used for serving meat. Single use plates may be 
used. 
 
Requirements following death 
• Post -mortems are accepted but are disliked, particularly in the case of children and neonates. 
• All procedures at death must be consulted with individual families. 
• In general the midwives or other hospital staff take care of fetal deaths. It is common to bury the 
fetus. It used to be the practice to bury all neonates and children up to 5 years of age but 
increasingly in this country parents are opting for cremation. 
• The family may wrap the body on a plain sheet brought from home. 
• Funeral arrangements are organised through a specialist funeral director. If additional advice is 
required the fun eral director can usually help. 

Islam 
 
Special considerations for Muslims 
• Great importance is placed on cleanliness. A shower is preferred to a bath. A bowl of water should 
always be provided when a bedpan is offered. 
• Preservation of modesty may be very important and women will prefer to be cared for by female 
staff. A woman may request that her husband or a female companion be present during a medical 
examination. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 39 of 82 
 • Times of prayer are dawn, noon, mid afternoon, just before sunset and before retiring for sleep. 
The mother needs to stand on clean ground or on a prayer mat facing Mecca (southeast in Britain). 
Privacy is appreciated but not essential. 
• During the time of Ramadan all healthy Muslims are required to fast. Ill patients and pregnant 
women are exempt from this. Food should be made available before dawn and after sunset. 
• Taking medication during the fast may cause problems, no undue pressure should be applied. The 
local Mosque will provide advice and support in this situation. 
• Pork and alcohol are forbidden 
 
Requirements following death 
• No part of the dead body should be cut out, harmed or donated. A coroner's PM is the only 
exception. 
• If it is unavoidable for a non -Muslim health worker to handle th e body they should wear gloves. 

Judaism 
 
Special considerations for Jews 
• No particular religious observance is demanded for the stillborn or liveborn baby. 
• Before stillbirth/death – no form of preparation is indicated (although the observant Jewish family 
will constantly invoke the help and solace of the Almighty). 
• Most Jews do not eat pork or offal and many will only eat kosher food. 
 
Requirements following death 
• Ideally only Jewish people should handle the body after death, but Jewish authorities recognise 
that the staff must carry out a minimum of preparation of the body. Similarly, the body should be in 
the presence of a Jew (the ‘wa tcher’) at all times until the burial. 
• A post -mortem is not permitted, although a Coroner’s post -mortem cannot be refused. 
• The burial should take place as soon as possible after death, although none are performed on the 
Sabbath or religious festivals. Set prayers are said at the funeral. The immediate relatives often 
undergo a seven day period of mourning (‘Shiva’) as for adults. 
• Jewish Branch of SANDS – 020 8954 4912 

Paganism 
 
Special considerations for the Pagan 
• Ensure that the religion is recorded correctly, not as ‘no religion’, or N/A Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 40 of 82 
 • Most Pagans will not have any unusual needs, but during one of their festivals they may ask for 
privacy during visiting hours to allow them to worship with their friends. 
• Because of the diverse traditions within Paganism individuals should be asked how their needs can 
best be met while in hospital. 
• Their families may not be aware of their beliefs and most Pagans are wary of making their beliefs 
known. Therefore this information must be treated as confidential. 
• Pagans may wish to have a small white candle or a small figure of the Goddess on their locker. 
• They may be vegetarian, vegan or on raw food diets 
 
Requirements following death. 
• It is important that Pagans have the name and telephone number of their Spiritual advisor to 
attend them. The Chaplain would be inappropriate unless requested. 
• Crem ation or burial are acceptable. 

Rastafaranism 
 
Special consideration for the Rastafarian 
• Rastafarians may be reluctant to accept Western medicines, preferring to use alternative 
therapies. They may be reluctant to answer questions. 
• Fear of contaminating the body influences the attitude to transfusion. 
• Many consider legal marriage to be unnecessary and extended families may be very complex. 
• Rastafarians may be unwilling to wear hospital garments that have been worn by others, 
disposable theatre gowns may be more acceptable. 
• Visiting the sick is important and visitors often arrive in large groups. 
• All forms of pig meat are forbidden. Some fish such as herring and sardines are not eaten. Only 
natural food that has not been canned or chemically treated is eaten. Some Rastafarians are 
vegetarian. 
 
Requirements following death 
• The family may pray at the bedside. 
• There are no rites or rituals before or after death. 
• Post -mortems and transplants are generally unacceptable. 
• Burial is preferred, altho ugh cremation is not forbidden. 

Sikhism 
 Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 41 of 82 
 Special consideration for the Sikh 
• Women prefer to be treated by female staff 
• Sikhs prefer to wash in flowing water before meals, after using the lavatory or bedpan 
• Often vegetarian and may not eat eggs or fish. 
 
Requirements following death 
• The family may wish to say or sing prayers often using taped hymns or prayers. 
• Sikhs are always cremated

 Please be assured that your baby /child will always be treated with care and respect. 
Section 1: Your decisions about a post mortem examination Select one of these 3 options. 
A complete post mortem This gives you the most information. It includes an external examination, 
examining the internal organs, examining small samples of tissue under a microscope, and taking 
x-rays (or other forms of imaging such as CT or MRI) and medical photographs. Tests may also be 
done for infection and other problems and the placenta may also be examined. 
If you think you may have another baby in the future and are worried that the problem might occur 
again, a complete post mortem is the best way to try to find out. 
 I/We agree to a complete post mortem examination. 
OR 
A limited post mortem This is likely to give less information than a complete post mortem. 
A limited post mortem includes an external examination, examining the internal organs in the 
area(s) of the body that you agree to, examining small samples of tissue under a 
microscope, and taking x -rays (or other forms of imaging such as CT or MRI) and medical 
photographs. Tests may also be done for infection and other problems and the placenta may 
also be examined. 
 I/We agree to a limited post mortem examination. 
Please indicate what can be examined: 
 Abdomen Chest and neck Head Other .................……. 
OR 
An external post mortem This may not give any new information. 
An external post mortem includes a careful examinati on of the outside of the body, x -rays (or 
other forms of imaging) and medical photographs. The placenta may also be examined. 
 I/We agree to an external post mortem examination. 
 
Section 2: Tissue samples Only if you consent to a complete or limited post mortem 
With your agreement, the tissue samples taken for examination under a microscope will be kept as 
part of the medical record (in small wax blocks and on glass slides). This is so that they can be 
re-examined to try to find out more if new tests or new information become available. This could be 
especially useful if you think you may have another baby in the future. 
 I/We agree to the tissue samples being kept as part of the medical record for 
 possible re-examination. If consent is not given, you must note below what should 
 be done with the tissue samples. See Section 9 Item 6 for more information.

University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 50 of 82 
 Notes to Section s 1 and 2 if required …………………………………………………………………… …………………………… 
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………............. ........ ................................ 
Section 3 : Genetic testing 
To examine the baby’s /child’s chromosomes or DNA for a possible genetic disorder or condition, the 
pathologist takes small samples of skin, other tissue and/or samples from the placenta (afterbirth). 
With your agreement, this material may be kept as part of the medical record so that it can be re -
examined to try to find out more if new tests or new information become available. This could be 
especially useful if you think you may have another baby in the future. 
 I/We agree to genetic testing of samples of skin, other tissue and/or the placenta. 
 If samples should not be taken from any of these, please note this below. 
 I/We agree to the genetic material may be kept as part of the medical record for 
 possible re -examination. See Section 9 Item 6 for more information. 
 
Notes to Section 3 if required ………………………………… ……………………………... ………… ………………………………. 
…………………………………………………………………………………………………….................. ........................................ 
Section 4: Keeping tissue samples for training professionals and for research 
Section 4 covers additional separate consent that you may decide to give. It will not affect what you 
have already agreed to above, what is done during the post mortem, or the information you get 
about your baby’s /child’s condition, but it may be helpful for others in the future. 
With your agreement, the tissue samples may also be examined for quality assurance and audit of 
pathology services to ensure that high standards are maintained. 
 I/We agree to the tissue samples being kept and used for quality assurance 
 and audit. 
Tissue samples, medical images and other information from the post mortem can be important for 
training health professionals. Identifying details are always removed when items are used for 
training. 
I/We agree to anonymised tissue samples, images and other relevant information 
from the post mortem being kept and used for professional training. 
Tissue samples, medical images and other relevant information from the post mortem can also be 
useful in research into different conditions and to try to prevent more deaths in the future. All 
research must be approved by a Research Ethics Committee. 
 I/We agree to tissue samples, images and other relevant information from the post 
 mortem being kept and used for ethically approved medical research. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 51 of 82 
 You can withdraw consent for any of the above at any time in the future. To do so, please contact 
the hospital and ask fo r the histopathology department (see contact details at end of form). 
 
Section 5 : Keeping one or more organs for diagnostic purposes 
(This section is to be used if an organ is to be kept after the body has been released from 
the mortuary, if an organ needs to be kept for a period longer than the standard 10 days 
or if you wish to donate an organ for research or training). 
 
In most cases, all the organs will be returned to your baby's/child’s body within 10 days after the 
post mortem examination, before the body is released from the mortuary . But occasionally the 
doctors may recommend keeping one or more organs for longer, to carry out further detailed 
examination to try to find out more about why your baby/child died. This might take several more 
days and so could affect the timing of your baby’s/child’s funeral. The person who discusses the post 
mortem with you will tell you if it is likely ( see Section 9 Item 9 for more information ). 
 
 I/We agree to further detailed examination of the organ(s) specified below: 
 Any organ 
 The following organ(s) ……………………………………………………………… …………………………………….. 
 
If you agree to further detailed examination, you also need to decide what should be done with the 
organ(s) after the examination: 
 I/We want the hospital to dispose of the organ(s) respectfully as required by law. 
 I/We want the organ(s) returned to the funeral director we appoint for separate 
 cremation or burial. 
 I/We want to delay the funeral until the organ(s) have been returned to my/our 
 baby’s/child’s body. 
 
Alternatively, after the further detailed examination, you may decide to donate the organ(s) for one 
or both of the following purposes: 
 I/We agree to donate the organ(s) to be used to train health professionals. 
 I/We agree to donate the organ(s) to be used for ethically approved medical research. Pregnancy Loss (RSCH PRH only ) MP073 
University Hospital Sussex NHS Trust East Page 52 of 82 
 If you agree to donate one or more organ(s), they will be respectfully disposed of as required by the 
Human Tissue Authority when they are no longer needed. 
If you change your mind about this donation at any time in the future, and want to withdraw your 
consent, please contact the hospital and ask for the histopathology department (see contact details 
at the end of the form).

Section 9 : Notes for the consent taker 
1. “Anyone seeking consent for hospital PM examinations should have relevant experience and a good 
understanding of the procedure. They should have been trained in dealing with bereavement and in the 
purpose and procedures of PM examinations and they should have witnessed a PM examination” (Human 
Tissue Authority, Code of Practice 3, 2009). 
2. Written information about post mortems should be offered to all parents before you discuss the form 
with them. 
3. If the parents have a specific request that you are not sure about, contact the pathologist before the form 
is completed . 
4. Make sure that an appropriate time and date are entered in the Changing your mind section at the 
beginning of the form, and the parent(s) understand what to do if they change their minds. The post 
mortem should not begin unless this section is completed. It is your responsibility to ensure that, if the 
parent(s) change their minds, they will be able to contact the person or department entered on this 
form. If the parents do not want a copy of the form, they should still be given written information about 
changing their minds. 
5. Write the mother’s or the baby’s /child’s hospital number in the box at the foot of each page of the form. 
For a baby who was born dead at any gestation use the mother’s hospital number; for a baby who was 
born alive use the baby’s hospital number. 
6. Sections 2 and 3: Tissue samples and genetic material If the parents do not want tissue samples or 
genetic material kept as part of the medical record, explain the different options for disposal (below) and 
note their decisions in the relevant section. 
If disposal is requested, it will usually take place only after the full post mortem report has been 
completed. The options are: disposal by a specialist hospital contractor; release to a funeral director of the 
parents’ choice for burial; or release to the parents themselves. For health and safety reasons, blocks and 
slides cannot be cremated. Genetic material is normally incinerated. 
7. Send the completed form to the relevant pathology department, offer a copy to the parent(s), and put a 
copy into the mother’s (for a stillbirth or miscarr iage) or the baby’s/child’s medical record. 
8. Record in the clinical notes that a discussion about the post mortem examination has taken place, the 
outcome, and any additional important information. 
9. Possible further examination of one or more organs Very rarely, it may be recommended that an organ is 
kept for more detailed examination after the baby /child is released from the mortuary (e.g. for complex 
brain malformations and complex cardiac malformations, or for research purposes). In this case, Section 
5 Keeping one or more organs for diagnostic purposes should be completed. 
• If you already know that this is recommended, discuss it with the parents and also explain how it 
might affect funeral arrangements. If they consent, Section 5 should be completed . 
• If the pathologist recommends further examination after the post mortem has begun, they will 
contact you or the unit. The parents should then be contacted as soon as possible to discuss their 
wishes and to explain how keeping the organ might affect funeral arrangements. If they consent, 
Section 5 should be completed.

Dear 
 
We are sorry about your recent pregnancy loss. We understand you have asked if you may 
take the products home to dispose of them yourself. 
 
We would like to advise you of the possible risk of infection from the contents of the 
container and, for this reason, we advise you not to open the container. Please be advised 
of the following guidelines in regard to disposal: 
 
- Advice on home burials and on alternative funeral practices that can minimise 
environmental harm, can be obtained from a number of sources, including the Natural 
Death Centre at www.naturaldeath.org.uk . 
- People who want information on home burials must consult with your local council’s 
Environmental Health Department and the Environment Agency who will be able to provide 
advice. 
 
If you change your mind, we will take back the container but the seal must be intact and not 
broken. 
 
The Trust agrees to you taking the container and its contents away from the hospital on 
your discharge home. It does this on the basis that you agree: 
 
1. To accept responsibility for the safe and appropriate storage and disposal of the 
container and its contents, as soon as the Trust has passed them to you. 
2. You will indemnify the Trust against any claims for loss, injury or damage 
relating to the container and its contents. 
 
Please sign and date both copies of this letter to confirm your agreement.

 Appendix 18 – Referring neonatal Deaths to the Coroner 
 
REPORT OF DEATH BY DOCTOR TO 
THE SENIOR CORONER FOR WEST SUSSEX 
 
Please type this form -the coroner’s officers will copy and paste your text onto another 
document. 
 
Complete every space –Omissions cause delay for bereaved relatives. 
 
Then email to the relevant coroner’s officer at – 
 
Horsham Office – west.sussex.coroner@sussex.pnn.police.uk 
(Horsham, Crawley, Mid Sussex, Gatwick) 
Worthing Office – WS.Coroners.Wor@sussex.pnn.police.uk 
(Worthing, Chichester, Arun, Bognor Regis, Littlehampton, Midhurst, Petworth) 
(Your own hospital bereavement office may be able to do that.) 
 
As soon as a coroner’s officer is able, s/he will telephone the bereavement office / Surgery. If 
there is sufficient information on the report of death form then, by the time of that call, the Senior 
Coroner will usually have decided whether a post mortem examination is to take place. However, 
further discussion with the reporting doctor and/or general practitioner may be necessary before 
that decision can be made. 
 
The reporting doctor may not issue an MCCD to a family until the coroner’s officer has indicated 
the Senior Coroner’s agreement. Relatives should not be promised any time frame for this, as 
court commitments take priority. 
 
When a medical cause of death is agreed by the Senior Coroner, the doctor signing the MCCD 
must indicate on it that the coroner has been informed, and must record the cause exactly as 
finally agreed with the coroner’s officer, with no abbreviations. Otherwise, the bereaved family will 
be unable to register. 
 
Reports of death are dealt with during office hours only. 
 Monday to Friday, 8am to 4pm 
 
For out of hours queries re organ donation or homicides, 
Call Sussex Police on 101, and a coroner’s officer will call you back.

 Appendix 19 - Pregnancy Loss – Giving Birth 
 
The way that you give birth to your baby will depend on your individual circumstances. You 
will be able to talk about your options with your midwife and a senior doctor. 
It is usually recommended that your labour is induced, and that you aim to have a vaginal 
birth. This may come as a shock for you. A normal birth is usually safer for you, allows you to 
have a faster recovery and avoids added risks in future pregnancies if you were to have a 
caesarean section. 
We assure you that you will have dedicated one to one care from a midwife throughout, 
and you will have access to effective pain relief of your choice. Your midwife and doctor will 
talk you through this at every stage. 
Induction of labour 
If you agree to have your labour induced, you will usually be offered a tablet to take by 
mouth in the first instance. This prepares your body to go into labour and takes some time 
to work. We will usually suggest that you go home after taking this, and return to hospital 
the next day or the day after. It is important that you call the labour ward if: 
• You feel unwell or worried 
• You think your waters may have broken, if they haven’t already 
• You think that your labour has begun 
During this time at home, many women feel very frightened about what is to come. Please 
don’t hesitate to call the labour ward at any time, for any reason. If you feel that you would 
prefer to stay as an in -patient, and that going home is too distressing, please speak to your 
midwife as we can usually help you. 
When you return to the hospital, we will usually use a vaginal pessary to continue your 
induction. After this you will be given a tablet form of the same drug at regular intervals 
until your labour is established. 
Your midwife will available to support you and your partner or birth companion at all times. 
You are not alone. 
If you choose not to be induced If you are healthy, and would prefer to wait for labour to 
begin naturally, we will support you with this. Due to the increased risk of you becoming 
unwell, we recommend that you have regular blood tests and a check -up at the hospital 
(usually twice a week). If there is a long wait before labour commences, your baby’s 
condition may deteriorate in your womb. This may make it more difficult for a post -mortem 
to provide useful information, if you would like to have one.
