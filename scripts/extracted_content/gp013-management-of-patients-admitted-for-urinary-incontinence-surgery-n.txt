 To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol 
 
Management: 
 To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National

Urinary incontinence is a major health issue.15 -30% of women over the age of 65 and 
up to 50% of nursing home residents have urinary incontinence. 
 
1.1 Urinary incontinence is consistently associated with adverse effects on quality of 
life for patients. Adverse effects include embarrassment, social isolation, 
loneliness and sadness. It can also lead to depression. Clinicians should be aware 
of and take in to consideration the potentially serious adverse effect that even 
mild urinary incontinence has on a patient’s quality of life. 
 
1.2 Stress incontinence is involuntary urine loss associated with an increase in the 
intra - abdominal pressure for example, durin g coughing, sneezing or 
 physical activity. Stress urinary incontinence is the Urodynamic diagnosis 
 which was previously known as genuine stress incontinence. NICE guidelines 
 on the management of urinary incontinence.

1.3 Postoperative urinary retention can be a significant problem after incontinence 
surgery. Early recognition and management is recommended to avoid impaired 
bladder function, urinary tract infections, and disruption of surgical repair. 
1.4 The recent minimal invasive surgical procedures for stress urinary 
 incontinence are: - 
 Two incision sub urethral sling system 
1- Retro pubic mid - urethral tape procedures; tension free vaginal 
tape (TVT) 
2- Transobturator tape procedures (TOT) 
 
 Autologous rectus fascial sling 
 
 Urethral bulking agents (Bulkamid) 
1.5 The above surgical procedures can be done under general anaesthesia (GA), 
Spinal anaesthesia or local anaesthetic infiltratio n (LA) either with or without 
sedation and all of them are day case procedures. 
1.6 The objective assessment of the severity and the impact of the urinary 
incontinence on the quality of life is essential, so, every patient should complete 
a validated urinary questionnaire (ICIQ -UI) before the surgery. 
1.7 Six weeks after the surgery this should be repeated, together with a patient 
satisfaction questionnaire as a part of ongoing prospective audit. 
 Management of patients admitted GP013 
For urinary incontinence Surgery 
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 6 of 81.8 This guideline should be read in conjunction with other guidel ines relating to the 
management of patients admitted for operative procedures, such as 
thromboprophylaxis and consent guidelines. 
1.9 These guidelines are applicable to patients admitted to gynaecology ward or 
those fulfilling the criteria for day surgery unit (DSU) admission. 
 
2 Pre-Operative Management 
 
2.1 All cases admitted for TOT, TVT, autologous sling or Bulkamid do not require 
Rectal Enema or Perineal Shaving. 
2.2 All cases admitted for these operations need to be fasted from midnight. 
2.3 The patient will have the routine observation, routine checks and the routine 
enhanced recovery programme (ERP) whether she is on gynaecology ward or on 
the day surgery unit. 
2.4 Enhanced Recovery Programme. http://nww.bsuh.nhs.uk/the -trust/safety -and-
quality/safety/initiatives/enhanced -recovery -programme/ 
2.5 The patient will be seen by the consultant for preoperative counselling and 
consenting 
3 Post -Operative Bladder Care 
 
3.1 Most of the vaginal mid urethral sling operations do not have a Foley’s catheter 
or a vaginal pack inserted unless stated clearly in the post -operative care plan. 
3.2 Ensure patient passes urine before discharge 
3.3 Assess for symptoms of urinary retention or inc omplete bladder emptying 
 Urinary frequency 
 Slow stream 
 Pain 
 Incomplete emptying 
 Incontinence 
 Inability to void 
3.4 All women after urinary incontinence surgery or after removal of self -retaining 
catheter should be encouraged to void within 4 hours and reviewed at 4 hours 
to ensure complete bladder emptying. 
3.5 Fluid balance chart is essential with measured voids 
 
 Management of patients admitted GP013 
For urinary incontinence Surgery 
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 83.6 All women require assessment of post void residual ( PVR) by 4 hours of return 
from theatre the PVR should be measured within 10 –15 minutes of the void , in 
order to ensure accuracy 
4 Management of PVR/TWOC : 
 
4.1 Passing >200ml and having a residual volume <100ml twice should be 
considered normal. The residual volume <100ml twice should ebe considered 
normal. The residual urine is better checked after each voi d, to avoid missin g 
high residual volume. If the residual volume is high >400mls it is better to empty 
the bladder with an in/out cathertre once to avoid over -distention. Otherwise a 
self-retaining catheter should be inserted. 
 
4.2 If voided volumes are not increasing and residuals more than voided / If unable 
to pass urine OR residuals > 150 mL 4 -6 hours post operatively; insert self -
retaining foleys catheter (with flip flow valve preferably). Record amount of 
urine drained and plan discharge with catheter . 
 
4.3 Evaluate signs of urinary tract infection, check urine dipstick and start of 
antibiotics if warranted after a failed TWOC. 
 
4.4 These patients should be seen either on the gynaecology Ward or VLH, 
according to the patient’ preference, to try passing urine w ithout a catheter 
(TWC) 48 hours later. Follow same guidelines for TWOC as above. 
 
4.5 If the voiding difficulty continues after 48 hours, then the catheter with valve 
should be left in for another week. 
4.6 Alternatively, the patient could be taught intermitten t clean self -catheterisation 
(ICSC) by the urology naecology specialist nurse at BSUH and will follow up 
patients. 
 
4.7 Keep the surgeon informed. 
 
5 Post -Operative Prescription a nd Follow -Up 
 Management of patients admitted GP013 
For urinary incontinence Surgery 
 Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 85.1 Those patients who had TOT, TVTs or Bulkamid can eat & drink once the y are 
fully conscious and well enough either on gynaecology ward or DSU. 
5.2 It is acceptable for the patients to have a mild blood loss following the 
procedure (similar to what would be expected at the end of a period) as vaginal 
pack was not used. 
5.3 The patien t can go home once she passes urine and feels well enough to go 
home. If the patient is on gynaecology ward and there is an indication to keep 
her overnight, inform the surgeon please. 
5.4 Regular analgesia f or 48 hours then PRN for 5 days. 
5.5 Follow up in Urogynecology clinic as planned at the time of surgery
