KEY MESSAGES
1. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a common
pregnancy condition manifesting in the late-second or third
trimesters with maternal itching and elevated non-fasting bileacids ( >19
mmol/L).
2. The most signi ﬁcant perinatal sequelae of intrahepatic
cholestasis of pregnancy are iatrogenic and spontaneous
preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatalintensive care unit admission. The risk of stillbirth is increasedwhen bile acid levels are /C21100
mmol/L.
3. The mainstay of symptomatic treatment of itching is with
ursodeoxycholic acid, given daily in divided doses.
4. Antenatal fetal monitoring has not been shown to improve
perinatal outcomes. The risk of stillbirth may be lowered
with planned early birth based on the highest recorded bileacid level.
ABSTRACT
Objective: To summarize the current evidence and to make
recommendations for the diagnosis and management of
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
Target Population: Pregnant people with intrahepatic cholestasis of
pregnancy.
Options: Diagnosing the condition using fasting or non-fasting bile
acids, classifying disease severity, determining what treatment tooffer, establishing how to monitor for antenatal fetal wellbeing,
identifying when to perform elective birth.
Bene ﬁts, Harms, and Costs: Individuals with intrahepatic cholestasis
of pregnancy are at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomesincluding preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress and admission
to a neonatal intensive care unit, with an increased risk of stillbirth
when bile acid levels are /C21100
mmol/L. There is inequity in bile acid
testing availability and timely access to results, along withuncertainly of how to treat, monitor. and ultimately deliver these
pregnancies. Optimization of diagnostic and management protocols
can improve maternal and fetal postnatal outcomes.
Evidence: Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were
searched from inception to March 2023, using medical subject
headings (MeSH) and keywords related to pregnancy, intrahepaticcholestasis of pregnancy, bile acids, pruritis, ursodeoxycholic acid,and stillbirth. This document presents an abstraction of the
evidence rather than a methodological review.Validation Methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and
strength of recommendations using the Grading ofRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach. See Appendix A (Tables A1 for de ﬁnitions and
A2for interpretations).
Intended Audience: Obstetric care providers, including obstetricians,
family physicians, nurses, midwives, maternal efetal medicine
specialists, and radiologists.
Social Media Abstract: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy requires
adequate diagnosis with non-fasting bile acid levels which guide
optimal management and delivery timing.
SUMMARY STATEMENTS:
1. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a common pregnancy
condition manifesting in the late-second or third trimesters(moderate ).
2. The etiology of intrahepatic cholestasis is complex, involving a
combination of hormonal factors, genetic susceptibility, and envi-ronmental in ﬂuences ( low).
3. Intrahepatic cholestasis remains a diagnosis of exclusion and is
based on the presence of maternal pruritis, predominantly of the
palms and soles, along with elevated non-fasting bile acids ( >19
mmol/L) ( moderate ).
4. The perinatal sequelae of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in-
cludes increased risks of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pre-
term birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatal intensive careunit admission ( moderate ). Patients with intrahepatic cholestasis
and bile acids /C21100
mmol/L have a signi ﬁcantly increased risk of
stillbirth compared with the general population ( moderate ).
5. The mainstay of symptomatic treatment of pruritis is with urso-
deoxycholic acid (10 e15 mg/kg/d), given daily in 2 e3 divided
doses, which may also reduce the risk of preterm birth, but not
stillbirth ( high).
6. Antenatal fetal monitoring has not been shown to improve perinatal
outcomes ( moderate ).
7. Symptoms as well as intrahepatic cholestasis-associated
biochemical abnormalities are expected to resolve within 1 e2
weeks postpartum, although they may persist up to 4 weeks insome individuals ( moderate ).
8. Individuals who have been diagnosed with intrahepatic cholestasis
are at increased risk of future cholecystitis, cholelithiasis,pancreatic disease, goiter, and hypothyroidism ( low).
9. Recurrence of intrahepatic cholestasis in future pregnancies is
around 70% e90% ( low).
10. In patients with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
choosing hormonal contraception, progestin-only options are
associated with the lowest risk of non-pregnant cholestasis
(moderate ).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clinicians should include intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in
the differential diagnosis of any pregnant person with pruritis,particularly of the palms of the hands or soles of feet, in the late-
second or third trimester ( strong, moderate ).
2. Laboratory investigations for intrahepatic cholestasis should
include non-fasting bile acids, alanine aminotransferase, aspartateaminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin.
Additional testing or imaging should be guided by clinical ﬁndings
and differential diagnoses ( strong, moderate ).
3. Clinicians and health care authorities should advocate for univer-
sally available serum bile acid testing with timely access to results
(strong, low ).

cholestasis as raised non-fasting bile acid levels >19mmol/L
(strong, moderate ).
5. Repeat testing of non-fasting laboratory investigations should be
performed every 2 e4 weeks to monitor disease progression and
ascertain the highest recorded bile acid level ( strong, low ).
6. Atypical presentations of intrahepatic cholestasis should be
referred for specialist consultation by a maternal efetal medicine or
internal medicine physician ( strong, low ).
7. Clinicians should counsel patients diagnosed with intrahepatic
cholestasis regarding increased risks of preeclampsia, gestational
diabetes, preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatalintensive care unit admission. Furthermore, there is a signi ﬁcant
increase in the risk of stillbirth if bile acid levels are /C21100
mmol/L,
and some evidence demonstrating a modest increase in stillbirth
risk with bile acid levels >40mmol/L from 38 weeks gestation
onward ( strong, low ).
8. While topical emollients and antihistamines may be prescribed,
clinicians should offer treatment of pruritis in cholestasis of preg-nancy with ursodeoxycholic acid ( strong, moderate ).
9. The following therapies for intrahepatic cholestasis have been
shown to be ineffective and should not be prescribed by clinicians
to treat the condition: dexamethasone, cholestyramine, pheno-barbital, S-adenosylmethionine, activated charcoal, and epome-diol ( strong, moderate ).
10. All pregnant individuals should be advised to monitor fetal move-
ments as the mainstay of fetal wellbeing surveillance in intra-hepatic cholestasis and to seek timely care if indicated ( strong,
moderate ).
11. While additional fetal monitoring is not mandated in intrahepatic
cholestasis, local units may offer monitoring after discussion andshared decision-making ( conditional, low ); in patients with bile acid
levels between 40 ؘe99
mmol/L monitoring can include obstetric
ultrasound for biophysical pro ﬁle or electronic fetal heart rate
monitoring every 1 e2 weeks, and in patients with bile acid levels
/C21100mmol/L monitoring can include obstetric ultrasound for bio-
physical pro ﬁle or electronic fetal heart rate monitoring weekly or
twice weekly.
12. Based on expert opinion, clinicians should counsel their patients
regarding optimal delivery timing based on the highest recordednon-fasting bile acid level: 20 e39
mmol/L at 390e396weeks
gestation ( conditional, low ); 40e69mmol/L at 380e386weeks
gestation ( conditional, low ); 70e99mmol/L at 360e376weeks
gestation ( conditional, moderate ); and /C21100mmol/L by 36 weeks
gestation ( strong, high ) or earlier in patients with comorbidities or
other risks factors (i.e., multiple pregnancy, preeclampsia, gesta-
tional diabetes, previous stillbirth secondary to intrahepaticcholestasis and/or severe persistent maternal pruritus).
13. Patients with intrahepatic cholestasis should be offered contin-
uous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in labour ( conditional,
low).
14. Clinicians should con ﬁrm resolution of pruritis in intrahepatic
cholestasis at the 6-week postpartum visit and repeat bile acid and
liver transaminase testing in those where symptoms persist ( con-
ditional, low ).
15. Clinicians should pursue further workup or specialist consultation
for patients with persistent intrahepatic cholestasis symptoms or
biochemical abnormalities beyond the postpartum period ( condi-
tional, low ).
16. Clinicians should inform patients affected by intrahepatic
cholestasis that they and their family members are at a higher risk ofintrahepatic cholestasis in future pregnancies ( conditional, low ).

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most
common hepatic disease unique to pregnancy, with
wide-ranging incidence from 0.1% to >27% in certain
populations.1,2This multifactorial disease manifests in the
late-second or third trimesters of pregnancy and is usually
characterized by symptomatic pruritis alongside elevated
maternal bile acid levels. The etiology of ICP is likelycomplex, involving a combination of hormonal factors,
genetic susceptibility, and environmental in ﬂuences
(Figure 1 ).
While ICP can cause signi ﬁcant pruritis and distress,
serious maternal complications are not associated with the
condition. The most signi ﬁcant sequelae of ICP are iat-
rogenic and spontaneous preterm birth, neonatal respira-
tory distress, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)admission, and stillbirth.
3Available pharmacological
treatments for ICP aim to relieve pruritis but do not
improve perinatal outcomes. Rather, earlier delivery is used
to mitigate the potential for fetal or neonatal morbidity and
mortality. After delivery, ICP usually resolves rapidly, and
long-term hepatic effects are rare, aside from an increased
risk of ICP recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.
In recent years, there have been con ﬂicting opinions and
guidance on the optimal diagnostic and management ap-
proaches to minimize adverse outcomes from ICP .Important debate has centred on diagnostic bile acid level
criteria, universal and timely availability of testing, fetal
monitoring for wellbeing, perinatal risk of stillbirth, and
the optimal gestational age at which to recommend de-
livery. As such, this clinical practice guideline aims to
evaluate and summarize the available literature on ICP and
provide pragmatic and evidence-based recommendations
to guide clinical care options and optimize perinataloutcomes. Informed and shared decision-making should
underpin all aspects of diagnosis and management,
respecting the wishes of each individual patient.
Summary Statement 1
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INCIDENCE
ICP is the most common gestational disease that specif-
ically targets the liver, as opposed to preeclampsia or
HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low
platelets) syndrome, where hepatic dysfunction may be
encountered but usually with multisystem or fetoplacental
involvement.4Furthermore, these disease processes can
coexist with ICP .5e7
The incidence of ICP varies widely geographically and
ethnically. Incidence of 0.1% e0.3% has been reported in
North America, compared with 1.5% e3.2% in northern
Europe, and 4.0% e6.5% in Chile.4,8,9Higher incidence
has been reported in Latino (5.6%) and South Asian
(1.2%e1.5%) populations, with >27% incidence in the
Mapuche, a group of Indigenous Chileans8e10.
ETIOLOGY, RISK FACTORS AND
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Bile acids are produced in the liver in a highly regulated
manner due to their cytotoxicity, and pregnancy is believed
to have a cholestatic effect. Bile acids within the fetal
compartment result from fetal production, which starts as
early as 12 weeks gestation, as well as from transplacental
transfer.8Pregnancies without a diagnosis of ICP have a
fetal to maternal gradient to facilitate clearance of bile
acids and protect the fetus from their cytotoxic effects. In
ICP , a signi ﬁcant increase of maternal bile acid reverses
this gradient, resulting in accumulation within the fetal
compartment.3
Administration of oral progesterone in early pregnancy hasbeen associated with increased risk of ICP .
11Animal
studies have identi ﬁed that estrogen may alter the
expression of hepatic transport proteins and receptors
involved in bile acid homeostasis.8,12The ability of the
physiological hormonal changes of pregnancy to result in
pathology may be related to the presence of underlying
genetic susceptibility. Heterozygous variants in several
genes associated with bile acid synthesis and homeostasishave been associated with ICP, particularly those associ-
ated with the autosomal recessive disorder progressive
familial intrahepatic cholestasis, including ABCB4,ABBREVIATIONS

been associated with other forms of hepatobiliary disease
including benign recurrent hepatic cholestasis and chole-
lithiasis. Additional gene candidates that may infer risk for
ICP include NR1H4 ( farnesoid X receptor [FXR]),
ABCC2 , and NR1I2 (pregnane X receptor [PXR]).8,12
Environmental in ﬂuences also represent risk factors for
ICP, including selenium or vitamin D de ﬁciency and
pregnancy during the winter months.12e14ICP has been
reported to occur more frequently in pregnant individuals
with advanced maternal age, multiparity, multiple gestation
pregnancy, conception after in vitro fertilization, diabetes
mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, tobacco use,
and personal or family history of ICP.6e10Finally,individuals with preexisting liver disease, including hepa-
titis C, may be at increased risk of ICP ( Figure 2 ).15,16

CLINICAL FINDINGS
Clinical Presentation
The most common presenting symptom of ICP is pruritis
of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that is often
reported as worse at nighttime.17Pruritis usually occurs in
the latter half of the second trimester or early in the thirdtrimester and may appear 3 e4 weeks prior to any
abnormal laboratory ﬁndings. Other uncommonFigure 1. Summary of risk factors involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

pale stool or steatorrhea, dark urine, and malaise; however,
systemic complaints are atypical and would indicate the
need for further evaluation for other differential
diagnoses.1,18,19
Physical Exam
There are no primary dermatological lesions associated
with ICP; however, secondary excoriations and prurigo
nodules resulting from scratching by the patient are
common.20Jaundice may be present in up to 10% e15%
of patients with ICP, with an onset of approximately 3 e4
weeks after pruritis occurs.18Other ﬁndings, such as
encephalopathy or signs of fulminant liver failure, are
rare and warrant specialist review and assessment
(Appendix B ).
Laboratory Findings
In association with the clinical presentation described
above, elevation of serum bile acids is the most common
laboratory abnormality in ICP .20Although serum bile
acids may be normal at ﬁrst presentation with pruritis,
subsequent elevations are common, justifying ongoing
surveillance. Other common laboratory abnormalities
include elevated serum aminotransferases (alanineaminotransferase / aspartate aminotransferase [ALT/
AST]).19,20Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) may be
normal or moderately elevated. Laboratory abnormalities
typically resolve following delivery. If there is persistence
of abnormal laboratory ﬁndings beyond 6 weeks post-
partum, then further investigation for an etiology beyond
ICP is indicated.
Imaging Findings
While some international organizations20e22recommend
or suggest diagnostic imaging, there are no pathogno-
monic imaging ﬁndings associated with ICP.
DIAGNOSIS
Once ICP is suspected in a pregnant person with pruritus
(particularly of the hands and feet) in the second or third
trimester, diagnosis is con ﬁrmed by an elevation of total
serum bile acids (TSBA) with or without an elevation in
liver transaminases. However, a thorough history and
physical examination can reveal atypical ﬁndings in some
patients. Pregnant individuals with a dermatologic erup-
tion, jaundice, or any other atypical features, as well as
those presenting earlier in pregnancy should prompt theclinician to consider other causes ( Appendix B ).Figure 2. The pathophysiology of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Reproduced from Dixon and Williamson. The

November 27, 2024. For personal use only. No other uses without permission. Copyright ©2024. Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Highly elevated bile acids are strongly associated with
adverse fetal events, and the magnitude of the increase
correlates with more severe outcomes.23Hence, accurate,
timely, and freely available testing of bile acid levels is
important. Normal bile acid level ranges vary by labora-
tory; generally, the upper limit of normal is accepted as 10
mmol/L in the non-pregnant population.24It is known that
postprandial elevation in bile acids typically occur.
Furthermore, pregnancy itself causes both fasting andpostprandial bile acid levels to rise,
25possibly due to high
levels of estrogen and progesterone.
We endorse the contemporary de ﬁnition of ICP as bile
acid levels >19mmol/L and recommendation to perform
testing in the non-fasting state. These recommendations
are based on a study comparing bile acid levels in preg-
nancies with mild and severe ICP to uncomplicated con-
trol pregnancies, which found values as high as 19 mmol/L
in the uncomplicated group after eating a standardized
meal.25Similarly, in a study of 293 healthy asymptomatic
pregnancies tested after 37 weeks gestation, the upper limit
of TSBA levels were found to be 14.1 mmol/L fasting and
20.1mmol/L non-fasting.26Unfortunately, individuals with
mild ICP may in fact have fasting bile acid levels that are
lower than the non-pregnant value cutoff of 10 mmol/L,25
emphasizing the importance of non-fasting samples forincreased the sensitivity.
In pregnant people with pruritus, a strong clinical suspi-
cion of ICP, and non-fasting bile acids /C2019
mmol/L, serial
TSBA levels should be monitored prospectively every 2 e4
weeks, as there can be a lag between symptom onset and
bile acid rise.27
Liver transaminases (AST/ALT) are often elevated in ICP
and may in fact precede the rise in bile acids.28,29However,
a meta-analysis found no correlation of elevated trans-
aminases with obstetric outcomes,30so these values cannot
be used to establish the diagnosis of ICP nor predict
outcomes. For a condition that is cholestatic in nature,
GGT and bilirubin are most commonly normal.29,31If
elevated, bilirubin levels remain inferior to bile acid levels
for both determining diagnosis and predicting stillbirth.30
ICP remains a diagnosis of exclusion, which raises the
question of which laboratory tests should be performed.
The pro ﬁle of elevated bile acids and AST/ALT with
normal bilirubin and GGT are characteristic of the syn-
drome. If the pattern is not as expected (i.e., signi ﬁcantly
raised GGT/bilirubin), this should prompt investigation
for an alternative diagnosis.Several studies have found that the yield on routine testing
for other medical conditions such as viral infections and
maternal autoimmune diseases is low.11,32In a retrospec-
tive study of 531 pregnancies with elevated bile acids,
testing for viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A, B, and C) and immune causes (antinuclear
antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-
mitochondrial antibodies) was performed in roughly 75%
of cases and identi ﬁed no new diagnoses.33Of the 62%
patients that had liver imaging, 26% had gallbladder
ﬁndings (sludge, gallstones) but no other signi ﬁcant liver
ﬁndings.
As such, it is our recommendation that routine testing for
Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis C not
be performed in the assessment of ICP (Hepatitis B is
routinely screened for in the ﬁrst trimester). Abdominal
imaging and further tests for underlying liver diseasesshould only be performed in select cases (see below).
While there are rare case reports of vitamin K de ﬁciency
and associated coagulopathy in ICP ,
34most of these in-
stances were associated with severe steatorrhea that led to
fat soluble vitamin malabsorption or with adverse drug
reactions to cholestyramine, which is not routinely pre-
scribed in contemporary practice. As such, routine testing
for either vitamin K de ﬁciency or coagulopathy (pro-
thrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT],
international normalized ratio [INR]) are not recom-mended, unless there is clinical evidence of these states
(i.e., easy bruising, petechiae, severe epistaxis or gingival
bleeding, hematuria, hemarthrosis).
Alternative diagnoses should be considered in the
following circumstances: onset of symptoms prior to the
late second trimester; presence of dermatologic eruption
(other than excoriations); presence of jaundice; abnormal
bilirubin or GGT; systemic symptoms, such as fever, etc.The differential diagnoses for cholestatic liver diseases are
outlined in Appendix B .

and meta-analysis identi ﬁed a pooled odds ratio (OR) of
2.58 (95% CI 2.37 e2.81) for preeclampsia in the presence
of ICP.5Preeclampsia was typically diagnosed within 2 e4
weeks after the identi ﬁcation of ICP .35,36Individuals
diagnosed with ICP also have an increased risk of gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus, with a pooled OR of 2.19 (95% CI
1.58e3.03).5
Fetal Effects
The fetal impacts of ICP include an increased chance of
stillbirth, meconium-stained amniotic ﬂuid, spontaneous
and iatrogenic preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress,
and admission to the NICU. ICP has not been shown to
be associated with reduced birthweight.30
A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2019evaluated the association between biochemical markers
and perinatal outcomes in ICP , including 56 studies in 15
countries with a total of 5269 patients with ICP versus 165
136 controls.
30Spontaneous preterm birth was found to
be higher in patients with ICP (OR 3.47 [95% CI
3.06e3.95]); as was meconium-stained amniotic ﬂuid (OR
2.60 [95% CI 1.62 e4.16]) and admission to the NICU
(OR 2.12 [95% CI 1.48 e3.03]). The risk of stillbirth for
singleton pregnancies was positively associated with the
highest recorded bile acid level. For patients with bile acids
˂40mmol/L, stillbirth occurred in 3 out of 2310 cases
(0.12%; [95% CI 0.02 e0.38]) and in 4 out of 1412 cases
for patients with bile acids 40 e99mmol/L (0.28%, [95%
CI 0.08 e0.72]) (hazard ratio 2.35 [95% CI 0.52 e10.50];
P¼0.26). Patients with ICP and bile acids /C21100mmol/L
had signi ﬁcantly increased risks of stillbirth with an OR of
30.50 (95% CI 8.83 e105.30) ( P˂0.0001. Eighteen cases
of stillbirth occurred among 524 patients representing a
3.43% risk (range 3% e44 %; [95% CI 2.05 e5.37])
compared with the baseline rate in the study of 0.32%.
Within the contemporary Canadian context, the baseline
population stillbirth rate is approximately 0.28%.38
From a pathophysiological perspective, bile acids have
been identi ﬁed to increase gut motility in an ovine model
as well as oxytocin receptor expression and contractility of
human myometrial cell cultures.8The exact mechanism of
fetal death remains unclear but is hypothesized to besecondary to a placental vasospasm or sudden fetal cardiac
event. Infusion of bile acids into isolated placental veins
identi ﬁed a dose-dependent vasoconstrictive effect, sug-
gesting the potential for acute vasospasm resulting in
sudden fetal death.
39Co-culture of laboratory rodentmyocytes with the bile acid taurocholate impacted the rate
and rhythm of cardiomyocyte contraction and abnormal
calcium dynamics.40Evaluation of pregnancies with ICP
have supported the presence of alterations to fetal cardiac
parameters, including increased fetal N-terminal pro-
hormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),41
prolongation of the mechanical PR interval,42e44arryth-
mias,45and altered left ventricular modi ﬁed myocardial
performance indices.46While these studies suggest a po-
tential for an acute fetal cardiac event resulting in fetal
death, as well as potential future tools for assessment, the
association of these altered fetal cardiac parameters with
stillbirth, longitudinal progression, and thresholds for
intervention remain unclear, and therefore their utility in
clinical practice is currently limited.
Summary Statement 4 and Recommendation 7
MANAGEMENT
The goal of treating ICP has two aims: to ameliorate
maternal symptomatology of pruritus and to improve fetal
outcomes. Therapies that may be used for pruritic relief
include topical emollients and antihistamines, such as hy-
droxyzine; these are safe in pregnancy; however, they have
not been speci ﬁcally evaluated for ef ﬁcacy in the treatment
of ICP.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most frequently used
medication for ICP . UDCA is itself a bile acid and has
proven bene ﬁt in several liver diseases in non-pregnant
people. It has a reassuring safety pro ﬁle overall, with
gastrointestinal complaints being the most common
adverse effect. UDCA alters the composition of total bile
salts, replacing 60% of harmful bile salts.47This may
explain why in some studies UDCA does not reduce total
bile acid levels compared with placebo,48causing confu-
sion as to whether it has any clinical bene ﬁt. Co-culture of
rodent cardiomyocytes with UDCA suggests a partial
protective effect49; however, evaluation of fetal cardiac
parameters show con ﬂicting results.41,43
Importantly, the PITCHES trial found that treatment with
ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg twice daily starting between
20 and 40 weeks gestation had no impact on the endpoint
of perinatal death, preterm delivery, or admission to the
NICU.48There was no reduction in total bile acid levels,
and a subgroup analysis of patients with severely elevated
bile acids >100 mmol/L showed no differences in

small (23 in the treatment group and 17 in the placebo
group). However, a large individual participant meta-
analysis found that treatment with UDCA reduced the
risk of preterm birth, with a number needed to treat of
15.50The 2020 Cochrane review on the subject could not
draw de ﬁnitive conclusions on the bene ﬁts of UDCA
regarding fetal compromise and stillbirth.51
With respect to maternal pruritis in ICP, in a meta-analysisof UDCA versus placebo or other treatments, UDCA
resulted in a modest improvement in maternal pruritus
scores on a visual analog scale (mean difference e7.64
[95% CI e9.69 to e5.60] points [two trials, n ¼715;
moderate-quality evidence]).
51
Given the bene ﬁcial effects of UDCA on pruritis and its
potential bene ﬁt in reducing preterm birth, alongside the
benign side effect pro ﬁle, we recommend treatment of
severe cases of ICP (non-fasting bile acids /C21100mmol/L)
with UDCA, unless delivery is indicated. The recom-
mended dose is 10 e15 mg/kg/d orally in 2 e3 divided
daily doses, with a typical starting dose of 500 mg every 12
hours (twice daily). If pruritus is not relieved to a tolerable
level within 2 weeks, the dose may be titrated every 1 e2
weeks as required, to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/d.52
We suggest that the use of UDCA be considered forsymptom relief in non-severe cases (non-fasting bile acids
<100
mmol/L), using a shared decision-making approach
with the pregnant individual.
Refractory cases of ICP may bene ﬁt from a referral to a
specialist hepatologist, obstetric internist, or
maternal efetal medicine specialist for evaluation of
possible underlying medical/genetic predisposition to ICP .
If no other disorder is found, consideration may be given
to the addition of rifampicin (dose range 300 e1200 mg/
d), a semi-synthetic antibiotic that has the ability to lowerbile acid levels.
53In a case series of 28 patients, the
addition of rifampicin to UDCA led to a reduction in bile
acid levels.54Initiation should be discussed with a specialist
in liver disorders in pregnancy. Maternal vitamin K sup-
plementation (10 mg oral daily) is only indicated in in-
dividuals with demonstrated vitamin K de ﬁciency and/or
coagulopathy with abnormal PT (see Diagnosis section
above regarding indications for testing).
Ineffective previously studied treatments for ICP include
dexamethasone, cholestyramine, phenobarbital, S-adeno-sylmethionine, activated charcoal, and epomediol.
51,54e56Summary Statement 5 & Recommendations 8 and
9
Follow-Up Laboratory Testing and Monitoring
Once the diagnosis is established, monitoring of bile acid
levels should be performed to gauge the magnitude of
fetal risk. Frequency of monitoring should be based on
severity of pruritic symptoms and weeks of gestation.
For early or mild disease, laboratory monitoring may be
performed every 2 e4 weeks, whereas for more severe or
late disease, every 1 e2 weeks for the remainder of the
pregnancy.
Both clinicians and health care authorities should advocate
for timely and equitable access to bile acid testing and
results, regardless of location or centre of care.
Fetal Monitoring
Fetal monitoring with either electronic fetal heart rate
monitoring (cardiotocography) or ultrasound have not
been shown to accurately identify fetuses at increased risk
of stillbirth or adverse outcomes.57e59However, since
recent data permit the strati ﬁcation of risk for pregnant
patients with ICP, it may be reasonable, but not mandated,
for units to develop fetal monitoring protocols based on
local preferences. All pregnant individuals should beadvised to monitor fetal movements as the mainstay of
fetal wellbeing surveillance, and to seek timely care if
indicated.
Despite a lack of evidence of bene ﬁt and absence of a
rationale for antenatal testing, some units with adequate
resources may elect to offer the following approach in
moderate to severe ICP:
/C15In patients with bile acid levels 40 e99
mmol/L: ob-
stetric ultrasound for biophysical pro ﬁle or electronic
fetal heart rate monitoring every 1 e2 weeks.
/C15In patients with bile acid levels /C21100mmol/L: obstetric
ultrasound for biophysical pro ﬁle or electronic fetal
heart rate monitoring weekly or twice weekly. Inpatient
management with daily electronic fetal monitoring maybe utilized by some units. The decision whether to
consider outpatient versus inpatient monitoring should
be based on speci ﬁc patient risk factors and the pref-
erence of the caregiver and the patient. Currently, there
is no speci ﬁc evidence demonstrating bene ﬁts of inpa-
tient care and monitoring.

increased in the case of ICP.30It is unlikely that per-
forming a growth ultrasound will change the management
of the pregnancy, since the likelihood of placental insuf-
ﬁciency is not increased in cases of isolated ICP . However,
in centres that do not routinely perform a third-trimester
ultrasound, this scan may be offered to rule out FGR,
and to ensure that there are no additional risk factors
present.
Summary Statement 6 & Recommendations 10
and 11
Delivery Timing
Previous international guidelines have recommended
active management for patients with ICP by elective de-
livery around 36 e38 weeks gestation, independent of bile
acid levels, to decrease the risk of adverse outcomes,including stillbirth. This has led contemporary obstetric
groups to question which speci ﬁc pregnancies affected by
ICP are at signi ﬁcant risk of adverse outcomes, consid-
ering the risks of medically indicated premature birth.
The decision of delivery timing should be based on the
highest recorded non-fasting bile acid level obtained in the
current pregnancy ( Appendix C ). Since the risk of stillbirth
is equivalent to the baseline risk in pregnant patients with
bile acids ˂40
mmol/L, delivery is recommended by 40
weeks gestation. In patients with bile acid levels between40e99
mmol/L, the risk of stillbirth is equivalent to
population data; this risk may increase from 38 weeks
gestation onwards, however, the number of patients
studied is limited after that gestational age. Thus, we
propose delivery at 380e386weeks if bile acids are 40 e69
mmol/L and 360e376weeks if bile acids are 70 e99mmol/
L. If the bile acids are /C21100mmol/L, the risk of stillbirth is
increased, and delivery should be considered by 36 weeks
gestation or earlier in patients with comorbidities or otherrisks factors (i.e., multiple gestation pregnancy, pre-
eclampsia, gestational diabetes, previous stillbirth second-
ary to ICP , and/or severe persistent maternal pruritus).
Individual decision-making based on identi ﬁed risk factors
or comorbidities should be prioritized when determining
birth timing.
Antenatal corticosteroids should be administered based on
gestational age ebased recommendations if the risk of
delivery within the next 7 days is high.
60The mode of
delivery for patients with ICP should be based onobstetrical and medical indications, since ICP does notincrease the risk of assisted vaginal birth or cesarean
delivery.
61
Acknowledging the lack of evidence, we recommend pa-
tients with ICP be offered continuous electronic fetal heart
rate monitoring in labour, owing to the increase incidence
of adverse outcomes, and repeat bile acid levels are usually
not performed intrapartum. There are currently no
evidence-based recommendations for analgesic or anaes-thetic options in labour, nor for alternative management of
the third stage.
Recommendations 12, 13
POSTPARTUM OUTCOMES, CONTRACEPTION
CONSIDERATIONS, AND RECURRENCE RISK
Symptoms as well as ICP-associated biochemical abnor-
malities are expected to resolve within 1 e2 weeks post-
partum, although they may persist up to 4 weeks in some
individuals.8,62,63It is important to con ﬁrm resolution of
symptoms at a follow-up visit around 6 weeks postpartum
and repeat bile acid and liver transaminase testing for those
whose symptoms persist. In the few who continue to havesymptoms, biochemical abnormalities, or any atypical fea-
tures, further investigation for an alternate etiology is indi-
cated.
8Further, collaborative consultation with specialists in
obstetric medicine, hepatology, or internal medicine should
be considered. It should be noted that normalization of liver
transaminases and bile acids postpartum does not rule out
the presence of an underlying liver disease.63
The postpartum encounter also provides an opportunity
to discuss the risk of ICP in family members, particularly
female siblings. If ICP has developed before 32 weeksgestation, there is 20% chance that the patient has a
pathologic genetic variant in the ABCB11 /ABCB4
genes.
8,20In these individuals, consultation with a specialist
in clinical genetics, internal medicine, or maternal efetal
medicine is recommended for consideration of genetic
testing. Finally, individuals with ICP are at an increased risk
of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatic disease, and,
interestingly, goiter and hypothyroidism.64The increased
likelihood of hepatobiliary disease may, in part, be sec-ondary to shared genetic risk factors as described
previously.

Infants born to parents with ICP have normal bio-
psychosocial development but may have an increased risk
of acquiring metabolic disease during adulthood, including

years.65,66
Overall, the recurrence risk of ICP in future pregnancies is
around 70%,67and up to 90%, if genetic predispositions
are present.68The risk may be lower if the index pregnancy
was multifetal,8and recurrence may vary in relation to
gravidity and timing compared with the index preg-
nancy.69e71Individuals should be counselled regarding this
relatively high risk of recurrence at the postpartum visit, if
not already discussed antenatally.
The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of
postpartum combined estrogen-progestin contraception
for those with ICP as acceptable ( Appendix D ).72How-
ever, these individuals should also be advised that they are
at risk of non-pregnant cholestasis with use of combined
hormonal contraception, and that this risk can be reducedusing lower dose estrogen formulations.
73Therefore,
combined hormonal contraceptives should be dis-
continued if symptoms of cholestasis develop. The risk of
non-pregnant cholestasis is low with the use of progestin-
only contraception.74

CONCLUSION
ICP is a multifactorial and common hepatic disease unique
to pregnancy. As such, all pregnancy care providers should
be familiar with the condition, its investigation and diag-
nosis, and contemporary evidence for best practice in
treatment and management. This guideline aims to syn-
thesize the most current evidence base into a pragmatic
and clinically relevant tool that can guide standardized care
to achieve the best possible perinatal outcomes.

Table A1. Key to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Quality of Evidence
Grade Deﬁnition
Strength of recommendation
Strong High level of con ﬁdence that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects (strong recommendation
for) or the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects (strong recommendation against)
Conditional (weak)aDesirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (weak recommendation for) or the undesirable
effects probably outweigh the desirable effects (weak recommendation against)
Quality of evidence
High High level of con ﬁdence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate Moderate con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantiallydifferent
Low Limited con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low Very little con ﬁdence in the effect estimate:
The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
Adapted from GRADE Handbook (2013), Table 5.1.
aDo not interpret conditional (weak) recommendations to mean weak evidence or uncertainty of the recommendation.

/C15“We suggest to not .”
Authors The net desirable effects of a course of action outweigh
the effects of the alternative course of action.It is less clear whether the net desirable consequences of a
strategy outweigh the alternative strategy.
Patients Most individuals in the situation would want the
recommended course of action, while only a small
proportion would not.The majority of individuals in the situation would want the
suggested course of action, but many would not.
Clinicians Most individuals should receive the course of action.
Adherence to this recommendation according to the
guideline could be used as a quality criterion orperformance indicator.Recognize that patient choices will vary by individual and that
clinicians must help patients arrive at a care decision
consistent with the patient ’s values and preferences.
Policy makers The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most
settings.The recommendation can serve as a starting point for debate
with the involvement of many stakeholders.
