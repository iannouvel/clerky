 Key Principles 
 
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective, standards to determine a course of action. 
Professional judgement may be used in the application of a protocol. 
 
Scope 
 
This guideline applies to all women, mothers, and babies receiving care from the Brighton & 
Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Directorate of Women and Children’s Health. Whilst 
this guidance uses the words women, mother and breastfeeding we also acknowledge that 
not all pregnant or birthing people identify as women or mothers and some choose to use 
the words chest and chest feeding. All staff should be respectful of with the use of chosen 
pronouns and language choices. 
 
Responsibilities 
 
Midwives, Nursery Nurses, Maternity Support Workers, Maternity Care Assistants, 
Paediatricians. 
• To access, read, understand and follow this protocol. 
• To clearly document any practice which deviates from the protocol and give 
rationale for doing so. This would only occur in exceptional circumstances. 
 
Management: 
• To ensure that the protocol is reviewed annually in line with Baby Friendly Initiative 
requirements. 
• To ensure that the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff. 
• To ensure that the protocol is available to service users on request .

 1 Policy Statement and Rationale 
 
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that all staff at Brighton and Sussex University 
Hospitals Trust understands their role and responsibilities in supporting expectant and new 
mothers and their partners to feed and care for their baby in ways which support optimum 
health and well -being. 
 
All staff are expected to comply with this policy. This Policy is based on the UNICEF Baby 
Friendly Initiative standards which are recognised as the standard for best practice in 
promoting, supporting and sustaining breastfeeding and early infant relationships. 
The Policy is also supported by NICE guidance (April 2021) and sets out the Trust’s process 
for supporting mothers who are both breast and formula feeding. This policy relates to 
Maternity, Neonatal and Paediatric Services. 
 
2 Aims and Objectives 
 
Breastfeeding is an important health issue and its positive impact on the short and long 
term health of mothers and newborns is well documented. 
 
The aim of this breastfeeding protocol is to show the University Hospitals Sussex ( Brighton 
and Sussex University Hospitals ) commitment, to promoting, protecting, and supporting 
breastfeeding, by providing the highest standard of care, to support expectant and new 
mothers and their partners to feed their baby and build strong and loving parent -infant 
relationships. This is in recognition of the profound importance of early relationships to 
future health and well -being, and the significant contribution that breastfeeding makes to 
good physical and emotional health outcomes for children and mothers. This policy aims to 
ensure that the health benefits of breastfeeding and the potential health risks of formula 
feeding are discussed with all women so that they can make an informed choice about how 
they will feed their baby. 
 
3 Outcomes 
 
This policy aims to ensure that the care provided improves outcomes for children and 
families, specifically to deliver: 
• An increase in breastfeeding initiation rates in Maternity and Neonatal Services 
• An increase in the number of babies on the Neonatal Unit receiving breastmilk. 
• An increase in breastfeeding rates at discharge and at 10 days 
• Amongst mothers who choose to artificially feed, an increase in those doing so as 
safely as possible, in line with nationally agreed guidance. 
• Improvements in parents’ experience of care 
• A reduction in the number of re -admissions for feeding problems

 4 The purpose of the breastfeeding protocol 
 
The purpose of this protocol is to promote breastfeeding and safe feeding practices by: 
 
4.1 Ensuring that all staff understands their role and responsibilities in supporting 
expectant and new mothers and their partners to feed and care for their 
baby in ways which support optimum health and wellbeing; by providing a 
clear and concise framework within which staff must practice, with regards to 
newborn feeding. Any deviation from the protocol must be documented and 
justified. This would only occur in exceptional circumstances. 
4.2 Familiarising new staff with the protocol within one week of appointment. 
4.3 Performing a bi -annual review of this protocol, for updating and maintaining 
relevance. 
4.4 Showing the trust commitment to promoting and protecting breastfeeding by 
making both the staff protocol readily available and client guidelines to the 
protocol visible in all relevant areas including areas that serve mothers and 
babies. 
4.5 Creating an environment where women are more likely to initiate 
breastfeeding and to receive appropriate information, which is in line with 
government guidelines for exclusive breastfeeding for six months and as part 
of a mixed diet, through to two years and beyond, if this is what they wish. 
4.6 Providing a programme of education for all staff appropriate to their 
position. New employees will receive an induction day within six months of 
starting employment. All staff must attend all breastfeeding training and 
complete the workbook and meet with a BFI Key trainer within six weeks of 
attending the BFI induction day. 
4.7 A curriculum for all training will be available and should be audited with 
regards to uptake, and training standards. 
4.8 Forbidding the promotion of artificial milks, bottles, teats and dummies in 
line with the WHO Code for the Marketing of Artificial Milk and other breast 
milk substitutes. 
4.9 Ensuring that literature provided by the Trust is not sourced from artificial 
milk companies or containing of any adverts or promotional products 
pertaining to newborn feeding. 
 
5 Definitions 
 
The infant feeding policy covers breastfeeding and formula feeding. Breastfeeding can be 
defined as giving human breastmilk to infants to meet their nutritional needs. The nutrients 
in breastmilk are unique and provide optimal health and immunological benefits for both Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
8 
 mother and child. Infant formula is a food manufactured, usually from modified cow’s milk, 
to support growth of infants under 6 months of age. It is an artificial substitute for feeding 
infants and does not provide the same health outcomes as breastmilk. 
 
6 Care standards 
 
This is the care the Trust is committed to giving each and every expectant mother and new 
family. It is based on the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards for both 
Maternity and Neonatal Servic es and relevant NICE guidance. 
6.1 Pregnancy 
 All women will be given the opportunity to discuss feeding and 
caring for their baby with a midwife in the pregnancy, on a one to 
one basis or with their partner. How and when this happens may 
vary from mother to mother. It may be appropriate to begin this 
conversation quite early on in the pregnancy and thread it 
through the rest of the care, incorporating different topics as the 
mother approaches the end of her pregnancy. It is recommended 
that the following topics have been covered by 34 weeks: 
• The value of connecting with their growing baby in utero. 
• The value of skin to skin for all mothers and babies. 
• The importance of responding to their baby’s need for 
comfort, closeness and feeding after birth, and the role 
that keeping their baby close has in supporting this. 
• Feeding, including: 
• Finding out what the mothers thoughts and feelings are, 
with regards feeding and caring for her baby. 
➢ An exploration of what parents already know about 
breastfeeding. 
➢ The value of breastfeeding as protection, comfort 
and food. 
➢ Getting breastfeeding off to a good start. 
 
6.2 Information given sh ould be supported with the o ff to a Good Start leaflet and 
Building A Happy Baby leaflet, directions to the BSUHT maternity website: 
https://www.bsuh.nhs.uk/maternity/ 
6.3 When women have a medical condition which may affect the physiology of 
lactation, an appropriate plan should be made with the mother and midwife 
(or Infant Feeding Midwife) to assist the initiation and maintenance of 
lactation. Antenatal women will not be shown how to make up a bottle of 
manufactured milk. 
6.4 Birth 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
9 
 6.5 All women will be offered uninterrupted Skin to Skin contact with their baby in 
an unhurried environment. This should last at least an hour or until after the 
first feed, or until mother wants to end skin to skin (early cessation should not 
be prompted by the midwife).The midwife providing care should document in 
the maternal notes the occurrence and length of time of skin to skin contact. 
6.6 All women must be given the opportunity to feed their baby whilst on labour 
ward (or at home) following delivery while the baby is skin to skin and showing 
signs of readiness to feed. Assistance should be offered by the midwife 
providing care, or a support worker. 
6.7 When women choose to formula feed they will be encouraged to offer the first 
bottle feed in skin contact. Subsequent formula (bottle) feeds should also be 
encouraged in skin contact. 
6.8 Transfer to the post natal area should not interfere with skin to skin. Women 
should be encouraged to continue putting the baby skin to skin over the next 
few days by the health professional or support worker providing care. 
Allowa nces should be made for the post natal area being cooler, and the baby 
suitably covered whilst in skin to skin. 
6.9 When it has been necessary to separate mother and baby due to clinical need 
then skin to skin should be achieved as soon as possible. Partners can also give 
their baby skin to skin . 
 
7 Skin to skin safety considerations 
 
Vigilance of the baby’s well -being is a fundamental part of postnatal care immediately 
following and in the first few hours after birth. For this reason, normal observations of the 
baby’s temperature, breathing, colour and tone should continue throughout the period of 
skin-to-skin contact in the same way as would occur if the baby were in a cot (this includes 
calculation of the Apgar score at 1, 5 and 10 minutes following birth). Care should always be 
taken to ensure that the baby is kept warm. Observations should also be made of the 
mother, with prompt removal of the baby if the health of either gives rise to concern. 
 
▪ Staff should have a conversation with the mother and her companion about the importance 
of recognising changes in the baby’s colour or tone and the need to alert staff immediately if 
they are concerned. 
▪ 
It is important to ensure that the baby cannot fall onto the floor or become trapped in 
bedding or by the mother’s body. Mothers should be encouraged to be in a semi -recumbent 
position to hold and feed their baby. Particular care should be taken with the position of the 
baby, ensuring the head is supported so the infant’s air way does not become obstructed. 
Notes – Mothers 
Observations of the mother’s vital signs and level of consciousness should be continued 
throughout the period of skin to skin contact. Mothers may be very tired following birth, 
and so may need constant support and supervision to observe changes in their baby’s 
condition or to reposition their baby when needed. Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
10 
 Many mothers can continue to hold their baby in skin to skin during perineal suturing, 
providing they have adequate pain relief. However a mother who is in pain may not be able 
to hold her baby safely. Babies should not be in skin to skin contact with their mothers when 
they are receiving Entonnox or other analgesics that impact consciousness. 
Notes – Babies 
 
All babies should be routinely monitored whilst in skin -to-skin c ontact with mother or 
partner. 
Observation to include: 
• Checking that the baby’s position is such that a clear airway is maintained: Observe 
respiratory rate and chest movement and listen for unusual breathing sounds or 
absence of noise from the baby. 
• Colour: The baby should be assessed by looking at the whole of the baby’s body, as 
the limbs can often be discoloured first. Subtle changes to colour indicate changes in 
the baby’s condition. 
• Tone: The baby should have a good tone and not be limp or unresponsive. 
• Temperature: Ensure the baby is kept warm during skin contact. 
 
Always listen to parents and respond immediately to any concerns raised 
 
8 Support for breastfeeding 
 
8.1 Mothers who are enabled to achieve effective breastfeeding according to their 
needs (including appropriate support with positioning and attachment, hand 
expression and the signs of effective feeding). This will continue until the 
mothers are feeding confidently. If a baby does not feed spontaneously in the 
first four hours of life, or does not spontaneously feed again within 6 hours of 
life, the “care of the baby who is reluctant to feed” flowchart (Appendix 4) will 
be instigated. 
 
Mothers will have the opportunity to discuss breastfeeding in the first few 
hours after birth as appropriate to their own needs and those of their baby. 
The discussion will include information on responsive feeding and feeding 
cues. Mothers and babies will not be routinely separated on the wards. 
 
A formal feeding assessment will be carried out using the breastfeeding 
assessment tool in Badgernet and as often as required, with a mi nimum of 2 
assessments in the first week , and always to include; 
• prior to discharge from hospital (or leaving house if homebirth) 
• first postnatal visit by community midwife 
• day 5 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
11 
 The rationale for doing this is to adequately assess breastfeeding in a 
standardised manner, to ensure effective feeding and the wellbeing of 
mother and baby. 
 
Before discharge home, breastfeeding mothers will be given information 
both verbally and on the Badgernet app about recognising effective feeding 
and where to call for additional help if they have any concerns. All mothers 
will be made aware of the importance of wet and dirty nappies in the baby, 
with an emphasis on changing stool from birth to day 5. Mothers will be 
advised to contact the community midwives if there is an absence of dirty 
nappies. Mothers should be directed to the ‘Off to the Best Start’ leaflet or 
The Mothers and Others Guide, demo nstrating stool colour change. 
 
All breastfeeding mothers will be informed about how to contact our 24hour support 
service, local support service for breastfeeding and directed to the postnatal booklet to 
access the updated breastfeeding drop in infor mation and national helplines. 
 
9 Responsive feeding 
 
The term responsive feeding is used to describe a feeding relationship which is sensitive, 
reciprocal, and about more than nutrition. Staff should ensure that mothers have the 
opportunity to discuss this aspect of feeding and should reassure mothers that: 
breastfeeding can be used to feed, comfort and calm babies; breastfeeds can be long or 
short; breastfed babies cannot be overfed or ‘spoiled’ by too much feeding, and 
breastfeeding will not, in and of itself, tire mothers any more than caring for a new baby 
without breastfeeding. Most babies will feed between 8 -12 times in 24 hou rs. UNICEF UK’s 
responsive feeding info -sheet: unicef.uk/bf -responsive 
 
10 Exclusive b reastfeeding 
 
10.1 Mothers who breastfeed will be provided with information about why 
exclusive breastfeeding leads to the best outcomes for their baby and why it is 
particularly important during the establishment of breastfeeding. 
10.2 When exclusive breastfeeding is not possible, the value of continuing partial 
breastfeeding will be emphasised and mothers will be supported to maximise 
the amount of breastmilk their baby receives. 
10.3 Mothers who give other feeds in conjunction with breastfeeding will be 
enabled to do so as safely as possible and with the least possible disruption to 
breastfeeding . This will include appropriate information and a discussion 
regarding the potential impact of introducing a teat when a baby is learning to 
breastfeed. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
12 
 10.4 A full record will be made of all supplements given, including the rationale for 
supplementation and the discussion held with parents and should be 
completed on Badgernet . 
10.5 Supplementation rates will be audited. 
Modified feeding regimes 
 
10.6 There are a number of clinical indications for short term modified feeding 
regime in the early days after birth. Examples include: preterm or small for 
gestational age babies and those who are excessively sleepy after birth. 
Frequent feeding, including a minimum number of feeds in 24hours, should be 
offered to ensure safety. 
10.7 And hypoglycaemia protocol needs to be implemented as per: 
https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/wp -
content/uploads/sites/2/2010/10/hypo_policy.pdf 
 
10.8 Babies that may require modified feeding regimes are identified as: 
• Intrauterine growth r estriction, or small for gestational age 
• Infants of diabetic mothers 
• Maternal beta blocker use 
• Gestation <37 weeks at birth 
• Moderate to severe birth asphyxia 
• Hypothermia 
 
11 Hand e xpressing 
 
Hand expressing is a skill all women should be taught and can be invaluable in the early days 
of breastfeeding. 
Women should be encouraged to read the trust guide to hand expressing and be offered 
colostrum sy ringes at 36 weeks antenatally. 
All women should be taught the skill of hand expressing , along with breast massage within 6 
hours of birth. It is also an ideal method of expressing milk in the first few days. 
Colostrum is low in volum e and may get lost in the pump. 
Helping a mother to maintain her milk supply whilst providing colostrum for her baby can 
help build her confidence and help avoid unnecessary infant formula. Breastmilk flow is 
reliant on oxytocin, which can be inhibited by anxiety or embarrassment. If a mother has 
attempted unsuccessfully to hand express, ask a colleague to go through the technique 
again. 
Ensure leaflets from Trust website my Pregnancy Matters and knitted breasts are taken to 
the bedside to assist demonstration. 
When the baby is not breastfeeding because of illness, prematurity, or some specific 
breastfeeding problem, the initiation, establishment and maintenance, of lactat ion is 
dependent on expressing. Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
13 
 Women should be supported to express 8 -10 times in 24hours including once at night in 
order to initiate and maintain lactation. 
 
12 Using an electric breast p ump 
 
Breast massage followed by hand expressing 8 -10 x in 24hrs should always be used in the 
first few days, as this is the best way to collect colostrum. However women who deliver 
extremely low birth weight babies or babies <34 weeks can combine hand expressing with 
early pump use, using the initiate/stimulation setting within 2 hours of birth. Research has 
demonstrated increased milk production when combining these methods . (Lussier 2015) 
 
• On the second day, all women who are experiencing breastfeeding 
difficulties will be shown how to use an electric double pump , alongside 
continued hand expressing on the post natal ward. 
• Women will be informed that at least 8-10 expressions in 24 hours are 
required, including at least one night expression. 
• While establishing lactation women are encouraged to express for 15 
minutes. Milk flow may cease before this. 
• Once full lactation is established women should be encouraged to express 
for at least 15 minutes but not more than 30 minutes. 
• Women will be informed how to obtain suitable equipment. A hospital 
grade pump may be beneficial when expressing, in the longer term. 
 
13 Supplementation 
13.1 Breast fed babies should not be offered anything other than breast milk. 
13.2 Artificial supplements should only be given where medically indicated with 
informed consent from the mother. The reason s hould be clearly documented 
in Badgernet by the midwife, ANNP or neonatologist providing care. When 
medically indicated artificial supplementation has been introduced, a plan to 
support breastfeeding/lactation and reduce artificial supplementation, should 
be put in place. 
13.3 Any other supplementation which is not medically indicated must only be 
given if the mother has made a fully informed choice and alternative 
management strategies offered. All discussions with and decisions made by the 
mother should be clearly documented by the health professional providing 
care. Should the baby be given any supplement which is not medically 
indicated, as a result of informed choice by the mother, it is preferable to 
avoid a teat. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
14 
 13.4 Where supplementation is medically indicated it is preferable to avoid artificial 
teats in a breast fed baby. A syringe, feeding cup, spoon or finger feeding can 
be used instead. Some babies receiving transitional or special care may be 
given supplementation by nasogastric tube. 
13.5 Breastfeeding women will not routinely be shown how to make up artificial 
milk. 
 
14 Syringe feeding ( Appendix A – Patient Information leaflet) 
 
For babies who aren’t yet feeding at the breast , syringe feeding is used to give a baby small 
amounts (<2mls) of colostrum that wou ld otherwise get lost in a cup. 
To syringe feed safely, health professionals should teach this skill and support parents until 
they are confident to syri nge feed their baby themselves. 
The baby should be held in the mother’s arms, slightly upright and a 1ml oral syringe placed 
gently in between the gum and the cheek. A little colostrum is gently dripped into the cheek 
cavity (no more than 0.2ml at a time), allow the baby to suck and swallow before 
continuing. 
Move onto cup feeding once you have more than 2 -5mls of colostrum. Babies should not be 
discharged home syringe feeding. 
 
15 Cup feedin g (Appendix A – Patient information leaflet) 
 
Cup feeding may be an interim measure whilst supporting a baby to transition to the breast 
or providing breastfed babies wit h additional supplementation. 
Cup feeding encourages the baby to practice tongue movements, enhances digestion by 
stimulating saliva and allows the baby to control the rate of milk given. It can be used when 
volumes are greater than 5ml. 
It does not risk causing nipple confusion or babies imprinting onto a teat. Healthcare 
professionals should teach this skill and support parents until parents are confident to cup 
feed their baby themselves. 
Volumes should be offered around 5 -10mls each cup which can be refilled until the required 
volume has been taken and the overall volume documented. Cup feeding is a short term 
method of feeding and it is not routine policy to dis charge a baby home cup feeding. 
Babies have a need to suck and generally a teat may be offered around day five, as volumes 
have increased and the baby will have a chance to suck. 
 
15.1 Contraindicated in: 
• Infants with poor gag reflex, increases the risk of aspiration 
• Babies who are lethargic and/or have very poor sucking reflex 
• Babies who have marked neurological deficits 
 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
15 
 16 Safe Cup Feeding 
• The baby should be awake and alert. Never cup feed a sleepy lethargic 
baby. 
• Explain cup feeding to parents and gain consent 
• Wash hands and gather feeding cup and EBM 
• Wrap baby securely to prevent milk spillage 
• Support the baby in a semi -upright position on your lap, to avoid the RISK OF 
ASPIRATION 
• Place the brim of the cup at the corners of the baby’s mouth, with it gently resting 
on the lower lip. 
• DO NOT FORCE THE CUP INTO THE BABY’S MOUTH 
• Tip the cup so that the milk is just touching the baby’s lips 
• DO NOT POUR MILK INTO THE BABY’S MOUTH 
• Expect the baby to sip or lap the milk 
• Keep the cup in contact with the baby’s mouth, allowing the baby to feed and 
pause as it wants. This takes time 
• Allow the baby to feed at its own pace 
If the parents wish to offer cup feeds, risk of aspiration with unsafe positioning or pouring 
the milk should be discussed . 
 
16.1 Parents wishing to cup feed at this time should be assessed as having 
understood safety issues and demonstrated a safe cup feed themselves. 
 
• Discuss potential wastage of milk due to dribbling 
• Ensure mothers receive on -going breastfeeding support, to ensure cup 
feeds are used only as short -term support of and not a replacement to 
breastfeeding. 
• A management plan should be documented for any baby receiving milk by 
either cup or syringe. 
• Consider teaching paced bottle feeding to mothers, who se babies haven't 
yet managed to feed exclusively at the breast. 
• Paced bottle feeding is considered to help protect babies from developing a 
flow preference and imprinting on the teat. 
17 Use of Dummies and Nipple Shields 
17.1 Breastfeeding reduces the risk of cot death. The Lullaby Trust says that settling 
the baby to sleep with a dummy, even for naps, can reduce the risk of cot 
death. If breastfeeding do not begin to give a dummy until the baby is at least 
one month old or until breastfeeding is well established. 
17.2 Dummy use has been negatively associated with both the exclusivity and 
duration of breastfeeding. 
17.3 All breastfeeding women should be discouraged from using teats and dummies 
during the establishment of breastfeeding. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
16 
 17.4 Health professionals providing care in the postnatal period should discuss with 
all women their own particular circumstances with regards to the 
establishment of breastfeeding and lactation, and the appropriate use of 
dummies, so as to ensure benefit from the positive aspects of dummy use 
without putting the breastfeeding relationship at risk. In this way parents can 
make an informed choice about the use of dummies. All discussions and 
decisions should be documented in the baby’s notes by the health professional 
or support worker providing care. 
17.5 Nipple shields should be avoided as they may cause problems. They should 
never be used in the first few days as full lactation is not yet established and 
breast drainage will not be sufficient for the newborns need, with inadequate 
stimulation of lactation. They must only be used under the guidance of a 
trained midwife with referral to a member of staff in a breastfeeding support 
post. Mothers should be made aware of the disadvantages and use 
discontinued as soon as possible. The emphasis should be on the 
establishment of lactation and ensuring adequate intake of milk in the baby. 
Use of nipple shields during the establishment of lactation is not 
recommended. 
 
18 Formula Feeding 
 
Mothers who formula feed will be enabled to do so as safely as possible through offers of 
discussion about how to prepare infant formula, at home and also when out and about, using 
the NHS guide to bottle feeding . We do not recommend prep machines as they have safety 
concerns. Direct to First Steps Nutrition Website: 
https://www.firststepsnutrition.org/infant -milks -overview 
18.1 Mothers who formula feed will have a discussion about the importance of 
responsive feeding and be encouraged to: 
• Respond to cues that their baby is hungry 
• Invite their baby to draw the teat rather than forcing the teat into their 
baby’s mouth 
• Pace the feed so that the baby is not forced to feed more than they 
want to 
• Recognise their baby’s feeding cues that they have had enough milk and 
avoid forcing their baby to take more milk than the baby wants. 
• Mothers should be advised that only First milks are advised for the first 
year of life. 
18.2 Early postnatal period: support for parenting and close relationships : 
• Skin to skin contact will be encouraged throughout the postnatal period 
• All parents will be supported to understand a newborn baby’s needs 
(including encouraging frequent touch and sensitive verbal/visual 
communication, keeping babies close, responsive feeding and safe 
sleeping practice). Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
17 
 • Mothers who bottle feed will be encouraged to hold their baby close 
during feeds and offer the majority of feeds to their baby themselves to 
help enhanc e the mother -baby relationship. 
• Parents will be given information about local parenting support that is 
available. 
19 Recommendations for discussing bed -sharing with parents

Simplistic messages in relation to where a baby sleeps should be av oided; neither blanket 
prohibitions nor blanket permissions reflect the current research evidence. 
 
The current body of evidence overwhelmingly supports the following key messages, which 
shou ld be conveyed to all parents: 
• The safest place for your baby to sleep is in a cot by your bed for the first 6 months 
of life. 
• They need a clear sleep space, no pillows, quilts or duvets, bumpers, pod nests or 
sleep positioners 
• Ensure baby’s head is uncovered so they don’t overheat 
• If baby sleeps in sling ensure parents aware of TICKS guidance for safe use 
• https://www.rospa.com/home -safety/advice/product/baby -slings 
• Sleeping with your bay on a sofa puts your baby at greatest risk. It should never be done. 
 
Your baby should not share a bed with anyone who is a smoker, has consumed alcohol, or 
who has taken drugs (legal or illegal) that make them sleepy. 
 
The incidence of SIDS (often called ‘cot death’ ) is higher in the following groups: 
• Parents in low socio -economic groups 
• Parents who currently abuse alcohol or drugs 
• Young mothers with more than one child 
• Premature infants and those with low birthweight 
Parents within these groups will need more face to face discussion to ensure that these key 
message s are explored and understood. 
 
20 Guidance for the Management of t he Reluctant Feeder 
(Appendix B flow chart) 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
18 
 20.1 To promote best practice in the care of newborn, healthy, term babies greater 
than 2.5kg, between 3rd and 90th centile. 
20.2 If babies have any risk factors for hypoglycaemia they should be managed as 
per the Trust hypoglycaemia pathway. 
20.3 Rationale 
 Babies need to feed at frequent intervals and healthy, term 
babies will wake and feed. The term “reluctant feeder” is applied 
to newborn babies who are too sleepy to attach and suck at the 
breast or who do not wake for feeds very often. 
 It is quite normal for term babies to feed infrequently in the first 
24 hours. If a baby has not fed within the first four hours or is not 
effectively feeding within six hours, then it should be considered 
to be a reluctant feeder. This guidance is not for babies with an 
infrequent feeding pattern in the first 24 -48 hours but those who 
are not waking for feeds at all. 
 Reluctant feeding is common behaviour for many healthy term 
babies in the first 24 hours of life and mothers will require 
reassurance if they are anxious. Early, prolonged skin to skin 
contact can minimise reluctance to breastfeed. 
 Normal healthy term newborns are at low risk of hypoglycaemia 
because of their physiological ability to adapt to a low enteral 
food supply in the first 24 -48 hours. These babies are able to 
mobilise alternate fuel sources to protect normal brain function. 
It is essential to differentiate the healthy term neonate from the 
baby who is at risk of hypoglycaemia. Lack of interest in feeding 
can be the first sign of an unrecognised disorder or illness. For this 
reason it is important to monitor these babies closely and 
perform frequent Observations of vital signs to exclude 
underlying illness and signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
These include: 
• Jitteriness – repetitive, unprovoked movements of one or more 
limbs* 
• Lethargy and/or hypertonia 
• Feeding difficulties (poor suck/refusal to feed) 
• Irritability and/or tremor 
• Apnoea and cyanotic episodes 
• High pitched cry 
• Difficulty maintaining body temperature/hypothermia 
• Coma and/or seizures 
 
*jitteriness refers to a high frequency, generalised, symmetrical tremor of the limbs which 
are unprovoked and usually relatively fast. It is important to be sure that this movement is 
not simply a response to stimuli. Unlike seizures, jitteriness can usually be Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
19 
 stopped/controlled by holding the limb firmly e.g. Baby’s arm held close to baby’s chest. 
Excessive or persistent jitteriness requires investigation. 
 It is necessary to stimulate a good milk supply by early and 
frequent breastfeeding or expressing. This guideline aims to 
support all health professionals in providing consistent advice and 
in planning care and support mothers to become empowered to 
help promote and manage their babies feeding. 
 Babies may be slow to feed for a number of reasons; these 
include sedation, illness, birth trauma and missed opportunity for 
skin to skin contact . Babies who have had an instrumental birth, 
long augmented or difficult labour can deplete their glycogen 
stores. Babies that become cold also deplete their glycogen stores 
and being too cold can depress feeding behaviour. 
Thermoregulation should be monitored as per Trust Guideline 
‘Care of the N ewborn Immediately after Birth’ MP069. 
20.4 What if the mother does not want to express and give colostrum? 
 The length of labour and type of birth may influence the mother’s 
feelings about expressing. She may ask you to give formula instead. 
Obviously give consideration to cultural/personal choices. However 
remember that if her baby has not breastfed, she needs to express to 
initiate good milk supply. This is because prolactin receptors should 
be activated within 4 -6 hours of the birth to enhance , long term milk 
production. Feeding or expressing soon after birth and frequently 
thereafter is associated with long term success in breastfeeding . 
 If a mother chooses not to express colostrum by hand or pump, and 
requests her baby receive a supplementary formula feed, the aim 
should be to ensure she is fully informed of the risks, benefits and 
alternatives of all the choices available to her. To enable informed 
choice, the mother has a right to know: 
• Formula supplements are highly likely to negatively affect her 
milk supply 
• Giving formula may impair the baby’s ability to utilise ketone 
bodies and counter -regulate (De Rooy and Hawdon, 2002). 
• There is a risk of possible allergic sensitisation of the baby to 
cow’s milk protein 
• It is known that, in genetically susceptible individuals, 
breastfeeding can have a protective effect on the later 
development of diabetes. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
20 
 • When supplements are given with an artificial nipple (teat) 
they have been associated with breastfeeding problems such 
as incorrect suckin g technique and breast refusal . Although 
some babies appear to be able to breastfeed successfully after 
having been given a teat, there are other babies for whom 
early introduction of a teat leads to breastfeeding cessation. 
Therefore it makes sense to avoid teats wherever possible 
while babies are learning to breastfeed. 
 
• The discussion should take place in an unhurried manner and 
should be given sensitively, as it may not be easy for a new 
mother to hear. Ensure the mother understands that these are 
risks, not certainties. The discussion should be documented in 
the baby’s records. Mothers should be aware that staff will 
respect her wishes and choices whatever she decides . Whilst 
in-patients, all supplemental feeds should be documented on 
Badgernet. If supplements are advised whilst doing a home 
visit this should documented on Badgernet. Families should be 
directed to the Guide to Bottle Feeding. 
 
Any formula given should be appropriate to the baby’s age i.e. day ) 5 -10mls per feed, day 1 
10-15mls per feed, day 2 15 -20mls per feed, day 3 20mls per feed. Formula top -ups should 
not exceed 20mls per feed once lactation is established. 
 
21 Process for weighing N ewborns 
 
The process for weighing newborns is naked, on electronic scales, on a firm surface, ideally 
in the prone position to reduce stress. For consistency, where possible t he same scales 
should be used . Ideally ask parents to take a photograph to avoid errors . 
Weights should be documented o n Badgernet and the Red Book, if available. 
21.1 At birt h 
21.2 At around 72hrs of age (day 3), if an inpatient, and if thought to be clinically 
beneficial in terms of informing the feeding plan, o r if risk factors are present. 
Occasionally this may be indicated whilst in the community if feeding 
problems are identified. 
21.3 Day 5: Along with observation of a full feed and documentation of feeding 
assessment. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
21 
 21.4 At day 10 or at next community appointment (Birth weight should normally 
have been re -gained by 14 days. PLEASE NOTE: Babies should be gaining 
weight at a minimum of 20g per day, from routine day 5 weight) Average 
daily gain is 25 -30 grams per day. 
21.5 Babies who have not regained their birthweight should not be discharged 
from midwifery care. Babies who are not back to birthweight by 3 weeks 
should be reviewed by their GP for faltering growth. 
 
22 Identification of excessive weight loss 
 
Neonatal weight loss in the first few days of life is part of normal physiological process 
where excess extra -cellular fluid is excreted. This weight loss has been expected to be up to 
10% of the birth weight, although this expectation was never evidence based. Recent 
studies have indicated that normal weight loss in the majority of babies is more likely to be 
around 5 -7% of birth weight (Dewey et al 2005, Macdonald 2003), however a small group of 
babies may be vulnerable to greater loss. Peak weight loss usually occurs around 72 hours. 
 
Excessive weight loss (>8%) in healthy breastfed newborns results when there is ineffective 
milk transfer to the baby. The most likely reasons are: 
 
• the baby is not latching to the breast effectively 
• the baby is not feeding frequently enough or for long enough 
• more rarely, it may be due to a medical condition or physical abnormality of either 
mother or baby (illness, infection). 
 
In all but a very small minority of cases the problem can be overcome with good feeding 
management. If the problem is not corrected, suppression of milk production will result. In 
the first few days of life the problem is more likely to be one of milk transfer from mother to 
baby rather than milk supply. An underlying illness can in itself cause weight loss or may be 
the reason for poor feeding responses. 
 
Infant weight is a late indicator of poor breastfeeding and close monitoring of the following 
would indicate poor breast milk intake prior to a weight loss occurring: 
• Observing effective positioning and attachment 
• Observation of the suck/swallow pattern of the baby throughout a feed 
• Frequent assessment of urine output and stool frequency 
23 Calculating weight l oss 
 
Calculation of percentage weight loss in infant 
Actual weight loss ÷ BW × 100 = n% 
Example: 
BW of 3500g, weight on day 5 3140g = loss of 360g 
360 ÷ 3500 × 100 = 10.2% 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072

 Weight loss of 8 -10.0% Plan A should be commenced. 
Weight loss of >10 -12.0% Plan A and B 
Weight loss of >12% Plan A, B and C (see below) 
Please refer to Trust Guideline for the Prevention and Management of Excessive Weight 
Loss in Healthy Breastfed Newborns Appendix D 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
23 
 24 Action plans for weight loss (Appendix C) 
24.1 Plan A 8 -10% weight loss after 72hrs (or for older babies) (Appendix C) 
 Perform a full examination of the baby and re -check weights and 
calculations 
 Take a full breastfeeding history from the mother 
 Observe a full breastfeed – ensure effective positioning and 
attachment. Observe sucking pattern – short initial sucks change 
to deep rhythmic sucks with pauses and audible swallows from 
day 4 -6 as milk volume increases. Ratio should be one to two 
sucks per swallow. Document the ratio. Complete the 
breastfeeding assessment form on Badgernet . 
 Teach the mother how to do breast compressions whilst baby is 
feeding. 
 Ensure minimum of 8 feeds in 24 hours. Advic e mother to initiate 
feeds every 2 -3 hours if baby not showing feeding cues regularly. 
Show mother how to wake a sleepy baby. Start a feed chart via 
the breastfeeding diary (Appendix 2) 
 Skin to skin contact to encourage pre -feeding behaviour and 
effective breastfeeding 
 Observe for change in frequency and volume of urine and stool 
output, ensure changing stool pattern. 
 If a restricted lingual frenulum (tongue tie) is suspected book a 
clinic appointment via Badgernet or by email the antenatal clinic 
at RSCH or Maternity Office at PRH. 
Uhsussex.maternityadminprh@nhs.net or 
uhsussex.maternityadminrsch@nhs.net 
 If at any point illness is suspected refer immediately to SCBU or 
CASU 
 Offer visit/telephone after 24 hours to ensure stool and urine 
output are improving 
 Review at 24 -48 hours. Consider re -weigh in 48hours if no change 
in frequency/amount of urine and stools and document. Minimal 
weight gain is 20g in a 24hour period. If weight increasing , 
continue to monitor and provide encouragement and support. 
 After 48 hours if no weight increase, move to management plan 
B straight away. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
24 
 24.2 Plan B >10 -12% weight loss of birth weight at 72 hours or for older babies 
with no/minimal improvement following management plan A (Appendix C) 
 Follow management plan A 
 Refer to the infant feeding team 
 Discuss with neonatal registrar for underlying illness. If baby is 
clinically well continue with plan B. 
 Perform a full set of observations. Examine baby and also look for 
signs of jaundice and document extent. 
 Commence a breastfeeding diary Appendix 2 
 Ensure breast compressions are being done effectively and 
throughout a feed 
 If babies are sleepy or have a poor suck, teach mothers ‘switch 
nursing’ technique *, which involves swapping the baby from one 
breast to the other and back each time the sucking pattern ceases 
to be a nutritive pattern (short term only) 
 Monitor and record urine and stool output noting frequency and 
colour. 
 Express breastmilk after each feed , ideally using a double electric 
breast pump and give to baby. Express for 15 minutes following 
feeds. Continue even when the flow of milk stops. Any milk 
expressed can be given as a top up following the next feed. 
 Visit at 24hours to ensure stool and urine output are improving 
and breastfeeding is more effective and/or frequent. 
 Ensure you are aware of any issues specific to the mother and 
have considered any potential impact on that individual situation. 
 Weigh again at 48hours, preferably on the same scales. 
 If no increase in weight or only minimal increase (<20g day) or 
weight loss, move to Management Plan C straight away. 
*switch nursing technique is used for sleepy babies. Let baby feed at the breast until sucking 
and swallowing slows down then swap breasts. Do this thro ughout the feed. For short -term 
use only. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
25 
 24.3 Plan C More than 12.% weight loss of birth weight at 72 hours or for older 
babies or no/minimal improvement following management plans A and B 
refer baby to CASU at RACH (RSCH) or SCBU <14 days (PRH). This is 
mandatory (Appendix C) 
24.4 Follow management plan A and B plus: 
 Minimum of 8 feeds in 24 hours plus supplements of EBM each 
feed to rehydrate. If EBM is insufficient give adequate volume of 
formula for age of baby. 
 Express after and between feeds, using hand expressing, own 
pump or hospital grade pump, whichever yields most milk to 
increase supply. 
 Re-weigh in 24hours then weekly weights, until clear trend 
towards birth weight is demonstrated. 
 COMPLETE A DATIX 
 
24.5 Treatment for babies requiring rehydration 
 All babies should be supplemented with expressed breast milk in 
the first instance. This would be done with a plan to protect the 
breastfeeding relationship and preserve breastmilk supply. 
Formula should only be used if insufficient volumes of expressed 
breastmilk are available whilst encouraging 
breastfeeding/expressing 
 A pragmatic approach would be to feed the baby between ½ of its 
fluid requirement as supplemental feeds whilst continuing to 
support lactation and breastfeeding. 
25 Calculating milk volumes for supplementation (Appendix D) 
Rationale for colostrum vo lumes in healthy term infant that will not latch due to tongue tie 
or other problems 
As there is limited research available, the amount of expressed milk given should reflect the 
normal amounts of colostrum available, the size of the infant’s stomach and the age and 
size of infant (The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2017). Several studies give an idea 
of intakes at the breast over time. None are indications of the mother’s capacity to make 
milk. The number of feedings should be based on infant cues. 
Average Reported Intakes of Colostrum per feed by Healthy, Term Breastfed Infants 
(Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2017) 
 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
26 
 Time (hours) Intake (ml per feed) 
First 24 hours (Day 0) 2-10 
24-48 (Day 1) 5-15 
48-72 (Day 2) 15-30 
72-96 (Day 3) 30-60 
 
Boss et al (2018) found that the mean milk production of lactating women by 8 days 
postpartum is 650 mL/24 hours, and from 1 to 6 months of lactation the mean range for 
exclusively breastfed infants is between 750 and 800 mL/24 hours. 
Volume of milk required in 24hrs mls/kg 
Day 3 120mls/kg 
Day 4 140mls/kg 
Day 5 onwards 150mls/kg 
 
This would equate to approximately 30mls of milk per feed for a 4kg baby on day 3 if 
feeding 3 hourly (120mls/kg). This supplement may also be given as 1 feed of 60mls 
approximately 6 hourly along with support of lactation and feeding. Larger supplements 
given less frequently may be more protective for breastfeeding and lactation. All feeds 
should be clearly documented on the feeding chart. Feeds should not be more than 6 hours 
apart in this group of babies and breastfeeding and/or breastmilk should be given in 
between formula feeds as frequently as possible. Breastmilk removal at night is important 
for lactation production. 
Supplementation should reduce once breastmilk yield increases, baby’s weight has 
increased and blood profile has normalised.

26 Neonatal readmissions 
 
The health professional admitting the baby into hospital should be responsible for 
completing the DATIX form. The Infant Feeding Specialist midwife with liaise with Clinical 
Governance regularly to analyse data on readmissions for excessive weight loss and 
resulting hypernatremia on an individual basis. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
27 
 26.1 Babies readmitted to the postnatal ward 
Readmitted with: 
• >12% weight loss 
• Sodium >150 
• Complex feeding problems 
26.2 Management P lan 
• ANNP or Neonatologist will clinically review baby 
• ANNP or neonatologist will discuss and agree a management plan 
with the mother and action a feeding plan accordingly. This should 
be clearly documented in the baby’s notes. 
• System for reporting all newborns readmitted to hospital with 
feeding problems in the first 28 days of life: admitting clinicians 
will complete DATIX form. For more information on how the Datix 
is then managed please see MD085 Maternity Risk Management 
Strategy Page 22, 14.6 
26.3 Midwives providing care should: 
• Commence checking and documenting wet and dirty nappies 
• Contact Infant feeding team for on -going support 
• Consider and support maternal physical and mental health 
26.4 For women who are breastfeeding the management plan should be: 
• BF responsively looking for early feeding cues, but at least 3hrly + 
top up volumes below (see be low) via bottle 
• Day 3 120ml/kg. Day 4 140 mls/kg. Day 5 onwards 150mls/kg. 
Depending on what the baby is taking from the breast, these 
volumes may exceed what a thriving breastfed baby would take 
and can have a negative impact on helping the mother to achieve 
exclusive breastfeeding. If the baby is seen to breastfeed well and 
it has been assessed that there has been good milk transfer, the 
volume of top up can be adjusted accordingly.) 
• Midwife providing care should encourage and support women to 
continue to breastfeed and commence expressing (see expressing 
section) 
• The quality and volumes of each feed should be documented in 
the baby’s notes and on the feed chart. 
• As the breastfeeding / lactation improves, mothers should be 
given a plan to reduce the volume of top ups and return to 
exclusive breastfeeding . 
26.5 For women who are artificially feeding baby 
• Artificially feed baby volumes below 
• Day 3 onwards 150ml/kg 
• The quality and volumes of each feed should be documented in 
the baby’s notes and on the feed chart

 Section 2 
 
1 Babies requiring care in the n eonatal unit 
 
1.1 Parents with a baby on the neonatal unit are supported to have a close and 
loving relationship with their baby. All parents will: 
 Have a discussion with an appropriate staff member as soon as 
possible (either before or after their baby’s birth) about the 
importance of touch, comfort and communication for their baby’s 
health and development as soon as possible. 
 Be encouraged to provide touch, comfort and emotional support to 
their baby, throughout their baby’s stay on the neonatal unit. 
 Be enabled to have frequent and prolonged skin to sin contact with 
their baby as soon as possible after the birth and throughout the 
baby’s stay on the neonatal unit, providing the baby’s condition 
allows. 
1.2 This service recognises the importance of breastmilk for babies’ survival and 
health. Therefore, this service will ensure that: 
 A mother’s own breastmilk is always the first choice to feed her baby. 
 Mothers have a discussion regarding the importance of their 
breastmilk for their preterm or ill baby as soon as is appropriate. 
 A suitable environment conducive to effective expression is created 
 Mothers have access to effective breast pumps and equipment. 
 Mothers are enabled to express breastmilk for their baby, including 
support to: 
• Express as early as possible after birth (ideally within two 
hours). 
• Learn how to express effectively, including by hand and 
by pump, using breast compressions to optimise supply. 
• Learn how to use pump equipment and store milk safely. 
• Express frequen tly between 8 -10 times in 24 hours, 
including once at night), especially in the first two to three 
weeks following delivery, in order to optimise long term 
milk supply. 
• Overcome expressing difficulties where necessary, 
particularly where milk supply is inadequate, or if less 
than 750ml in 24hours is expressed by day 10. 
• Stay close to their babies when expressing milk Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
29 
 • Use their milk for mouth care when their baby is not 
tolerating oral feeds, and later to tempt their baby to 
feed. 
1.3 Where possible, breastfeeding babies should receive their non -nutritive 
sucking at the breast. There is evidence that non -nutritive sucking in this way 
improves breastfeeding outcomes. 
1.4 In mothers absence or if non -nutritive sucking at the breast is not possible for 
medical reasons for e.g. CPAP and venti lation, it may be appropriate, with her 
permission and under the guidance of senior neonatal nurs e to temporarily 
provide non -nutritive sucking with a dummy. In certain cases for e.g. when 
baby’s fluid intake is restricted , non -nutritive sucking may be offered at the 
breast after mother has expressed and emptied her breasts or by a dummy 
1.5 In cases where the baby has been using a dummy on the neonatal unit and is 
then transferred from the neonatal unit to the postnatal ward for transitional 
care, further dummy use will be discouraged so as to ensure any sucking, 
nutritive or non -nutritive is received at the breast so as to avoid sucking 
abnormalities which may complicate breastfeeding. 
1.6 When supplementation is medically indicated, there must be a 
breastfeeding/lactation supportive plan put in p lace, with a plan for reducing 
supplementation as soon as possible. 
1.7 A formal review of expressing is undertaken a minimum of four times in the 
first two weeks to support optimum expressing and milk supply. 
1.8 This service will ensure that mothers receive care that supports the transition 
to breastfeeding, including support to: 
 Recognise and respond to feeding cues and use skin to skin contact to 
encourage instinctive feeding behaviour 
 Position and attach their baby for breastfeeding 
 Recognise effective feeding and overcome challenges when needed. 
 
2 Valuing parents as partners in care whilst on the neonatal u nit 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
30 
 2.1 This service recognises that parents are vital to ensuring the best possible 
short and long term outcomes for babies and therefore, should considered a s 
the primary partners in care. The service will ensure that parents: 
 Have unrestricted access to their baby , unless individual restrictions 
can be justified in the baby’s best interest. 
 Are fully involved in their baby’s care, with all care possible entrusted 
to them. 
 Are listened to, including their observations, feelings and wishes 
regarding their baby’s care 
 Have full information regarding their baby’s condition and treatment 
to enable informed decision making. 
 Are make comfortable when on the unit, with the aim of enabling 
them to spend as much time as is possible with their baby. 
2.2 The Neonatal unit will ensure that parents who formula feed: 
 Receive information about how to clean, sterilise equipment and 
make up a bottle of formula milk as safely as possible to minimise the 
risks of formula milk. 
 Are able to bottle feed using a safe and responsive technique. 
 
3 Babies Receiving Special / Transitional Care 
 
Babies at risk of hypoglycaemia should follow the hypoglycaemic pathway (see 
hypoglycaemia protocol MP069 Care of the Newborn immediately after birth ). 
Breast milk will be the first choice of nutrition, other supplements may be necessary. When 
other supplementation is medica lly indicated, the lead health professional (midwife, ANNP 
or neonatologist) must give women full explanations and obtain informed consent. All 
conversations should be documented and a supplemental sticker completed for the notes 
for those babies on transitional care. 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
31 
 3.1 Advise mother where she can obtain a suitable pump for use at home 
3.2 Continue to keep offering the breast. Use both prescriptive holds and 
biological nurturing. Avoid situations where baby and mother become upset 
at efforts to breastfeed 
3.3 Where possible avoid a bottle in the first five days. After this, the larger 
quantities of breast milk required, may necessitate the use of a bottle 
3.4 Give parents information about how to assess neonatal wellbeing, including 
expected number and volume of wet nappies and numbers of dirty nappies 
and colour of stool. Parents should be advised to ring the community 
midwives office if there are concerns re baby’s urine or stool output. 
3.5 Inform parents about local and national breastfeeding drop -ins, which 
provide ongoing support, and telephone advice. 
3.6 Inform partner and family and friends so that they can provide support 
which, protects the breastfeeding relationship and allows mother to make 
her own choices 
3.7 Staff should remain positive, in their attitude. As long as the mother is 
establishing a good lactation, the window of opportunity for breastfeeding 
remains open.

Optimal Care of the Breastfeeding Newborn 
1.1 The following advice and measure s have been shown to: 
• help to reduce the severity of physiological jaundice 
• prevent its transition to a pathological condition which may threaten the 
breastfeeding relationship 
1.2 Colostrum has a laxative affect, and early establishment of breastfeeding and 
the subsequent bowel stimulation helps to reduce the incidence and seve rity 
of physiological jaundice, meconium contains bilirubin which is reab sorbed 
through the neonatal gut 
1.3 After delivery t he midwi fe providing care at birth will: 
• Help with the first breastfeed 
• If the baby does not feed at birth the midwife providing care should show 
the mother how to hand express Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
32 
 1.4 If the baby is reluctant to breastfeed in the first two days, mother should be 
encouraged to hand express and offer the baby her colostrum in a syringe. 
2 The presence of physiological jaundice from 2 -3 days 
2.1 The midwife providing postnatal care should advise mother to: 
 Arrange a transcutaneous bilirubin check (TCB) within 24hrs if no 
other concerns. If concerns regarding wellbeing or raised TCB refer to 
RACH/SCBU 
 Look for early feeding cues, a nd respond to them (responsive 
feeding). 
 If the baby is not waking spontaneously, wake baby every three hours 
and offer a breastfeed. 
 Seek advice from the midwife should the baby refuse to feed on two 
consecutive occasions . 
 Respond to feeding cues. Do not wait for the baby to cry for food. 
 Aim that the baby has 8-12 good feeds in 24 hrs 
2.2 Advise to keep baby warm 
2.3 The midwife providing postnatal care should show the mother: 
 How to wake a sleepy baby, in order to achieve a successful 
breastfeed 
 Optimise positioning and attachment so that breast drainage is 
optimal and assess adequate milk transfer by observing the suck and 
swallow pattern (ratio2:1) 
2.4 Breast milk aids the conjugation and elimination of bilirub in, offer the second 
 breast, once the first breast is drained. 
 
3 Concerns about l actation 
 
If there are concerns over lactation, the Midwife providing postnatal care should: Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
33 
 3.1 Suggest expressing after feeds to increase the amount of milk available at the 
next feed, and offer any EBM expressed, by cup 
3.2 Offer additional support with breastfeeding by referring to the breastfeeding 
team 
3.3 Ensure that mother knows how to seek advice on a 24 hr basis 
3.4 Always refer to a paediatrician if the baby’s condition gives rise for concern. 
3.5 If the jaundice persists beyond ten days, refer for assessment but continue to 
support breastfeeding

 3 Appendix C – Prevention and management of excessive weight 
loss in healthy breastfed newborns 
 
Plan A 8-10% weight loss after 72hrs (or for older babies) 
• Perform a full examination of the baby and re -check weights and calculations 
• Take a full breastfeeding history from the mother 
• Observe a full breastfeed – ensure effective positioning and attachment. Observe 
sucking pattern – short initial sucks change to deep rhythmic sucks with pauses and 
audible swallows from day 4 -6 as milk volume increases. Ratio should be one to two 
sucks per swallow. Document the ratio. Complete the breastfeeding assessment 
form 
• Teach the mother how to do breast compressions whi lst baby is feeding 
• Ensure minimum of 8 feeds in 24 hours. Inform mother to initiate feeds every 2 -
3hours if baby not showing feeding cues regularly. Show mother how to wake a 
sleepy baby. Start a feed chart via the breastfeeding diary (Appendix A) 
• Skin to skin contact to encourage pre -feeding behaviour and effective breastfeeding 
• Observe for change in frequency and volume of urine and stool output, ensure 
changing stool pattern. 
• If a restricted lingual frenulum (tongue tie) is suspected book a clinic appointment by 
telephoning the antenatal clinic at RSCH 
• If at any point illness is suspected refer immediately to SCBU or CASU 
 
3.1 Offer visit or telephone call after 24 hours to ensure stool and urine output 
are improving. 
• Review at 24 -48 hours. Consider re -weigh in 48hours if no change in frequency/amount of 
urine and stools and document. Minimal weight gain is 20g in a 24hour period. If weight 
increasing continue to monitor and provide encouragement and support. 
 
After 48 hours if no weight increase, move to management plan B straight away 
 
Plan B >10 -12% weight loss of birth weight at 72 hours or for older babies with no/minimal 
improvement following management plan A 
• Follow management plan A plus 
• Discuss with neonatal registrar for underlying illness. If baby clinically well continue 
with plan B. 
• Perform a full set of observations. Examine baby and also look for signs of jaundice 
and document extent. 
• Ensure skilled help w ith positioning and attachment. R efer to a more exp erienced 
colleague if necessary . 
• Commence a breastfeeding diary (appendix 2) 
• Ensure breast compressions are being done effectively and throughout a feed Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
38 
 • If babies are sleepy or have a poor suck, teach mothers switch nursing* technique, 
which involves swapping the baby from one breast to the other and back each time 
the sucking pattern ceases to be a nutritive pattern. 
• Monitor and record urine and stool output noting frequency and colour. 
• Express breastmilk after each feed and give to baby. Express for 15 minutes following 
feeds. Continue even when the flow of milk stops. Any milk expressed can be given 
as a top up following the next feed. 
 
3.2 Visit at 24 hours to ensure stool and urine output are improving and 
breastfeeding is more effective and/or frequent. 
• Ensure you are aware of any issues specific to the mother and have considered any 
potential impact on that individual situation. 
 
• Weigh again at 48 hours, preferably on the same scales. 

If no increase in weight or only minimal increase (<20g day) or w eight loss, move to 
management p lan C straight away. 
 
*switch nursing technique swaps baby from one breast to the other and back each time the 
sucking pattern ceases to be a nutritive pattern. 

Plan C more than 12% weight loss of birth weight at 72 hours or for older babies with no 
minimal improvement following management plans A and B 
 
• Refer baby to CASU at RACH (RSCH) or SCBU (PRH) if <14 days . This is mandatory. 
 
Follow management plan A and B plus: 
 
• Perform a full set of observations. Examine the baby for signs of jaundice and 
document extent of jaundice. Observe urine and stool frequency. 
• Minimum of 8 feeds in 24 hours plus supplements of EBM each feed to rehydrate 
plus appropriate formula supplementation when clinically indicated. Express after 
and between feeds, using hand expressing, own pump or hospital grade pump, 
whichever yields most milk to increase supply. 
• Re-weigh in 24hours then weekly weights, until clear trend towards birth weight is 
demonstrated. 
• Serum sodium <150 admit to SCBU/RACH commence feeding plan 
• Serum sodium 150 -170 admit to SCBU/RACH – IV or oral rehydration 
• Serum sodium >170 admit to SCBU/RACH – IV rehydration Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072

 4 Appendix D – Calculating milk volumes for supplementation 
 
Rationale for colostrum volumes in a healthy term infant w ho will not latch due to tongue 
tie or other problems. 
As there is limited research available, the amount of expressed milk given should reflect the 
normal amounts of colostrum available, the size of the infant’s stomach and the age and 
size of infant (The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2017). Several studies give an idea 
of intakes at the breast over time. None are indications of the mother’s capacity to make 
milk. The number of feedings should be based on infant cues. 
Average Reported Intakes of Colostrum per feed by Healthy, Term Breastfed Infants 
(Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2017) 
 
Time (hours) Intake (ml per feed) 
First 24 hours (Day 0) 2-10 
24-48 (Day 1) 5-15 
48-72 (Day 2) 15-30 
72-96 (Day 3) 30-60 
 
Boss et al (2018) found that the mean milk production of lactating women by 8 days 
postpartum is 650 mL/24 hours, and from 1 to 6 months of lactation the mean range for 
exclusively breastfed infants is between 750 and 800 mL/24 hours. 
 
Volume of milk required in 24hrs mls/kg 
Day 3 120mls/kg 
Day 4 140mls/kg 
Day 5 onwards 150mls/kg 
 
This would equate to approximately 60mls of milk per feed for a 4kg baby on day 3 if 
feeding 3 hourly (120mls/kg/day), and taking no breastfeeds. It may be prudent and 
protective of breastfeeding to give half this volume if the baby is breastfeeding and taking 
some milk and the infant requires a top -up only. Larger supplements given less frequently 
may be more protective for breastfeeding and lactation. All feeds should be clearly 
documented on the feeding chart. Feeds should not be more than 6 hours apart in this 
group of babies and breastfeeding and/or breastmilk should be given in between formula 
feeds as frequently as possible. Breastmilk removal at night is important for lactation 
production. 
Supplementation should reduce once breastmilk yield increases, baby’s weight has 
increased and blood profile has normalised.

5 Appendix E – Transcutaneous bilirubin monitoring 
 
Use serum bilirubin measurement for babies: 
• in the first 24 hours of life or 
• who have a gestational age of less than 35 weeks . 
In babies who have a gestational age of 35 weeks or more, and who are over 24 hours old: 
• Use a transcuta neous bilirubinometer to measure the bilirubin level 
• If a transcutaneous bilirubinometer is not available, measure the serum bilirubin 
• If a transcutaneous bilirubinometer measurement indicates a bilirubin level greater 
than 250 micromol/litre , measure the serum bilirubin to check the result 
• Use serum bilirubin measurement if bilirubin levels are at or above the relevant 
treatment thresholds for their age, and for all subsequent measurements. 
Do not use an icterometer to measure bilirubin levels in babies. 
Do not measure bilirubin levels routinely in babies who are not visibly jaundiced

7 Appendix G - Tongue Tie 
 
Tongue Tie (Ankyloglossia) 
Division of Tongue Tie ( Frenulotomy ) to Assist Newborn Feeding 
 
7.1 Introduction – Breastfeeding is the optimal way for a baby to feed, and not 
doing so increases health risks for life for both mother and baby. The UK 
government and the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend six 
months exclusive breastfeeding. The National Institute of Health and Clinical 
Excellence have issued guidelines for the diagnosis, management and 
treatment of tongue tie in breastfed babies. The guidelines do not specifically 
cover bottle fed babies, but may apply to them also. 
 
 Only those who are a registered health professional and have successfully completed 
an approved training may undertake the division of tongue tie. 
 
7.2 Effects of Tongue Tie on Infant Feeding 
 
 Babies may present with a range of problems including: 
• Difficulty or inability to attach to the breast 
• Constantly slipping off the breast 
• Excessive weight loss 
• Slow or no weight gain 
• Constant or very frequent feeding 
• Unsettled baby 
• Difficulty taking the teat in a bottle fed baby 
• Excessive dribbling in a bottle fed baby 
• Prolonged feeding in a bottle fed baby 
• Slow weight gain in a bottle fed baby 
• Prolonged jaundice 
 
 Mothers often complain of: Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
42 
 • Sore nipples 
• Painful breastfeeding 
• Engorgement or mastitis 
• Poor milk supply 
• Exhaustion from constant breastfeeding 
 
Some of these problems are commonly seen during the early breastfeeding period when a 
mother has not been assisted to position and attach her baby correctly for breastfeeding. 
When tongue tie is present these problems persist regardless of skilled help, and may result 
in a mother deciding to stop breastfeeding before she is ready to do so. 
 
Assessment for tongue t ie is not part of the check of the newborn and should only be 
performed as part of the overall asses sment for feeding problems. A full tongue tie 
assessment should only be made by a health professional who is a tongue tie practitioner 
and has been approv ed to perform this role by the t rust. However in the presence of 
feeding problems, staff who have been trained in the use of the BTAT/TABBY Tool (Appendix 
H) may, if confident to do so, perform a full feeding assessment followed by a TABBY 
assessment. If the assessment scores 6 or below and there are persistent feeding problems 
then a ref erral can be made to the tongue tie clinic for a full assessment. 
 
Adequate tongue movement is essential for successful breastfeeding. Approximately 10% of 
babies are born with a significant lingual frenulum. They do not all need snipping. If the 
lingual frenulum is short and limiting tongue movement to the extent that feeding is 
affected, then frenulotomy is indicated. 
 
The signs for tongue tie are one or more of the following: 
• The tongue appears shortened or flattened at the front. 
• The normal tongue groove is increased on protrusion 
• The tongue does not extend beyond the lower gum, when the mouth is open. 
• The tongue tips down on extension 
• Elevation of tongue is restricted with digital examination. 
• The sides of the tongue rise well above the tip when the tongue is elevated 
creating a heart shaped or butterfly appearance. 
• Finger cupping is poor or absent on digital examination of suck. 
 
The assessment of tongue movement is the most important part of diagnosis but the extent 
of the frenulum and whether it is diaphanous (elastic) or short and thick are also key 
observations. 
 
When tongue tie is suspected, the baby should be referred to a tongue tie practitioner who 
will make the definitive assessment, diagnosis, and clinical decision as to whether or not a 
frenulotomy is indicated. 
 
The parents should not be given the impression that a frenulotomy will definitely be 
performed 
 Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
43 
 7.3 Referral 
 
The baby must be less than 12 weeks old at the time of making the appointment. Older 
babies should be referred to : Uhsussex.ttbrightonsurgeons@nhs.net 
 
There is often provision to offer assessment a nd frenulotomy to babies who are on the 
post natal ward and having difficulties with feeding that are not resolved by help with 
position ing and attachment. Assessment must be made by a Trust approved tongue tie 
practitioner. 
 
There must be a feeding problem that has not been resolved despite help with positioning 
and attachment. 
 
Babies who are breastfeeding well and thriving, and the mother is comfortable should not 
be referred, regardless of the appearance of the tongue. 
Concerns about eating, speech, the aesthetics or dental decay in the future are not 
appropriate referral criteria for this clinic and these babies should be referred to the GP for 
guidance. 
 
Referral can be made by G.P’s, ANNP’s, midwives, nursery nurses maternity support 
workers, health visitors, or the mother can self-refer, provided feeding has been assessed by 
a health worker, skilled in the support of infant feeding. 
 
Appointments are made on Badgernet or by emailing the referral form (appendix J) to t he 
Maternity Office PRH or Antenatal Clinic RSCH uhsussex.maternityadminrsch@nhs.net or 
uhsussex.maternityadminprh@nhs.net 
 
Clinics are held eve ry Friday 1.30 – 4.30pm at RACH and every Wednesday 9.30 – 12.00 at 
PRH antenatal clinic. 
 
Parents should not be given the impression that a frenulotomy will definitely be performed 
Advise parents to contact the antenatal clinic at RSCH if they no longer require the 
appointment, so that it can be reallocated. 
 
7.4 Management whilst waiting for appointment 
 
Even when there is a tongue tie, improving positioning and attachment will often help to 
make the mother more comfortable . An exaggerated attachment technique may help the 
breastfed baby. 
Put breastfeeding plan in place and e ducate mother to signs of effective feedin g and 
support with literature e. g. NHS Off to The Best Start 
If baby/mother unable to feed, advise breast expression to maintain lactation and provide 
food for the baby. Start hand expressing as soon as possible after birth between 8 -10 times 
every 24hrs including once at night. A breast pump can be started from day 2. 
 
Advise on volumes of milk according to the age of the baby. If giving expressed milk, use a 
cup in the first five days, after this time a bottle may be used. Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072 
44 
 It should be possible to avoid large weight loss, if an adequate lactation is established. 
Artificial milk should only be used if the mother is unable to express sufficient breast milk. 
Mothers experiencing difficulties with breastfeeding due to tongue tie will require 
emotional as well as practical support in order to continue breastfeeding whilst they wait 
for the assessment appointment. 
Bottle feeding babies will usually manage without intervention, small more frequent feeds, 
may help. 
Any baby with suspected tongue tie who is not feeding well or whose weight loss/gain, or 
general condition gives cause for concern should be seen by a paediatrician. 
 
7.5 Procedure 
 
On arrival parents take a seat in the waiting area. If the mother is breastfeeding then she 
should attend the appointment. If the baby is artificially feeding then the carer must bring a 
dummy and or bottle feed. 
A detailed feeding and relevant medical history is taken. Frenulotomy is contraindicated if 
there is a family history of bleeding disorders for which the baby has not been investigated. 
In these cases refer the parents to the baby’s GP for further guidance. 
The baby should have had Vitamin K, at birth. If this is not the case, refer to GP for 
paediatric referral for further guidance. 
After hand washing and putting on gloves an examination of the baby’s mouth is made, to 
exclude other anomalies that may affect feeding. 
The presence of tongue tie is confirmed or excluded following full assessment. 
Discussion takes place between the practitioner and the parent s. If there is not a tongue tie 
present, alternative help with the feeding is offered. If there is a tongue tie the procedure 
for frenulotomy is explained including any possible complications. 
Parents are given time to ask any questions and to decide whether to proceed to 
frenulotomy if diagnosis is confirmed. 
If proceeding with frenulotomy the parents are encouraged to remain with the baby and be 
involved by holding the baby. The equipment is placed read y. The baby is placed on a flat 
surface . 
The baby is swaddled firmly in a towel, sheet or blanket. The assistant’s hands are placed 
either side of the baby’s head on the baby’s shoulders to ensure that the baby’s arms are 
held firmly in position. After hand washing and putting on gloves the practitioner stretches 
the frenulum using left index finger, the lower lip is protected and pushed down by the left 
thumb. The frenulum is divided using appropriate scissors, being careful to snip in the 
midline so as not to damage the underneath of the tongue and cause bleeding, not to snip 
too low and damage salivary glands but to divide deeply enough to prevent regrowth of the 
frenulum. Usually one snip is sufficient but occasionally two or three may be necessary. 
The wound is compressed using a swab. The baby is quickly unwrapped and handed to the 
mother for a feed. Feeding the baby immediately will cal m the baby, help to control any 
bleeding and reassure the mother. 
Breastfeeding mothers are helped with the positioning and attachment.

 If there is excessive bleeding or any immediate problems: 
• Refer to paediatrician or ANNP 
• If at home, apply pressure and call for an ambulance. 
• Please see guidance below from the Association of Tongue Tie Practitioners for 
the control of excessive bleeding post frenulotomy. 
 
Guideline for the management of bleeding post frenulotomy 
 
A small amount of bleeding post division is common and to be expected. Allowing the baby 
to feed treats this best, as feeding will compress the floor of the mouth. 
If there is an unusual amount of bleeding after division, it is likely to be dark venous 
bleeding. Bright red arterial bleeding is very rare. 
 
1. Hold baby in an upright position. Put some gauze on the raw diamond under the tongue 
and hold in place firmly with one finger, taking care not to place any pressure under baby’s 
chin as this can obstruct the airway. Moistening the gauze with sterile water, cooled boiled 
water, or breastmilk will help prevent the clot sticking to the gauze and being removed when 
the gauze is removed. Continue to press for at least 10 timed minutes. Ensure that the 
airway is maintained. Keep baby warm and calm. Walking round whilst carrying baby, 
rocking, white noise, music, fresh air, toys, etc . can be used to distract and help calm baby. 
 
2. If the gauze becomes soaked while you are pressing, you are not pressing in the right 
place. Replace the gauze and check you are pressing under the tongue on the raw diamond, 
but now press with two fingers, side by side, to ensure you are pressing on the outer edges 
as well as the centre. Continue pressure for at least 10 timed minutes 
 
3. Do not continually remove the gauze to see if the bleeding has stopped – wait for at least 
10 minutes and then look. 
 
4. If bleeding persists apply pressure for a further 10 minutes using gauze 
 
5. In a controlled, hospital environment, with suitable monitoring, put a few drops of 
adrenaline (1:1000, 1:10000 and 1:100000, or lignocaine 1% with 1:100,000 adrenaline have 
all been used) on a gauze swab and press for 5 minutes on to the wound. There is no correct 
dose, but the potential side -effects of systemic absorption need to be considered when 
choosing the dose to use. 
 
6. Rebound bleeding is a risk with adrenaline so tranexamic acid can be used as an 
alternative or after the application of adrenaline . Soak gauze in tranexamic a cid and apply 
for 5 minutes. 
 
7. If all this fails, you will have to invoke surgical help … Silver Nitrate, electrocautery and 
suturing are options at this point 
This group of babies have had a long period of sublingual pressure followed by some form of 
surgery. This causes considerable oedema and some oral aversion, so they need to be kept 
under very close supervision, potentially as an inpatient for several days, until they are Newborn Feeding (RSCH PRH only ) MP072

 feeding normally. A prompt naso -gastric tube for initial stress -free feeds is very useful and 
avoids an unnecessary IV line.

9 Appendix I – Antenatal Hand Expressing 
 
Background 
Colostrum is the optimal source of nutrition for newborns. However, some infants are at risk 
of receiving manufactured milk before colostrum in the first few days after the birth, due to 
a number of medical conditions and possible barriers to early breastfeeding. 
 
Antenatal hand expression and storage of colostrum during pregnancy can reduce the need 
for/amount of manufactured milk given to at risk infants. 
 
Desired outcome 
To raise the profile on the value of breast milk, the normality of hand expression and reduce 
the need for manufactured milks; thereby ensuring that all newborns including those at 
higher risk will, benefit from the best possible nutrition and reduce the risks associated with 
using manufactured milks. 
 
Issues to Consider 
• Nipple stimulation at term may assist with cervical ripening (up to 45 minutes three 
times a day) 
• Nipple stimulation will not augment labour. 
• Women successfully breastfeed whilst pregnant 
• There is no significant relationship between nipple stimulation and inducing labour.

In recognition that nipple stimulation may cause uterine contractions/Braxton Hicks 
it is recommended that women: 
• Commence daily expression at 36 weeks 
• Start with 3 -5 minutes each breast 
• Total time 5 -10 minutes, build up to 3 times a day 
• Stop if hand expressing causes contractions, before 37 weeks. 
• Mothers admitted in established preterm labour may hand express. 
 
Equipment 
 
• Knitted breast/diagram of breast for teaching 
• Leaflet on hand expressing 
• 1ml oral syringes for collection of any colostrum expressed 
• Zip lock food bags to put syringes in 
• Labels (mothers’ name, date of birth and date of expression) 
• Patient information leaflet antenatal hand expressing 
 
Frozen colostrum should be put immediately in the freezer on arrival at hospital as 
once defrosted must be used within 12 hours
