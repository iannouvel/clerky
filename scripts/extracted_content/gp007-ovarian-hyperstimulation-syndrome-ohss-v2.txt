Maternity Protocol: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
Date Agreed : July 2012 Amended Date : 27th November 2015 Review Date: November 2018 OBJECTIVE STANDARDS 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION & DEFINITION 
 
1.1 OHSS is an iatrogenic condition that happens only after taking medications to 
stimulate the ovaries for fertility treatment . It is a systemic disease resulting 
from vasoactive products released by hyperstimulated ovaries. 
 
1.2 The pathophysiolo gy of OHSS is characterised by increased capillary 
permeability, leading to leakage of fluid from the vascular compartment, with 
third space fluid accumulation and intravascular dehydration. 
 
1.3 Severe manifestations include a tendency to develop thrombosis, renal and 
liver dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing 
serious morbidity. Although the true incidence of mortality from OHSS is 
unknown, and possibly under -reported, deaths from OHSS are rare. The 
reported causes of death incl ude ARDS, cerebral infarction and hepatorenal 
failure in a woman with pre -existing hepatitis C. (RCOG Green -top Guideline 
2006). 
 
1.4 All patients with suspected OHSS should be seen in GAU (RSCH) or A&E 
(PRH) and reviewed by the SpR or Consultant on duty. Ultr asound scan 
should be requested to assess the size of the ovaries and presence of ascites. 
Blood should be sent for FBC, U&Es and LFTs. HCG level should be checked 
in blood only if the date of admission is more than 12 days from egg collection. 

2.0 DIAGNOSI S 
 
2.1 Diagnosis of OHSS is usually straightforward, given a history of ovarian 
stimulation, either by gonadotrophins (FSH injections) or antiestrogens 
(Clomid, Letrozole or Tamoxifen) followed by the typical symptoms of 
abdominal distension, abdominal p ain, nausea and vomiting 

3.0 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
 
3.1 Alternative diagnoses should always be considered, such as: 
 Complication of an ovarian cyst (torsion, haemorrhage), 
 Pelvic infection, 
 Intra-abdominal haemorrhage, 
 Ectopic pregnancy 
 Appendicitis

Date Agreed : July 2012 Amended Date : 27th November 2015 Review Date: November 2018 4.0 ASSESSING SEVERITY & REPORTING ADVERSE OUTCOMES 
 
4.1 Women with OHSS should have the severity of their condition assessed and 
documented as management should be guided by the severity of the 
condition. It should be remembered that the severity could worse n over time 
as the condition evolves (See table) 
 
4.2 In the UK, any death related to OHSS must be reported to the Confidential 
Enquiries into Maternal Deaths, irrespective of whether the woman was 
pregnant. The treating IVF centre should be informed of the ad mission. The 
IVF centre should follow relevant Human Fertilisation and Embryology 
Authority (HFEA) guidelines for reporting severe untoward incidents by 
telephone within 12 working hours of the identification of the incident and 
submission of an Incident R eport Form within 24 working hours 

5.0 CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY 
 
Grade Symptoms, Signs & Investigations results 
 
Mild OHSS Abdominal bloating 
Mild abdominal pain 
Ovarian size usually < 8 cm

Ovarian size usually > 12 cm 
 
Critical OHSS Tense ascites or large hydrothorax 
Haematocrit > 55% 
White cell count > 25 000/ml 
Oligo/anuria 
Thromboembolism 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Maternity Protocol: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
Date Agreed : July 2012 Amended Date : 27th November 2015 Review Date: November 2018 6.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT 
 
6.1 The management of OHSS is essentially supportive until the condition 
resolves spontaneously 
 
6.2 All women with suspected OHSS should have blood taken for FBC, U&Es, 
LFTs and clotting screen. Also, they should all have ultrasound scan to assess 
ovarian si ze and the presence of ascites 
 
6.3 Symptomatic relief is important, particularly regarding pain and nausea 

7.0 OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT 
 
7.1 Treatment for women with mild OHSS and many with moderate OHSS can be 
managed on an outpatient basis 
 
7.2 Women can sta y at home and review can be done every 3 days by running 
blood for FBC, U&Es and LFTs. Ultrasound scan may have to b e repeated 
depending on severity of symptoms. This should be arranged through GAU 
(RSCH) and Horsted Keynes Ward (PRH) 

7.3 Urgent clinical review is necessary if the woman develops increasing severity 
of pain, increasing abdominal distension, shortness of br eath and a subjective 
impression of reduced urine outpu t 
 
7.4 The following should be advised: 
7.4.1 Analgesia using paracetamol or codeine is appropriate. Non -steroidal 
anti-inflamm atory drugs should not be used 
7.4.2 Women should be encouraged to drink to thirst, rather than to excess 
7.4.3 Strenuous exercise and sexual intercourse should be avoided for fear 
of injury or torsion of hyperstimulated ovaries. 

8.0 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT 
 
8.1 All women with severe or critical OHSS should be admitted to hospital until 
resolution of the condition. Also, women with moderate OHSS who are unable 
to achieve control of their pain and/or nausea with oral treatment should also 
be admitted.

Maternity Protocol: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
Date Agreed : July 2012 Amended Date : 27th November 2015 Review Date: November 2018 8.2 The medical staff should work in conjunction with the nursing staff to ensure 
the following is completed on admission (See also appendix A) : 
8.2.1 Observation chart should be started for pulse, blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, weight, abdominal girth and urine output. Pulse, blood 
pressure, respiratory rate and fluid input/urine outpu t should be 
monit ored 4 -hourly 
8.2.2 Weight and abdominal girth should be repeated daily 
8.2.3 FBC, U&Es, LFTs and clotting screen. FBC, U&Es an d LFTs should be 
repeated daily 
8.2.4 Ultrasound scan for ovarian size and ascite s 
8.2.5 Chest X -ray or ultrasound if respiratory symptoms or hydrothorax is 
suspected 
8.2.6 ECG and echocardiogram if pericardial effusion is suspected 
8.2.7 Pain relief is best provided with paracetamol and if necessary oral or 
parenteral opiates 
8.2.8 Antiemetic drugs used should be those appropriate for the possibility of 
early pregnancy, su ch as Cyclizine (1st line) or Metoclopramide. 
8.2.9 VTE assessment must be completed and venous support st ockings and 
prophylactic Tinzaparin should be used to minimi se the risk of thrombo -
embolism 
8.2.10 Where oral intake cannot be maintained, intravenous crystalloid s, such 
as normal saline, should be used. Most women will need a fluid intake 
of 2–3 litres in 24 hours, guided by a strict fluid balance chart 
8.2.11 Women with haemoconcentration (haemoglobin greater than 14g/dl, 
haematocrit greater than 45% may need more inten sive initial 
rehydration, such as 1 lit re of normal saline over 1 hour 
8.2.12 Women with persistent haemoconcentration and/or urine output less 
than 0.5ml/kg/ hour may benefit from colloids. Human albumin, 6% 
hydroxyethylstarch (HES), dextran, mannitol and Haemac cel h ave been 
used for this purpose 
8.2.13 If haemoconcentration and/or oliguria persist despite these measures, 
paracentesis should be considered. Paracentesis should be considered 
in women with discomfort or respiratory embarrassment because of 
severe abdominal distension, abdominal pa racentesis should be 
considered 
8.2.14 Further fluid management may be guided by central venous pressure 
monitoring and an aesthetists should be involved 
8.2.15 Aspiration of ascites should take place under ultrasound guidance to 
minimise the ris k of injury to enlarged, vascular ovaries 
8.2.16 Repeated paracenteses may be avoided by the use of pigtail or 
suprapubic catheter that can be left in place 
8.2.17 Drainage of ascites alone may suffice to resolve hydrothorax, if present, 
but symptomatic hydrothorax that persists despite abdominal 
parac entesis may be drained directly 
8.2.18 If thromboembolism is suspected, therapeutic anticoagulation should be 
commenced, and additional diagnostic measures performed such as 
arterial blood gases, and ventilation/perfusion scan

Maternity Protocol: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
Date Agreed : July 2012 Amended Date : 27th November 2015 Review Date: November 2018 8.2.19 Ovarian torsion should be suspected in the presence of further ovarian 
enlargement, worsening particularly unilateral pain, nausea, 
leucocytosis and anaemia. Colour Doppler assessment of ovarian 
blood flow may help in diagnosis. Untwisting of the twisted ad nexa 
followed by observation of improved colour at laparoscopy or 
laparotomy is associated with a favourable prognosis for ovarian 
function 
8.2.20 Features of critical OHSS should prompt consideration of the need for 
intensive care 
 
8.3 Patients who are pregnant should continue taking the following medications if 
they are already taking any of them: 
8.3.1 Progesterone (Cyclogest) 400mg vaginal pessaries, once or twice daily. 
8.3.2 Gestone (Progesterone) 100mg daily intramuscular injections. 
8.3.3 Oral Aspirin 75mg a day. 
8.3.4 Heparin ( Clexane) 40mg, daily subcutaneous injections. 
8.3.5 Prednisolone 20 -25mg daily oral dose 

9.0 DISCHARGE & FOLLOW UP 
 
9.1 All women should inform primary clinician of admission and a discharge letter 
must be sent to the referring clinic and GP 
 
9.2 Women must be discharge d with their usual medications 
 
9.3 All women must be given patient information leaflet and contact numbers
