 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

1. Scope and purpose 
The overall purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance on best clinical practice in the treatment and 
management of women living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the UK during pregnancy and 
postpartum, and their infants. The scope inc ludes guidance on the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) both to 
prevent vertical transmission of HIV and for the welfare of the woman and her baby, guidance on mode of 
delivery and recommendations in specific patient populations where other factors need to be taken into 
consideration, such as co -infection with other agents. The guidelines are aimed at clinical professionals directly 
involved with, and responsible for, the care of pregnant women living with HIV. The 2018 guidelines have 
identified signific ant developments that have either led to a change in recommendation or a change in the 
strength of recommendation. More detail has been added in areas of controversy, particularly breastfeeding. 
New data that simply support the existing data have not routi nely been included in this revision. A new section on 
the postpartum management of women has been added. Of note, the term ‘HIV’ refers to HIV -1 throughout these 
guidelines, unless HIV -2 is specified. 
1.1 Guideline development process 
The British HIV Assoc iation (BHIVA) revised and updated the Association’s guideline development manual in 2011 
(www.bhiva.org/BHIVA -guideline -development ). BHIVA has adopted the modified GRADE system for the 
assessment, evaluation and grading of evidence and the development of recommendations. Full details of the 
guideline development process including selection of the writing group and the conflict of interest policy are 
outlined in the manual. 
The guidelines we re commissioned by the BHIVA Guidelines Subcommittee; the Subcommittee nominated the 
Chair and Vice -chair of the writing group, who then nominated a writing group of experts in the field based on 
their knowledge, expertise and freedom from conflicts of int erest (the conflict of interest statements of members 
of the writing group are available and have been published along with these guidelines on the BHIVA website ). In 
addition, BHIVA members were asked to volunteer as authors for the guidelines, again base d on their knowledge, 
expertise and freedom from conflicts of interest. 
The scope, purpose and guideline topics were agreed by the writing group. Questions concerning each guideline 
topic were drafted and a systematic literature review undertaken by an in formation scientist. Details of the search 
questions (including the definition of populations, interventions, comparators and outcomes) are outlined in 
Appendix 1, and details of the search strategy can be found on the BHIVA website ( www.bhiva.org/pregnancy -
guidelines ). The literature searches for the 2018 guidelines covered the period from July 2013 to July 2017 (with 
an additional search on ART in pregnancy from July 2017 to May 2018 in response t o consultation comments), 
and included abstracts from selected conferences. For each topic and healthcare question, evidence was 
identified and evaluated by writing group members with expertise in the field. Using the modified GRADE system 
(see Appendix 2) , members were responsible for assessing and grading the quality of evidence for predefined 
outcomes across studies and developing and grading the strength of recommendations. All writing group 
members received training in use of the modified GRADE criteri a before assessing the evidence. 
Owing to the lack of data from randomised controlled trials in several important areas, the writing group was 
unable to assign high grades (in areas such as mode of delivery); however, recommendations have been given on 
best practice where decisions need to be made on the balance of available evidence. Recommendations are 
summarised and numbered sequentially within the text. 
The guidelines were published online for public consultation and external peer review was commissione d, 
comments from which resulted in minor revision prior to final approval by the writing group. 
1.2 Patient involvement 
BHIVA views the involvement of patient and community representatives in the guideline development process as 
both important and essentia l. The writing group included two patient representatives who were involved in all 
aspects of the guideline development. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

1.3 Dissemination and implementation 
The following measures have been/will be undertaken to disseminate and aid implementation of the g uidelines: 
• E-publication on the BHIVA website and in the journal HIV Medicine ; 
• Publication in HIV Medicin e; 
• Shortened version including concise summary of recommendations ; 
• E-learning module accredited for CME ; 
• Educational slide set to support local and regional educational meetings ; 
• National BHIVA audit programme ; 
• Presentation of significant changes and additions at a BHIVA national conference. 
1.4 Summary of guideline update and date of next review 
There have been some changes in recommendations. 
• Prevalence data on HIV in pregnancy: updated. 
• Infant feeding: updated advice including new data on breastfeeding and the emotional impact of not 
breastfeeding on women. The use of cabergoline in non -breastf eeding women is also discussed. 
• Psychosocial care: section 4 on The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after 
pregnancy has been expanded and its position moved within the guidelines to reflect its importance. 
• Safety: new data have been included on tenofovir DF, raltegravir, rilpivirine, dolutegravir, elvitegravir and 
cobicistat. 
• Prescribing: all women (including elite controllers) are recommended to start on treatment and remain 
on lifelong treatment. 
• Infant post -exposure prophylaxis ( PEP): length of infant PEP has been shortened where risk of vertical 
transmission is VERY LOW. 
• Hepatitis: information has been added on tenofovir alafenamide for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 
on direct -acting agents for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infe ction. 
• A new section has been added on the postpartum management of women living with HIV. 
We aim to revise these guidelines by 2021. In the meantime, the writing group will confer at least annually to 
consider new information from high -quality studies and will issue revisions or updates should clinically important 
and relevant data become available. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

2. Recommendations and auditable outcomes 
2.1 Recommendations 
Section 4. The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after pregnancy 
4.1 Psychosocial issues around HIV and pregnancy 
4.1.1 Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT). 1D 
4.1.2 We recommend that pregnant women living with HIV are offered peer support where available. 1B 
4.2 Perinatal mental health assessment 
4.2 Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken at booking, and 4 –6 
weeks postpartum and 3 –4 months postpartum in accordance with National Institute for Care 
and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines. 1D 
Section 5. Screening and monitoring of pregnant women livin g with HIV 
5.1 Sexual health screening 
5.1.1 Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. 1B 
5.1.2 For women living with HIV and already engaged in HIV care who become pregnant, sexual 
health screening is suggested. 2C 
5.1.3 Genital tract infections should be treated according to British Association for Sexual Health and 
HIV (BASHH) guidelines. 1B 
5.2 Laboratory monitoring of pregnant women living with HIV 
5.2.1 Pregnant women who are newly diagnosed with HIV do not require any additional baseline 
investigations compared with non -pregnant women living with HIV other than those routinely 
performed in the general antenatal clinic. 1D 
5.2.2 HIV resistance testing should be completed and results available prior to initiation of treatment, 
except for late -presenting women (after 28 weeks). Women should be encouraged to continue 
combination (c)ART post -delivery but, where they chose to stop cART , a further resistance test 
is recommended to ensure that mutations are not missed with reversion during the off -
treatment period. 1D 
5.2.3 In women conceiving on cART there should be a minimum of one CD4 cell count at baseline and 
one at delivery. 2D 
5.2.4 In women who commence cART in pregnancy, a CD4 cell count should be performed as per 
routine initiation of cART with the addition of a CD4 count at delivery even if starting at CD4 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
10 
 
>350 cells/mm3. 
5.2.5 In women who commence cART in pregnancy, a n HIV viral load should be performed 2 –4 weeks 
after commencing cART, at least once every trimester, at 36 weeks and at delivery. 1C 
5.2.6 In women commencing cART in pregnancy, liver function tests (LFTs) should be performed as 
per routine initiation of cART and then with each routine blood test. 1C 
5.2.7 In the event that a woman who has initiated cART during pregnancy has not suppressed plasma 
viral load to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, the following interventions are recommended: 
• Review adherence (including a full exploration of potential impacting factors) and 
concomitant medication; 
• Perform resistance test if appropriate; 
• Consider therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM); 
• Optimise to best regimen; 
• Consider intensification. 1C 
Section 6. Current issues on the use of ART in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes 
6.1 Conceiving on cART 
6.1.1 It is recommended that women c onceiving on an effective cART regimen should continue this 
treatment. 1B 
 Exceptions are: 
Non -standard regimens, for example protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy; 
Regimens that have been demonstrated to show lower pharmacokinetics in pregnancy such as 
darunavir/cobicistat and elvitegravir/cobicistat, or where there is an absence of 
pharmacokinetic data such as raltegravir 1200 mg once daily (od) (should be administe red 400 
mg twice daily [bd]). These should be modified to include (depending on tolerability, resistance 
and prior antiretroviral history) one or more agents that cross the placenta. 
A woman planning a pregnancy and/or conceiving on dolutegravir should se e her physician as 
soon as possible to discuss current evidence on neural tube defects (see section 6.5). 2D 
6.1.2 Women taking dolutegravir who are trying to conceive or in the first trimester of pregnancy 
(<12 weeks’ gestation) should be recommended to take folic acid 5 mg od (see section 6.5) . 1B 
 Women on regimens that do not contain dolutegravir should take the standard recommended 
dose of folic acid 400 g od, unless they meet the criteria for a higher dose of folic acid (see 
NICE gui dance on m aternal and child nutrition : https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11 ). 
It is recommended that all women start folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and 
continue to 12 weeks’ gestation (the end of the first trimester). BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
11 
 
6.2 Woman is not already on cART: when to start 
6.2.1 All pregnant women, including elite controller s, should start ART during pregnancy and be 
advised to continue lifelong treatment. 
 1A 
6.2.2 All women not on cART should commence cART: 
• As soon as they are able to do so in the second trimester where the baseline viral load 
≤30,000 HIV RNA copies/mL; 
• At the start of the second trimester, or as soon as possible thereafter, in women with a 
baseline viral load of 30,000 –100,000 HIV RNA copies /mL; 
• Within the first trimester if viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL and/or CD4 cell 
count is less than 200 cells/mm3. 
All women should have commenced cART by week 24 of pregnancy. 1C 
6.3 Woman is not already on cART: what to start 
6.3.1 Women are rec ommended to start tenofovir DF or abacavir with emtricitabine or lamivudine as 
a nucleoside backbone. 2C 
6.3.2 It is recommended that the third agent in cART should be efavirenz or atazanavir/r, as these are 
agents with the most safety data in pregnancy. 1C 
 Rilpivirine (25 mg od), raltegravir (400 mg bd) or darunavir/r (600/100 mg bd) may be used as 
alternatives. 1C 
 Darunavir/r should be prescribed at the twice daily dose (600/100 mg bd) if known resistance, 
and consideration should be given to using this higher dose if darunavir is initiated in 
pregnancy. 2C 
 Dolutegravir (50 mg od) may be considered from 6 weeks’ gestation which must be confirmed. 1C 
 Tenofovir alafenamide may be prescribed for women after the first trimester of pregnancy 1C 
 Zidovudine monotherapy is not recommended and should only be used in women declining 
cART with a viral load of <10,000 HIV RNA copies/mL and willing to have a caesarean section 
(CS). 1A 
 PI monotherapy, darunavir/cobicistat , atazanavir/cobicistat and elv itegravir/cobicistat are not 
recommended in pregnanc y. 1C 
6.3.3 It is recommended that an integrase inhibitor -based regimen be considered as the third agent 
of choice in patients: 
• With high baseline viral load (>100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL); 
Where cART is failing to suppress the virus. 
 
2C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
12 
 
1C 
6.4 Late -presenting woman not on treatment 
6.4.1 A woman who presents after 28 weeks should commence cART without delay. 1B 
6.4.2 If the viral load is unknown or >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL, a three - or four -drug regimen that 
includes raltegravir 400 mg bd or dolutegravir 50 mg od is suggested. 2D 
6.4.3 Management of an untreated woman presenting in labour at term. 
• All women should be given a stat dose of nevirapine 200 mg; 
1B 
 • and commence oral zidovudine 300 mg and lamivudine 150 mg bd; 1B 
 • and raltegravir 400 mg bd; 2D 
 • and receive intravenous zidovudine for the duration of labour. 
Please also see section 9.1.3 for HIGH -RISK neonatal management. 2D 
6.4.4 In preterm labour, if the infant is unlikely to be able to absorb oral medications consider the 
addition of double -dose tenofovir DF to the woman’s treatment described in recommendation 
6.7.3 to further load the inf ant. 2C 
6.4.5 Women presenting in labour/with spontaneous rupture of the membranes (SROM)/requiring 
delivery without a documented HIV result must be advised to have an urgent HIV test. A 
reactive/positive result must be acted upon immediately, with initiation of interventions to 
prevent vertical transmission of HIV without waiting for further/formal serological confirmation. 1D 
6.7 Pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals in pregnancy 
6.7 No routine dose alterations are recommended for antiretrovirals during pregnancy if used at 
standard adult licensed doses, apart from raltegravir, which should be given as 400 mg bd. 1C 
 Consider TDM particularly if combining tenofovir DF and atazanavir/r. 2C 
 If dosing off licence, consider switching to standard dosing throughout pregnancy or regular 
TDM. 2C 
6.8 Stopping ART postpartum 
6.8.1 Stopping ART after delivery is not recommended; women who wish to stop ART should be 
counselled on the risks and managed as per the BHIVA guidelines for the treatment of HIV -
positive adults with antiretroviral therapy. 1B BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
13 
 
6.9 HIV -2 
6.9.1 Case discussion with experts with experience of managing HIV -2 is recommended for all 
women. 1D 
6.9.2 A boosted PI -based regimen such as twice daily darunavir/r is rec ommended in women with 
HIV-2. 1C 
Section 7. HIV and hepatitis virus co -infections 
7.1 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
7.1.1 On diagnosis of new HBV infection, confirmation of viraemia with quantitative HBV DNA, ‘e’ 
antigen status as well as hepatitis A virus (HAV), HCV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) screening and 
tests to assess hepatic inflammation/fibrosis and liver function are recommended. 1C 
7.1.2 LFTs should be repeated at 2 and 4 weeks after commencing ART to detect evidence of 
hepatotoxicity or immune re constitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and then monitored 
regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. 1C 
7.1.3 Because there is no evidence of any adverse effect on maternal or neonatal health if women 
become pregnant while taking ART dually active against HBV, treatment should be continued. 1C 
7.1.4 Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine or lamivudine should form the backbone of an antiretroviral 
regimen in treatment -naïve patients with wild -type HIV/HBV co -infection and no 
contraindication to any of these drugs. 1B 
7.1.5 If tenofovir DF is not currently pa rt of cART it should be added or tenofovir alafenamide 
/emtricitbine can be added after the first trimester . 1B 
7.1.6 Lamivudine/emtricitabine may be omitted from the antiretroviral regimen and tenofovir DF 
given as the sole anti -HBV agent if there is cl inical or genotypic evidence of 
lamivudine/emtricitabine -resistant HBV. 1C 
7.1.7 Lamivudine or emtricitabine should not be used as the only active drug against HBV in cART 
because of the likelihood of emergent HBV resistance to these agents. 1B 
7.1.8 Emtricitabine has potentially increased antiviral benefits compared to lamivudine, appears to be 
equally safe during pregnancy and hence is the preferred option to be given with tenofovir DF in 
women with HBV and HIV. 2D 
7.1.9 In all HAV non-immune women with HBV and HIV, HAV vaccination is recommended, after the 
first trimester as per the normal schedule (0 and 6 months); 1A 
 unless the CD4 cell count is <300 cells/mm3, when an additional dose (0, 1 and 6 months) may 
be indicated. 1D BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

7.1.10 cART active against both HBV and HIV should be continued postpartum in all women with HBV 
and HIV. 1A 
7.1.11 Hepatitis flares that occur after delivery should be managed conservatively with careful 
monitoring. 2D 
7.1.12 In the absence of obstetric complications, normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if the 
woman has fully suppressed HIV viral load on cART, irrespective of HBV viral load. 1C 
7.1.13 Neonatal immunisation with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) should commence 
within 24 hours of delivery. The national infant HBV schedule should then be followed. 1A 
7.2 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
7.2.1 On diagnosis of new HCV infection, confirmation of HCV viraemia with quantitative RNA and 
genotype, assessment of hepatic inflammation/fibrosis and liver function and concomitant liver 
disease should be performed. 1C 
7.2.2 LFTs should be repeated a t 2 and 4 weeks after commencing ART to detect evidence of 
hepatotoxicity or IRIS and then monitored regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. 1C 
7.2.3 Women with both HCV and HIV should not be treated for HCV with ribavirin -based directly 
acting an tiviral (DAA) therapies, and all women who discover they are pregnant while receiving 
treatment should discontinue HCV therapy immediately. 1B 
7.2.4 Women with both HCV and HIV of child -bearing age wishing to become pregnant should be 
expedited to have DAA -based HCV therapy. 2D 
7.2.5 Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all women with both HCV and HIV after the first 
trimester, unless already i mmune. 1C 
7.2.6 In all HAV non -immune women with both HCV and HIV, HAV vaccination is recommended, after 
the first trimester as per the normal schedule (0 and 6 months); 1A 
 unless the CD4 cell count is <300 cells/mm3, when an additional dose (0, 1 and 6 months) may 
be indicated. 1D 
7.2.7 In the absence of obstetric complications, normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if the 
woman is receiving effective cART for HIV, irrespective of HCV viral load. 2C

Section 8. Obstetric management 
8.1 Antenatal management 
8.1.1 Fetal ultrasound imaging should be performed as per national guidelines regardless of maternal 
HIV status. 1D 
8.1.2 The combined screening test for fetal aneuploidies and non -invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for 
those who screen as high risk is recommended as this has the best sensitivity and specificity and 
will minimise the number of women who may need invasive testing. 1A 
8.1.3 Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the 
woman is known, and should ideally be deferred until HIV viral load has been adequately 
suppressed to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1C 
8.1.4 If not on cART and the invasive diagnostic test procedure cannot be delayed until viral 
suppression is achieved, it is recommended that women should commence cART to include 
raltegravir and be given a single dose of nevirapine 2 –4 hours prior to the procedure. 1D 
8.1.5 External cephalic version (ECV) can be offered to women with plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL. 2D 
8.2 Mode of delivery 
For women taking cART, a decision regarding recommended mode of delivery should be made after review of 
plasma HIV viral load re sults at 36 weeks. 
8.2.1 For women with a plasma viral load of <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, and in the absence 
of obstetric contraindications, planned vaginal delivery should be supported. 1C 
8.2.2 For women with a plasma viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, pre -labour CS 
(PLCS) should be considered, taking into account the actual viral load, the trajectory of the viral 
load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, obstetric fac tors and the woman’s views. 1C 
8.2.3 Where the viral load is ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, PLCS is recommended. 1C 
8.2.4 In women for whom a vaginal delivery has been planned and labour has commenced, obstetric 
management should follow the same g uidelines as for the HIV -negative population, apart from 
duration of ruptured membranes (see section 8.3). 1C 
8.2.5 Vaginal birth after CS (VBAC) can be offered to women with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1D 
8.2.6 Where the indication for CS is the prevention of vertical transmission, CS should be undertaken 
at between 38 and 39 weeks’ gestation. 1C 
 Where PLCS is undertaken only for obstetric indications and plasma viral load is <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, the usual o bstetric considerations apply and the CS will usually be performed after 
39 weeks’ gestation. 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
16 
 
8.3 Management of SROM 
8.3.1 In all cases of term pre -labour SROM, delivery within 24 hours should be the aim. 1C 
8.3.2 If maternal HIV viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate induction or augmentation of 
labour is recommended in women who have pre -labour SROM, with a low threshold for 
treatment of intrapartum pyrexia. Obstetric management should aim for delivery within 24 
hours of SROM. 1C 
8.3.3 For women with SROM and a last measured plasma viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA copies/mL, 
immediate CS is recommended, but should take into account the actual viral load, the trajectory 
of the viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, obstetric factors and the 
woman’s views. 1C 
8.3.4 For women with SROM and maternal HIV viral load ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate CS is 
recommended. 1C 
8.3.5 The management of preterm SROM at ≥34 weeks is the same as that of term SROM, except that 
women at 34 –37 weeks’ gestation will require group B streptococcus prophylaxis in line with 
national guidelines. 1C 
8.3.6 When premature SROM occurs at <34 weeks: 
• Intramuscular steroids should be administered in accordance with national guidelines; 
• Where HIV viral load is not controlled, this should be optimised; 
• There should be multidisciplinary discussion about the timing and mode of delivery. 1C 
8.4 Use of i ntrapartum intravenous infusion of zidovudine 
8.4.1 Intrapartum intravenous zidovudine infusion is recommended in the following circumstances: 
 For women with a viral load >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL plasma who present in labour or with 
SROM or who are admit ted for PLCS. 1C 
 For untreated women presenting in labour or with SROM in whom the current viral load is not 
known; 1C 
 The use of intrapartum intravenous zidovudine infusion can be considered in women on cART 
with a plasma HIV viral load between 50 and 1000 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1C 
8.5 Place of birth 
8.6.1 All women living with HIV are recommended to give birth in a facilit y that has direct access to 
paediatric care (i.e. a co -located birth centre or obstetric unit). 1D BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
17 
 
8.6 Water birth 
8.7.1 There is scant safety evidence to support water births in women living with HIV; however, 
women who choose a water birth should be supported to achieve this where the viral load is 
<50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1D 
Section 9. Neonatal management 
9.1 Infant PEP 
See Appendix 3 for dosing recommendations 
9.1.1 VERY LOW RISK 1C 
 Two weeks of zidovudine monotherapy is recommended if all the following criteria are met: 
• The woman has been on cART for longer than 10 weeks; 
AND 
• Two documented maternal HIV viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL during pregnancy at 
least 4 weeks apart; 
AND 
• Maternal HIV viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at or after 36 weeks. 
9.1.2 LOW RISK 1C 
 Extend to 4 weeks of zidovudine monotherapy: 
• If the criteria in 9.1.1 are not all fulfilled but maternal HIV viral load is <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL at or after 36 weeks; 
• If the infant is born prematurely (<34 weeks) but most recent maternal HIV viral load is 
<50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
9.1.3 HIGH RISK 1C 
 Use combination PEP if maternal birth HIV viral load is known to be or likely to be >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL on day of birth, if uncertainty about recent maternal adherence or if viral load is not 
known. 
9.1.4 Neonatal PEP should be commenced as soon as possible after birth, and at least within 4 hours. 1D 
9.1.5 In the context of known maternal resistance to zidovudine with VERY LOW or LOW RISK, 
zidovudine monotherapy is still recommended for infant PEP. 1D 
9.1.6 If HIGH RISK (combination PEP indicated) and there is a history of documented maternal 
zidovudine and/or nevirapine resistance, seek expert advice. If advice is not immediately 
available, commence standard three -drug PEP (zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) until 
guidance is provided. 1D BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
18 
 
9.1.8 Infant PEP and HIV -2 
9.1.8 If a woman is known to have HIV -2 infection, follow the above advice as for HIV infant PEP but if 
HIGH RISK (combination PEP indicated) nevirapine will not be effective. Seek expert advice. If 
advice is not immediately availab le, commence zidovudine , lamivudine and raltegravir until 
guidance is available (see Appendix 3). 2C 
9.1.9 Infant PEP beyond 4 weeks 
9.1.9 Infant PEP should not be given beyond 2 weeks for VERY LOW -RISK or 4 weeks for LOW -RISK 
infants even if the infant is breastfed . 1C 
 PEP should not be restarted unless significant subsequent exposure (e.g. maternal viral load 
detectable during breastfeeding). Seek expert advice regarding need for PEP following breast 
milk exposure during an episode of maternal viraemia. 1D 
9.2 Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis 
9.2.1 Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended from 1 month of age if HIV PCR screening is 
positive at any stage or if the infant is confirmed to be diagnosed with HIV. This should only be 
stopped if HIV infection is subsequently excluded. 1C 
9.3 Immunisation 
9.3.1 Immunisations should be given as per the national schedule outlined in the Green Book. 1C 
9.3.2 Rotavirus vaccine is not contraindicated (unless HIV diagnosis has been confirmed and infant is 
severely immunosuppressed). 1C 
9.3.3 If there is VERY LOW or LOW RISK of HIV transmission and BCG at birth is indicated as per UK 
guidelines, this should not be delayed. 1D 
9.4 Infant feeding 
9.4.1 In the UK and other high -income settings, the safest way to feed infants born to women with 
HIV is with formula milk, as there is no on -going risk of HIV exposure after birth. We therefore 
continue to recommend that women living with HIV feed their babies with formula milk (but 
see also section 9.4.4) . 1D 
9.4.2 Abstaining from breastfeeding can have financial and psychological repercussions for women, 
requiring support from the HIV MDT. 1C 
 Women advised not to breastfeed for their baby’s health should be provided with free formula 
feed to minimise vertical transmission of HIV. 1D 
9.4.3 Suppression of lactation 
9.4.3 Women not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of viral load >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, should be offered cabergoline to suppress lactation. 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
19 
 
9.4.4 Choosing to breastfeed in the UK 
9.4.4 Women who are virologically suppressed on cART with good adherence and who choose to 
breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should be informed about the low risk of 
transmission of HIV through breastfeedin g in this situation and the requirement for extra 
maternal and infant clinical monitoring. 1D 
 When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic 
for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 months after stoppin g breastfeeding. 1D 
 Maternal cART (rather than infant pre -exposure prophylaxis [PrEP ]) is advised to minimise HIV 
transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the woman’s health. 1D 
9.5 Diagnosis of infant HIV status 
9.5.1 Non-breastfed infants 
9.5.1.1 Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on the following occa sions: 1C 
 • During the first 48 hours and prior to hospital discharge; 
• At 6 weeks (or at least 2 weeks after cessation of infant prophylaxis*); 
• At 12 weeks (or at least 8 weeks after cessation of infant prophylaxis*); 
• On other occasions if additional risk including at 2 weeks of age if HIGH RISK at delivery . 
*BHIVA guidelines on duration of PEP have changed for VERY LOW -RISK infants (see section 8.1 ). 
9.5.1.2 Antibody testing 
 • If the mother’s antibody status is not documented, an HIV antibody test should be 
performed on the first sample received from the infant . 
• HIV antibody testing for seroreversion should be checked at age 22–24 months. 
• Although an HIV antibody test may be negative before this time, engagement in care 
with follow -up of the infant should continue until at least 18 months of age . 
9.5.2 Breastfed infants 
9.5.2.1 Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on the following occasions: 
 • During the first 48 hours and prior to hospital discharge; 1C 
 • At 2 weeks of age; 1D 
 • Monthly for the duration of breastfeeding; 1D 
 • At 4 and 8 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding . 1D 
9.5.2.2 Antibody testing 
• If the mother’s antibody status is not documented, an HIV antibody test should be 
performed on the first sample received from the infant. 
• HIV antibody testing for seroreversion should be checked at age 22–24 months , or at a 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

minimum of 8 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding, if this is later. Engagement in care 
should continue until this time . 
9.5.3 Management of infant s diagnosed with HIV 
 • Infants with a positive test for HIV should be started on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis from 
4 weeks of age . 
 • Infants with a positive test for HIV should be referred urgently to a specialist centre for 
management of HIV according to Children’s HIV As sociation ( CHIVA ) and Paediatric 
European Network for Treatment of AIDS (Penta ) guidelines . 
 • A positive HIV diagnosis in an infant should be fed back to the obstetric unit where the infant 
was born to allow investigation of any avoidable factors in transmission .

9.6.1 Follow national guidance for management of maternal HBV in pregnancy and for prevention of 
transmission of HIV to the infant (see also section 7.1). 1D 
9.6.2 Follow usual practice for investigation and management of maternal HCV in pregnancy (see also 
section 7.2). 1D 
9.7 HIV exposed but uninfected (HEU) 
9.7.1 In light of evidence for possible increased infectious morbidity in HIV exposed but uninfected

3. Introduction 
A key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimise a woman’s own health. Furthermore, one 
of the major successes in the management of individuals living with HIV has been the prevention of vertical 
transmission of HIV. With the widesprea d implementation of routine antenatal screening for HIV, vertical 
transmission is now a rare occurrence in the UK. Despite few recent randomised controlled trials of the use of ART 
in pregnancy or obstetric intervention, practice continues to evolve. This is largely informed by observational 
data, theoretical considerations and expert opinion. 
At the outset, the aim of the writing group was to make these guidelines as clinically relevant and as practical as 
possible. The writing group drew up a list of ques tions reflecting day -to-day practice and queries. It was 
acknowledged that the level of evidence for many of these topics was poor but recognised that there was a need 
to provide guidance. These guidelines have expanded on all areas relevant to the managem ent of HIV in 
pregnancy and the postpartum period. The guidelines are intended to inform and aid healthcare workers in the 
management of pregnancy in the context of HIV. They are not intended to be prescriptive or restrictive and it is 
recognised that situ ations will arise where the optimum management may deviate from these recommendations 
and new data will emerge to better inform practice. We recognise that a small number of trans and non -binary 
people living with HIV will also experience pregnancy. We use the term ‘woman’ or ‘women’ in these guidelines 
for brevity, on the understanding that guidance also applies to trans and non -binary individuals. 
Particular areas of focus have been psychosocial, infant feeding, neonatal and postnatal management. We have 
expanded, renamed and moved the section on the psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and after 
pregnancy. We have emphasised the need for antenatal HIV care to be delivered by an MDT, the precise 
composition of which will vary. We have also rec ommended that assessment of antenatal and postnatal 
depression be undertaken at booking, and 4 –6 weeks postpartum and 3 –4 months postpartum in accordance 
with NICE guidelines. We have updated infant feeding advice to include new data on breastfeeding and t he 
emotional impact that not breastfeeding may have on a woman. We discuss the use of cabergoline in non -
breastfeeding women. Length of infant PEP has been stratified according to risk of transmission being VERY LOW, 
LOW or HIGH according to maternal viral load and ART. PEP has been shortened to 14 days where risk of vertical 
transmission is VERY LOW. We have added a section on the postpartum management of women living with HIV. 
An increasing number of women are aiming for and achieving a vaginal delivery b ut the rate of emergency CSs has 
increased. It is hoped that the recommendations contained within these guidelines will enable a further increase 
in the proportion of vaginal deliveries and a reduction in the number of emergency CSs. Linked to this is the 
proposed starting gestation for women temporarily taking combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in 
pregnancy, which has been brought forward depending on baseline viral load. It is anticipated that this will result 
in a larger proportion of women achiev ing a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL by 36 weeks’ gestation, thereby 
allowing them to plan for a vaginal delivery. 
Additional guidance has been provided with regard to conception on cART, the choice of specific drugs or drug 
classes and the management of women with HBV or HCV co -infection. For the first time these guidelines have 
addressed the issue of continuation of cART postpartum in women. The paediatric section provides further 
guidance on infant PEP, drug dosing and safety. There is a clear urgent n eed for neonatal preparations for a wider 
variety of antiretroviral drugs because the current options, particularly in the case of maternal viral resistance, are 
limited. 
In key areas, the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC) informs t he management of HIV in 
pregnancy through comprehensive data collection, collation and analysis, and the need to interrogate the data 
continues as practice changes. 
3.1 UK prevalence and epidemiology of HIV in pregnancy, antenatal screening and 
risk of tra nsmission 
Information about the management, epidemiology and outcome of HIV in pregnancy in the UK is available from BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
24 
 
the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC: www.ucl.ac.uk/nshpc ). Other vital data sources 
are Public Health England’s HIV surveillance systems ( www.gov.uk/government/collections/hiv -surveillance -data -
and-management ) and the NHS infectious diseases in pregnancy screening (IDPS) programme 
(www.gov.uk/topic/population -screening -programmes/infectious -diseases -in-pregnancy ). 
Prevalence of HIV among women giving birth in the UK was monitored for over 20 years through an unlinked 
anonymous survey, based on residual neonatal dried blood spots, which provided an estimate of HIV prevalence 
in women giving birth regardless of whether they had bee n diagnosed [1]. By 2011, the last year for which data 
were published, the survey covered about 400,000 births in England, and prevalence overall was 2.2 per 1000 
women giving birth, and highest in London at 3.5 per 1000. When the sur vey was discontinued in Scotland in 
2008, prevalence was about 0.9 per 1000 women. Among women from sub -Saharan Africa giving birth, overall 
prevalence was relatively stable in the last 10 years of the survey at 2 –3%; among UK -born women there was a 
gradua l increase over the decade from 0.3 to 0.5 per 1000 [2]. 
National data on HIV in the general population show that around 20,000 women were living with diagnosed HIV in 
England in 2016, and an estimated 1300 with undiagnosed infection [3]. Betw een 2012 and 2016 the number of 
women diagnosed each year with HIV in the UK declined from around 1700 to 1200, and this was particularly 
marked among women from sub -Saharan Africa. The number of diagnosed pregnant women reported to the 
NSHPC also declined from a peak of over 1450 in 2010 to around 1100 in 2015, and a little lower in 2016; about 
three -quarters of women are from sub -Saharan Africa and around 15% were born in the UK or Ireland [4]. 
Major progress has been made in the UK, as elsewhere, in reducing the rate of vertical transmission of HIV. In 
1993, when interventions were virtually non -existent, the vertical transmission rate among diagnosed women 
was 25.6% [5]. In the mid -1990s only about one -third of pregnant women living with HIV were diagnosed, and 
most of these women were aware of their status before they became pregnant, with very few being diagnos ed 
antenatally. Once interventions to reduce the risk of vertical transmission were available it became clear that 
antenatal screening and early detection of maternal infection was vital; the universal offer and recommendation 
of antenatal HIV testing was introduced in England in 2000 and throughout the UK by 2002. National uptake rates 
improved year on year, and uptake has exceeded 97% since 2011 [6]. Antenatal scre ening guidance for 
laboratories and healthcare providers is regularly updated and available at 
www.gov.uk/government/collections/infectio us-diseases -in-pregnancy -screening -clinical -guidance . 
Between 2000 and 2006, with high antenatal detection rates and uptake of effective interventions, the overall 
transmission rate from diagnosed women was 1.2%, and less than 1% among women who had receiv ed at least 
14 days of ART. Among more than 2000 women delivering on cART with an undetectable viral load, there were 
only three transmissions (transmission rate 0.1%) [7]. These very low transmission rates persist, reducing to an 
estimated 0.57% [8] in 2007 –2011, and 0.27% in 2012 –2014 [9]. In 2012 –2014, 85% of deliveries were to women 
who already knew their HIV status before they became pregnant, and about 50% of women were having a second 
or subsequent baby si nce their HIV diagnosis. Almost all women received cART during pregnancy, while the 
proportion conceiving on cART has increased from 40% in 2007 –2011 to 60% in 2012 –2014. The proportion of 
vaginal deliveries also increased, from 37% to 46%, but emergency C S rates remain high, at around 20 –25% of 
deliveries [4,9] . An increasing proportion of pregnancies are in women aged over 40, rising from 2% in 2000 –2004 
to 9% in 2010 –2014 [10], and at the same time a growi ng cohort of pregnant women with perinatally acquired 
HIV is emerging [11]. 
3.2 HIV infection in children 
The number of children (aged under 16) diagnosed with vertically acquired HIV infection in the UK increased from 
around 70 diagnoses a year in the early 1990s to a peak of 164 in 20 03, and then declined to 74 in 2011 and 29 in 
2015 [3]. 
During the last decade about two -thirds of children newly diagnosed in the UK were born abroad. However, 
despite the high uptake of antenatal screening and effective interventions, perinatal infections still occur in the 
UK. The number remained stable at about 30 –40 a yea r between 2001 and 2007. However, as the total number of 
births to women living with HIV stabilised and then declined, and uptake and impact of screening and 
interventions improved, this number reduced substantially; it is now fewer than five per year [3,9] . BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

demonstrated that over two -thirds of these infants were born to women who had not been diagnosed prior to 
delivery [12]. About half of these undiagn osed women had declined antenatal testing. A smaller proportion had 
tested negative and had presumably seroconverted in pregnancy, or while still breastfeeding. The findings of a 
subsequent UK audit of perinatal transmissions between 2006 and 2013 were sim ilar, although the number of 
transmissions (108 identified by the end of March 2014) had substantially reduced [13]. Both audits also revealed 
that a high proportion of these women faced multiple issues such as comorbidities, insecure accommodation, 
immigration concerns, intimate partner violence and other challenging social circumstances during and after 
pregnancy, and required multidisciplinary support. 
Among children living with HIV with follow -up care in the UK and Ireland, the rate of AIDS and mortality combined 
declined from 13.3 cases per 100 person -years before 1997 to 2.5 per 100 person -years in 2003 –2006 [14]. With 
improving survival, the median a ge of children in follow -up increased from 5 years in 1996 to 12 years in 2010, 
and over 800 young people had transferred to adult care by the end of 2015 [4]. 
3.3 Reporting and long -term follow -up 
Aggregated data tables from the UK and Ireland of antiretroviral exposure and congen ital malformations are 
regularly sent to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR). 
Individual prospective reports should also be sent to the APR antenatally with postnatal follow -up (Antiretroviral 
Pregnancy Registry Research Park, 1011 Ashes Drive, Wi lmington, NC 28405, USA; UK Tel: 0800 5913 1359; 
Fax: 0800 5812 1658; for forms visit: www.apregistry.com ). 
3.4 National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC) 
NSHPC is the surveillance system for obstetric and paediatric HIV for the UK and Ireland, based at the UCL Great 
Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London. Children living with HIV and children born to women living with 
HIV are reported through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child 
Health, or in the case of some units with large caseloads direct to the NSHPC. Diagnosed pregnant women are 
reported prospectively through a parallel reporting scheme originally es tablished under the auspices of the Royal 
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Longer -term data on infected children are subsequently collected 
through the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS). It is the responsibility of clinicians caring fo r women living 
with HIV and their children to report cases prospectively to the NSHPC. For further information see the NSHPC 
website ( see section 3.1 ) or the CHIPS website ( www.chipscohort.ac.uk/ ), or email the NSHPC ( nshpc@ucl.ac.uk ).

4. The psychosocial care of women living with HIV during and 
after pregnancy 
4.1 Psychosocial issues around HIV and pregnancy 
4.1.1 Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT). 1D 
4.1.2 We recommend that pregnant women living with HIV are offered peer support where available. 1B 
First, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of women living with HIV engage well in care during 
pregnancy, resulting in the low rates of vertical transmission outlined in section 3. This is to be celebrated. 
Furthermore, for many women pregnancy and early motherhood is a joyful time. However, some wom en may 
experience psychosocial challenges during and/or after pregnancy. Trans women and non -binary individuals may 
experience challenges as a result of stigma and discrimination (including within healthcare services), and the lack 
of trans -inclusive anten atal and obstetric services [1]. Therefore they may require particular support. 
HIV is associated with a higher risk of poor mental health [2]. Data from the UK -based ASTRA study reveal that the 
prevalence of depressive symptoms among women living with HIV is nearly 30% [3]. Furthermore, women may 
experience significant psychosocial barriers to accessing HIV care such as HIV -related stigma, unemployment and 
lack of financial resources. It is therefore important to be aware that pregnancy and the postpartum period may 
precipitate new psychosocial issues, or indeed exacerbate existing issues, among women living with HIV [4]. A 
recent national review of vertical transmissions has identified psychosocial issues such as immigration and HIV -
related sti gma as key contributing factors [5]. 
According to a systematic review of HIV and perinatal mental health, the prevalence of postnatal depression 
(PND) among women living with HIV i n high -income settings is reported to be between 30% and 53% [6]. In the 
studies that include an HIV -negative comparison group, there was no evidence of an association between HIV 
status and PND [6]. Factors associated with PND in women living with HIV include past history of mental health 
issues, financial, immigration and housing concerns, lack of social support, HIV -related stigma, intimate partner 
violence, substance misuse and lac k of support from a partner [6-8]. However there remains an abs ence of data 
on perinatal mental health among women living with HIV within a UK setting. Trial data on interventions targeting 
psychiatric and psychosocial outcomes in pregnant women living with HIV are also currently lacking [6]. 
The link between gender -based violence and HIV is well established [9]. As in the general population, women 
living with HIV may be at risk of intimate partner violence during pregnancy, with a lifetime pr evalence rate of 
intimate partner violence in pregnancy estimated to be 14% in women living with HIV in the UK [10]. We 
therefore fully endorse NICE antenatal guidelines recommending that all preg nant women be asked about 
domestic violence [11]. 
4.1.1 Social issues 
Many women living with HIV will have issues relating to social support and/or immigration. In both situations, it is 
important to identify the issues as early as possible so that women can be referre d for appropriate specialist 
advice and support. We therefore suggest that all pregnant women living with HIV are routinely asked about their 
social situation as early as possible during their pregnancy. 
Dispersal is an issue that may arise and is general ly felt to be inappropriate in pregnant women, especially in late 
pregnancy or soon after delivery [12-14]. Some short -term visitors to the UK and undocumented migrants are not 
eligible for free secondary care on the NHS; however, since 1 October 2012, individuals living with HIV have not 
had to meet any residency requirement in order to access treatment. Treatment for HIV is freely available to 
anyone regardless of immigration status, and no hospital should refuse HIV treatment to anyone living with HIV. 
 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
28 
 
Since October 2017, all antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal services are required by law to be considered 
‘immediately necessary’. Any service deemed ‘immediately necessary’ or ‘urgent’ cannot be denied to an 
individual regardless of ability to pay. However, people who are not eligible for free care on the NHS can be billed 
afterwards f or these services. 
Advice should be sought from colleagues, the General Medical Council ( GMC), British Medical Association and 
Medical Defence Organisations in difficult cases. Advice can also be sought from organisations such as the 
Terrence Higgins Trust ( www.tht.org.uk ) or the National AIDS Trust ( www.nat.org.uk ). You can also contact the 
Doctors of the World advice line (0207 515 7534) for advice on a ccess to healthcare in the UK. 
4.1.2 Psychosocial care 
A critical component in the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV is to facilitate a woman’s engagement in 
care from an MDT that can employ medical interventions and provide appropriate holistic support. Clinicians 
should be mindful that clinical experience indicates that the management of issues such as adjusting to an HIV 
diagnosis and uncertainty during pregnancy, and robust confidentiality processes, have an impact on adherence 
to ART and acce ptance of recommended interventions. Adherence to medication is of vital importance for the 
success of ART. Pregnant women may require extra support and planning in this area, especially if there are 
practical or psychosocial issues that may impact adverse ly on adherence. Referral to peer support workers, 
psychology support and telephone contact may all be considered [15]. Adherence can sometimes be suboptimal 
postpartum, resulting in viral load rebound [16]; early engagement in HIV care in the postpartum period has been 
shown to improve adherence [8]. 
Reassurance about confidentiality is extremely important, especially regarding family members and friends , who 
may not know the woman is living with HIV, but who are intimately involved with the pregnancy. Women from 
communities in which HIV is more common may be concerned about HIV ‘disclosure -by-association’ when 
discussing certain interventions, including taking medication during pregnancy, having a CS, and avoiding 
breastfeeding. Possible reasons such as the need to ‘take vitamins’, or having ‘obstetric complications’ and 
‘mastitis’ may help the women feel more confident in explaining the need for certain procedures to persistent 
enquirers [17]. For couples where a male partner is HIV negative, advice should be provided on condom use and 
PEP following sexual exposure if a woman does not have an undetectable viral load [18]. 
The importance of informing appropriate healthcare workers about HIV status should be emphasised to women 
as well as the need for HIV status to be included i n the birth plan wherever possible. This includes midwives, GPs, 
health visitors and paediatricians. The process of inpatient care should be explained clearly so that women can be 
supported in informing ward staff explicitly about maintaining confidentiali ty about HIV status, especially around 
visitors. 
4.1.3 The antenatal HIV MDT 
The minimum team should comprise an HIV specialist, obstetrician, specialist midwife and paediatrician, with the 
recommendation of peer and voluntary -sector support. All efforts should be made to involve the woman’s GP and 
health visitor, with her permission. It may be necessary to involve some of the following: patient advocates, social 
workers, legal advocates, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, health advisors, Citizens Advice Bureau 
workers, interpreters, community midwives, pharmacists, adult and paediatric clinical nurse specialists and health 
visitors [19]. 
In setti ngs with relatively few women living with HIV, it is still important to develop robust pathways of care with 
identified members of an MDT. Regular links, formal or informal, can also be established with a larger unit to 
provide advice and support as necess ary. Good communication is vital in view of the complexity of the issues 
involved. An early assessment of the social circumstances of a woman given a new diagnosis of HIV is important. 
Patients who initially decline interventions or disengage from follow -up need to be identified and actively 
followed up. 
Support by trained peer support workers is a valuable component of the care of a woman living with HIV and 
should continue into the postpartum period. Peer Mentor Mother programmes to support women living w ith HIV 
during pregnancy are well established in the UK and internationally, with positive multidimensional impacts on 
vulnerable women and improvements in clinical outcomes (such as adherence, prevention of vertical transmission BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
29 
 
interventions and lower ra tes of depression) in randomised controlled trials [20,21] . Many newly diagnosed 
pregnant women are initially reluctant to engage with peer support because of f ears around confidentiality; 
however, the great majority of women who do engage find that it becomes one of the most highly valued 
interventions [22,23] . We therefore strongly recommend that pregnant women are offered peer support. More 
informatio n on Mentor Mothers is available at positivelyuk.org and salamandertrust.net. 
4.1.4 The psychosocial care of women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy 
Women diagnosed with HIV for the first time during pregnancy may experience significant psychosoci al stress and 
trauma as a result of the diagnosis in the context of pregnancy, and will therefore require the support of an MDT 
of experienced carers. A new HIV diagnosis may precipitate a complex mix of emotional, psychosocial, 
relationship, economic and, sometimes, legal issues. The newly diagnosed pregnant woman also has a relatively 
brief time in which to develop trust in her medical carers and attain sufficient medical knowledge of her situation 
to be able to make informed decisions that will affect he r long -term health, as well as that of her baby and her 
partner. In the case of newly diagnosed HIV in pregnancy, prompt linkage to HIV care is beneficial [24], as is the 
offer of psychological support soon after an antenatal HIV diagnosis [25]. 
Confidence in telling others about an HIV diagnosis will vary from woman to woman, and there may be cultural 
factors that influenc e the patterns of telling partners and other social network members [19,26] . Talking about 
HIV should be encouraged in all women but should be viewed as a process that may take some time [27,28] . 
Talking about HIV to a family member, other than a sexual partner, should be encouraged as this has been 
demonstrated to reduce levels of postnatal depression [29]. There are situations in which a woman given a new 
diagnosis of HIV may be reluctant to share this with a current sexual partner, or appears to want to delay telling 
indefinitely. This can give rise to complex professional, ethical, moral and, potentially, legal situations. There is a 
conflict between the duty of confidentiali ty to the index patient and a duty to prevent harm to others. Breaking 
confidentiality in order to inform a sexual partner of the index patient’s positive HIV status is sanctioned as a ‘last 
resort’ by the World Health Organization (WHO) [30] and GMC [31]. However, it is not to be t aken lightly as it 
could have the negative impact of deterring others from testing because of the fear of forced imparting of HIV 
status and loss of trust by patients in the confidential doctor –patient relationship. Cases with challenging issues 
around sha ring of HIV status should be managed by the MDT. It is important to accurately record discussions and 
management strategy in these cases. Timely partner testing during the pregnancy should be encouraged where 
possible and support given. 
HIV testing of exis ting children should be raised with all women. In practice, if the children are asymptomatic the 
testing is often most easily done when the newborn is attending paediatric follow -up for HIV diagnostic tests [32]. 
4.2 Perinatal mental health assessment 
4.2 Assessment of antenatal and postnatal depression should be undertaken at booking, and 4 –6 
weeks postpartum and 3 –4 months postpartum in accordance with National Institute for 
Care and Health Excellence ( NICE) guidelines. 1D 
We advise that HIV MDTs follow existing NICE guidance on the detection of antenatal and postnatal depression 
[33]. This includes identifying women with past or present severe mental health illness including previous history 
of postnatal psychosis. These women shou ld be managed in conjunction with a perinatal mental health team. 
Assessment of mental health should occur at antenatal booking, postnatally at 4 –6 weeks, and then again at 3 –4 
months. This should include asking the following questions: 
1. During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? 
2. During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing 
things? 
If a woman answers 'yes' to either of the initial questions, consider asking a third question: 
3. Is this something you feel you need or want help with? 
As per the general antenatal population, if a mental health problem is suspected as a result of answers to these 
questions, we advise further assessment in accordance with NICE guidance, and prompt liaison with perinatal BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
30 
 
mental health services, or the patient’s GP, and/or voluntary groups as appropriate.

5. Screening and monitoring of pregnant women living with HIV 
5.1 Sexual health screening 
5.1.1 Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV. 1B 
5.1.2 For women living with HIV and alrea dy engaged in HIV care who become pregnant, sexual 
health screening is suggested. 2C 
5.1.3 Genital tract infections should be treated according to British Association for Sexual Health and 
HIV (BASHH) guidelines. 1B 
There are limited data regarding the prevalence of genital infections in pregnant women living with HIV in the UK. 
Studies of pregnant women living with HIV in London and Slough found a prevalence of bacterial sexually 
transmitted infection (STIs) of 0 –4% and of bacterial vaginosis (BV) of 1 –4% [1-3]. A London cohort study found 
that STI diagnosis was associated with an antenatal HIV diagnosis, disclosing additional sexual partners during 
pregnancy, nulliparity, a shorter relationship duration and a partner of unknown HIV status [1]. 
The diagnosis and treatment of genital infections in any individual have clear benefits in terms of both individual -
level morbidity and possible onward transmission to sexual partners. In pregnancy, the welfare of the baby is an 
additional issue. However, apart from the recommendation that all pregnant women should be screened for HIV, 
HBV and syphilis, asymptomatic HIV -negative pregnant women in the UK are not routinely screened for genital 
infections [4]. In pregnant women who are living with HIV, an additional consideration is the potential effects of 
the presence of a genital infection on vertical transmission of HIV. This could occur through an increase in the HIV 
viral load in the genital tract and/or the presence of chorioamnionitis. In addition, certain infections may be linked 
to premature birth, an event that occurs more frequently in women living with HIV when compared to HIV -
negative women. An American study demonstrated that despite 96.9% of pre gnant women living with HIV taking 
ART, a concomitant STI doubled the risk of spontaneous preterm birth [5]. 
It has long been recognised that genital infections, in particular ulcerative diseases, are associated with an 
increased risk of sexual transmission of HIV [6-8]. This may be a consequence of an increase in local HIV 
replication resulting in a higher viral load in genital secretions , secondary to the presence of specific 
microorganisms, and/or ulceration and inflammation [9,10] . Organisms assoc iated with BV have been shown to 
stimulate HIV expression in vitro [11,12] . Studies from Kenya h ave demonstrated a reduction in cervical mucosal 
shedding of HIV RNA following treatment of gonococcal, chlamydial and non -specific cervicitis [13,14] . In the 
setting of full virological suppression on cART it is unclear to what extent, if any, the presence of any genital 
infection will contribute to the vertical transmission of HIV. 
Viral load in cervicovaginal specimens has been shown to correlate wit h vertical transmission of HIV [15]. Genital 
tract HIV viral load will usually mirror the plasma HIV viral load [16], but there is increasing evidence of 
compartmentalisation of HIV between the plasma and genital tract. Genital tract HIV has been detected in 
women with an undetectable pla sma viral load [17,18] and genetic diversity of virus from the two compartments 
has been reported [19]. A number of factors may be responsible for this, including differential drug penetration 
into body compartments and the presence of genital tract infections. With increasing numbers of women in the 
UK aiming for and achieving a vaginal delivery, an increasing number of babies are exposed to the cervicovaginal 
secretions of women living with HIV. The clinical significance of this is not clear. Data from the UK and Ireland [20] 
and France [21] show no difference in vertical transmission associated with mode of delivery in women with an 
undetectable viral load, providing some reassurance that the potential discordance may not be clinically releva nt. 
5.1.1 Herpes simplex virus 
A systematic review has demonstrated a correlation between a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV -2) diagnosis and 
HIV vertical transmission (odds ratio [OR] 1.57). However, studies did not always adjust for key confounders such BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
33 
 
as ART use and mode of delivery [22]. 
Regarding the relationship between genital HSV -2 shedding and vertical transmission, a Thai study found an 
association between vertical transmission and HSV -2 shedding in cervicovaginal lavag e fluid at 38 weeks' 
gestation (OR 3.0), but this was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for ART use, maternal CD4 cell 
count, plasma viral load at delivery and cervicovaginal HIV viral load at 38 weeks (OR 2.3) [23]. Two other studies 
assessed shedding either at 10 –32 weeks' gestation or at delivery, but neither found an association with 
intrapartum or in utero transmission in univariate analyses [21,24] . 
For pregnant women receiving ART, data regarding the relationship between vertical transmission and HSV -2 are 
inconclusive. A Ukrainian study, in which 96% of women received antenatal ART (half receiving cART), found no 
evidence that HSV -2 seropositivity was associated with risk of vertical transmission of HIV in unadjusted analyses. 
In multivariable analyses, the only factor associated with vertical transmission of HIV was lack of antenatal ART, 
which was associated with a three -fold increased risk. However, due to the rela tively low HIV transmission risk (in 
comparison with earlier studies examining HSV and vertical transmission of HIV), the study was only powered to 
rule out a 2.25 -fold increased risk of vertical transmission of HIV with HSV -2 antibodies [25]. A Thai study of 
women living with HIV who were HSV -2 seropositive found that vertical transmission of H IV was not reduced by 
zidovudine treatment [23]. 
That there may still be an increased risk associated with HSV shedding with patients on cART is suggested by a 
randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled tr ial of herpes -suppressive therapy in women living with HIV and 
HSV-2 taking cART in Burkina Faso, which demonstrated that valaciclovir 500 mg bd further reduced genital HIV 
replication in those women with residual HIV shedding despite cART. However, vertic al transmission of HIV was 
not reviewed [26]. A study from the USA reported greater rates of HSV -2 shedding at delivery in HSV -2-
seropositive women with HIV compared to HIV -negative women (30.8% vs 9.5%). However, it is not clear whether 
any women we re receiving antiviral HSV suppressive therapy, or what proportion of women living with HIV was 
receiving ART [27]. 
The incremental benefit of providing HSV suppression in late pregnancy to women living with HIV with a previous 
diagnosis of genital HSV and who are taking cART needs further investigation. These women should be treated in 
line with the BASHH/RCOG guidelines, which recommend that women who are HIV antibody positive and have a 
history of genital herpes should be offered suppressive aciclovir 400 mg three times daily from 32 weeks of 
gestation, especially where a vaginal delivery is planned. This aims to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV 
infection, and to reduce HSV shedding and herpes recurrence at delivery [28]. 
5.1.2 Chorioamnionitis and BV 
Chorioamnionitis may lead to premature rupture of the membranes with the possibility of premature birth 
[29,30] . Chorioamnionitis, prolonged rupture of membranes and premature birth have all been associated with 
vertical transmission of HIV and may be interlinked [31-33]. However, a Phase 3 clinical trial of antibiotics to 
reduce chorioamnionitis -related perinatal HIV transmission showed no benefit in reducing vertical transmission in 
the context of single -dose nevirapine prophylaxis [34]. Although both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae have been associated with chorioamnionitis, the organisms usually implicated are those associated 
with BV including Ureaplasma urealyticum [35,36] . A strong association between BV and premature delivery has 
been reported [37,38] . There are data from Malawi that suggest that BV may be associated with an increased risk 
of maternal HIV acquisition in pregnancy as well as premature delivery and verti cal transmission of HIV [36]. A 
study in which women received zidovudine from 34 weeks of pregnancy reported that maternal fever >38°C and 
BV were associated with in utero transmission of HIV with 2.6 -fold and 3.0 -fold increased risks, respectively [39]. 
It is not known how applicable this is in settings in which women receive cART from earlier in pregnancy. 
In HIV -negative women, data regarding the effect of screening for and treating BV on premature delivery are 
conf licting. There are scant pre -cART data on women living with HIV, therefore BV should be treated as per 
BASHH guidelines ( www.bashh.org/guidelines ). 
5.1.3 STI screening 
In the setting of full virological sup pression on cART it is unclear to what extent, if any, the presence of any genital 
infection will contribute to the vertical transmission of HIV. Pregnant women newly diagnosed with HIV should be BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
34 
 
screened for STIs as per the routine management of newly dia gnosed patients [40]. For pregnant women living 
with HIV and already engaged in HIV care, in the absence of randomised controlled trials but for the reasons 
outlined above, the writing group suggests screening for genital tract infections including evidence of BV. This 
shoul d be done as early as possible in pregnancy and consideration should be given to repeating this at around 
28 weeks. Syphilis serology should be performed on both occasions. In addition, any infection detected should be 
treated according to the BASHH guide lines taking into account recommended treatment regimens in pregnancy, 
followed by a test of cure. Partner notification should take place where indicated, to avoid re -infection. 
5.1.4 Cervical cytology 
• With regard to cervical cytology, pregnant women livin g with HIV should be managed as per the guidelines for 
the NHS Cervical Screening Programme 2016 [41] and BASHH/BHIVA/FSRH Guidelines on the Sexual and 
Reproductive Healthcare of People Living with HIV [42]. Routine cytology should be reviewed but deferred 
until 3 months postpartum. 
• A woman referred with abnormal cytology should undergo colposcopy in late first or early second trimester 
unless there is a clinical contraindication. For low -grade changes triaged to colposcopy on the basis of a 
positive HPV test, the woman’s assessment may be delayed until after delivery. 
• If a previous colposcopy was abnormal and in the interim the woman becomes pregnant, the colposcopy 
should not be delayed. 
• If a pregnant woman requires colposcopy or cytology after treatment (or follow -up of untreated cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] grade 1), her assessment may be delayed until after deli very. However, unless 
there is an obstetric contraindication, assessment should not be delayed if the first appointment for follow -up 
cytology or colposcopy is due following treatment for cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia. 
• The ‘test of cure’ ap pointment should not be delayed after treatment for CIN2 or CIN3 with involved or 
uncertain margin status. In these circumstances if repeat cytology is due, and the woman has missed her 
appointment prior to pregnancy, cytology or colposcopy during pregnanc y can be considered. This should 
also be reviewed at the postnatal appointment (see section 10). 
5.1.5 Contraception 
A plan for contraception to be used postnatally should be discussed antenatally with each woman. Antiretrovirals 
may need to be changed pos tnatally to align with a woman’s choice of contraception. Further guidance on 
contraception in HIV can be found in the BASHH/BHIVA/FSRH Guidelines on the Sexual and Reproductive 
Healthcare of People Living with HIV [42]. 
5.2 Laboratory monitoring of pregnant women living with HIV 
5.2.1 Pregnant women who are newly diagnosed with HIV do not require any additional baseline 
investigations compared with non -pregnan t women living with HIV other than those routinely 
performed in the general antenatal clinic. 1D 
5.2.2 HIV resistance testing should be completed and results available prior to initiation of treatment 
[43], except for late -presenting women (after 28 weeks). Women should be encouraged to 
continue combination (c)ART post -delivery but, where they choose to stop cART, a further 
resistance test is recommended to ensure that mutations are not missed with reversion during 
the off -treatment period. 1D 
In the case of late -presenting women, cART, based on epidemiological assessment of resistance, should be 
initiated without delay and modified once t he resistance test is available. 
5.2.3 In women conceiving on cART there should be a minimum of one CD4 cell count at baseline and 
one at delivery. 2D 
5.2.4 In women who commence cART in pregnancy, a CD4 cell count should be performed as per 
routine init iation of cART with the addition of a CD4 count at delivery even if starting at CD4 >350 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
35 
 
cells/mm3. 
5.2.5 In women who commence cART in pregnancy, an HIV viral load should be performed 2 –4 weeks 
after commencing cART, at least once every trimester, at 36 weeks and at delivery. 1C 
Performing a viral load test at 2 weeks allows for a more rapid assessment of adherence and may be of particular 
benefit in a late -presenting woman. 
5.2.6 In women commencing cART in pregnancy, liver function tests (LFTs) should be performed as per 
routine initiation of cART and then with each routine blood test. 1C 
Hepatotoxicity may occur as a result of the initiation of cART and/or the development of obstetric complications 
such as obstetric cholestasis, pre -eclampsia, HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) 
syndrome and acute fatty liver. Close liaison with the obstetric team is recommended. 
5.2.1 Failure to suppress 
5.2.7 In the event that a woman who ha s initiated cART during pregnancy has not suppressed plasma 
viral load to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, the following interventions are recommended: 
• Review adherence (including a full exploration of potential impacting factors) and 
concomitant medication; 
• Perform resistance test if appropriate; 
• Consider therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM); 
• Optimise to best regimen; 
• Consider intensification. 1C 
For a woman who conceives on cART that is not fully suppressive or loses virological control during the pregnancy, 
these interventions should be undertaken as soon as possible. If treatment failure occurs when the infant is likely 
to be delivered prematurely and may be unable to take medication enterally, intensification should consist of 
therapies that readily cross th e placenta such as double -dose tenofovir DF, raltegravir and single -dose nevirapine.

6. Current issues in the use of ART in pregnancy and pregnancy 
outcomes 
6.1 Conceiving on cART 
6.1.1 It is recommended that women conceiving on an effective cART regimen should continue this 
treatment . 1B 
 Exceptions are: 
Non -standard regimens, for example PI monotherapy; 
Regimens that have been demonstrated to show lower pharmacokinetics in pregnancy such as 
darunavir/cobicistat and elvitegravir/cobicistat, or where there is an absence of 
pharmacokinetic data such as raltegravir 1200 mg once daily (od) (should be administe red 400 
mg twice daily [bd]). These should be modified to include (depending on tolerability, resistance 
and prior antiretroviral history) one or more agents that cross the placenta. 
A woman planning a pregnancy and/or conceiving on dolutegravir should se e her physician as 
soon as possible to discuss current evidence on neural tube defects (see section 6.5) . 2D 
6.1.2 Women taking dolutegravir who are trying to conceive or in the first trimester of pregnancy 
(<12 weeks’ gestation) should be recommended to take folic acid 5 mg od (see section 6.5) . 1B 
 Women on regimens that do not contain dolutegravir should take the standard recommended 
dose of folic acid 400 g once da ily, unless they meet the criteria for a higher dose of folic acid 
(see NICE guidance on m aternal and child nutrition : https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph11 ). 
It is recommended that all women start foli c acid supplementation before pregnancy and 
continue to 12 weeks’ gestation (the end of the first trimester). 
Despite the lack of a licence for the use of ART in pregnancy, with the exception of zidovudine in the third 
trimester, there is global consensus that women who conceive on effective cART should continue cART 
throughout pregnancy and then lifelong. Pregnant women are a unique group within the HIV population as 
treatment is relevant not on ly for their own health but also for that of the unborn child and risk of congenital 
abnormality must be considered when assessing cART in pregnancy. Therefore it may not always be appropriate 
to use standard adult treatment guidelines as recommended regim ens in pregnancy usually consist of triple 
therapy with less evidence for safety and efficacy of newer antiretrovirals and evolving combinations such as dual 
therapy and integrase inhibitors. 
As pregnancy is a temporary state, concerns about long -term toxi city of cART for a woman may not be relevant 
during pregnancy. After delivery cART may be switched to a regimen preferable for long -term use in terms of both 
toxicity and tolerability. Our recommendations are shown in Table 6.1. 
Table 6.1 . Recommended and alternative agents in pregnancy 
 Recommended Alternative 
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) backbone Abacavir/lamivudine 
Tenofovir DF/emtricitabine Tenofovir alafenamide/ 
emtricitabine (after the first 
trimester) 
Zidovudine/lamivudine BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
40 
 
Third agent Efavirenz 
Atazanavir/r Rilpivirine 
Darunavir/r 
Raltegravir 400 mg bd 
Dolutegravir (after 6 weeks’ 
gestation) 
 
The writing group recommends that choice of therapy should always be discussed in full with every woman and 
be individualised for the patient , taking into account a woman’s concerns and preferences [1], in accordance with 
the standard treatment guidelines. Nucleoside backbone combinations recommended by BHIVA for HIV in 
pregnancy include tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine. Pregnant women may also want to 
consider zidovudine/lamivudine [1]. Considerations for the backbone include side -effect profile, frequency of 
dosing, interactions with the third agent, adverse outcome profiles and prior cART experience including a 
resistance profile where available. The writing group recommends that wome n are advised against the 
combination of tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and lopinavir/r (especially high -dose lopinavir/r), which demonstrated 
an increased risk of neonatal death and prematurity in the randomised controlled PROMISE trial [2]. 
Although zidovudine remains the only antiretroviral agent with a licence for use in pregnancy, non -pregnant 
adults are now rarely prescribed zidovudine as part of cART due to concerns about toxicity. Despite its proven 
efficacy in preventing vertical transmission of HIV, particularly in the pre -cART era [3], there are no data to 
suppor t routinely switching to zidovudine, or adding zidovudine to a combination of antiretrovirals that is 
suppressing HIV viral load to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL in plasma. Analyses of data combined from two 
observational studies, the European Collaborative Study and the UK and Ireland NSHPC, have shown no difference 
in pregnancy outcomes between zidovudine -based and zidovudine -sparing cART [4]. 
Where the risk of treatment failure due to reduced or intermittent drug exposure with hyperemesis gravidarum 
exceeds the risk of tr eatment interruption , the writing group recommends that treatment is interrupted for the 
minim um time required to overcome the issue. If receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI) - or raltegravir -based cART , an additional resistance test may be performed. However, there are no data 
that specifically address this issue in pregnancy. 
6.2 Woman is not already on cART: when to start 
6.2.1 All pregnant women, including elite controllers, should start ART during p regnancy and be 
advised to continue lifelong treatment. 1A 
Current BHIVA treatment guidelines recommend treatment of all people living with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell 
count or clinical status [5]. Studies have shown that immediate initiation of cART improves clinical outcomes for 
patients, regardless of initial CD4 cell count, and reduces transmission of HIV among serodiscordant partners if 
the partner with HIV has an undetectable HIV viral load on cART [6-8]. All pregnant women living with HIV should 
be counselled about the importance of continuation of cART postpartum. 
6.2.1 Elite controllers 
As advice to commence lifelong cART when HIV is diagnosed applies to elite controller s (people with HIV who 
maintain an undetectable viral load and high CD4 counts without having to take ART), we no longer provide 
specific recommendations on treatment for elite controllers. 
6.2.2 All women not on cART should commence cART 
6.2.2 All women not on cART should commence cART 
• As soon as they are able to do so in the second trimester where the baseline viral load 
≤30,000 HIV RNA copies/mL; 
• At the start of the second trimester, or as soon as possible thereafter, in women with a 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
41 
 
baseline viral load of 30,000 –100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL; 
• Within the first trimester if viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL and/or CD4 cell count 
is less than 200 cells/mm3. 
All women should have commenced cART by week 24 of pregnancy. 
When determining the op timal time to start cART, the following must be considered: 
• The theoretical issues for avoiding medication during pregnancy, in particular the first trimester; 
• Evidence of risk of congenital abnormality following exposure to cART (see section 6.5); 
• Matern al health; 
• Risk of vertical transmission to the infant as determined by maternal viral load, whether cART is taken in 
pregnancy, and the time on cART prior to delivery. 
Major determinants of a woman suppressing to a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL by the time of delivery are the 
baseline untreated viral load and the time available to achieve this target. In both the UK and Ireland, and also the 
ANRS French Perinatal C ohort, vertical transmission was significantly associated with starting treatment later i n 
pregnancy. In the French cohort, the median duration of treatment was 9.5 weeks among women where vertical 
transmission occurred, compared with 16 weeks for non -transmission ( P<0.001) [9]. NSHPC data also show an 
increased risk of transmission in those initiating treatment beyond 30 weeks, compared to those starting 
earlier [10]. 
In the Mma Bana study, plasma HIV viral load at delivery <400 HIV RNA copies/mL was observed in 96% 
(lopinavir/r -based therapy) and 100% (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine) of women with baseline plasma viral load 
<1000 HIV RNA copies/ mL, and in 86% (lopinavir/r -based therapy) and 90% (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine) 
with a baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL. When therapy was initiated at 31 –34 weeks, viral 
suppression was seen in only 78% of women on PI -based therapy [11]. 
Data from a UK multicentre study retrospectively analysing outcomes in pregnant women initiating cART at a 
median gestation of 23 weeks demonstrated very low rates of virological suppression in women with a baseline 
viral load in the upper quartile (>32,641 HIV RNA copies/mL) with only 46% achieving <50 HIV RNA copies/mL by 
36 weeks’ gestation (the time point used to make most delivery management decis ions); this fell to 37% for 
baseline viral loads >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL [12]. For all viral loads >10,000 HIV RNA copies/mL, treatment 
initiation later than 20.3 weeks’ gestation was associated with significantly reduced likelihood of successful viral 
load suppression. 
Therefore, the writing group recommends that cART should be commenced as soon as possible in women with 
baseline viral load >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL, and at the start of the second trimester, or as soon as possible 
thereafter, in women with a baseline vi ral load between 30,000 and 100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
Deferring treatment to the start of the second trimester may be necessary if the woman is experiencing nausea 
and/or vomiting of pregnancy. However, where she is at risk of or has presented with an opp ortunistic infection, 
initiation of cART should not be delayed because of pregnancy, to protect both maternal and fetal health. 
All women should have commenced cART by week 24 of pregnancy. 
In women with a history of preterm delivery (PTD) it may be prude nt to start cART as soon as possible after the 
first trimester to maximise time on cART prior to delivery although there are no supporting data and avoidance of 
PIs associated with PTD may be considered (see section 6.6). 
6.3 Woman is not already on cART: what to start 
6.3.1 Women are recommended to start tenofovir DF or abacavir with emtricitabine or lamivudine as 
a nucleoside backbone. 2C 
6.3.2 It is recommended that the third agent in cART should be efavirenz or atazanavir/r, as these are 
agents with the most safety data in pregnancy. 1C 
 Rilpivirine (25 mg od), raltegravir (400 mg bd) or darunavir/r (600/100 mg bd) may be used as 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
42 
 
alternatives. 
 Darunavir/r should be prescribed at the twice daily dose (600/100 mg bd) if known resistance, 
and consideration should be given to using this higher dose if darunavir is initiated in 
pregnancy. 2C 
 Dolutegravir (50 mg od) may be considered from 6 weeks’ gestation which must be confirmed. 1C 
 Zidovudine monotherapy is not recommended and should only be used in women declining 
cART with a viral load of <10,000 HIV RNA copies/mL and willing to have a caesarean section 
(CS). 1A 
 Tenofovir alafenamide may be prescribed for women after the first trimester of pregnancy 1C 
 PI monotherapy, darunavir/cobicistat and elvitegravir/cobicistat are not recommended in 
pregnancy. 1C 
 
There is good evidence for the use of efavirenz in pregnancy; however, it is no longer a preferred regimen for 
ART-naïve patients in BHIVA and international guidelines for treatment of HIV in a dults. It may be prescribed to a 
pregnant woman for the duration of her pregnancy with a subsequent switch postpartum. Rilpivirine may be 
considered as an alternative. 
Ritonavir -boosted PIs are robust and may be employed where there are concerns about adhe rence. Atazanavir/r 
is recommended over darunavir/r and lopinavir/r which have an increased risk of preterm delivery. 
Raltegravir may also be used but must be dosed at 400 mg bd as there are no pharmacokinetic data to support 
the use of 1200 mg od in preg nancy. 
Dolutegravir is discussed in detail in section 6.5 and can be used only from 6 weeks’ gestation (which must be 
confirmed) until further data on the use of dolutegravir in pregnancy become available. 
The IMPAACT 2010 study compared the safety and vir ologic al efficacy of dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide v ersu s dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF v ersus efavirenz/ emtricitabine /tenofovir DF in 
pregnant women [13]. Overall, 643 pregnant women with HIV in nine countries were random ly assigned 1:1:1 to 
start open -label dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide (n=217), dolutegravir + 
emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (n=215) or efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (n=211) at 14–28 weeks ’ gestational 
age. Safety outcomes compared between all arms were : 
(i) composite adverse pregnancy outcome (PTD <37 weeks, small for gestational age [<10th centile ], stillbirth or 
spontaneous abortion ); 
(ii) maternal grade >3 adverse event up to 14 days postpartum; and 
(iii) infant grade >3 adverse event up to 28 days. 
Neonatal death ( <28 days) was also evaluated. Pregnancy outcomes were available for 640 women (99.5%). 
Fewer women in the dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide arm (24.1%) had an adverse pregnancy 
outcome than in the dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (32.9% ; P=0.043) or 
efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (3 2.7% ; P=0.047) arms. Although stillbirth occurred more frequen tly with 
dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide (3.7%) and dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (5.2%) 
than efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (1.9%) ( P-values ≥0.05; post -hoc), all cases were reviewed by 
investigators and not deemed to be due to investigational agents ( Waitt C, personal communication). Neonatal 
death occurred less frequent ly with dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide (1.0% ; P=0.019) than with 
dolute gravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (1.5% ; P=0.053) or efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (4.8%) . 
Maternal and infant adverse event outcomes were similar by arm. Therefore it is the conclusion of the writing 
group that tenofovir alafenamide may be prescribed for women living with HIV after the first trimester. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

The efficacy of zidovudine monotherapy for prevention of vertical transmission is well known; transmission rate 
for women treated with zidovudine monotherapy and assigned to PLCS was 0.8% in the Mode of Delivery study 
[14]. It is not a recommended option for pregnant women with HIV as it cannot be continued postpartum. 
Our recommendations for ART initiation in pregnancy are the same as for when a woman conceives o n ART (see 
Table 6.1). 
6.3.3 It is recommended that an integrase inhibitor -based regimen be considered as the third agent 
of choice in patients: 
• With high baseline viral load (>100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL) 
• Where cART is failing to suppress the virus. 

2C 
1C 
Raltegravir and dolutegravir ( from 6 weeks’ gestation) may be used in this context. A retrospective cohort analysis 
of 92 pregnant women with HIV showed more rapid viral suppression in those patients on an integrase inhibitor -
containing regimen versus women on ART without an integrase inhibitor [15]. Median time to viral load reduction 
by greater than 1 log 10 unit was 7 days in the integrase inhibitor -containing ART arm and 35 days in the non - 
integrase inhibitor ART arm ( P<0.01). In a second retrospective study of 14 women, raltegravir was either initiated 
as part of a cART regimen in nine antiretroviral -naïve women or added to an existing antiretroviral regimen in five 
women who had conceived on cART but had persistent viraemia [16]. Raltegravir was initiated at a gestational age 
of 34 weeks or later. The median exposure time to raltegravir was 17 days and the mean viral load decline was 2.6 
log 10 units. Raltegravir was well tolerated but elevated liver enzymes were reported. 
6.4 Late -presenting woman not on treatm ent 
6.4.1 A woman who presents after 28 weeks should commence cART without delay. 1B 
6.4.2 If the viral load is unknown or >100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL , a three - or four -drug regimen 
that includes raltegravir 400 mg bd or dolutegravir 50 mg od is suggested 2D 
Late presentation after 28 weeks and before the onset of labour occurs less frequently since the introduction of 
the routine offer and recommendation of antenatal HIV screening. With improved turnaround times for viral load 
testing, a woman presentin g beyond 28 weeks may still be managed with a view to a possible vaginal delivery if 
she commences cART and achieves a viral load of <50 HIV RNA copies/mL by 36 weeks. 
As discussed in section 6.7.3, an integrase inhibitor -based cART regimen is recommended because of a more rapid 
viral load decline compared to other drug combinations. A recent Thai study [17] of 57 pregnant women has 
shown that intensification of a standard three -drug cART regimen in women with detectable viral load after 
28 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in viral load at delivery. 
A pilot study in 40 women demonstrated that initiation of raltegravir -based thera py, compared to lopinavir/r -
based therapy, resulted in significantly more women with undetectable viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at 
delivery and a faster median time to viral load reduction to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL of 44 days in the raltegravir 
arm and 6 9 days in the lopinavir/r arm [18]. Adverse event incidence rates were also lower in the raltegravir arm. 
Raltegravir has been demonstrated to be more effective than efavirenz at reducing the viral load to <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL by 36 weeks’ gestation in an RCT of women who present after 28 weeks’ gestation [ 19]. Similarly, the 
use of dolut egravir in the third trimester is more effective in reducing viral load to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL than 
other third agents [ 20]. Based on these emerging data, the writing group recommends initiation with raltegravir - 
or dolutegravir -containing regimen s in this group of patients. Thus, where the viral load is unknown or >100,000 
HIV RNA copies/mL, a fourth drug, raltegravir or dolutegravir , may be added to the cART regimen. 
6.4.3 Management of an untreated woman presenting in labour at term. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
44 
 
All women should be given a stat dose of nevirapine 200 mg; 1B 
 and commence oral zidovudine 300 mg and lamivudine 150 mg bd; 1B 
 and raltegravir 400 mg bd; 2D 
 and receive intravenous zidovudine for the duration of labour. 2D 
 Please also see section 9.1.3 for HIGH -RISK neonatal management. 
A single dose of nevirapine, regardless of CD4 cell count (even if available) or hepatitis status, should be given 
immediately as this rapidly crosses the placenta and within 2 hours achiev es, and then maintains, effective 
concentrations in the neonate for up to 10 days [21,22 ]. cART should be commenced immediately with oral 
zidovudine and lamivudine and with raltegravir as the preferred additional agent because it also rapidly crosses 
the place nta [23]. Intravenous zidovudine should be administered for the duration of labour and delivery. 
Following a loading dose of 2 mg/kg for 1 hour the maintenance dose of 1mg/kg per hour is infused until the cord 
is clamped [24]. Data from the French cohort indicate that peripartum zidovudine infusion further reduces 
transmission in women on cART from 7.5% to 2.9% ( P=0.01) where the delivery viral load is >1000 HIV RNA 
copies/mL. However, this benefit is not seen if neonatal therapy is intensified [25]. If delivery is not imminent, a 
CS should be considered. 
6.4.4 In preterm labour, if the infant is unlikely to be able to absorb oral medications consider the 
addition of double -dose tenofovi r DF to the treatment described in recommendation 6.4.3 to 
further load the infant. 2C 
Nevirapine and raltegravir should be included in the regimen as they cross the placenta rapidly (see above). In 
addition, double -dose tenofovir DF (490 mg) has been shown to cross the placenta rapidly to preload the infant, 
and should be considered where the prematurity is such tha t the infant is likely to have difficulty taking oral PEP 
in the first few days of life [26]. 
6.4.5 Women presenting in labour/with spontaneous rupture of the membranes (SROM)/requiring 
delivery without a documented HIV result must be advised to have an urgent HIV test. A 
reactive/positive result must be acte d upon immediately, with initiation of interventions to 
prevent vertical transmission of HIV without waiting for further/formal serological 
confirmation. 1D 
If the woman’s HIV status is unknown due to lack of testing, a point -of-care test (POCT) should be performed. 
Women who have previously tested negative in pregnancy but who have an on -going risk of HIV should ideally 
also have a repeat fourth -generation laboratory test or, if unavailable, a POCT if presenting in labour. If the test is 
positive (reactive) a confirmatory test should be performed, but treatment to prevent vertical transmission should 
commence immediately. Where a POCT is not available, laboratory -based serology must be performed urgently 
including out of hours, and the result acte d upon as above. Baseline samples for CD4 cell count, viral load and 
resistance should be collected. Treatment should be commenced immediately as per recommendation 6.4.3 
above. Three -drug PEP should be given to the neonate (see section 9).

6.5 Evidence on teratogenicity, neonatal outcomes and ART 
Pregnant women with HIV remain a special group with specific guidelines for HIV treatment based on 
teratogenicity and toxicity data on cART use in pregnancy from published reports, national HIV in pregnancy 
data bases and international antiretroviral databases such as the APR. 
The APR provides the best data on teratogenicity and first trimester ART exposure although it should be noted 
that births from the UK contribute to only 4.6% of collected data [27]. This voluntary prospective database 
records rates of congenital birth defects in babies born to women with first -trimester exposure to ART in 
comparison to background rates of congenital birth defects and second - or third -trimester only exposures to the 
same compounds. The congenital malformation rate observed in babies exposed to a specified drug is reported 
once a minimum of 200 prospective first -trimester exposures to an individual antiretroviral have been reported. 
As of January 2018, the APR report for infants exposed to antiretrovirals includes the following. 
• Abacavir, atazanavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, lop inavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, tenofovir DF 
and zidovudine: there are now more than 200 prospective reports of first -trimester exposure with no 
signal of increased risk, and a greater than two -fold higher rate than in the general populati on has 
been excluded [27]. 
• Darunavir, efavirenz, indinavir, raltegravir and rilpivirine have been sh own to have congenital 
malformation rates within the expected range, and a congenital malformation rate greater than 1.5 -fold 
higher than in the general population has been excluded. 
• For newer agents (cobicistat, dolutegravir, elvitegravir and tenofovir al afenamide) and a number of 
less commonly prescribed older compounds (saquinavir, fosamprenavir, enfuvirtide, tipranavir, maraviroc 
and etravirine) there have been insufficient reported outcomes of first -trimester exposure to exclude 
such risk. 
Data f rom the APR have shown no difference in risk of birth defects for abacavir/lamivudine and non -
abacavir/lamivudine backbones [28]. 
The PROMISE study [2] compared the efficacy of zidovudine/single -dose nevirapine with two combination therapy 
arms to prevent vertical transmission. The first combination consisted of zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir/r and 
the second comprised tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/lopinavir/r. An unexpected higher rate of early neonata l death, 
predominantly attributed to preterm birth, was reported in the tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/lopinavir/r 
combination therapy arm. On review of this large randomised controlled trial, the BMJ Clinical Guidelines group 
recommended the zidovudine/lamivu dine -based antiretroviral regimen over tenofovir DF/emtricitabine with 
lopinavir/r, because of the reduced risk of infant death [29]. Other reviews have reported no increase in birth 
adverse events or safety events (and no increased risk of congenital abnormalities) in infants exposed to tenofovir 
DF compared to non -tenofovir DF -containing regimens, which did not have lopinavir/r as a backbone [30-33]. In 
addition to these systemic reviews, three prospective observational cohorts in pregnancy have shown no 
differences in adverse outcomes between tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and non -tenofovir DF/emtricitabine 
backbones [34-36]. Zash et al. [35] found that the risk of adverse birth outcome was lowest among infants 
exposed to a combined regimen of tenofovir DF/emtricitabine and safer than with zidovudine/lamivudine as a 
backbone. The writing group notes that the dose of lopinavir/r was increased by 50% for the durati on of the third 
trimester in the PROMISE study. This is not standard practice and the writing group recommends against using 
lopinavir/r at this dose. On review of all the data the writing group does not consider the increase in adverse 
outcomes in the PRO MISE study to be related to the tenofovir DF/emtricitabine backbone alone, but to the 
combination used ( www.bhiva.org/BHIVA -response -to-BMJ -article ). The writing group therefore recommends 
against using the combination tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/lopinavir/r in pregnancy. See also section 6.7.1 and 
Appendix 3. 
An initial meta -analysis on the use of dolutegravir in six studies and from four control databases suggested it 
appeared safe to use i n pregnancy [37]. However, a preliminary unscheduled analysis of an ongoing birth 
surveillance study in Botswana reported an increased risk of neural tube defects among infants of women who 
become pregnant while taking dolutegravir -based regimens [38]. The study reported four cases of neural tube 
defects out of 426 infants born to women who were on dolutegravir -based regimens at the time of conception. 
This rate of 0.94% compares to a rate of neural tube defects of 0.12% among infants born to women taking non -BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
46 
 
dolutegravir -based regimens at the time of conception. Of note there have been no reporte d neural tube defects 
in infants born to a further 2812 women in the Botswana study who started dolutegravir during pregnancy , 
including in the first trimester [39]. 
Further analysis of prospective surveillance data on 1908 women from t he Tsepamo study in Botswana was 
presented at AIDS 2020 [40]. These women were on dolutegravir -based ART regimens at the time of conception 
and seven neural tube defects were reported (0. 20%), down from 0.9% in original data in published in 2018 [41] . 
This compares to a rate of neural tube defect s of 0.1 1% in women who conceived on non -dolutegravir -containing 
ART, and 0.0 7% in those taking efavirenz -containing regimens at the time of conception. The greater number of 
conceptions on dolutegravir in this anal ysis provides a more precise estimate with further narrow ing of 
confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI 0.0 9–04) than the initial data, and shows a smaller difference in incidence of 
neural tube defect s between exposure to dolutegravir at conception and exposur e to other ART. 
Two other studies recently reported neural tube defect rates in infants exposed to dolutegravir at conception 
[42]. A neural tube defect surveillance study, also conducted in Botswana, reported a neural tube defect rate of 
0.66% in 152 dolutegravir -exposed pregnancies and a retrospective analysis from Brazil reported no neural tube 
defect s among infants born to 382 women who conceived on dolutegravir [43]; the overall rate of neural tube 
defect s in Brazil is <0.06%. Furthermore, the most recent update from the APR showed that among 248 
dolutegravir exposures at conception there was one neural tube defect giving a prevalence of 0.40% [ 44]. 
However, this estimate is based on a single neural tube defect among a relatively small number of exposures. 
Furthermore the IMPAACT 2010 study compared the safety and virologic al efficacy of dolutegravir + 
emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide v ersu s dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF v ersu s 
efavirenz/ emtricitabine /tenofovir DF in pregnant women as described in detail in section 6.3.2 [13]. Pregnancy 
outcomes for 640 women (99.5%) showed fewer women in the dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir 
alafenamide arm (24.1%) had an adverse pregnancy outcome than in the dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir 
DF (32.9% ; P=0.043) or efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (32.7% ; P=0.047) arms. Although stillbirth occurred 
more frequent ly with dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide (3.7%) and dolutegravir + 
emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (5.2%) than efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF (1.9%) ( P-values ≥0.05; post -hoc), all 
cases were reviewed by investigators and not deemed to be due to investigation al agents ( Waitt C, personal 
communication). Neonatal death occurred less frequent ly in both dolutegravir -containing arms (dolutegravir + 
emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide [1.0% ; P=0.019 ], dolutegravir + emtricitabine /tenofovir DF [1.5% ; P=0.053) 
and efavirenz /emtricitabine /tenofovir DF [4.8% ]). 
The writing group recognises that incidence of neural tube defect s varies between countries and not all countries 
have introduced folic acid fortification. 
The World Health Organization has updated recommendations for first -line treatment regimens to include 
dolutegravir , in combination with an NRTI backbone, as preferred first -line treatment for people living with HIV, 
including women of child -bearing potential. This decision was taken in the conte xt of the potential risks of 
negative aspects of other ART choices [ 45]. 
The writing group agrees that all women living with HIV should be given all available information and supported 
to make informed choices regarding ART, at all stages of their reproduc tive life. 
Based on these findings the writing group makes the following recommendations: 
1. For a woman on dolutegravir wishing to conceive: 
a. Women should be fully informed that the prevalence of neural tube defects is higher following 
dolutegravir exposure at conception than with other types of ART at conception (equating to 
2 per 1000 births vs 1 per 1000 births). 
b. The best safety data in pregnancy are for efavirenz or atazanavir/r and these should be 
considered first line in pregnancy. 
c. All women choosing to continue dolutegravir while planning to conceive will be supported in this 
decision and advised to commence or continue folic acid 5 mg od based on the original Medical 
Research Council data on prevention of neural tube defects in the general population [46]. 
2. For a woman on dolutegravir who becomes or is pregnant: BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
47 
 
a. We acknowledge the neural tube has closed within 6 weeks of conception but the mechanism of 
some of the reported abnormalities remains unce rtain. If dolutegravir is the best ART choice for 
the woman, the neural tube defect risk of 0. 20% should be discussed and if a woman accepts this 
risk then dolutegravir can be continued in pregnancy . 
b. We do not recommend switching from dolutegravir if the pregnancy is confirmed to be already 
past 6 weeks’ gestation unles s there are other reasons to consider switching . 
c. If the physician/woman choose(s) to switch, use a regimen for which there are the most safety 
data in pregnancy, such as efavirenz or atazanavir/r. 
d. Detailed anomaly scans should be performed as per national pregnancy guidelines with no 
additional scans required. 
Historical recommendations that efavirenz be avoided in women who may conceive [47] were based on 
preclinical animal studies that had not been conducted on any other ART, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) reclassification of efavirenz to category D, and the paucity of human data. Based on current evidence, the 
writing group recom mends that efavirenz can be used (i.e. both continued and commenced) in pregnancy without 
additional precautions and considerations above those of other antiretroviral agents [48]. 
For further information on toxicity and pharmacokine tics and discussion regarding choice of ART, see section 6.7. 
6.6 Preterm delivery (PTD) 
Rates of PTD in women with HIV are high. This was the case prior to cART and remains so in the current era. 
However, data on the association between PTD and different antiretroviral agents are complex. Some studies, but 
not all, implicate boosted PIs. Particularly in observational studies, differences between populations and timing of 
cART initiation undoubtedly contribute to the discrepant findings, while data on other risks associated with PTD 
including previous PTD are rarely collected. However, while the early studies investigated women initiating cART 
in pregnancy it is also becoming apparent that women conceiving on cART, with an undetectable HIV load, still 
have a higher than expected PTD rate. 
Studies showing no association between boosted PIs and PTD 
Several large observational studies from the USA have not found an association between cART and PTD [49,50 ]. A 
US meta -analysis in 2007 did not find an association between PI -containing cART and PTD [51], and analysis of the 
NSHPC UK and Ireland data, although demonstrating the increased risk of PTD in wome n on cART, similarly did 
not find a difference when comparing PI - and NNRTI -based regimens [52]. In addition, an analysis of data on over 
10,000 women reported to the APR from 1989 to 2010 did not find a significant increase in PTD in women with PI 
exposure with lower pre -existing risk [53]. Over 85% of these reports to the APR came from the USA. 
 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
48 
 
Most studies that have examined the relationship between the timing of cART initiation and PTD have found that 
the risk was increased in those either conceiving on cART or taking it early in pregnancy (in the first trimester) 
[51,54 -56]. However, an NSHPC UK and Ireland study did not find an association between timi ng of cART initiation 
and PTD [52]. A 2010 US study attempted to overcome the potential confounding factors associated with timing 
of cART initiation by including only women starting cART in pregnancy and comparing PI -containing with non -PI-
containin g regimens and did not find an association between PI -containing regimens and PTD [57]. In this study, 
72% of the 777 women received a PI -based regimen, and in 47% of those the PI was nelfinavir with 22% on 
lopinavir/r. Further comparison between nelfinavir and lopinavir/r was unfortunately not possible. A small 
Canadian study retrospectively reviewed 384 women living with HIV compared to a matched HIV -negative cohort 
[58]. A two -fold increase in preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age parameters was found, 
however no statistical difference between the two cohorts remained when odds ratio was adjusted for race and 
history of PTD. 
Studies suggesting an association between boosted PIs and PTD 
The association between cART and PTD was first reported by the Swiss Cohort study group in 1998 [59], and 
subsequ ently from a number of other European studies including three analyses from the European Cohort Study 
[54,56,60,61 ]. Analysis of the NSHPC UK and Ireland data in 2007 found that there was a 1.5 -fold increased risk of 
PTD when comparing women on cART with those on monotherapy or dual therapy [52]. One single -centre UK 
study found the risk was increased in w omen initiating cART in pregnancy compared to those conceiving on 
treatment [62]. 
In two US studies, one multicentre study from the Pediatric Spectrum of HIV Disease cohort and one single -centre 
study, an asso ciation between cART and PTD was found only if cART included a PI [63,64 ]. Two of the earlier 
European Cohort Study reports had also noted that the increased risk of PTD in patients on cART was particularly 
marked in patients on PI -containing cART [54,56 ]. 
A 2011 study from the ANRS reported an association between cART and PTD and in the 1253 patients initiating a 
PI-based regimen, those on ritonavir -based PI regimens were significantly more likely to deliver prematurely 
compared to those on a non -boosted PI regimen (hazard ratio 2.03; 95% CI 1.06 –3.89) [65]. One additional 
analysis from the APR of 955 live births exposed to lopinavir/r reported a PTD rate of 13.4% [66]. A retrospective 
study from th e UK reported a PTD rate of 10% in 100 women taking atazanavir/r in pregnancy, of whom 67% had 
conceived on their regimen [67]. The same group found no difference in PTD rates in a retrospective study 
com paring lopinavir/r and atazanavir/r as the third agent in cART [68]. The latest publication from the NSHPC 
suggests that atazanavir /r has a lower PTD rate than lopinavir/r, particularly in women with a CD4 count <350 
cells/mm3 and compared to darunavir/r in women initiating cART in pregnancy [69]. 
Several randomised studies investigating the use of different antiretroviral regimens in di fferent settings have 
now been published, although none was designed specifically to address whether ART affects the rate of PTD. The 
Mma Bana study from Botswana randomly allocated 560 women at 26 –34 weeks’ gestation, with CD4 cell counts 
>200 cells/mm3, to receive either lopinavir/r plus zidovudine/lamivudine (PI group) or 
abacavir/zidovudine/lamivudine (NRTI group). The PTD rates were significantly higher in the PI group (21.4% vs 
11.8%; P=0.003) [70]. A second study, the Kesho Bora Study, randomly allocated 824 women at 28 –36 weeks’ 
gestation, again with CD4 cell counts >200 cells/mm3, to receive either lopinavir/r with zidovudine/lamivudine or 
zidovudine monotherapy twice daily plus a single dose of nevirapine at the onset of labour. There was no 
difference in the PTD rate between the two groups (13% with PI vs 11% with zidovudine monotherapy/single -dose 
nevirapine) [71]. An analysis of placental malaria data from PROMOTE of 391 Ugandan women randomly assigned 
to lopinavir/r or efavirenz initiated during pregnancy showed no significant difference in PTD: 15.9% and 13.6%, 
respectively [72]. Finally, in the PROMISE study lopinavir/r prescribed with tenofovir DF/emtricitabine was 
associated with a high neonatal mortality rate due to severe PTD, which was not seen with lopinavir/r when 
prescribe d with zidovudine/lamivudine, nor with zidovudine monotherapy. However, in both PI arms the doses of 
lopinavir and ritonavir were increased by 50% for the duration of the third trimester. A role for ritonavir has been 
proposed – PTD is not associated with nelfinavir (no ritonavir) or with atazanavir/r (100 mg ritonavir), and is most 
strongly associated with lopinavir (usually 200 mg daily; 300 mg daily in PROMISE). BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

Summary 
The data regarding cART , including individual components of cART, and PTD remain complex and it is likely that 
there are several drivers. The most consistent findings suggest lopinavir/r should be avoided, while the latest UK 
data favour atazanavir/r if a PI is indicated. Random ised controlled trial data on the current most commonly 
prescribed boosted PIs in the UK are not available thus the NSHPC data provide the best guide. Additional data on 
once daily darunavir/r would be helpful. A patient friendly, approach to assessing the data has been developed by 
the BMJ guidelines group [73]. 
Of note, recent reports on the pharmacokinetic profiles of cobicistat and the safety concerns over dolutegravir 
exposure during the first few weeks of gestation demonstrate that the newest therapies may not be the safest in 
pregnancy and that older ‘tried and tested’ regimens may still be preferred, considering that a woman with fully 
suppressed HIV on therapy has a very low risk of ve rtical transmission regardless of the combination. Therefore 
safety in pregnancy becomes the most pressing concern. The importance and long -term impact of PTD, even with 
access to excellent neonatal care, should not be underestimated. 
6.7 Pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals in pregnancy 
6.7 No routine dose alterations are recommended for antiretroviral s during pregnancy if used at 
standard adult licensed doses, apart from raltegravir, which should be given as 400 mg bd. 1C 
 Consider TDM particularly if com bining tenofovir DF and atazanavir/r. 2C 
 If dosing off licence, consider switching to standard dosing throughout pregnancy or regular 
TDM. 2C 
Physiological changes that occur even during the first trimester of pregnancy may affect the kinetics of drug 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, thereby affecting drug dosing [74]. In pregnancy, 
gastroin testinal pH is increased, transit time becomes prolonged, body water and fat increase, and there are 
accompanying increases in cardiac output, ventilation and liver and renal blood flow. Plasma protein 
concentrations decrease, notably albumin and α1 acid g lycoprotein; renal sodium reabsorption increases and 
changes occur in the metabolic enzyme pathway in the liver, including changes in cytochrome P450. 
6.7.1 NRTIs 
The pharmacokinetics of most NRTIs (zidovudine [75], lamivudine [76] and abacavir [77]) are not significantly 
altered by pregnancy and dose adjustment is not required. 
Tenofovir DF concentrations in the third trimester were reported to be reduced by about 15 –25% compared with 
postpartum, but trough levels were adequate [78,79 ]; however in a population -based study of tenofovir DF use, 
clearance in pregnant women appeared to be 39% higher than in non -pregnant women [80]. Higher rates of 
treatment failure during pregnancy with tenofovir DF -containing combinations have not been reported. Another 
study reported lower tenofovir DF area under the curve (AUC) and trough levels throughout pregnancy and found 
that this was linke d to higher maternal weight. One double dose of tenofovir DF administered shortly before 
delivery resulted in plasma concentrations similar to those observed in non -pregnant adults following a standard 
245-mg dose and adequate levels in the neonate [26,81 ] (see section 9). A review of antenatal patients with HIV 
attending a London hospital showed no decline in renal function during pregnancy in women taking tenofovir DF. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a newer version of tenofovir DF and although data on the safety and pharmacokinetics 
of tenofovir alafenamide are limited, no signals for concern with regard to birth defect have been reported [82]. 
However, the writing group does not recommend its routine use in pregnancy until further data are available. This 
should be discussed with all women who conceive on tenofovir alafenamide, and consideration shoul d be given to 
switching to an alternative NRTI regimen. 
Data on emtricitabine show that while third -trimester concentrations are lower than postpartum the absolute 
concentrations achieved during pregnancy are adequate and dose adjustment is not required [79,8 3].

6.7.2 NNRTIs 
Rilpivirine is r ecommended in the current BHIVA Adult Treatment Guidelines [5] as a first -line antiretroviral agent 
with tenofovir DF and emtricitabine in patients with viral load <100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL. A pharmacokinetic 
study by the PANNA consortium [84] carried out intensive 24 -hour pharmacokinetic profiles in women living with 
HIV receiving rilpivirine 25 mg od in the third trimester and postpartum. Fifteen women were included in th e 
study and rilpivirine levels were approximately 50% lower during the third trimester than postpartum. However, 
all women had <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at delivery and there were no vertical transmissions. Based on this, it is 
recommended that women may be co mmenced or continued on rilpivirine -containing regimens (with no routine 
dose adjustment) if they are able to take their medication with a meal to optimise pharmacokinetics, and that 
they are closely monitored with additional viral load monitoring and TDM if clinically indicated. 
Efavirenz 600 mg od was reported in one study of 25 pregnant women to result in third -trimester plasma 
concentrations that were similar to 6 - to 12 -week postpartum concentrations. Cord blood to maternal blood ratio 
was 0.49 result ing in transplacental concentrations in the therapeutic range [85]. 
A study of the pharmacokinetics of etravirine 200 mg bd in 15 women found an increase in etravirine exposure 
during pregnancy but still within the range observed in previous studies of non -pregnant individuals with HIV 
treated with this dose [86]. Fourteen of 15 women had an undetectable viral load during pregnancy and no 
vertical transmissions were reported. A second study from the PANNA group has shown similar findings [87]. 
Nevirapine has been extensively investigated in pregnancy and plasma concentrations are similar to those in non -
pregnant adults [21,88 ]. No dose adjustment is required when using licensed doses. There are no data on the 
prolonged release for mulation of nevirapine in pregnant women and therefore consideration should be given to 
switching patients on 400 mg prolonged release formulation to the 200 mg bd formulation during pregnancy. It 
should be noted that nevirapine is no longer a preferred tr eatment option for naïve patients in the current BHIVA 
Adult Treatment Guidelines [5]. 
 6.7.3 Integrase inhibitors 
Raltegravir 1200 mg od should not be used in pregnancy. Instead a woman should be switched to or started on 
400 mg bd. 
A study of pregnant women taking r altegravir 400 mg bd found adequate trough levels in all 10 women in the 
study, although levels were very variable and lower than postpartum [87]. In another study of five women, third -
trimester concentrations were no lower than postpartum and in the two cord blood samples studied, the cord 
blood to maternal blood ratio was >1.0 [89]. A third stu dy of 23 women receiving raltegravir 400 mg bd, mostly as 
intensification of PI -based regimens during pregnancy, showed no statistically significant change in raltegravir 
concentrations during pregnancy and postpartum [90]. The PANNA study has also shown similar results [91]. In an 
ongoing prospective study of 31 women who took raltegravir during preg nancy, mostly (74%) starting in the third 
trimester, no evidence of adverse events has been observed in infants who are being followed up to 6 years [92]. 
The IMPAACT P1026s stu dy is an ongoing prospective study of antiretroviral pharmacokinetics in pregnant 
women living with HIV [93]. Results from intensive 24 -hour pharmacokinetic profiling for elvitegravir and 
cobicistat in women during the second and third trimesters and postpartum have been reported. Twenty -nine 
subjects were included and elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures were lower and clearance higher during 
pregnancy, compared to postpartum. Viral load at delivery was <50 HIV RNA copies/mL for 14/19 women (74%). 
Congenital abnormalities were reported in two infants. Analysis of elvitegravir and cobicistat levels in infant blood 
showed undetectable levels of cobicistat and a similar elvitegravir elimination half-life for infants in comparison to 
adults. In view of recent data on darunavir/cobicistat in pregnancy, cobicistat -boosted regimens are not 
recommended in pregnancy. 
The IMPACT 1026 trial has also assessed m aternal dolutegravir pharmacokinetics and showed that the calculated 
dolutegravir AUC was 25 –30% lower in the seco nd and third trimesters but not statistically significantly different to the 
AUC during the postpartum period. The AUC was also numerically similar to the value in non-pregnant adults. Therefore 
no dose adjustment is required [94]. 
 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

6.7.4 PIs 
While ritonavir -boosted PI therapy can maintain suppression of viral load, ve rtical transmission of HIV would be 
almost entirely dependent on antiviral activity within the woman. With minimal transplacental transfer, the low 
to undetectable drug concentrations in the fetus provide no peri -exposure protection. The writing group 
ther efore recommends that, where possible, patients who conceive on PI monotherapy should have their 
regimen intensified with agents that cross the placenta. 
Pharmacokinetic and safety data in pregnancy for cobicistat -boosted PIs show low darunavir exposure d uring the 
second and third trimesters of pregnancy which may be associated with virological failure based on a 
pharmacokinetic study of six pregnant women [95]. Compared with levels 6 –12 weeks postpartum, where mean 
exposure of darunavir boosted with cobicistat was 90%, darunavir levels were lower in the second (56%) and third 
trimesters (50%). Cobicistat exposure was 63% and 49% in the second and third trimesters respectively. Therefore 
darunavir/cobicistat should not be initiated in pregnancy and women receiving this combination as part of cART 
and who become pregnant should be switched to an alternative such as darunavir/r. When given with 
elvitegravir, cobicistat has been shown to have lower levels during pregnancy and it does not cross the placenta 
[93]. For this reason, the writing group recommends that the boosting agent is switched from cobicistat to 
ritonavir for women who conceive on a cobicistat -boosted PI regimen. When initiating PIs during pregnancy, it is 
recommended that ritonavir is t he boosting agent of choice. 
PIs are highly protein bound and placental transfer in humans appears to be limited. During the third trimester of 
pregnancy, small reductions in protein binding can significantly increase free drug levels. For example, the pr otein 
binding of lopinavir reduces marginally to 99%, which results in 17% more unbound lopinavir [96]. It is therefore 
difficult to interpret the significance of studies that show reduced total plasma levels, with an increased likelihood 
of trough levels below the target during pregnancy. Compared with concentrations postpartum, concentrations of 
lopinavi r/r 400/100 mg during the third trimester are reduced by 28%. The protein -free fraction is moderately 
increased (17%) and, at the standard dose, lopinavir appears to be clinically effective with a wide variation in 
individual plasma trough concentrations. A study using the tablet formulation showed that women taking three 
tablets bd (lopinavir/r 600/150 mg) achieved similar AUC levels to non -pregnant adults taking the standard dose 
of two tablets bd [97]. The improved bioavailability of the tablet formulation is also found in pregnant women and 
this, toget her with the impact of pregnancy on changes in protein binding, increases the protein -free fraction in 
the third trimester [98]. The writing group recommends that no dose adjustment is required in pregnancy for 
patients on lopinavir/r but notes that this treatment is no longer preferred for the reasons given above. 
A study from Italy demonstrated similar atazanavir concentrations at standard 300 mg dose with ritonavir 100 mg 
od during the third trimester and postpartum [99]. However, recently third -trimester 24 -hour AUC concentrations 
28% lower than postpartum concentrations were reported from North America. Third -trimester concentrations of 
atazanavir in women taking tenofovir DF were low er still (i.e. approximately 50% of the postpartum values of 
women on atazanavir without tenofovir DF), and 55% of women in the study taking tenofovir DF had lower than 
target atazanavir concentrations. The study authors therefore recommended that it may b e necessary to increase 
the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg (when given with ritonavir 100 mg od) during the third trimester [100]. A 
systematic review has demonstrated that grade 3 –4 maternal hyperbilirubinaemia rates are doubled with 
atazanavir/r 400/100 mg [101]. Data from the Europe -based PANNA study also revealed a 33% reduction in third -
trimester AUC and last measurable plasma atazanavir concentrations compared with postpartum. However, all 
drug concentrations measured, including with co -administered tenofovir DF, were above the recommended 
minimum plasma concentration for wild -type virus and therefore the writing group recommends consideration of 
an increased dose in experienced patients on an individual basis only if required [102]. 
Atazan avir/r 400/100 mg is also recommended in women who require an H2 antagonist during pregnancy, 
however the combination of atazanavir/r, tenofovir DF and an H2 antagonist is not recommended [101]. 
When prescribed with zidovudine/lamivudine, plasma concentrations achieved with atazanavir/r 300/100 mg od 
are only 21% less (by AUC) than historic controls whereas trough concentrations were reported to be comparable 
to these controls. Increasing the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg od during the third trimester increased trough 
concentrations by 39% and doubled the risk of hyperbilirubina emia [103]. A case note revie w of 122 women in 
London receiving atazanavir/r did not show virological failure during pregnancy despite 83% receiving standard 
dosing of 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg, and the authors concluded that the data did not support routine 
atazanavir dose escalat ion in pregnancy [67]. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
52 
 
For darunavir, a study from the USA showed reduced troughs and 24 -hour AUC values with daily dosing in 
pregnancy, whereas twice daily dosing produced levels more comparable to thos e in non -pregnant individuals 
[104]. The authors concluded that twice daily dosing should be used in pregnancy and higher doses may be 
required. For women receiving darunavir/r 800/100 mg, the AUC was reduced by 38% in the second trimester and 
by 39% in the third trimester compared to postpartum levels. With twice daily dosing the AUC was reduced by 
26% in both trimesters. Similar findings have been reported from the PANNA network with subtherapeutic trough 
concentrations with 800/100 mg od dosing and no detectable darunavir in any of the cord blood samples 
collected [105]. Zorrilla et al. reported that, although total darunavir exposur e decreases during pregnancy, there 
were no significant changes in unbound darunavir concentration compared with postpartum and concluded that 
no dose adjustment is required when darunavir/r is prescribed at 600/100 mg bd [106]. Others have also reported 
that although there is a reduction in darunavir levels during pregnancy, this is less pronounced when unbound 
darunavir levels are measured [105,107 ]. 
A pharmacokinetic study by the IMPAACT P1026s study group showed no impact on third -trimester darunavir 
levels by further increasing the dose from 600/100 mg bd to 800/100 mg bd, therefore this is not recommended 
[108]. The clinical relevance of th ese pharmacokinetic studies has yet to be fully determined. 
It is the view of the writing group that if a patient conceives on darunavir -based cART and has a fully suppressed 
viral load on a daily regimen, this regimen may be continued. A more cautious ap proach using twice daily 
darunavir may be considered if initiating ART in pregnancy with darunavir or where there is known protease 
resistance. Although the pharmacokinetic data are consistent across studies, the virological impact during 
pregnancy and pos tpartum are unknown. Such outcome data are needed. Where the 600/100 mg bd dose is 
used, women should be reviewed postpartum for appropriateness to switch to the 800/100 mg od dose. 
In general, there are still limited data on the currently available PI for mulations. Given this lack of data and the 
considerable degree of interpatient variability, TDM for PIs during pregnancy can be considered, but is not 
routinely recommended in the absence of studies that show improved outcomes. If performed, TDM should be 
conducted at steady state (2 weeks or more into therapy) and repeated in the third trimester. 
6.7.5 Other agents 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of enfuvirtide in pregnancy, as well as of tipranavir and maraviroc, have not been 
described. It is noteworthy th at enfuvirtide does not cross the placenta [109]. 
6.8 Stopping ART postpartum 
6.8.1 Stopping ART after delivery is not recommended; women who wish to stop ART should be 
counselled on the risks and managed as per the BHIVA guidelines for the treatment of HIV -
positive adults with antiretroviral therapy [5]. 1B 
6.9 HIV -2 
6.9.1 Case discussion with experts with experience of managing HIV -2 is recommended for all 
women. 1D 
6.9.2 A boosted PI -based regimen such as twice daily darunavir/r is recommended in women with 
HIV-2. 1C 
Vertical transmission of HIV -2 is considerably less common than of HIV -1, varying between 0% and 4% in the 
absence of any intervention to reduce transmission [110-112]. It is likely that this can be explained by the lower 
viral loads seen in HIV -2 infection [112]. Nevertheless, vertical transmission can occur; of note, dual infection with 
HIV-1 and -2 as well as mono -infection can occur. There is no systematic evidence to guide choice of treatment 
for pregn ant women with HIV -2 or PEP for the infant. Case discussion with experts with experience of managing 
HIV-2 is recommended for all women. A ritonavir -boosted PI -based regimen is recommended and tenofovir BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
53 
 
DF/emtricitabine with twice daily darunavir/r would b e likely to have the greatest anti -viral efficacy. It is 
suggested that such treatment is used, even in the presence of an undetectable HIV -2 viral load; this would help 
to avoid management difficulties if the viral load becomes detectable late in pregnanc y. Agents used as PEP for 
the infant are a matter for expert opinion and discussion. Zidovudine monotherapy would be the minimum 
recommendation, but clinicians may wish to use triple therapy with raltegravir as a cautious approach 
and certai nly if the viral load is detectable at delivery. Raltegravir is suggested because HIV -2 is sensitive to 
integrase inhibitors [113] and there is greater experience and availability of suitable formulations in paediatric 
dosing (see Appendix 3).

7. HIV and hepatitis virus co -infections 
7.1 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
The combination of HIV, chronic HBV infection and pregnancy presents unique management considerations. 
Referral to the local designated specialist should be undertaken to ensure that all aspects of care are addressed, 
including the effects of HBV/HIV on pregnancy, effects of pregnancy on the course of co -infection, antiretroviral 
management for both HBV and HIV, and prevention o f vertical transmission for both viruses. Pregnant women 
with advanced cirrhosis should be managed in a tertiary centre with a hepatologist. 
The prevalence of HBV co -infection in pregnant women tends to reflect that of the adult population 
(Europe/Africa 4 –10%) [1-4] and is 40% higher than that found in the general population (HIV positive vs HIV 
negative: relative risk [RR] 1.40; 95% CI 1.16 –1.69) [1]. Up to one -third of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is 
wild -type (hepatitis B envelope antigen [HBeAg] positive) and, depending on region, up to 6% of individuals may 
be co -infected with hepatitis delta virus. Rates of HBV/HIV co -infection vary with race and ethnicity so that 
changing immigration patterns in Western countries with traditionally low prevalence may significantly influence 
rates at a regional level (e.g. 6% among Asian women in the USA vs 0.6% in white women) [5]. The same is true 
for injecting drug use (prevalence <0.1% in Northwestern Europe compared to 1 –4% in Southern Europe) and 
sexual transmission (prevalence is higher in men who have sex with men). 
Although plausible because of higher levels of HBV DNA in women living with both HBV and HIV, there is no 
evidence of increased vertical transmission of HBV in co -infection compared with mono -infection. The impact of 
pregnancy on women wit h HBV mono -infection is small. There appears to be no worsening of liver disease in the 
majority of women, although case reports of hepatic exacerbations/fulminant hepatic failure have been reported; 
alanine transaminase (ALT) levels tend to fall, HBeAg se roconversion occurs in a small minority and may be 
associated with liver dysfunction, and HBV DNA levels may rise by as much as 1 log 10 unit. The impact of HBV 
infection on pregnancy appears negligible. 
By contrast, the effect of HIV on HBV disease progre ssion includes higher levels of HBV replication (HBV DNA 
levels and proportion HBeAg positive), higher mortality when compared to HIV or HBV mono -infection, a higher 
rate of chronicity (20 –80% compared to 3 –5% in HIV -negative individuals with risk increasi ng with lower CD4 cell 
counts at the time of HBV acquisition), lower ALT levels, higher rate of hepatoma, lower rate of spontaneous loss 
of HBeAg or HBsAg and seroconversion to anti -HBe and anti -HBs, faster progression to cirrhosis, and a higher 
incidence of lamivudine resistance [6]. 
7.1.1 On diagnosis of new HBV infection, confirmation of viraemia with quantitative HBV DNA, ‘e’ 
antigen status as well as hepatitis A virus (HAV), HCV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) screening and 
tests to assess hepatic inflammation/fibrosis and liver function are recommended. 1C 
7.1.2 LFTs should be repeated at 2 and 4 weeks after commencing ART to detect evidence of 
hepatotoxicity or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and then monitored 
regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. 1C 
In a pregnant woman living with HIV and newly diagnosed with HBV (HBsAg positive on antenatal screening or 
diagnosed preconception), baseline hepatitis B markers (anti -HBc/HBeAg/anti -HBe status) and level of the virus 
(HBV DNA), the degree of inflammation and synthetic function (ALT, asp artate transaminase [AST], albumin and 
international normalised ratio [INR]), an assessment of fibrosis and the exclusion of additional causes of liver 
disease (e.g. haemochromatosis and autoimmune hepatitis) are indicated. Additionally, patients should be 
assessed for the need for HAV immunisation, by testing for HAV immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody, as well as for 
HDV co -infection (HDV serology and HDV RNA if positive). 
Liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry (FibroScan) are relatively contraindicated during p regnancy [7], therefore 
clinical assessment, use of blood panel -based fibrosis markers (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase -to-platelet ratio BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
61 
 
index [APRI ] or fibrosis -4 index [FIB-4]) and an ultrasound scan of the liver and spleen should be undertaken 
where there is suspicion of advanced liver disease. It is important where cirrhosis is found to be present that 
there is close liaison with the hepatologist because of a significantly in creased rate of complications. Additionally, 
acute liver failure can occur on reactivation of HBV disease if anti -HBV treatment is discontinued [8]. However, in 
the absence of decompensated disease and with cART incorporating anti -HBV drugs and close monitoring, most 
women with cirrhosis do not have obstetric complications from their HBV infec tion. 
Because of the risk of antiretroviral -related hepatotoxicity and a hepatitis flare from immune reconstitution, it is 
important to repeat LFTs at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of ART and periodically thereafter. Through pregnancy, 
LFTs are routinely monitored at each antenatal clinic appointment as a marker for potential obstetric 
complications (HELLP, pre -eclampsia, acute fatty liver, etc.), particularly in the final trimester. Finally, in those 
diagnosed late and not receiving HBV treatment incorpor ated into cART, LFT flares may be seen shortly after 
delivery, which in some cases relates to HBeAg seroconversion and reappearance or a marked increase in HBV 
DNA levels. Where acute infection is suspected, testing for anti -HBc IgM is recommended. Acute H BV is 
uncommon during pregnancy and each case needs to be managed with specialist advice. Data suggest that 
lamivudine as part of cART does not completely protect against the development of acute HBV infection, although 
it is unlikely that this is also the case with tenofovir DF with or without lamivudine/emtricitabine [9]. Although 
there is a theoretical risk of high HBV DNA levels and the linked association with increased risk of vertical 
transmission combined with the potential for acute hepatitis and threat to maternal and fetal health, it is 
assumed that this would be mitigated by the patient already being on cART incorporating tenofovir DF and either 
emtricitabine or lamivudine. Where the woman is not on cART, a tenofovir DF -based ART regimen should be 
commenced immediately. 
7.1.3 Because there is no evidence of any adverse effect on maternal or neonatal heal th if women 
become pregnant while taking ART dually active against HBV, treatment should be continued. 1C 
For tenofovir DF, emtricitabine and lamivudine, the APR [10] and the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy 
Study [11] have not identified any increase in prevalence of congenital abnormality or any specific pattern of 
anomaly, even when administered in the f irst trimester. Hence, when a woman conceives on an anti -HBV viral 
agent as part of ART (tenofovir DF, lamivudine or emtricitabine), as for HIV management, cART should be 
continued as the potential risk to the fetus from drug exposure is outweighed by that of a hepatitis flare or liver 
disease progression if the drug(s) were to be discontinued in addition to HIV virological rebound and risk of 
vertical transmission of HIV. Because entecavir has activity against HIV, it is not recommended unless given with 
active cART in a woman with both HBV and HIV. Moreover, it has been found to have significant carcinogenic 
potential in animal studies and therefore its use as an antiviral drug for HBV during pregnancy should be avoided. 
Lamivudine has been extensively use d, as has tenofovir DF and to a lesser extent emtricitabine, for the treatment 
of HIV mono -infection during pregnancy, and a combination of lamivudine and telbivudine has been used in HBV 
mono -infected pregnant women and all have been found to be safe. Alt hough experience with tenofovir 
alafenamide in pregnancy is limited, animal data do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity [12]. New data from IMPACT 2010 has shown use of tenofovir alafenamide to be safe after 
the first trimester of pregnancy, therefore it may be considered to treat HIV and HBV co -infection after the first 
trimester [13]. There is no evidence of any adverse effect on maternal health if women become pregnant while 
taking tenofovir DF, lamivudine or emtricitabine; these drugs are recommended as NRTI choices in national 
[14,15] and international guidelines [16]. 
7.1.4 Tenofovir DF and emtricitabine or lamivudine should form the backbone of an antiretroviral 
regimen in treatment -naïve patients with wild -type HIV/HBV co -infection and no 
contraindication to any of these drugs. 1B 
7.1.5 If tenofovir DF is not currently part of cART it should be added or tenofovir alafenamide 
/emtricitbine can be added after the first trimester . 1B 
7.1.6 Lamivudine/emtricitabine may be omitted from the antiretroviral regimen and tenofovir DF 
given as the sole anti -HBV agent if there is clinical or genotypic evidence of 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
62 
 
lamivudine/emtricitabine -resistant HBV or HIV. 
7.1.7 Lamivudine or emtricitabine should not be used as the only active drug against HBV in cART 
because of the likelihood of emergent HBV resistance to these agents. 1B 
7.1.8 Emtricitabine has potential ly increased antiviral benefits compared to lamivudine, appears to 
be equally safe during pregnancy and hence is the preferred option to be given with tenofovir 
DF in women with HBV and HIV. 2D 
All women living with both HBV and HIV should receive cART containing tenofovir DF , or if after the first trimester 
tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with emtricitabine or lamivudine treatment during pregnancy. Although 
lamivudine and emtricitabine are potent anti -HBV agents, HBV monotherapy is associated with a high likelihood 
of HBV resistance in co -infected persons and hence therapy with either of these drugs, without a second anti -HBV 
active drug, is not recommended. Tenofovir DF is effective at sup pressing HBV DNA in mono - and co -infected 
patients whether they are HBeAg positive or negative, and independent of the presence of lamivudine -resistant 
virus [17]. More recently, tenofovir alafenamide has also been shown to have non -inferior efficacy and improved 
renal and bone toxicity compared to tenofovir DF in the management of HBV mono -infection [18,19]. Phenotypic 
HBV resistance has not been ascribed to tenofovir DF in people with both HBV and HIV with up to 5 years of 
follow -up an d has only been demonstrated in vitro in treated individuals with suboptimal control [20] as 
represented by detectable HBV DNA levels. In combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine, tenofovir DF has 
been demonstrated to be effective at s uppressing HBV DNA and may induce HBeAg seroconversion. Combining 
lamivudine/emtricitabine with tenofovir DF may also reduce the risk of breakthrough HBV viraemia [14], however 
the biggest advantage is that currently emtricitabine is co -formulated with tenofovir DF and therefore convenient 
for dosing. 
Emtricitabine is structurally similar to lamivudine but has a longer intracellular half -life and is more potent in vitro 
and in vivo as monotherapy in the treatment of naïve patients with HIV and HBV [21]. It also selects for resistance 
for both HBV and HIV less rapidly and less often than lamivudine [21]. Although not currently appro ved for HBV 
treatment, it induces a sharp reduction of HBV DNA in both mono - and co -infected patients. In patients with both 
HBV and HIV naïve to antivirals, combining emtricitabine with tenofovir DF has been shown in a randomised 
controlled trial to be mo re effective than emtricitabine alone (median time -weighted average concentration 
decrease was −5.32 log 10 IU/mL in the tenofovir DF/emtricitabine group vs −3.25 IU/mL in the emtricitabine 
group; P=0.036) [22]. Further studies comparing emtricitabine/lamivudine with lamivudine alone produced similar 
results [23]. 
Nevirapine should be not be started in any individual with HBV and HIV. Zidovudine should, if possible, be avoided 
in viral hepatitis co -infection because of the associat ion with hepatic steatosis. In a retrospective analysis of 
patients with HCV and HIV, a strong association with hepatic steatosis was found with didanosine and stavudine, 
however there was also a trend with zidovudine (OR 2.65; 95% CI 0.95 –7.41) [24]. 
Liver enzymes should be monitored frequently after starting cART because of the possibility of an inflammatory 
flare from immune reconstitution (see recommendation 7.2.2). 
7.1.9 In all HAV non -immune women with HBV and HIV, HAV vaccine is rec ommended, after the first 
trimester as per the normal schedule (0 and 6 months); 1A 
 unless the CD4 cell count is <300 cells/mm3, when an additional dose (0, 1 and 6 months) may 
be indicated. 1D 
Immunisation for HAV uses inactivated vaccine. Data for HA V vaccine in pregnancy are limited. Nevertheless, 
several guidelines indicate that pregnancy is not a contraindication for HAV immunisation, including in pregnant 
women with both HBV and HIV [25]. Patie nts with higher CD4 cell counts and on cART generally show improved 
responses to HAV vaccination. People living with HIV with CD4 cell counts <300 cells/mm3 should receive three 
instead of the standard two doses of HAV vaccine. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
63 
 
7.1.10 cART active against b oth HBV and HIV should be continued postpartum in all women with HBV 
and HIV. 1A 
7.1.11 Hepatitis flares that occur after delivery should be managed conservatively with careful 
monitoring. 2D 
Inflammatory flares may be severe, particularly in persons with cirrhosis, and can occur as a result of viral escape 
and HBV viraemia if drugs with anti -HBV activity are stopped. In a randomised controlled trial comparing 
lamivudine with placebo for reduci ng vertical transmission of HBV in women with HBV mono -infection, an 
immediate increase in HBV DNA levels was observed on discontinuation of lamivudine postpartum [26]. Similarly, 
hepatitis flares among patients with HBV and HIV have been reported upon the discontinuation of lamivudine, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. In the Swiss HIV observational cohort, liver enzyme elevation occurred in 29% of 
patients who discontin ued lamivudine and in 5% this was severe with three patients presenting with fulminant 
hepatitis [27] at a median time of 6 weeks after discontinuation. 
Pregnancy induces a state of relative immune suppression. Postpartum flares of liver inflammation have been 
described for HBV, HCV and autoimmune hepatitis. Although rarely leading to fulminant hepatitis, careful 
monitoring of flares is needed in the postpartum period. HBeAg positivity is a common predictor of flares, most of 
which are asymptomatic and resolve within 12 months [28]. 
HBV -active antiviral therapy does not appear to protect against the development of a postpartum flare and does 
not lead to anti -HBe seroconversion in HBeAg -positive women [29]. 
7.1.12 In the absence of obstetric complications, normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if the 
woman has fully suppressed HIV vira l load on cART, irrespective of HBV viral load. 1C 
7.1.13 Neonatal immunisation with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) should commence 
within 24 hours of delivery. The national infant HBV schedule should then be followed. 1A 
No data exist to support any benefit from PLCS in women with both HBV and HIV and no robust randomised 
controlled trial has been conducted in women with HBV alone. In a meta -analysis of women with HBV alone (four 
randomised trials all from China including 789 people) wher e routine HBV neonatal vaccine and HBIG were used, 
there was strong evidence that PLCS versus vaginal delivery could effectively reduce the rate of vertical 
transmission of HBV (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.28 –0.60) [30]. However, methodological concerns including lack of 
information on randomisation procedure, lack of allocation c oncealment and lack of blinding make the role of 
PLCS for preventing vertical transmission of HBV uncertain. A more recent meta -analysis including 10 eligible 
studies confirmed that there may not be additional benefit beyond appropriate vaccination and HBI G use [31]. 
Another meta -analysis suggested that oral antiviral therapies in pregnancy, including lamivudine, telbivudine and 
tenofovir DF, reduce the rates of vertical HBV transmission [32]. 
Although HBV DNA levels are increased as a result of HIV, the efficacy of oral nucleos(t)ide inhibitors in reducing 
the rate of vertical transmission in mono -infection, the efficacy of lamivudine, tenofovir DF and emtricitabine as 
part of cART in red ucing HBV DNA in non -pregnant individuals with HBV and HIV, and the use of tenofovir DF with 
either lamivudine or emtricitabine as standard practice in co -infected patients collectively provide further reason 
against recommending PLCS in those pregnant wom en with HBV and HIV. 
Immunoprophylaxis with HBV vaccine with or without HBIG given to the neonate has been shown in 
separate meta -analyses of randomised controlled trials to significantly reduce vertical transmission from women 
with HBV alone. 
HBIG should be given to the neonate if: 
• maternal HBV DNA concentration is >106 IU/mL 
• and/or the woman is HBeAg positive 
• or anti -HBe negative BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
64 
 
• or anti -HBe status is unknown [33]. 
In the absence of neonatal immunisation with HBV vaccine with or without HBIG, the rate of vertical transmission 
from a pregnant woman with HBV alone is 70 –90% if the woman is both HBsAg and HBeAg positive and 10 –40% if 
HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative. By co -administering vaccination (effectiveness of vaccine vs placebo RR: 0.28; 
95% CI 0.2 –0.4) and HBIG (effectiveness of HBIG/vaccine vs vaccine alone RR: 0.54; 95% CI 0.41 –0.73), 
transmission rates can be reduced to between 0% and 14%. The most important determinant of prophylaxis 
failure has been shown to be maternal serum HBV DNA levels. 
Failure of birth -dose vaccine and HBIG in up to 9% of infants despite appropriate post -delivery 
immunoprophylaxis occurs mainly because of infection in utero [34]. 
The strongest evidence of prevention of vertical transmission is for the use of birth -dose vaccination and HBIG in 
neonates born to high viraemic and HBeAg -positive mothers. 
A randomised controlled trial of tenofovir DF given to HBV mono -infected mothers (in addition to birth -dose 
vaccine and HBIG for the neonate) sh owed a significant reduction in vertical transmission in the tenofovir DF 
group [35]. All mothers randomly assigned to the tenofovir DF group received therapy from week 32 onwards. 
Only mothers with HBV DN A >200 000 IU/L showed transmission of infection. 
The inference, therefore, is that while birth -dose vaccination plus HBIG remains the cornerstone for prevention of 
vertical transmission of HBV, additional tenofovir DF with/without lamivudine is of benefit in mothers with very 
high viral loads and a reduction in viral load to <200 000 IU/L at birth is of additional benefit. 
Therefore, maternal cART together with prompt post -delivery neonatal immunoprophylaxis is the ideal approach 
for preventing vertical tr ansmission of HBV. This recommendation may change, therefore clinicians should refer 
to the Green Book [33] for the most up -to-date recommendations. 
7.2 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
It is recommended practice that all pregnant women with active HCV (HCV RNA positive) and HIV should be 
managed jointly with a clinicia n experienced in the management of these co -infections, and that those with 
advanced cirrhosis be managed in a tertiary centre with a hepatologist. 
Antenatal prevalence of HCV mono -infection ranges from less than 1% to about 2.5%, increasing to 3 –50% in co -
infection with the wide range reflecting the proportion of women who are injecting drug users or from high HCV 
prevalence areas in the cohorts studied [36,37]. Several meta -analyses and systematic reviews have shown that 
the overall rate of vertical transmission for HCV is approximately 5% (range 2 –10%) if the woman has HCV mono -
infection. 
Infection with HCV and HIV is associated with a significant increase in HCV transmission (OR up to 2.82) compared 
to HCV mono -infection [38,39]. Conversely, the higher risk of HCV transmission seems to be ameliorated in co -
infected mothers who have suppressed HIV on ART [40,41]. In addition, a higher rate of HCV vertical transmission 
is seen in women who have both HCV and HIV with HCV viraemia compared to those who have HCV and HIV but 
without HCV viraemia (OR 2.82) [38,39]. Acquisition of infection of HCV is more likely in infants acquiring HIV 
vertically, and vertical transmission of HIV occurs more often from women with HCV and HIV than from those 
with HIV alone (OR 1.82) with a modest association with HCV viral load [42]. 
Numerous studies have shown that the HCV viral load correlates with the risk of HCV vertical transmission and it 
is likely there is a linear relationship between viral load and transmission as for HIV [43-45]. Invasive obstetric 
procedures, internal fetal monitoring, prolonged rupture of membrane s and female infant sex have also been 
associated with transmission but breastfeeding and CS do not pose an additional risk in women with HCV alone 
[40,41]. Indeed some studies have shown a lower risk of HCV transmission in infants born by CS [46,47]. However, 
a meta -analysis in HCV mono -infected women concluded that there was no effec t of mode of delivery on risk of 
vertical transmission [48]. Effective cART significantly reduces the rate of HCV transmission, possibly by reducing 
HCV viraemia [40,49]. Lack of immune regulation during pregnancy may also facilitate HCV transmission via 
peripheral b lood monocytes [50]. No correlation between HCV genot ype or interleukin -28 polymorphisms and 
transmission has been identified [45,51,52]. Both intrauterine and intrapartum infection probably occur, but the 
relative contribution of each is uncertain. However, approximately one -third of neonates are HCV viraemic at BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
65 
 
birth suggesting acqu isition in utero [53]. 
7.2.1 On diagnosis of new HCV infection, confirmation of HCV viraemia with q uantitative RNA and 
genotype, assessment of hepatic inflammation/fibrosis and liver function and concomitant 
liver disease should be performed. 1C 
7.2.2 LFTs should be repeated at 2 and 4 weeks after commencing ART to detect evidence of 
hepatotoxicity or IRIS and then monitored regularly throughout pregnancy and postpartum. 1C 
In a pregnant woman living with HIV and newly diagnosed with HCV, in addition to referral to the local designated 
specialist, baseline investigations are indicated including the presence and level of the virus (HCV RNA viral load), 
the genotype and subtype, the degree of inflammation and synthetic function (ALT, AST, albumin and INR ), an 
assessment of fibrosis and the exclusion of additional causes of liver disease (e.g. haemochromatosis and 
autoimmune hepatitis). Additionally, patients should be assessed for: 
• The need for HAV immunisation (HAV IgG antibody); 
• The need for HBV immunis ation (anti -HBs); 
• HBV co -infection (HBsAg). 
Liver biopsy and hepatic elastometry (FibroScan) are relatively contraindicated during pregnancy [7], therefore 
clinical assessment, use of blood panel -based fibrosis markers (e.g. APRI or FIB -4) and an ultrasound scan of the 
liver and spleen should be undertaken where there is suspicion of advanced liver disease. It is important where 
cirrhosis is found to be pres ent that there is close liaison with the hepatologist because of a significantly increased 
rate of complications [8]. However, in the absence of decompensated disease, most women with cirrhosis do not 
have obstetric complications from their HCV infection. 
Because of the risk of cART -related hepatotoxicity and a hepatitis flare from immune reco nstitution, it is 
important to repeat LFTs at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of cART. Through pregnancy, LFT results are routinely 
monitored at each antenatal clinic appointment as a marker for potential obstetric complications (HELLP, pre -
eclampsia, acute fatty liver, etc.), particularly in the final trimester. Acute HCV infection is rare in pregnancy but 
HCV RNA, the initial test to become positive, should be measured where there is a sudden unexplained increase in 
transaminases and/or a history of exposu re. Where acute HCV infection is confirmed, HCV viral load should be 
monitored through pregnancy. Involvement of a clinician experienced in the management of hepatitis is 
important both for initial care and postpartum when treatment decisions are made. 
In chronic HCV infection there is unlikely to be a significant change in the HCV viral load during pregnancy. 
However, the prenatal viral load will give some indication of the risk of transmission and may be worth repeating 
near delivery. Treatment of HCV inf ection is not recommended during pregnancy. If pregnancy has occurred 
during treatment for HCV with pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin, or during DAA -based therapy, there 
should be immediate discontinuation of all HCV treatment. Ribavirin is teratoge nic (see below), and risk of 
teratogenicity may persist for weeks after discontinuation. Furthermore, ribavirin is able to penetrate in 
spermatozoa with the added risk of mutagenesis. The effects of DAAs in pregnant women are largely unknown 
[54]. In addition, thyroid function testing should be included as part of routine blood tests as thyroid dysfunction 
occurs in approximately 7% of patients on IFN therapy. 
Ribavirin has been assigned to category X by the FDA and is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Significant 
teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. It is 
contraindicated in pregnancy and i n the male partners of women who are pregnant. In the Ribavirin Registry, 
6.1% of women who received ribavirin at some point during their pregnancy had offspring with birth defects [55]. 
Given the evidence from animal data, women with co -infection should discontinue HCV therapy as soon as 
pregnancy is confirmed. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy during therapy and for the 6 months 
after completion of therapy in both female patients and in female partners of male patients who are taking 
ribavirin therapy. At least two rel iable forms of effective contraception must be utilised. The outcome of an 
exposed pregnancy should be reported prospectively to the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registries (email: 
pregnancyregistries@incr esearch.com ). 
There are limited data on the possible teratogenicity of DAA -based IFN -free therapy without ribavirin. The BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
66 
 
currently licensed DAA therapies sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed -dose combination (FDC), daclatasvir, 
dasabuvir, grazoprevir/el basvir FDC and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir FDC have not shown teratogenicity in small -animal 
studies, but have variable ability to cross the placenta and into breast milk [56-58]. 
Paritaprevir/ribavirin/ombitasvir FDC and daclatasvir have both shown risk of malformations in small animals at 
supranormal dose exposures [59,60]. 
There is no evidence that HCV can be transmitted vertically in the absence of HCV viraemia, therefore only 
viraemic patients would be considered for therapy. The current standard of care in HCV therapy is DAA -based IFN -
free therapy with or without ribavirin [61]. There are no definitive studies on the safety of HCV antiviral therapy 
during pregnancy. 
Finally, it is recognised that a small number of individuals with both HCV and HIV are HCV antibody negative but 
HCV viraemic. Where there is evidence of liver inflammation or fibrosis, profound immune deficiency or risk 
factors, an HCV viral load assay should be performed. 
 
7.2.3 Pregnant women with both HCV and HIV should not be treated for HCV with ribavirin -based 
directly acting antiviral (DAA) therapies, and all women who discover they are pregnant while 
receiving treatment should discontinue HCV therapy immediately. 1B 
7.2.4 Women with both HCV and HIV of child -bearing age wishing to become pregnant should be 
prioritised for DAA -based HCV therapy. 2D 
Given the issues with treatment during pregnancy and the postnatal period, it is the writing group’s view that 
HCV -infected women of child -bearing age wishing to become pregnant should be prioritised for DAA -based anti -
HCV therapy regardless of fibrosis stage , and should delay pregnancy until after treatment is completed or longer 
if ribavirin based as noted above. See section 9 for guidance on subsequent screening of the infant. 
7.2.5 Vaccination against HBV is recommended for all women with both HCV and HIV after the first 
trimester, unless already immune. 1C 
Immunisation for HBV uses an inactivated vaccine. Limited data are available on the use of HBV vaccination 
in pregnancy and none in pregnant women living with HIV. Moreover, no randomised tria l has been performed 
to determine the optimum dosing schedule for use in pregnancy [62]. Nevertheless, several guidelines indicate 
that pregnancy is not a contraindication for HBV immunisation, including in pregnant women with both HCV and 
HIV [25]. 
In single -arm open studies in HIV -negative persons, seroconversion rates for HBV are no different in the pregnant 
and non -pregnant woman and no fetal risks have been reported. In a prospective clinical trial in pregnant women, 
an accelerated schedule at 0, 1 and 4 months was found to be effective and well tolerated, and had the advantage 
of potential completion prior to delivery [63]. Patients with higher CD4 cell counts and on cART generally show 
improved responses to vaccination. Regardless of CD4 cell count, anti -HBs level sh ould be measured 6 –8 weeks 
after completion of vaccination. In a systematic review and meta -analysis of five studies, an increased -dose HBV 
vaccination schedule improved anti -HBs response rates compared to standard -dose HBV vaccination (OR 1.96; 
95% CI 1.4 7–2.61) with separate randomised trial data demonstrating improved serological response with four -
dose regimens [64]. 
7.2.6 In all HAV non -immune women with both HCV and HIV, HAV vaccination is recommended, 
after the first trimester as per the normal schedule (0 and 6 months); 1A 
 unless the CD4 cell count is <300 cells/mm3, when an additional dose (0, 1 and 6 months) may 
be indicated. 1D 
Immunisation for HAV also uses an inactivated vaccine and data for HAV vaccination in this setting are similarly 
limited. Individuals living with HIV with CD4 cell counts <300 cells/mm3 should receive three instead of the BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
67 
 
standard two dose s of HAV vaccine over 6 –12 months [25]. 
7.2.7 In the absence of obstetric complications, normal vaginal delivery can be recommended if the 
woman is receiving effective cART for HIV, irrespective of HCV viral load. 2C 
As HCV antiviral therapy is contraindicated in pregnant women due to possible teratogenicity, mode of delivery 
remains the only possible risk factor amenable to intervention. No randomised studies of CS compared to normal 
vaginal delivery to prevent vertic al transmission of HCV have been performed. In HCV mono -infection, two meta -
analyses failed to show a significant decrease in HCV vertical transmission among women who underwent CS 
compared with women who gave birth vaginally (OR 1.10 –1.19) [48]. In the first European Paediatric Hep atitis 
Network (EPHN) cohort, a subgroup analysis of women with both HCV and HIV ( n=503; 35.4%) demonstrated a 
reduced risk of vertical transmission of HCV with CS (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23 –0.80) [65]. However, in a later analysis 
also from the EPHN ( n=208; 15.0% ) no such association was found (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.23 –2.53) [40]. In this later 
analysis, the rate of vertical transmission of HCV was reduced (8.7% vs 13.9%) and more women probably 
received cART (41%), which was associated with a significant HCV viral load reduction compared to those who 
received HIV monotherapy or no therapy (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 –1.01). There was also a trend towards lower HCV 
viral load in this group, which may in part explain the findings. In addition, in a small French cohort of women with 
both HCV and HIV (29% on cART), rates of vertical transmission did not differ significantly betw een infants born by 
vaginal delivery or CS [66]. A recent systematic review concluded that no intervention, in terms of mode of 
delivery, obstetric intervention or avoidance of breastfeeding, reduces the risk of HCV transmission [67]. cART 
should be given to all pregnant women with both HCV and HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count or HIV viral load 
because of the evidence of increased HIV vertical transmission in this group. 
7.2.8 cART should be continued postpartum in all women with both HIV and HCV regardless of HCV 
viraemia, fi brosis stage or CD4 cell count. 1A 
Recommendations for lifelong ART are in line with current BHIVA guidelines [68] and sec tion 6 in these 
guidelines. Furthermore, effective HIV suppression improves liver histology even in the absence of effective HCV 
treatment [69,70].

8. Obstetric management 
8.1 Antenatal management 
8.1.1 Fetal ultrasound imaging should be performed as per national guidelines regardless of 
maternal HIV status. 1D 
The National Screening Committee [1] and the NICE antenatal guidelines [2] recommend that ultras ound 
screening for fetal anomaly should be offered to all pregnant women between 18+0 and 20+6 weeks’ gestation. 
There is no evidence to alter this for women living with HIV. 
In the past, because of a theoretical increased risk of anomaly due to first -trim ester ART exposure, more detailed 
ultrasound scanning (i.e. in a fetal medicine unit) has been considered. The evidence from prospective reports of 
first-trimester ART exposure to the APR [3] does not support the need for increased surveillance with the most 
commonly prescribed therapies (listed in Appendix 3), although with newer medication the knowledge base is 
inevitably limited (see also section 6). APR reports on the frequency and nature of birth defects and ART are 
updated every 6 months ( www.apregistry.com ). 
8.1.2 The combined screening test for fetal aneuploidi es and non -invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for 
those who screen as high risk is recommended as this has the best sensitivity and specificity 
and will minimise the number of women who may need invasive testing. 1A 
NICE antenatal guidelines [2] also recommend that all women should be offered screening for trisomies 13, 18 
and 21. The most effective screening is with the combined test at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks’ gestation. This includes 
maternal age, nuchal translucency, β-human chorioni c gonadotrophin (βHCG) and pregnancy -associated plasma 
protein A (PAPP -A). In the general population this has a detection rate of 92.6% with a false -positive rate of 5.2% 
[4]. 
For women who present too late for the combined test, the most clinicall y effective and cost -effective serum 
screening test for Down’s syndrome (triple or quadruple test) should be offered between 15 weeks 0 days and 20 
weeks 0 days [2]. However, significantly increased levels of βHCG and α-fetoprotein and lower levels of 
unconjugated oestri ol (the elements of the ‘triple test’) have been observed in women with HIV [5-7] while a 
reduction in βHCG in patients treated with PI -based [8] or NNRTI -based cART has been reported. Do wn’s 
syndrome is associated with increased βHCG, therefore HIV infection per se may increase the false -positive rate in 
women and thus increase the number of invasive tests offered compared with the general population [9]. PAPP -A 
and nuchal translucency are unaltered by HIV infection or ART [10] and thus are the preferred screening modality 
for women presenting between 15 and 20 weeks’ gestation. 
In 2016 the National Screening Co mmittee recommended that NIPT of free fetal DNA in maternal serum should 
be offered to all pregnant women in the UK who are stratified as high risk after the combined test or serum 
screening tests [11]; at the time of writing, widespread implementation of this has yet to be adopted. NIPT has 
been shown to be highly effective at screening for fetal aneuploidy, with a lower false -positive rate and higher 
positive pred ictive values than standard screening [12]. The adoption of NIPT for women stratified as high risk 
following screening will further reduce the number of women to whom invasive prenatal diagnostic tests are 
offered. 
8.1.3 Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should not be performed until after the HIV status of the 
woman is known, and should ideally be deferred until HIV viral load has been adeq uately 
suppressed to <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1C 
Limited data suggest that amniocentesis is safe in women on cART [13-15]. There are minimal data on other forms 
of prenatal invasive testing. It is now possible to use NIPT to screen for Down’s syndrome and other common 
aneuploidies. All clinicians performing a prenatal invasive test should know the woman’s HIV status, and if BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
73 
 
necessary delay the invasive test until the HIV result is available. Where possible, amniocentesis should be 
defer red until the viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. The fetal medicine team should discuss management with 
an HIV physician in cases where a woman has a detectable HIV viral load. 
8.1.4 If not on cART and the invasive diagnostic test procedure cannot be del ayed until viral 
suppression is achieved, it is recommended that women should commence cART to include 
raltegravir and be given a single dose of nevirapine 2 –4 hours prior to the procedure. 1D 
The French Paediatric HIV Infection Study Group observed an in creased risk of HIV transmission (RR 1.9; 95% CI 
1.3–2.7; P=0.003) with ‘antenatal procedures’ that included amniocentesis, cerclage, laser therapy and 
amnioscopy [16]. This study was conducted between 1985 and 1993 and, of the 1632 mother –infant pai rs (overall 
transmission 19%), only 100 women had received zidovudine, mostly for advanced HIV infection. 
There are few studies on the safety of invasive testing in the cART era. A study of 9302 pregnancies in France in 
2009 (including 166 during which an amniocentesis was performed) showed that the risk of vertical transmission 
of HIV in the untreated group increased from 16% to 25% in women who had an amniocentesis; in those on 
zidovudine alone the risk increased from 3% to 6% and in those on cART there w ere no transmissions in 81 
women who underwent amniocentesis [17]. Viral load data were not reported, but in other settings suppression 
of viral load r educes transmission. 
A further study of nine women on cART in France (in 2008) [15] and 17 women on cART in Portugal (1996 –2009) 
showed no transmissions, whereas transmission occurred in one of six women ei ther not diagnosed with HIV prior 
to amniocentesis, or not treated prior to the procedure. There are no studies and few case reports in the cART era 
examining chorionic villus sampling or cordocentesis [18]. For evidence relating to choice of ART to reduce 
trans mission risk associated with amniocentesis, see section 6.4. 
8.1.5 External cephalic version (ECV) can be offered to women with plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL. 2D 
ECV for breech presentation can be performed at term from 37+0 weeks of gestation in women with an 
undetectable plasma viral load. In nulliparous women, ECV may be offered from 36+0 weeks of gestation, in line 
with current guidance. 
There is less obstetric risk to the baby and woman when the fetus is head -down at the time of birth. ECV is a 
procedure by which the fetus, which is lying bottom first, is manipulated through the woman’s abdominal wall to 
the head -down position. If the fet us is not head down by about 36 weeks of pregnancy, ECV reduces the chance 
that the fetus will present as breech at the time of birth, and thus reduces the chance of caesarean section. There 
is no published evidence that helps decision making regarding ECV in the pregnant woman living with HIV. For the 
general maternity population, ECV is recommended [2]. There is a low rate of complications, with an estimated 
0.5% incidence of immediate caesarean section [2]. 
The question of whether ECV might increase the risk of vertical transmission of infections such as HIV is 
important; however, there is currently no direct evidence to support this. The incidence of fetomaternal 
haemorrhage after ECV has been estimated at 2.4%, this represents the new presence of fetal blood cells in the 
maternal ci rculation after the procedure [19]. It ha s been postulated that, due to the structure and function of the 
placenta, the risk of maternal blood entering the fetal circulation due to ECV is much lower [19]. It is also 
reassuring that in a randomised trial of fundal pressure to expel the baby during caesarean section, no evidence 
of matern al–fetal transfusion was found [20]. It is the writing group’s opinion, therefore, that ECV can be offered 
to women wi th a breech presentation who have a plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
8.2 Mode of delivery 
For women taking cART, a decision regarding recommended mode of delivery should be made after review of 
plasma viral load results at 36 weeks. 
8.2.1 For women with a plasma viral load of <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, and in the absence 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
74 
 
of obstetric contraindications, planned vaginal delivery should be supported. 
8.2.2 For women with a plasma viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, pre -labour CS 
(PLCS) should be considered, taking into account the actual viral load, the trajectory of the 
viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, obstetric fac tors and the woman’s 
views. 1C 
8.2.3 Where the viral load is ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL at 36 weeks, PLCS is recommended. 1C 
Published cohort data from the UK and other European countries have shown vertical transmission rates of <0.5% 
in women with plasma HIV RNA <50 HIV RNA copies/mL taking cART, irrespective of mode of delivery [21-25]. 
These studies support the practice of recommending planned vaginal delivery for women on cART with plasma 
viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
The most recent analysis from the NSHPC UK and Ireland surveillance study investigated vertical transmission of 
HIV in women delivering between 2000 and 2011 ( n=2000) [26] and found that the overall transmission rate in 
women with undetectable viral load (<50 HIV RNA copies/mL) was 0.09%, and 0.06% (4/6345) when two in utero 
transmissions were excluded; there was no significant difference betw een CS and planned vaginal delivery (0.11 % 
vs 0.15%; P=0.53). For all modes of delivery, risk of transmission was significantly higher when viral load was 
50–399 HIV RNA copies/mL than when fully suppressed (<50 HIV RNA copies/mL). Among 1033 women wit h viral 
load of 50 –399 HIV RNA copies/mL, vertical transmission rates were 0.8% following CS and 1.6% following 
planned vaginal delivery ( P=0.39). Women delivering by CS had a slightly shorter duration of cART than those who 
had planned vaginal deliveries in this group (median 12.4 vs 13.9 weeks; P=0.007). Excluding five in utero 
transmissions, the vertical transmission rate among women with viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA copies/mL was 
0.26% (2/777) following CS and 1.1% (2/188) following planned vaginal deli very ( P=0.17). 
A recent analysis from the ANRS French Perinatal cohort examined CS in 8977 women delivering on cART between 
2000 and 2010, and found no difference in unadjusted vertical transmission rates by mode of delivery in 3075 
women delivering at ter m (>37 weeks) with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL (0.3% for vaginal delivery, 0.3% 
for CS and 0.3% for non -CS; P=1.00). For 707 women who delivered at term with viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, there was also no difference in transmission by mod e of delivery (1.0%, 1.0% and 2.5% respectively; 
P=0.24). The authors did not comment on the timing of transmission in the infants diagnosed with HIV [27]. 
Older data were reported from the ANRS French Perinatal cohort of 5271 women delivering between 1997 and 
2004, of whom 48% were on cART. In women on cART with a delivery viral load <400 HIV RNA copies/mL there 
was no significant difference in vertical transmission rates according to mode of delivery, with 0.4% (3/747) 
transmission in the CS group compared with 0.5% (3/574) transmission in the vaginal delivery group ( P=0.35). The 
effect of mode of delivery was also analysed for women delivering with a viral load >10,000 HIV RNA cop ies/mL 
and no significant protective effect of CS was seen (OR 1.46; 95% CI 0.37 –5.80). Vertical transmission of HIV was 
low at 0.4% in women delivering with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL but mode of delivery data for this 
subset were not provided [25]. 
By contrast, data from the European Collaborative Study of 5238 women delivering between 1985 and 2007 
showed that in 960 women delivering with a viral load <400 HIV RNA copies/mL, PLCS was associated with an 80% 
decreased risk of vertical transmission aft er adjusting for cART and prematurity (adjusted OR 0.2; 95% CI 0.05 –
0.65). There were only two transmissions among 599 women delivering with viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL 
(transmission rate 0.4%) with one delivering vaginally at <34 weeks and one by eme rgency CS at 37 weeks, but 
further analysis was not possible [21]. 
A potential explanation for the differi ng conclusions of the effect of mode of delivery on vertical transmission in 
women with delivery plasma viral load <400 HIV RNA copies/mL in these two studies is that there may be a 
significant difference in the viral load distribution <400 HIV RNA copies/ mL between studies. This highlights the 
fact that it is not possible to infer that vertical transmission rates from studies using a viral load assay with a cut -
off value <400 HIV RNA copies/mL can necessarily be applied to patients with plasma viral loads of 50 –399 HIV 
RNA copies/mL using current assays with lower limits of detection of 50 HIV RNA copies/mL or less. 
Although neither of the most recent UK and French analyses showed a statistically significant difference in vertical BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
75 
 
transmission by mode of de livery for women with plasma viral loads between 50 and 399 HIV RNA copies/mL, in 
the UK/Ireland dataset the risk of vertical transmission for women delivering vaginally is about twice that of those 
delivering by CS, and this rises to four -fold when in ute ro transmissions are excluded. The writing group therefore 
recommends that CS should be considered in this group taking into account the actual viral load, the trajectory of 
the viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, obstetric factors a nd the woman’s views. 
Multiple observational studies and a randomised controlled trial established the benefit of CS in women not on 
effective ART, reducing the risk of vertical transmission by two -thirds in the pre -cART era. More recent 
observational studies only included very small numbers of women delivering vaginally with a viral load >400 HIV 
RNA copies/mL, due to the evolution of recommended clinical practice. Studies to date do not provide data to 
determine the vir al threshold above which CS should definitely be recommended. However, given the conflicting 
data regarding the effect of mode of delivery on vertical transmission in women with a viral load <400 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, together with the data from the UK study showing a 2.4 -fold increased risk of transmission for every 
1 log 10 unit increase in viral load associated with mode of delivery, the writing group continues to recommend CS 
for all women with a viral load ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
8.2.4 In women for whom a vaginal delivery has been planned and labour has commenced, obstetric 
management should follow the same guidelines as for the HIV -negative population, apart from 
duration of ruptured membranes (see section 8.3). 1C 
Traditionally amniotomy, fetal scalp e lectrodes and blood sampling, instrumental delivery and episiotomy have 
been avoided in HIV infection because of theoretical transmission risks. Data from the pre -cART era have been 
reviewed, and show little or no risk for many of these procedures. Scant d ata are available from the cART era. 
The French cohort (1985 –1993) provides data on the risk of various obstetric factors in a predominantly 
untreated, non -breastfeeding population. Procedures, classified as amniocentesis and other needling procedures, 
cerclage, laser therapy and amnioscopy, were associated with an increased risk of transmission (RR 1.9; 95% CI 
1.3–2.7). 
Fetal skin lesions (RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.7 –1.8) and episiotomy/tear (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7 –1.3) were not associated with 
transmission [16]. In a retrospective study from Spain, predominantly in the pre -cART era, HIV transmission 
occurred in 26.3% of infants exposed to fetal scalp monitoring (electrodes or pH sampling or both) compared 
with 13.6% exposed to neither type of monitoring (RR 1.94 ; 95% CI 1.12 –3.37) [28]. However, prolonged rupture 
of membranes was a significant contributor t o the risk of transmission associated with this invasive monitoring. In 
the Swiss cohort neither fetal scalp electrodes (RR 2.0; 95% CI 0.58 –6.91) nor pH blood sampling (RR 1.73; 
95% CI 0.58 –5.15) were confirmed as independent risk factors [29]. In the Women and Infants Transmission Study 
(WITS ) cohort (1989 –1994) artificial rupture of membranes (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.74 –1.53) and exposure to blood 
during labour (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.4 –1.27) or delivery (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.74 –1.52) were not associated with 
transmission [30]. 
Induction has previously been avoided as there were conc erns about the duration of ruptured membranes and 
risk of vertical transmission but recent evidence (see section 8.3) appears to be reassuring with regard to these 
concerns. 
Data from the predominantly untreated French cohort (1985 –1993) showed no risk wit h instrumental vaginal 
delivery (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6 –1.2) [16]. Data from the smaller Swiss cohort ( n=494; 1986 –1996; transmission rate 
16.2%) also failed to identify instrumental delivery as a risk factor for transmission (RR 1.82; 95% CI 0.81 –4.08) 
despite less than 20% of the cohort taking any ART for prophylaxis [29]. 
The NSHPC recently reported data on operative vaginal deliveries in women in the cART era between 2008 and 
2016; of 3023 vaginal deliveries, 251 infants were delivered with forceps or vacuum [13]. Infection status was 
available for 222/233 infants who had reached 18 months of age: one infant was diagnosed with HIV, but timing 
of infection is unclear and there were other risk factors present. This is consistent w ith previously reported 
transmission rates in this population, and numbers are too small to draw further conclusions. 
In the absence of trial data for women with HIV infection who undergo an operative vaginal delivery, evidence to 
support a benefit of any type of operative vaginal delivery compared to CS for women or their infants is limited to 
expert judgement and extrapolation from other datasets, and is subject to inherent biases. There are theoretical BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
76 
 
reasons why low cavity traction forceps may be prefe rred to a vacuum -assisted delivery (i.e. as it is generally 
accepted that they are associated with lower rates of fetal trauma than vacuum -assisted delivery). In women with 
a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL it is unlikely that the type of instrument used will affect transmission risk and 
thus the one the operator feels is most appropriate should be used as in the non -HIV population (and following 
national guidance [31]). 
The importance of the use of ART in the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV is clear an d undisputed. High -
quality studies to determine the remaining contribution of obstetric events and interventions to prevent 
transmission in the setting of a fully suppressed HIV viral load have not been performed and are unlikely to be 
performed in the nea r future. 
HIV DNA [32] and HIV RNA [33] in cervicovaginal lavage have been identified as independent transmis sion risk 
factors. Large cohort studies from the UK and Ireland as well as from France have concluded that there is no 
significant difference in vertical transmission in women with an undetectable HIV viral load when comparing 
those who have a planned vagi nal delivery and those who have a CS. These studies provide some reassurance 
with regard to concerns raised about possible discordance between plasma and genital tract viral load that have 
been reported in patients with an undetectable viral load on cART [34-37]. The clinical significance of this 
phenomenon is not clear and further research is warranted. 
Furthermore, there are reassuring results from the limited studies that have examined the effect on vertical 
transmission of amniocentesis and length o f time of rupture of membranes in women on cART and in those with a 
viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. An association between vertical transmission and the use of instrumental 
delivery, amniotomy and episiotomy is not supported by data from the pre -cART era and there is a lack of data 
from the cART era. Therefore, while acknowledging the potential for discordance between the plasma and genital 
tract viral load, the writing group considers that there is no compelling evidence to support the continued 
avoidanc e of these procedures as well as induction of labour in women on cART for whom a vaginal delivery had 
been recommended on the basis of viral load. 
The data regarding fetal blood sampling and the use of scalp electrodes also originate from the pre -cART era and 
have yielded conflicting results. The writing group acknowledges a lack of data from the cART era, but concludes 
that it is unlikely that the use of fetal scalp electrodes or fetal blood sampling confers increased risk of 
transmission in a woman with a n undetectable viral load although this cannot be proven from the current 
evidence. Electronic fetal monitoring should be performed according to national guidelines [31]. HIV infection per 
se is not an indication for continuous fetal monitoring as there is no incr eased risk of intrapartum hypoxia or 
sepsis. If the woman has no other risk factors, she can be managed by midwives either in a midwifery -led unit or 
at home. She will need to continue with cART through labour and adequate provision needs to be made for 
examination and testing of the newborn and dispensing of medication to the newborn in a timely fashion (see 
section 9). 
8.2.5 Vaginal birth after CS (VBAC) can be offered to women with a viral load <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL. 1D 
In the absence of randomised trial data for women with HIV infection who undertake VBAC, evidence to support a 
benefit of VBAC and vaginal birth over CS is limited to expert judgement that is subject to inherent biases. 
The probability of a successful vaginal delivery remai ns dependent on current and past obstetric factors. In 
general, provided that the woman is being cared for in a consultant -led maternity unit and the labour properly 
monitored with rapid recourse to CS in the face of any difficulty, the outcome of trial of labour for both the 
woman and neonate is good, even if scar dehiscence occurs [38]. In the general maternity population, 70% of 
women who attempt VBAC manage a vaginal delivery with a uterine rupture rate of around 0.3%. Therefore, 
where a vaginal birth has been recommended on the basis of cART and viral load, maternal management of the 
delivery, including a decision regarding VBAC, should be as for a woman without HIV. 
8.2.6 Where the indication for CS is the prevention of vertical transmission, CS should be 
undertaken at between 38 and 39 weeks’ gestation. 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
77 
 
 Where PLCS is undertaken only for obstetric indications and plasma viral load is <50 HIV 
RNA copies/mL, the usual obstetric considerations apply and the CS will usually be 
performed after 39 weeks’ gestation . 
 1C 
The timing of CS is a balance between the risks of transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) and the likelihood 
of labour supervening before the scheduled CS [39]. Where the indication for CS is prevention of vertical 
transmission, the earlier timing reflects the importance of avoiding the onset of labour. In these cases, the ri sk of 
transmission associated with labour and SROM is considered to outweigh the risk of TTN. Where CS is undertaken 
only for obstetric indications, the optimal timing of PLCS is after 39 weeks of gestation [38]. The risk of TTN at this 
gestation is approximately 1 in 300 and this risk doubles for every week earlier that delivery occurs. The 
administration of steroids to the woman to reduce the risk of TTN should be considered prior to 38 completed 
weeks. The NICE guidelines committee on preterm labour and birth found no reliable evidenc e of benefit of 
antenatal corticosteroids in terms of fetal or neonatal death, intraventricular haemorrhage, chronic lung disease 
or reducing requirement for ventilation or pressure support after 36 weeks’ gestation [40]. However, a 
subsequent meta -analysis showed that maternal corticostero ids reduced the risk of respiratory distress syndrome 
in infants born at 37 weeks’ gestation (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.27 –0.59) [41]. Therefore, maternal corticosteroid 
administration should be considered where PLCS is carried out before 39 weeks. 
8.3 Management of SROM 
8.3.1 In all cases of term pre -labour SROM, delivery within 24 hours should be the aim. 1C 
8.3.2 If maternal HIV viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate induction or augmentation 
of labour is recommended in women who have pre -labour SROM, with a low threshold for 
treatment of intrapartum pyrexia. For all women with viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, 
obstetric management should aim for delivery within 24 hours of SROM. 1C 
8.3.3 For women with SROM and a last measured plasma viral load of 50 –399 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, immediate CS is recommended, but should take into account the actual viral 
load, the trajectory of the viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, 
obstetric factors and the woman’s views. 1C 
8.3.4 For women with SROM and matern al HIV viral load ≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL, immediate CS is 
recommended. 1C 
In the pre -cART era, several studies [30,42,43] suggested that prolonged duration of ruptured membranes, 
usually defined as more than 4 hours, in women who were either untreated or if treated were largely 
receiving zidovudine monotherapy, resulted in a significantly increased risk of vertical transmission. A widely 
quoted meta -analysis (not reporting viral load data) subsequently showed a 2% increase in relative risk of 
transmission per hour of mem brane rupture ( adjusted OR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 –1.04; for each 1 -h increment). 
Transmission increased from 12% with <1 hour of membrane rupture to 19% with >12 hours of membrane 
rupture [44]. 
There are few published studies on SROM from the cART era. A study from Spain of 500 women living with 
HIV examined the effect of various obstetric risk factors on vertical transmission rates in women on no 
treatment, monotherapy or dual therapy, and in those on cART. Ruptured membranes >6 hours compared to 
<6 hours was only significantly associated with transmission in the group of women receiving no treatment 
(26.6% vs 11.9%; P<0.01). Corresponding transmission rates were 14.3% versus 7.1% ( P=NS) for the 
monotherapy or dual therapy group and 0.8% versus 0.0% ( P=NS) for the women on cART [45]. 
The NSHPC has reported data on 1464 women with undetectable viral load with duration of SROM for births 
at term between 2007 and 2012. In these 1464 women delivering with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
78 
 
the vertical transmission rate was 0.12% (1/809) in women with SROM <4 hours and 0.15% (1/655) in 
women with SROM ≥4 hours and <24 hours ( OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.07 –18.27 ). There were no transmissions in 
the 55 women with viral load <50 RNA copies/mL and duration of SROM >24 hours, but this represents very 
few cases [46]. Data from North America in 2012 showed similar results. In over 700 women with HIV (89% 
received cART , 10% monotherapy and 1% no treatment), the perinatal transmission rate was 1% in those 
with SROM <4 hours and 1.9% in those with SROM for >4 hours. In those with a viral load <1000 HIV RNA 
copies/mL there were no cases of perinatal transmission (493 cases with SROM up to 25 hours). Only viral 
load >10,000 HIV RNA copies/mL was shown to be an independent risk factor [47]. Therefore, for women on 
cART with SROM at term with a v iral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL and who do not have an obstetric 
contraindication to vaginal delivery, a CS is not recommended for the prevention of vertical transmission. 
When planning the birth, it should be discussed that women are recommended to contac t their maternity 
unit for in -person assessment as soon as any SROM is suspected. Women with HIV with a history of SROM 
should be prioritised for induction/augmentation when they present. Obstetricians should be aware that 
although there is no evidence of increased transmission risk in women with undetectable viral load with 
SROM <4 hours and 4 to <24 hours, there are few data for transmission risk beyond this time, and therefore 
they should aim for delivery within 24 hours, weighing up the risks of interve ntion as appropriate. 
As both acute and chronic chorioamnionitis have been associated with perin atal transmission [43,48 -50], 
albeit from studies largely performed in the pre -cART era, it is recommended that labour should be 
expedited for all women with SROM at term. Hence women with SROM at term with a viral load <50 HIV 
RNA copies/mL should have immediate induction with a low threshold for the treatment of intrapartum 
pyrexia. The NICE induction of labour guidelines [51] and the NICE intrapartum guidelines [31] should be 
followed with regard to use of antibiotics and mode of induction. 
NSHPC data for the effect of SROM more than or less than 4 hours for women with a viral load >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL are more difficult to interpret as the numbers are currently small. In the published analysis, there 
was no significant difference in vertical transmission rates between SROM <4 hours and SROM 4 to 
<24 hours in women at all viral load levels (vertical transmission rates were 0.34% and 0.64% respectively; 
OR 1.90; 9 5% CI 0.45 –7.97). However, transmission rates were 0.13% in women with viral load <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL (2/1519), 2.05% in women with viral load of 50–999 HIV RNA copies/mL (3/146) and 23.08% 
in women with viral load >10,000 HIV RNA copies/mL (3/13) . There were too few women for a subgroup 
analysis comparing vertical transmission rates with SROM <4 hours and >4 hours in women with viral load 
>50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
A single -centre study from Miami of 707 women on ART showed that SROM >4 hours was associated with an 
increased risk of vertical transmission if the viral load was >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL. There was no 
association at <1000 HIV RNA copies/mL, but it is not possible to determine the number of women with a 
viral load greater than 50 and les s than 1000 HIV RNA copies/mL in this group. 
It is the recommendation of the writing group that CS should be considered for women with a viral load of 
50–399 HIV RNA copies/ mL at term. Again, if CS is not carried out, delivery should be expedited to occur 
within 24 hours, as above. 
Until further data are available, an urgent (category 2) CS is recommended where the viral load is >400 HIV 
RNA copies/mL regardless of treatment [52]. 
In women who have a detectable viral load it may be possible to optimise their cART regimen to reduce t he 
risk of vertical transmission (see recomme ndation 6.3.3 ). 
8.3.5 The management of preterm SROM at ≥34 weeks is the same as that of term SROM, except 
that women at 34 –37 weeks’ gestation will require group B streptococcus prophylaxis in line 
with nationa l guidelines. 1C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
79 
 
8.3.6 When preterm SROM occurs at <34 weeks: 
• Intramuscular steroids should be administered in accordance with national guidelines; 
• Where HIV viral load is not controlled, this should be optimised; 
• There should be multidisciplinary discussion about the timing and mode of delivery. 1C 
There are no data to inform the optimum management of preterm labour in women living with HIV. 
Decisio ns regarding the optimum management of early preterm SROM require the assessment of a number 
of factors including the exact gestation, the facilities available, maternal viral load and the presence of other 
comorbidities such as infection and pre -eclampsia . Corticosteroids to improve fetal lung maturation and oral 
erythromycin should be given as per the NICE guidelines on preterm labou r [40]. Decisions regarding timing 
of delivery should be made in consultation with the full MDT including the neonatal unit. Induction is 
recommended from 34 weeks’ gestation in women with SROM who are not in labour to minimise the risk of 
developing chorioamnionitis. 
If maternal HIV viral load is not fully suppressed, consideration should be given to the options available to 
optimise therapy. An additional concern is that the early preterm infant may be unable to tolerate oral 
therapy and therefore loading the infant through the trans placental route with maternal ART is 
recommended (see section 6 for further information on cART in pregnancy). There is most experience with 
maternal oral nevirapine 200 mg stat > 2 hours prior to delivery, but double -dose tenofovir DF and standard -
dose ral tegravir 400 mg bd should also be considered. 
8.4 Use of intrapartum intravenous infusion of zidovudine 
8.4.1 Intrapartum intravenous zidovudine infusion is recommended in the following circumstances: 
 For women with a viral load >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL plasma who present in labour or with 
SROM or who are admitted for PLCS. 1C 
 For untreated women presenting in labour or with SROM in whom the current viral load is not 
known. 1C 
 The use of intrapartum intravenous zidovudine infusion can be considered i n women on cART 
with a plasma HIV viral load <1000 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1C 
The use of intravenous zidovudine for women on cART with a viral load between 50 and 1000 HIV RNA copies/mL 
can be considered regardless of mode of delivery. However, continued oral dosing of their current regimen is a 
reasonable alternative. 
Intravenous zidovudine (as part of an intervention package; see section 6.4) has also been recommended for 
women who present in labour having not received ART. 
From the updated French data, there is no evidence that intrapartum intravenous zidovudine further reduces the 
risk of vertical transmission in women on cART unless maternal HIV viral load is >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL and this 
benefit is no longer seen if intensive neonatal therapy is given [53]. However, individual circumstances vary, and 
intravenous zidovudine may be considered as one of a number of maternal intrapartum antiretroviral options for 
women with viral load >50 HIV RNA copies/mL who present in labour or with SROM or who are admitted for CS 
provided this does not delay other interventions. 
8.5 Multiple pregnancies 
There are no published studies comparing multiple versus singleton pregnancies in HIV. Based on the available 
evidence, comprising expert opinion, there is no increased risk of vertical transmission in multiple pregnancies. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
80 
 
Multiple pregnancies are more common in older pregnant women with HIV than in the HIV -negative population 
[54]. The number of pregnant women with HIV over 40 years of age has increased from 2% of all pregnant women 
over 40 in 2000 –2004, to 9% in 2010 –2014 [54], therefore further data are likely to emerge. Multiple pregnancies 
should be managed according to obstetric need of the woman and as per HIV -negative protocols. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
81 
 
8.6 Place of birth 
8.6.1 All women living with HIV are recommended to give birth in a fa cility that has direct access to 
paediatric care (i.e. a co -located birth centre or obstetric unit). 1D 
Given that infants born to women living with HIV will require PEP as soon as possible after birth and within 
4 hours (see section 9) and a blood test, the writing group recommends that all women living with HIV give birth 
in a facility that has direct access to paediatric care (i.e. a co -located birth centre or obstetric unit). 
8.7 Water birth 
8.7.1 There is scant safety evidence to support water births in women living with HIV; however, 
women who choose a water birth should be supported to achie ve this where the viral load is 
<50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 1D 
A Cochrane review published in 2018 examined obstetric outcomes following immersion during the first and 
second stages of labour (15 trials included). Outcomes related to HIV were not specifically reviewed. Overall, 
there was little or no difference in spontaneous vaginal birth, instrumental birth or CS with water immersion in 
the first stage (moderate - to low -quality evidence), but immersion in the first stage may reduce the use 
of regional anaesthesia (moderate -quality evidence). For women immersed in the second stage, there was little 
or no difference between groups for spontaneous vaginal birth. The quality of evidence was very low for the 
outcomes instrumental birth, CS or neona tal intensive care unit admissions therefore it remains uncertain 
whether water birth makes any difference. There was no evidence on the incidence of third - or fourth -degree 
tears, blood loss or neonatal infection. When immersion in water during the second stage of labour and birth 
was compared to no immersion, there was one reported death in the immersion group in one trial. The infant 
was born alive to a woman with HIV who was treated 2 weeks prior to birth for vaginal infection. The infant died 
at 2.5 hours after birth. After investigation the cause of death was determined to be intrauterine infection [55]. 
The writing group recommends that the lack of safety evidence should be discussed with women living with HIV 
who are considering a water birth. Women who choose to give birth in water should be supported to do so where 
the viral load is <50 HIV RNA copi es/mL.

9. Neonatal management 
9.1 Infant PEP 
Infant PEP should be started within 4 hours of delivery (see Figure 9 .1 and Appendix 3). 
9.1.1 VERY LOW RISK 1C 
 Two weeks of zidovudine monotherapy is recommended if all the following criteria are met: 
• The woman has been on cART for longer than 10 weeks; 
AND 
• Two documented maternal HIV viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL during pregnancy 
at least 4 weeks apart; 
AND 
• Maternal HIV viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at or after 36 weeks. 
9.1.2 LOW RISK 1C 
 Extend to 4 weeks of zidovudine monotherapy: 
• If the criteria in 9.1.1 are not all fulfilled but maternal HIV viral load is <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL at or after 36 weeks; 
• If the infant is born prematurely (<34 weeks) but most recent maternal HIV viral load 
is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
9.1.3 HIGH RISK 1C 
 Use combination PEP if maternal birth HIV viral load is known to be or likely to be >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL on day of birth, if uncertainty about recent maternal adherence or if viral load is not 
known. 
9.1.4 Neonatal PEP should be commenced as soon as possible after birth, and at least within 4 
hours . 1D 
9.1.5 In the context of known maternal resistance to zidovudine with VERY LOW or LOW RISK, 
zidovudine monotherapy is still recommended for infant PEP. 1D 
9.1.6 If HIGH RISK (combination PEP indicated ) and there is a history of documented maternal 
zidovudine and/or nevirapine resistance, seek expert advice. If advice is not immediately 
available, commence standard three -drug PEP (zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) until 
guidance is provided. 1D 
As critical decisions relating to categorisation of risk relate directly to the maternal viral load at the time of 
delivery, the writing group recommends that this result should be available as early as possible and certainly 
within 72 hours of delivery. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum

Figure 9.1 . Algorithm for infant treatment 
9.1.1 VERY LOW RISK 
Zidovudine monotherapy for the infant has been part of the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV strategy 
since the publication of the results of the ACTG 076 trial in 1994 [1]. The relative contributions of the antenatal, 
peripartum and infant components have been difficult to quantify. In the ACTG 076 study, neonatal zi dovudine 
2 mg/kg every 6 hours was given for 6 weeks. 
In the last version of the BHIVA pregnancy guidelines, 4 weeks of oral zidovudine was recommended for all infants 
except in specific HIGH -RISK circumstances relating to detectable or unknown maternal viral load at time of 
delivery [2]. This has been part of a hugely successful strategy to reduce the vertical transmission rate in the UK 
and Ireland with transmission now occurring only under exceptional circumstances [3]. 
In Germany, in an attempt to reduce neonatal exposure to zidovudine further, a strategy of using 2 weeks of 
neonat al zidovudine in the lowest -risk situations has been recommended for over 10 years with no signal that this 
has resulted in increased transmission [4]. 
French cohort data have provided further evidence that reducing neona tal PEP duration would be safe. No 
transmissions occurred among 2651 infants born to women receiving ART before conception, continuing ART 
throughout pregnancy and delivery with an HIV viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL (upper 95% CI 0.1%) [5]. 
Although this report does not specify the nature of neonatal PEP received, the absence of any transmission in this 
‘real world’ setting gives support to the recommendation of reducing the duration of infant PEP as long as specific 
criteria are fulfilled. 
BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
88 
 
In the pre -cART era, a randomised placebo -contr olled trial of zidovudine monotherapy in Thailand compared four 
strategies for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV: 
• Maternal zidovudine monotherapy from 28 weeks’ gestation through to delivery and neonatal zidovudine 
for 6 weeks (long -long); 
• Maternal zidovudine from 35 weeks' gestation and neonatal zidovudine for 3 days (short -short); 
• Maternal zidovudine from 28 weeks' gestation and neonatal zidovudine for 3 days (long -short); 
• Maternal zidovudine from 35 weeks' gestation and neonatal zidovudine for 6 weeks (short -long). 
Analysis demonstrated the efficacy of the 'long -short' regimen to be equivalent to that of the 'long -long' regimen. 
This led the authors to conclude that a regimen of 3 days of PEP would be sufficient when the woman had 
commence d zidovudine at 28 weeks' gestation [6]. 
Adult PEP guidelines for sexual exposure to HIV now recommend against PEP in the context of known viral load 
<50 HIV RNA copies/mL, based on strong evidence provided by large randomised trials investigating treatment as 
prevention of transmission [7]. In Switzerland, this evidence has now been extrapolated to the context of the 
prevention of vertical transmission of HIV, supporting the national guidelines recommending no PEP to infants 
born to women on cART with documented viral load <50 HIV RNA copie s/mL on the two most recent 
measurements prior to delivery. For all other situations three -drug combination PEP is recommended [8]. 
It is the writing group’s opinion that adult 'treatment as prevention' studies s hould be extrapolated to the 
prevention of vertical transmission with caution. The HIV transmission risk for peripartum exposure is much 
higher than for sexual or occupational exposure (10 –20% vs 0.1–1.5%) [7,9] . The nature of exposure is also 
different. The fetus may be exposed at any time from conception to delivery; exposure at the time of delivery 
carries a particularly HIGH RISK. 
Mother -to-infant trafficking of maternal cells (including CD4 cells) occurs and these cells can persist in the infant 
circulation after birth [10]. Although the relevance of this pr ocess in HIV transmission is not known, it has recently 
been suggested to have implications for vertical transmission of HBV [11]. Of note, this was the justification for 
6 weeks of neonatal PEP in the original ACTG 076 study [1]. 
For these reasons, a 'no PEP' strategy is not included in this current BHIVA guideline. However, in the context of 
extremely low transmission rates in the UK, the writing group now recommends a shortened, 2 -week cours e of 
zidovudine in VERY LOW RISK situations. 
European cohort data indicate that risk of transmission remains LOW and stable if maternal cART is initiated more 
than 10 weeks prior to delivery [12]. Two weeks of infant zidovudine is therefore recommended i f a woman has 
been on cART for more than 10 weeks, with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL on the most recent two occasions 
during pregnancy prior to delivery (at least 4 weeks apart) and a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at or after 
36 weeks' gestat ion. There is no need to extend the duration of PEP to 4 weeks for breastfed infants if all the 
criteria for very low risk are met (see section 9.4.4 on breastfeeding). 
9.1.2 LOW RISK 
Two weeks of zidovudine is only recommended if all criteria in section 9 .1.1 are met. If these criteria are not met 
but the maternal viral load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at time of delivery, zidovudine therapy should be extended 
to 4 weeks as in the 2014 BHIVA guidelines [2]. Cohort data indicate that prematurity is still possibly a risk factor 
for transmission [13]. Although it is difficult to determine the contribution of reduced duration of ART to this 
increased risk, the writing group recommends the use of 4 weeks of infant zidovudine if the woman commenced 
ART in pregnancy and delivers prematurely (<34 weeks) with a viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
If the criteria in section 9.1.1 are fulfilled and the infant commences zidovudine monotherapy but the maternal 
delivery HIV viral load is su bsequently discovered to be greater than 50 HIV RNA copies/mL the duration of infant 
PEP should be extended to 4 weeks. 
 
9.1.3 HIGH RISK 
There is one large randomised controlled trial of combination therapy in neonates born to women who did not BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
89 
 
receive ART prior to delivery [14]. Infants were randomly allocated at less than 48 hours of age to: 6 weeks of 
zidovudine monotherapy; 6 weeks of zidovudine with three doses of nevirapine in the first week of life; or 
6 weeks of zidovudine, with nelfinavir and lamivudine for 2 weeks. The HIV vertical transmission rate was 8.5%, 
and in multivariate analysis only ART arm and maternal HIV viral load were significantly associated with 
transmiss ion. Perinatal transmission was two -fold higher in the zidovudine alone arm compared to the multiple 
ART arms ( P=0.034). There was no significant difference in transmission rates between the two multiple ART 
arms. Neonatal neutropenia was significantly higher in the three -drug arm. 
In a randomised African study, babies born to women presenting at delivery received single -dose nevirapine or 
single -dose nevirapine and 1 week of zidovudine. Of those HIV negative at birth, 34 (7.7%) who receive d 
nevirapine plus zidovudine and 51 (12.1%) who received nevirapine alone were infected ( P=0.03); protective 
efficacy was 36% for the dual combination [15]. 
However, in two other randomised African studies where the women received short -course ART, for infants who 
did not acquire HIV at birth there was no significant difference in t ransmission rate at 6 weeks for dual versus 
monotherapy short -course regimens for the infant: zidovudine plus lamivudine versus nevirapine [16]; or 
zidovudine plus nevirapine versus nevirapine [17]. 
NSHPC data from the UK and Ireland (2001 –2008) demonstrate how the use of combination PEP in neonates has 
increased over time [18]. In total, 99% of 8205 infants received any PEP; for the 86% with data on type of PEP, 3% 
received dual and 11% triple regimens. The use of triple PEP increased significantly over this period, from 43% to 
71% for infants born to untreated women, and from 13% to 32% where women were viraemic despite cART. HIV 
infection status was known for 89% of infants with information on PEP; 14.7% of infants who received no PEP 
were infected (5 of 34, all born vaginally to untreated women compared to 1.0% of those who received any PEP 
[72 of 7286]). Among infants born vaginally to untreated women, those who received PEP were significantly less 
likely to be infected than those who did not (8.5% [4/47] vs 45.5% [5/11]; P=0.002). However, in this cohort study, 
because of the overall low rate of transmission and selective use of triple PEP for infants at higher risk of HIV, it 
was not possible to explore the association between type of PEP and infection status. 
Data from the European Pregnancy and Paediatric Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) has shown increasing use of 
combination PEP across Europe. In 5285 HIGH -RISK mother –infant pairs (27.7% no antenatal or intrapartum 
antiretroviral prophylaxis, 17.3% only intrapa rtum prophylaxis, 55.0% detectable viral load at delivery despite 
antenatal ART), 23.9% of infants received combination PEP. Study results did not indicate an advantage of 
combination PEP compared to single -drug neonatal prophylaxis; however, the authors c oncluded that this 
observation may result from confounding or combination PEP only being effective in a subgroup of HIGH -RISK 
infants [19]. 
There are no randomised trials of combination PEP for infants where women are receiving cART. In a 
French study, trans mission rates with dual therapy (zidovudine and lamivudine) given to both the neonate 
and woman (1.6%) were lower than zidovudine monotherapy reported in historical controls (6.8%; OR 0.22; 
95% CI 0.2 –0.5) [20]. 
When an infant has been started on combination PEP because the maternal viral load was considered likely to be 
>50 HIV RNA copies/mL a t delivery and subsequently the delivery maternal viral load is shown to be <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, it is reasonable to simplify the infant PEP to zidovudine monotherapy as in section 9.1.2. 
 
9.1.4 Choice of triple combination PEP for neonates 
Most neonates born in the UK to women known to have HIV will be exposed to ART in utero , during delivery and 
in the first month of life. The range of combinations of ART to which neonates are being exposed in utero 
continues to increase. Neonatal drug metabolism is gen erally slower than that of older infants or children and is 
even less efficient in premature neonates. Due to a lack of neonatal pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies and 
suitable formulations, ART dosing regimens remain restricted to a small proportion of antiretrovirals (Appendix 3). 
For infants born to ART -naïve women, or where drug resistance is unlikely, zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine 
is a well -tolerated combination regimen with the most clinical experience [18,19,21 -24] (see Appendix 3 for 
dosing). BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
90 
 
Neonatal pharmacokinetic studies have been perfor med for zidovudine [25], lamivudine [26,27] , tenofovir DF 
[28] and emtricitabine [29] and dosing regimens are available for most of the nucleoside analogues from 
age 1 month [30]. 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of nevirapine in neonates have been described in detail [31-35]. 
In contrast to the PIs, nevirapine efficiently crosses the placenta (see below) and is well absorbed by the neonate 
[36]. Neonatal metabolism of nevirapine is induced where there has been antenatal in utero exposure [31,32] ; if 
this drug is given to the neonate when the women has taken it for 3 or more days, the full dose of 4 mg/kg/day 
should be started at birth, rather than the induction dose of 2 mg/kg/day (Appendix 3). In combination PEP, 
owing to its long half -life, nevirapine should be stopped 2 weeks before co -pres cribed antiretroviral drugs to 
reduce the risk of nevirapine monotherapy exposure and the development of NNRTI resistance should 
transmission have occurred. 
The recommended regimen for standard three -drug PEP is therefore a total of 2 weeks of nevirapine (at full or 
incremental dosing) with 4 weeks of zidovudine and lamivudine as shown in detail in Appendix 3. 
Dosing for raltegravir for neonates has recently been described (IMPAACT P1110). This requires increasing doses 
after the first and fourth weeks of life [37] (see Appendix 3). As raltegravir may affect bilirubin metabolism, total 
and split bilirubin should be checked during the first week o f life, although the risk of discontinuation due to 
hyperbilirubinaemia in the study was low [37]. Appropriate raltegravir dosing for premature neonates is not yet 
available, and they are more vulnerable to hyperbilirubinaemia. 
The writing group therefore recommends that raltegravir should only be prescribed to preterm neonates in 
exceptional circumstances. Its use should only be considered after seeking expert advice and where there is 
multidrug resistance. 
Pharmacokinetics -supported dosing is available for lopinavir/r based on infants who have acquired HIV initiating 
therapy in the first 6 weeks of life [38-40] and a study that included infants treated from birth [41]. However, 
evidence of adrenal suppression has been documented in some neonates treated with lopinavir/r, particularly 
preterm infants [42]. This is in addition to case reports of cardiac, renal and neurological toxicity, especially in, but 
not restricted to, premature infants, and including one death during PEP with lopinavir/r [43]. No effects have 
been observed with maternal lopinavir/r in the absence of neonatal dosing. It remains unclear whether these 
effects are related to lop inavir/r specifically or could be seen with other ritonavir -boosted PIs. 
The writing group therefore recommends that lopinavir/r should be avoided in routine infant PEP and should only 
be prescribed to preterm neonates in exceptional circumstances. Its us e should only be considered after seeking 
expert advice and where there is multidrug resistance. Close metabolic monitoring in hospital should be 
undertaken for the first 5 days of life. 
9.1.5 Intravenous ART in the neonate 
The only licensed ART available for intravenous use in sick and/or premature neonates who are unable to take 
oral medication is zidovudine [25,44] . Reduced oral and intravenous dosing schedules for premature infants are 
available (Appendix 3). 
The very premature neonate is at risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) if enteral feeding is commenced too soon 
or increased too rapidl y. It is not known whether very early enteral administration of ART can exacerbate this risk. 
In a large French case -controlled study of NEC, being an infant of a woman with HIV was associated with an 
increased risk of NEC (OR 6.63; 95% CI 1.26 –34.8; P=0.0 25), although the numbers were too small to ascertain the 
effect of maternal and/or infant ART [45]. Premature infants should be commenced on intravenous zidovudine 
until enteral feeding is established, when zidovudine may be given enterally. The premature dosing regimen 
should be used (Append ix 3). 
The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is the only other antiretroviral that is administered parenterally, usually 
subcutaneously, in adults and children. Enfuvirtide does not cross the placenta. Although intravenous enfuvirtide 
has been given to a small number of infants born to women with multidrug -resistant HIV, no formal neonatal 
pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to date. An unlicensed intravenous dosing regimen for infants at 
risk of multidrug -resistant HIV has been adapted from the paediat ric subcutaneous treatment study [46] and an 
adult intravenous dosing study [47] (see Appendix 3 and s eek expert advice). BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
91 
 
9.1.6 Timing of neonatal PEP 
All infant PEP should be started within 4 hours of delivery. 
There are no clear data on how late infant PEP can be initiated and still have an effect, but all effective studies of 
infant PEP have started t reatment early and animal data show a clear relationship between time of initiation and 
effectiveness, with no benefit demonstrated if commenced after >72 hours [48-50]. Immediate administration of 
PEP is especially important where the woman has not received a ny ART. 
9.1.7 Maternal genotypic resistance 
For infants born to women on fully suppressive cART, zidovudine monotherapy PEP remains reasonable, even 
where the woman has a previous history of zidovudine exposure with resistance (thymidine -associated 
mutatio ns). On cART, the risk of transmission from a woman with fully suppressed viral replication is extremely 
low (∼0.1%) and, although history of zidovudine resistance in maternal virus and infant PEP regimen has not been 
dissected, the frequency of transmissi on of zidovudine -resistant virus is concomitantly very low. 
Despite minimal supporting evidence, this has been standard practice in the UK for several years without a signal 
from cohort data that transmissions are occurring in this context. Theoretical su pport for this approach comes 
from evidence that wild -type virus may be preferentially transmitted in the context of a maternal mixed 
population including zidovudine -resistant virions [51]. Furthermore, Swiss cohort data demonstrated no 
transmission among six infants born to women with zidovudine -resistant virus [52]. A substudy of the ACTG 076 
trial showed that low -level zidovudine resistance was not associated with an increased risk of transmission [53]. 
Retrospective data from the US found no significant association between maternal zidovudine resistance and risk 
of transmission [54]. 
Historical French cohort data demonstrated possible transmission of zidovudine -resistant virus following 
failed zidovudine prophylaxis in a very small number of woman –infant pairs, although in all these cases (where 
data were available) the woman had detectable viral load at the time of delivery [55]. In the WITS cohort, 
presence of zidovudine -resistance m utations was shown in multivariate analysis to be associated with increased 
risk of transmission, although a significant proportion of women in this study had detectable HIV at the time of 
delivery [56]. 
There is therefore very little data on the risk of transmission of zidovudine -resistant HIV in the context of fully 
suppressed maternal viral load at time of delivery and infant zidovudine monotherapy. However, observational 
data from the UK have not shown this to be a practice associated with increased transmission risk. 
Some clinicians prefer to choose another antiretroviral, with no history of maternal resistance, for infant post -
exposure monotherapy. The established alternatives, nevirapine and lamivud ine, have potent antiretroviral effect 
but a low (single -point mutation) barrier to resistance. In the event of transmission, the likelihood of an infant 
developing new resistance on zidovudine monotherapy is probably less than with nevirapine or lamivudin e. The 
dosing and safety issues with lopinavir/r and raltegravir are outlined above. With infant feeding patterns, it is 
difficult to separate drug dosing from feeds, so drugs without food restrictions are preferred; this is another 
advantage of zidovudine . 
Neonatal zidovudine monotherapy therefore remains a reasonable approach for infants born to women with a 
plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL, even if there is a previous history of zidovudine resistance. 
There are no data available on the efficacy o f modified combination PEP when maternal zidovudine and/or 
nevirapine resistance has been demonstrated. Expert advice should be sought and use of alternative drug 
combinations should be considered following careful risk assessment. 
 
9.1.8 HIV -2 
9.1.8 If a woman is known to have HIV -2 infection, follow the same advice as for HIV infant PEP but 
if HIGH RISK (combination PEP indicated), nevirapine will not be effective. Seek expert advice. 
If advice is not immediately available, commence zidovudine, lamivudin e and raltegravir until 2C BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
92 
 
guidance is available (see Appendix 3). 
There are no data available to suggest that babies born to women living with HIV -2 who are at VERY LOW or LOW 
RISK of vertical transmission should be managed any differently from those bor n to women with HIV. If the 
maternal viral load is undetectable at or after 36 weeks' gestation, the same guidance should therefore be 
followed as described above for HIV -exposed infants. 
HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs. There are no data to gu ide practice in the event of a HIGH -RISK delivery 
in the context of HIV -2 infection. The same guidance for the use of three -drug PEP should be followed as in 
section 9.1.3, replacing nevirapine with raltegravir. If raltegravir is not available, lopinavir/r could be used but 
with caution, as discussed in the previous section. Infants receiving raltegravir or lopinavir/r PEP should be 
monitored for toxicity in the first few days of life as per Appendix 3. Blood samples for infant testing should be 
sent to a UK laboratory that routinely provides HIV -2 testing. 
9.1.9 PEP beyond 4 weeks 
9.1.9 Infant PEP should not be given beyond 2 weeks for V ERY LOW-RISK or 4 weeks for L OW-RISK 
infants even if the infant is breastfed 1C 
 PEP should not be restarted unless significant subsequent exposure (e.g. maternal viral load 
detectable during breastfeeding). Seek expert advice regarding need for PEP following breast 
milk exposure during an episode of maternal viraemia. 1D 
Indications for PEP outside the neonatal period (e.g. following breast milk exposure to HIV) involves a complex 
risk assessment in relation to timing of HIV exposure, which may be staggered. Expert advice should be sought. 
See section 9.4 for further information on monitoring during breastfeedin g. 
9.2 Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis 
9.2.1 Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended from 1 month of age if HIV PCR screening is 
positive at any stage or if the infant is confirmed to be diagnosed with HIV. This should only be 
stopped if HIV in fection is subsequently excluded. 1C 
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in infants with HIV is associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, as 
the risk of neonatal HIV infection has fallen to <1% where interventions for the prevention of vertical tran smission 
are in place, the necessity for PCP prophylaxis has declined and in most European countries it is no longer 
prescribed routinely for HIV -exposed infants, even when a baby is born to a woman with a viral load >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL. 
Co-trimoxazole s hould be prescribed from 4 weeks of age for infants with a positive PCR screening test for HIV 
before 4 weeks of age. This should be continued if infection is confirmed and stopped if infection is excluded. 
Infants with a first positive HIV molecular diagn ostic test result at any age between 4 weeks and 1 year should be 
started on co -trimoxazole prophylaxis immediately until HIV infection is confirmed or excluded (see Appendix 3 
for dose). 
9.3 Immunisation 
9.3.1 Immunisations should be given as per the national schedule outlined in the Green Book [57]. 1C 
9.3.2 Rotavirus vaccine is not contraindicated (unless HIV diagnosis has been confirmed and infant is 
severely immunosuppressed). 1C 
9.3.3 If there is VERY LOW or LOW RISK of HIV transmission and BCG at birth is indicated, this should 
not be delayed. 1D BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
93 
 
Rotavirus vaccine should be given to all HIV -exposed infants unless confirmed infected and shown to be severely 
immunosuppressed. If uncertain about administration of live vaccines, expert advi ce should be sought. Infants 
considered at VERY LOW or LOW RISK of HIV transmission (i.e. maternal viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at or 
after 36 weeks’ gestation) may be given BCG at birth if indicated according to UK guidelines for HIV -unexposed 
infants . 
9.4. Infant feeding 
There are no data on the risk of HIV transmission via breast milk in high -income countries. In low - to middle -
income settings, the overall postnatal risk of HIV transmission via breast milk when women are treated with cART 
has been reported as 1.08% (95% CI 0.32 –1.85) at 6 months and 2.93% (95% CI 0.68 –5.18) at 12 months, however 
in these studies women only received cART for 6 months and often breastfed for longer [58]. In the more recent 
PROMISE trial, women received cART throughout the breastfeeding period, and the transmission rate was 0.3% 
(95% CI 0.1 –0.6) at 6 months and 0.6% (95% CI 0.4 –1.1) at 12 months [59]. 
Factors that increase the risk of HIV transmission via breast milk when women are not on cART include: 
• Detectable HIV viral load; 
• Advanced maternal HIV disease; 
• Longer duration of breastfeeding; 
• Breast and nipple infection/inflammation; 
• Infant mouth or gut infection/inflammation; 
• Mixed feeding, in particular solid food given to infants less than 2 months of age [60]. 
Where a woman is on cART and breastfeeding, it is presumed that the same fac tors are relevant, albeit less so, 
depending on adherence and viral load suppression. 
Historically the risk of HIV transmission in women not on cART was affected by feeding other solid foods to young 
infants. The transmission risk for exclusive breastfeedi ng is 9.0/100 child -years; for predominantly feeding breast 
milk with other liquids is 9.5/100 child years; and for giving early solid foods rises to 41.2/100 child -years [60]. 
Whether this risk persists with feeding o f solid foods when women breastfeed on cART with full viral suppression 
is not yet known. 
An analysis of data from four African studies published before 201 2, where women were on cART from before 
conception, estimated that the postnatal HIV transmission probability was around 0.16% per month of 
breastfeeding [61]. However, this estimated transmission risk is at least twice that seen in infants enrolled in the 
PROMISE trial at 12 months of age [59]. 
9.4.1 Breastfeeding advice for women with HIV living in the UK 
9.4.1 In the UK and other high -income settings, the safest way to feed infants born to women 
with HIV is with formula milk, as there is on -going risk of HIV exposure after birth. We 
therefore continue to recommend that women living with HIV feed their babies with 
formula milk (but see also section 9.4.4) . 1D 
Current WHO advice on breastfeeding for women with HIV is aimed at low - and middle -income countries where 
there is a high risk of infant morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea, pneumonia and other infections, and where 
formula feeding is not safe or afford able for many families. All women with HIV are advised to start cART as soon 
as possible after HIV diagnosis and continue lifelong treatment. They are advised to breastfeed their infants 
exclusively for the first 6 months, while adhering to cART, then to a dd complimentary foods as appropriate after 
this time. They are advised not to stop breastfeeding until other safe and adequate foods are available, and to 
continue up to 12 –24 months of age [62]. 
Suppressive maternal cART significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of vertical transmission of 
HIV through breastfeeding. The undetectable=untransmi ttable (U=U) statement applies only to sexual 
transmission, and we currently lack data to apply this to breastfeeding. Other considerations are the lack of 
lactation studies for most antiretroviral a gents, meaning that the pharmacokinetic properties of ART in breastmilk 
are poorly understood, and the potential effects of exposure to ART in the breastmilk on infants who do not 
acquire HIV [63]. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
94 
 
The writing group therefore continues to recommend formula feeding by women living with HIV to eliminate the 
risk of postnatal transmission. 
9.4.2 Supporting women living with HIV to formula feed 
9.4.2 Abstaining fro m breastfeeding can have financial and psychological repercussions for women, 
requiring support from the HIV MDT. 1C 
 Women advised not to breastfeed for their baby’s health should be provided with free formula 
feed to minimise vertical transmission of HI V. 1D 
It is important to be aware that not breastfeeding can come at an emotional, financial and social cost to women 
living with HIV [64,65] , and we advise that women receive appropriate support from their HIV MDT (which may 
include peer support, psychological and practical support, and financial support for formula feeding) [64-66]. 
We advise discussing infant feeding intentions early in pregnancy so that appropriate information and support 
can be provided. When women living with HIV are advised not to breastfeed, this can have a significant financial 
impact. There is a risk that some women with insufficient finances will forgo their own nutritional needs in order 
to afford formula for their infant, thus compromising their own health and potentially compromising the 
effectiveness of their HIV treatment [65]. Women with irregular immigration status and no recourse to public 
funds and women with a low income are particularly vulnerable to these bar riers [65]. The provision of free 
formula milk, and the appropriate equipment to use it, alleviates any financial burden attached to this key 
prevention tool [64]. This ensur es that women can make decisions on how to feed their infant without being 
influenced by cost. Free provision of formula milk also has the potential to improve women’s retention in HIV care 
postpartum [67,68] . 
We acknowledge that provision of free formula for women living with HIV remains inconsistent across the UK. We 
advise clinics and voluntary sector organisations to map local services. There are different ways in which formula 
milk may be provided (see Box 1). Other examples of formula milk schemes can be found in the National AIDS 
Trust Policy Briefing on access to formula milk for women living with HIV [65]. 
Jonathan Mann Clinic runs a scheme that provides vouchers for pregnant women and 
new mothers l iving with HIV, enabling the purchase of sterilisers, bottles and formula 
milk. The scheme is available to women who deliver at Homerton Hospital or who are 
residents of Hackney and attending HIV care at other clinics. At 30 weeks, pregnant 
women receive a n entitlement letter from their midwife that they take to their HIV 
department, helping with compliance with care and treatment. They are given an initial 
voucher for £120 in the form of a Tesco payment card, which is then followed up with a 
further £80 at their 6 -week postnatal appointment, and another £80 after 3 months. The 
scheme has been well received by women who report that it has removed much of the 
fear they had about not being able to breastfeed. The scheme is funded by the local 
authority and sup ports approximately 50 women per year.

9.4.3 Suppression of lactation 
9.4.3 Women not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of viral load >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL, s hould be offered cabergoline to suppress lactation. 1C 
Cabergoline is an ergot derivative introduced in the mid -1990s to inhibit puerperal lactation. It can also be used in 
the treatment of Parkinson's disease, prolactinomas, acromegaly and amenorrhea and galactorrhea secondary to 
neuroleptic use [69,70] . Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist with a higher affinity and specificity for the dopamine 
D2 receptor than bromocriptine [71]. The suppression of prolactin release is more prolonged with cabergoline 
than with bromocriptine [72], such that a single dose of 1 mg cabergoline may be used to inhibit lactation on day 
1 postpartum giving the equivalent effect of 2 weeks of bromocriptine. Adverse effects are similar to those 
reported with other ergot derivatives, but cabergoline appears to be better tolerated [73]. 
A small prospective study in Canada included 22 women who received cabergoline postpartum [74]. Taken on 
days 2 and 15 postpartum, cabergoline successfully suppressed lactation with an absence of pain, swelling or 
nipple discharge in over 86% of women. However, side effects were common and seen in nine women on day 2 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
95 
 
and in 10 women on day 15. Most frequently reported side effects were dizziness and hand or foot numbness, 
hand or foot pain and nausea, but overall women were satisfied with the treatment and would recommend its 
use to a friend. 
The option of usi ng cabergoline should be discussed in advance with each woman and included in her birth plan. 
It should be made clear that it will reduce the discomfort of lactation if not breastfeeding but will prevent her 
from breastfeeding once taken. 
9.4.4 Choosing to breastfeed in the UK 
9.4.4 Women who are virologically suppressed on cART with good adherence and who choose to 
breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should be informed about the low risk of 
transmission of HIV through breastfeeding in this situati on and the requirement for extra 
maternal and infant clinical monitoring. 1D 
 When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic 
for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding. 1D 
 Maternal cART (rather than infant pre -exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) is advised to minimise HIV 
transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the woman’s health. 1D 
Women who choose to breastfeed should be advised of the small on -going risk of HIV transmission. They should 
be supported in their decision, if they fulfil the following criteria: 
• A fully suppressed HIV viral load (for as long a period as possible, but certainly during the last trimester of 
pregnancy); 
• A good adherence hi story; 
• Strong engagement with the perinatal MDT; 
• Prepared to attend for monthly clinic review and blood HIV viral load tests for themselves and their infant 
during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding (see section 9.5.1.2). 
Information for women considering breastfeeding should also be provided in written form and can be adapted 
locally from patient information leaflets developed by the writing group (see the BHIVA website : 
www.bhiva.org/pregnancy -guidelines ). Women who do not fulfil the above criteria should be advised against 
breastfeeding. Women whose infants fall into the L OW-RISK category because of a short duration of cART and 
viral suppression or because of prem aturity should be counselled that their risk of transmission may be higher 
because of a higher risk of transient viral expression in plasma and breast milk, and because of the immature 
neonatal gut. Women who breastfeed with a known detectable HIV viral lo ad should be referred to social care as 
this places their infant at significant risk of HIV infection. A supportive and harm reduction approach of working 
openly together should be taken, to maintain trust and reduce the risk of women being pressurised to breastfeed 
in secret [64,75] . 
The risk of transmission in women on cART does still increase according to the duration of breastfeeding [76]. 
Women who wish to breastfeed (and meet the criteria specified above) should be advised to breastfeed for as 
short a time as possible, to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months, and to cease breastfeeding if they have 
breast infection/mastitis or if they or their infant has gastrointestinal symptoms. They should be given clear 
information, including how to manage common complications of breastfee ding, and have ready access to clinical 
advice and peer support. When weaning to solids, women should follow standard UK guidance, introducing 
complementary foods after 6 months of age, if still breastfeeding. Abrupt weaning from breast to formula and/or 
solids can be avoided, as long as the maternal HIV viral load remains fully suppressed. 
In resource -poor settings, neonatal PrEP is equally effective as maternal cART in preventing HIV transmission via 
breast milk. In the PROMISE -PEP trial (ANRS 12174), in fant regimens of daily lamivudine or lopinavir/r were 
equally effective up to 50 weeks (transmission rate on lopinavir/r: 1.4%, 95% CI 0.4 –2.5; on lamivudine: 1.5%, 95% 
CI 0.7 –2.5), with similar rates of grade 3 –4 side effects of approximately 50% in both arms [76]. In the PROMISE 
trial, daily nevirapine as infant PrEP was comparable to maternal cART up to 12 months of breastfeeding, with a 
reported transmission rate of 0.3% (95 % CI 0.1 –0.6) at 6 months and 0.6% (95% CI 0.4 –1.1) at 12 months [59]. BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
96 
 
As lifelong maternal cART is now the WHO recommendation, these infant PrEP regimens are less likely to be used 
on a large scale. There are no clinical trials of maternal cART plus infant PrEP in the context of breastfeedi ng, 
although it has been suggested that this could be a feasible approach in resource -poor settings where women 
may not have fully suppressed viral load and may be more likely to give medication to the infant than take it 
themselves [77]. 
Given the h ealth benefits of cART for the woman herself, and the equivalent efficacy of maternal cART and infant 
PrEP in reducing risk of vertical transmission of HIV through breastfeeding, we recommend that maternal cART 
(rather than infant PrEP) be used in cases wh ere a woman chooses to breastfeed. There is no need to extend 
infant PEP beyond 2 weeks simply because of breastfeeding if all of the criteria for VERY LOW RISK are met. 
Healthcare providers requiring advice on use of medicines during the breastfeeding period can contact the UK 
Drugs in Lactation Advisory Service ( www.sps.nhs.uk/ ukdilas ). 
When a woman decides to breastfeed, she and her infant should be reviewed monthly in clinic for HIV RNA viral 
load testing during and for 2 months after stopping breastfeeding (see section 9.5.1.2). 
The NSHPC is now collecting enhanced surveillance data on women with HIV who breastfeed and their infants. 
This will contribute to epidemiolo gical data for the future ( www.ucl.ac.uk/nshpc ). 
9.4.5 Communication with health professionals 
With sensitivity to concerns about confidentiality, women should be strongly encouraged to inform 
partners/families an d healthcare providers (including midwives, health visitors and GPs) and anyone else involved 
in their care (such as lactation consultants) about their HIV status. This will enable the family and local team to 
give appropriate support and advice, especiall y regarding feeding, vaccinations and medical assessment of the 
infant. 
9.5 Diagnosis of infant HIV status 
9.5.1 Non-breastfed infants 
9.5.1.1 Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on the following occasions : 1C 
 • During the first 48 hours and prior to hospital discharge; 
• At 6 weeks (or at least 2 weeks after cessation of infant prophylaxis*); 
• At 12 weeks (or at least 8 weeks after cessation of infant prophylaxis*); 
• On other occasions if additional risk including at 2 weeks of age if HIGH RISK at 
delivery . 
*BHIVA guidelines on duration of PEP have changed for VERY LOW -RISK infants (see section 
8.1). 
9.5.1.2 Antibody testing 
• If the mother’s antibody status is not documented, an HIV antibody test should be 
performed on the first sample from the infant. 
• HIV antibody testing for serorever sion should be checked at age 22–24 months. 
• Although an HIV antibody t est ma y be negative before this time , engagement in 
care should continue until at least 18 months of age . 
9.5.2 Breastfed infants 
9.5.2.1 Molecular diagnostics for HIV infection should be performed on the following occasions : 
 • During the first 48 hours and prior to hospital discharge; 1C 
 • At 2 weeks of age; 1D BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
97 
 
 • Monthly for the duration of breastfeeding; 1D 
 • At 4 and 8 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding . 1D 
9.5.2.2. Antibody testing 
• If the mother’s HIV status is not documented, an HIV antibody test should be 
performed on the first sample from the infant. 
• HIV antibody testing for seroreversion should be checked at age 22–24 months , or 
at a minimum of 8 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding, if this is later . 1C 
9.5.3 Management of infa nts diagnosed with HIV 
 • Infants with a positive test for HIV should be started on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis 
from 4 weeks of age. 
 • Infants with a positive test for HIV should be referred urgently to a specialist centre 
for management of HIV according to Children’s HIV Association ( CHIVA ) and 
Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (Penta ) guidelines. 
 • A positive HIV diagno sis in an infant should be fed back to the obstetric unit where 
the infant was born to allow investigation of any avoidable factors in transmission. 
 
The gold standard test for HIV infection in infancy was HIV DNA PCR on peripheral blood lymphocytes. In a 
number of studies, including the large French perinatal cohort, equal or increased early sensitivity with 
amplification of viral RNA with no false -positive results has been reported [78,79] . 
Infant s acquiring HIV intrapartum may have low peripheral blood HIV levels, so HIV DNA/RNA may not be 
amplified from all infected infants at birth. Indeed, a positive HIV DNA/RNA result within 72 hours of birth is taken 
as presumptive evidence of intrauterine tr ansmission. Within the first few weeks of life the sensitivity of the viral 
diagnostic tests increases dramatically and by 3 months of age 100% of non -breastfed infants with HIV are likely 
to be detected [78]. 
Although HIV RNA and DNA assays have similar sen sitivity, RNA assays commonly require 1 mL plasma, whereas 
DNA can be performed on smaller samples. If the sample requires dilution due to a low volume, which is often the 
case with paediatric samples, the lower limit of detection will be increased (with a corresponding decrease in 
assay sensitivity). In addition, where transmission may have occurred in utero , subsequent maternal ART with 
agents that cross the placenta could lead to a false -negative RNA result in an infected infant. In this situation, the 
infant should be tested using DNA PCR. As HIV DNA PCR is not widely available, a faster result may be obtained 
with a local RNA test. However, if HIV RNA is detected, HIV DNA PCR is recommended as a confirmatory test. 
The same considerations regarding using primers known to amplify maternal virus apply to both RNA and DNA 
assays. In view of the genomic diversity of HIV, a maternal sample should always be obtained for HIV DNA or RNA 
amplification with, or prior to, the f irst infant sample to confirm that the primers used detect the maternal virus. 
If the maternal virus cannot be detected, a different primer set and/or test should be used. There has been 
an increase in the number of cases, usually in women establis hed on ART with undetectable HIV viral load, where 
it has not been possible to amplify maternal DNA using four different primer sets. An HIV antibody test at 
18 months is of particular importance in this scenario. 
Evidence from the French perin atal cohort demonstrated that neonatal ART, especially if more than one 
drug, can delay the detection of both HIV DNA and RNA in the infant [79]. For this reason, the second and third 
HIV molecular tests are performed at 2 weeks and 2 months after stopping PEP, i.e. usually at 4 –6 weeks and 
10–12 weeks of age depending on PEP duration. If all tests are negative and the baby is not being/has not been 
brea stfed, parents can be informed that the child does not have HIV. For infants at HIGH RISK of infection, an 
additional early HIV test may be undertaken at 2 –3 weeks of age. For infants breastfeeding from women on cART BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
98 
 
(see section 9.4), HIV viral diagnostic tests should be undertaken at least monthly for the woman and infant while 
breastfeeding, and then additionally for the infant, at 4 and 8 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding. 
 
Loss of maternal HIV antibodies should be confirmed at 22–24 month s of age [80]. Ideally an HIV antibody test 
should be used to confirm loss of maternal antibodies rather than a combined HIV antibody –antigen test , and this 
will almost always be negative by 18 months of age in an uninfected infant . However , combined tests (fourth 
generation and above) are commonly used and may still give a positive HIV result until up to 2 years of age [81]. 
Testing for loss of maternal HIV antibody remains important as, rarely, late postnatal infection may occur, even 
when all early HIV viral ge nome diagnostic tests were negative (French Perinatal cohort: 5/4539 cases) [82]. This 
may be due to breastfeeding, premastication of infant food or unknown intra familial exposure. 
9.5.3 Management of i nfants diagnosed with HIV 
If any of the infant HIV tests are found to be positive, an immediate repeat test on a new sample should be 
requested to confirm infection. When an infant is diagnosed with HIV, PCP prophyla xis should be started as soon 
as the baby reaches age 4 weeks, or immediately of the infants is already aged more than 4 weeks. An urgent 
referral should be made to the local specialist HIV clinic to initiate infant cART. Maternal and infant HIV resistanc e 
testing should be undertaken to help delineate reasons for PEP failure and guide treatment. The infant’s H IV 
diagnosis should be fed back to the obstetric unit where the infant was delivered to allow investigation of the 
circumstances of the transmission . 
HIV services for children in the UK are organised in managed networks; details of the Children’s HIV National 
Network (CHINN) and contacts for local paediatricians can be found on the CHIVA website ( www.chiva.or g.uk). 
9.6. Neonatal management in maternal hepatitis co -infection 
9.6.1 Follow national guidance for management of maternal HBV in pregnancy and for prevention of 
transmission of HIV to the infant (see also section 7.1). 1D 
Immunoprophylaxis with HBV vac cine with or without HBIG given to the neonate has been shown in separate 
meta -analyses of randomised controlled trials to significantly reduce vertical transmission from women with 
HBV alone. 
HBIG should be given to the neonate if: 
• Maternal HBV DNA concentration is >106 IU/mL; 
• And/or a woman is HBeAg positive; 
• Or anti -HBe negative; 
• Or anti -HBe is unknown [83]. 
In the absence of neonatal immunisation with HBV vaccine with or without HBIG, the rate of vertical transmission 
from a pregnant woman with HBV alone who is both HBsAg and HBeAg positive is 70 –90% and for a woman who 
is HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative is 10 –40%. By co -administering vaccination (effectiveness of vaccine vs 
placebo: RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.2 –0.4) and HBIG (effectiveness of HBIG/vaccine vs vaccine alone: RR 0.54; 95% CI 
0.41 –0.73), transmission rates can be reduced to between 0% and 14%. The most important determinant of 
prophylaxis failure has been shown to be maternal serum HBV DNA levels. 
Failure of birth -dose vaccine and HBIG in up to 9% of infants despite appropriate po st-delivery 
immunoprophylaxis occurs mainly because of infection in utero [84]. Therefore, maternal cART together with 
prompt post -delivery neonatal immunoprophylaxis is the ideal approach for preventing vertical transmission of 
HBV. 
9.6.2 Follow usual practice for investigation and management of maternal HCV in pregnancy (see 
also section 7.2). 1D 
No postnatal interventions are currently available for reducing risk of transmission of HCV to infants of women 
with HCV and HIV. Testing and follow -up of these infants should follow usual practice recommended for infants BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
99 
 
born to women with HCV alone, with consideration of combining HIV and HCV follow -up assessments in the first 
18 months to 2 years. 
9.7 HIV exposed but uninfected (HEU) 
9.7.1 In light of evidence for possible increased infectious morbidity in HIV exposed but uninfected 
(HEU) children, timely routine vaccination should be ensured and general practitioners (GPs), 
health visitors and secondary care physicians should be made aware of possible increased risk 
in order to inform decisions when assessing risk in primary care. 1D 
With increasingly successful rollout of prevention of vertical transmission of HIV interventions across the 
globe, the number of HEU children is increasing in para llel. A growing body of evidence, mainly from 
observational studies in low - and middle -income countries, suggests that these children may be at increased risk 
of morbidity (mainly infection related) in early life (reviewed in [85] and [86]). Multiple potential confounding 
factors make interpret ation and conclusions from such studies challenging. In utero exposure to an altered 
maternal immune system and ART have both been proposed as potential factors contributing to an impairment in 
HEU neonatal immunity [86]. Much less information is availab le from high -incom e settings and findings are 
inconsistent [87-90]. 
In view of these concerns, although it remains to be demonstrated that HEU children in the UK are at increased 
risk of morbidity, the writing group recommends that all healthcare professionals involved in the care of HEU 
children i n early life are made aware of this potential additional risk factor. The need for timely and complete 
routine immunisations should also be emphasised.

 105 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
 
10. Postpartum management of women 
10.1 Antiretroviral therapy 
10.1.1 All women are recommended to continue cART postpartum. 1A 
It is recommended that all women remain on ART postpartum [1,2] , although ultimately this is a woman’s choice. 
For women who start on ART in pregnancy there may be an opportunity to simplify regimens, for example to once 
daily co -formulated regimens, or sw itch to newer regimens. Additionally, women who started darunavir/r bd in 
pregnancy should be switched to daily dosing unless there is evidence of significant genotypic resistance (see also 
section 6) [3]. Viral rebound has been demonstrated in women living with HIV postpartum, with the risk greater 
than in non -pregnant women with HIV [4]. Adherence can decline in the postnatal period as a result of concerns 
about side effects, the lifelong nature of treatment, fear of HIV status being shared and fear of HIV -related stigma 
within the community and in clinics [5-7]. It is important to be aware of the potential for compromised 
adherence, and to provide appropriate support including peer mentoring, which has been shown to improve 
adherence [6]. 
10.2 Support services 
10.2.1 Women should have their support needs assessed postpartum and be re ferred to appropriate 
services in the Trust, community and/or voluntary groups without delay. 1D 
The support required by each woman and the support services available at each HIV service will vary considerably 
and should be individualised for each woman. Support required may include child care, help with housing, access 
to food, peer mentoring and leg al and advocacy services. The HIV MDT should work with local peer -led and 
voluntary organisations to tailor support to each woman. Referrals to partner organisations should have 
commenced at first presentation in pregnancy (see section 4) and be continued in the postnatal period. For 
women with drug or alcohol issues, continued support should be offered on an on -going basis. The minority of 
women who experience pregnancy loss may require additional support through HIV peer mentoring or support 
services such as the Miscarriage Association ( www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/ ) or Sands ( www.sands.org.uk/ ). 
10.3 Postnatal follow -up of women 
10.3.1 All women shou ld be reviewed in the postnatal period by a named member of the MDT within 
4–6 weeks. 1C 
It is important to be aware that there may be issues with retention in care after pregnancy, with disengagement 
of care rates estimated at 12% in both the NSHPC and the Swiss Cohort, and caring responsibilities identified as a 
barrier to accessing care [8-10]. It is essential to see all women in the postpartum period for follow -up of both 
medical and social issues, and to promote linkage back to general HIV care. We recommend that all women 
receive an appointment to see a named member of the HIV MDT and adequate ART until this appointment prior 
to discharge after delivery. This is particular ly important for women newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy. The 
infant’s postnatal 6 -week check provides a good opportunity to also see the woman. A full assessment of the birth 
experience is important to provide constructive feedback to the MDT and to e nsure pregnancy pathways are 
working well. This will also allow women to receive support for any difficult experiences they may have had. 
Should a woman miss her first postnatal appointment, every effort should be made by the HIV MDT to contact 
her and add ress any barriers in order to re -establish care. 
 106 BHIVA guidelines on the management of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum 
 
10.4 Mental health assessment and support 
10.4.1 Women should have their mental health needs assessed postpartum and those assessed as 
having mental health issues should be referred to appropriate service s in the Trust, community 
and/or voluntary groups without delay. 1D 
As discussed in section 4, mental health issues are common in the context of HIV and pregnancy. All women 
should be assessed as recommended in section 4.2. If there are concerns about postnatal depression, women 
should be linked to Trust community hub perinatal mental health services or referred to HIV liaison/community 
psychiatry for further assessment. Peer mentoring should be offered as additional support. 
10.5 Contraception 
10.5.1 Contraceptive needs should be discussed with all women, and ART may be changed to 
optimise a woman’s contraception choice as long as the ART prescribed is fully active against 
the viral genotype. 1D 
Ovulation usually resumes at 6 weeks postpartum but may occur earlier in non -breastfeeding women. A plan for 
contraception postnatally should have been discussed in advance of delivery (see section 5.1.5) and revisited in 
the early postpartum period and at the 4 - to 6-week follow -up. Women should be advised that it is possible to 
conceive before the first postnatal menses and therefore to use condoms if necessary until the postnatal review 
[11]. It is important to try to accommodate both the contraceptive and ART wishes of each woman. There are 
multiple ART agents ava ilable which do not interact with systemic oestrogens and/or progestogens such as all 
NRTIs, raltegravir, dolutegravir, rilpivirine and maraviroc. ART may be changed to optimise a woman’s 
contraception choice as long as the ART prescribed is fully active a gainst the viral genotype. A full guide to drug –
drug interactions between ART and hormonal contraceptives is available at www.hiv -druginteractions.org . 
10.6 Cervical cytology 
10.6.1 Cytology should be scheduled 3 months post -delivery as per the Guidelines for the NHS 
Cervical Screening Programme 2016. 1C 
As discussed in section 5, cervical screening is not routinely recommended in pregnancy but can be resumed, as 
per the Guidelines for the NHS Cervical Screening Programme 2016, 3 months postpartum [12,13] . 
10.7 Testing of partner and/or older children 
10.7.1 For the woman newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy, testing of her partner and/or other 
children should be completed. 1D 
Postpartum follow -up may be an opportune time to revisit testing of partners and/or older children . A woman 
newly diagnosed in pregnancy should be counselled and supported regarding testing of her other children and 
partner, if appropriate and there are no other conc erns (such as risk of intimate partner violence, see section 4). 
She should be informed that as well as significantly reducing her risk of vertical transmission of HIV [14], being on 
cART will also reduce her risk of sexual transmission. When her viral load is undetectable for 6 months or more 
she will not transmit HIV sexually; however, she should be advised to use condoms with her untested or HIV -
negative partner until that time [15].

Appendix 2: Summary of the modified GRADE system 
BHIVA revised and updated the Association’s guideline development manual in 2011 [1]. BHIVA has adopted the 
modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for the 
assessment, evaluation and gradin g of evidence and the development of recommendations [2,3] . 
1A 
Strong recommendation. 
High -quality evidence. 
Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa. Consistent 
evidence from well -performed, randomised controlled trials or 
overwhelming evidence of some other form. Further research is unlikely 
to change our confidence in the estimate of benefit a nd risk. Strong 
recommendations can apply to most individuals in most circumstances 
without reservation. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation 
unless there is a clear rationale for an alternative approach. 2A 
Weak recommendation. 
High -quality ev idence. 
Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens. 
Consistent evidence from well -performed , randomised 
controlled trials or overwhelming evidence of some 
other form. Further research is unlikely to change our 
confidence in the estimate of benefit an d risk. Weak 
recommendation ; best action may differ depending on 
circumstances or individuals or societal values. 
1B 
Strong recommendation. 
Moderate -quality evidence. 
Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa. Evidence from 
randomised controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent 
results, methods flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence of 
some other research design. Further research may impact on our 
confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk. Strong recommendation 
and applies to most patients. Clinicians should follow a strong 
recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an 
alternative approach is present. 2B 
Weak recommendation. 
Moderate -quality evidence. 
Benefits closely balance d with risks and burdens, some 
uncertainly in the estimates of benefits, risks and 
burdens. Evidence from randomised controlled trials 
with important limitations (inconsistent results, 
methods flaws, indirect or imprecise). Further research 
may change the estimate of benefit and risk. Weak 
recommendation, alternative approaches likely to be 
better for some individuals under some circumstances. 
1C 
Strong recommendation. 
Low-quality evidence. 
Benefits appear to outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa. Evide nce 
from observational studies, unsystematic clinical experience, or from 
randomised controlled trials with serious flaws. Any estimate of effect is 
uncertain. Strong recommendation ; applies to most patients. Some of the 
evidence base supporting the recomm endation is, however, of low 
quality. 2C 
Weak recommendation. 
Low-quality evidence. 
Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks and 
burdens; benefits may be closely balanced with risks 
and burdens. Evidence from observational studies, 
unsystematic clin ical experience, or from randomised 
controlled trials with serious flaws. Any estimate of 
effect is uncertain. Weak recommendation; other 
alternatives may be reasonable. 
1D 
Strong recommendation. 
Very low -quality evidence. 
Benefits appear to outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa. Evidence 
limited to case studies. Strong recommendation based only on case 
studies and expert judgement. 2D 
Weak recommendation. 
Very low -quality evidence. 
Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks and 
burden s; benefits may be closely balanced with risks 
and burdens. Evidence limited to case studies and 
expert judgement. Very weak recommendation; other 
alternatives may be equally reasonable.
