RELEASING PLACENTAS TO PARENTS – INFORMATION SHEET FOR PARENTS 
 
This information is intended to guide you through how to safely transport and dispose of your 
placenta if you decide to take it home with you (or to keep it at home following a home birth). 
A placenta provides a perfect environment for micro -organisms to grow. There are some 
standard precautions you should be aware of for your health and safety and that of others in 
your household. In order to reduce the risk of spreading infections, the foll owing steps should 
be followed: 
1. The placenta should be put in 2 bags, each sealed separately and then placed into a 
leak-proof, sealed container to transport it home in. Once sealed, the container should 
not be re -opened until you arrive home. 
 
2. A placenta will deteriorate quickly and should be stored in a fridge that does not 
contain any food for no more than 48 -72 hours before it is disposed of. 
 
3. While the risk of getting an infection from a healthy placenta is low, standard hygiene 
precautions should be followed, including handling it as little as possible, avoiding 
contact with food and drink, wearing protective gloves and always washing your han ds 
thoroughly after any contact with it. 
 
4. Avoid contact between blood from the placenta and breaks in the skin such as cuts, 
burns or sores. If blood does contaminate any of these areas, wash the area 
immediately with soap and water. 
 
5. As a placenta is not considered ‘bodily remains’ there is no law to prevent you from 
burying it at home. If you decide to do so, it is your responsibility to ask your local 
council if there are any applicable guidelines and to follow them. 
 
6. It is suggested that you bury the placenta at a depth of no less than 1 metre to prevent 
it being dug up by animals and becoming a potential source of infection. 
 
7. The placenta should be free of any plastic cord clamps and not be buried in a plastic 
bag or container, due to not being biodegradable. 
 
8. The placenta should not be buried in a location likely to contaminate a domestic water 
supply, near a river or on public land. 
 
9. If you decide that you do not want to bury the placenta, it cannot be disposed of in a 
domestic waste bin. You may return it in a sealed container to the hospital for disposal.
