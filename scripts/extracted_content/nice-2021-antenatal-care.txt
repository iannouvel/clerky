This guideline is t he basis of QS22, QS35 , QS98 , QS105 , QS204 and QS17 8. 
This guideline should be r ead in conjunction wit h NG137 . 
Overview 
This guideline co vers t he routine ant enatal car e that w omen and t heir babies should

topics of emotional attachment and bab y feeding. 
The guideline uses t he terms 'w oman' or 'mot her' t hroughout. These should be tak en to 
include people who do not identify as w omen but who ar e pregnant. Similarly , wher e the 
term 'par ents' is used, t his should be tak en to include an yone who has main r esponsibility 
for caring f or a bab y. 
The Royal College of Obst etricians and Gynaecologist s has pr oduced guidance on 
COVID-19 and ant enatal car e for all midwif ery and obst etric ser vices.

63Continuity of carer 
Having continuity of car er means t hat a trusting r elationship can be de veloped betw een 
the w oman and t he healt hcare professional who car es for her . Better Bir ths, a repor t by 
the National Mat ernity R eview , defines continuity of car er as consist ency in t he midwif ery 
team (betw een 4 and 8 individuals) t hat pr ovides car e for the w oman and her bab y 
throughout pr egnancy , labour and t he postnatal period. A named midwif e coor dinat es the 
care and tak es responsibility f or ensuring t hat t he needs of t he w oman and her bab y are 
met t hroughout t he ant enatal, intrapar tum and postnatal periods. 
For the purpose of t his guideline, definition of continuity of car er in t he Better Bir ths repor t 
has been adapt ed to include not just t he midwif ery team but an y healt hcare team in volved 
in the car e of t he w oman and her bab y. It emphasises t he impor tance of eff ectiv e 
information transf er betw een t he individuals wit hin the team. F or mor e information, see t he

Shared de cision making 
Shar ed decision making is a collaborativ e process t hat in volves a person and t heir

63Rationale and im pact 
These sections briefly e xplain wh y the committ ee made t he recommendations and ho w 
they might aff ect practice. 
Starting an tena tal c are 
Recommendations 1 .1.1 to 1.1.3 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
No relevant e vidence was identified and so t he committ ee made t he recommendations 
based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, and also made a resear ch recommendation 
about ho w to star t ant enatal car e. The committ ee discussed t he wa ys in which w omen 
should be able t o access ant enatal car e, but agr eed t hat t he configuration details w ould 
depend on local arrangement s. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat ant enatal ser vice planning should tak e into account w omen's 
needs and cir cumstances, and should not discriminat e against, f or example, a limit ed 
ability t o use and access online ser vices, limit ed skills in English language or in lit eracy , or 
not being r egist ered wit h a GP sur gery. The committ ee w ere awar e that f or some w omen 
in vulnerable situations or wit h limit ed English language skills, t here ma y be a dela y in 
accessing and star ting ant enatal car e. 
The booking appointment should occur b y 10 weeks of pr egnancy but t he initial contact 
and r eferral might ha ve happened se veral w eeks earlier , so t he committ ee agr eed t hat t he 
referral contact should include pr ovision of early pr egnancy inf ormation, f or example, 
public healt h messages f or the w oman about f olic acid supplementation or st opping 
smoking. It is also impor tant t o identify w omen wit h specific needs or risk f actors early on 
so that appr opriat e car e can be pr ovided fr om t he beginning. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat it is impor tant t o have the contact details f or the w oman's GP 
to ensur e that inf ormation can be shar ed betw een primar y car e and mat ernity ser vices so 
that car e is pr ovided accor ding t o the w oman's individual needs, and t o identify pot ential 
safeguar ding issues. Antenatal car e (NG201)

63How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
Ther e is v ariation in curr ent practice in ho w women access ant enatal car e and t he time 
betw een w omen's first contact wit h a healt hcare professional and subsequent st eps. 
Enabling w omen t o star t their ant enatal car e through v arious r outes, including t hrough 
school nurses, community centr es or r efugee host els, ma y have some implications on 
resour ces; ho wever, these should be outw eighed b y the benefit s of timely ant enatal car e. 
The r ecommendations should impr ove timely access t o ant enatal car e for women in 
various situations, and impr ove early r ecognition of specific needs and risk f actors so t hat 
care can be planned. 
Return t o recommendations 
Antena tal appoin tmen ts 
Recommendations 1 .1.4 to 1.1.13 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
Ther e was no new e vidence t o suppor t changing fr om t he existing r ecommended practice 
of women ha ving t heir first ant enatal (booking) appointment b y 10+0 weeks. 
Some w omen only contact, or ar e referred to, mat ernity ser vices aft er 9+0 weeks. This 
'late booking' ma y be par ticularly common among some socially vulnerable w omen or 
women wit h limit ed English language skills. Based on t heir kno wledge and e xperience, t he 
committ ee agr eed t hat w omen who contact, or ar e referred to, mat ernity ser vices aft er 
9+0 weeks should ha ve a booking appointment ideally wit hin 2 weeks so t hat early 
pregnancy car e, including inf ormation pr ovision and scr eenings, can happen wit hin the 
right timeframe. The committ ee agr eed t hat it w ould be helpful t o identify an y underlying 
factors t hat ma y have led t o the 'lat e booking' so t hat t he w oman's need f or pot ential 
additional suppor t or car e can be consider ed and t hat an y pot ential inequality and 
accessibility issues can be addr essed. 
Ther e was no new e vidence t hat led t he committ ee to change fr om t he existing 
recommended practice of arranging 10 appointment s for nullipar ous w omen and 
7 appointment s for par ous w omen. Inst ead, t he committ ee made a resear ch 
recommendation about t he ideal number and timing of ant enatal appointment s, including 
consideration f or gr oups at higher risk of adv erse out comes. Antenatal car e (NG201)

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 38 of
63The e vidence on w omen's e xperience and satisf action in r elation t o the number of 
antenatal appointment s was mix ed, but t he committ ee agr eed t he impor tance of being 
flexible t o meet w omen's needs. 
Ther e was e vidence t hat w omen who needed t o use int erpreters found t he ser vice t o be 
unreliable and inconsist ent, so t he committ ee made a specific r ecommendation 
highlighting t hat int erpreters should alwa ys be a vailable when needed (including, f or 
example, at scan appointment s) and t hat t hey should be independent of t he w oman and 
not, f or example, a f amily member or a friend. 
Ther e was good e vidence t hat w omen v alue ha ving t he same midwif e throughout t heir 
antenatal car e, alt hough t he review did not look at t he benefit s and harms of continuity of 
carer in r elation t o clinical- and cost -effectiv eness out comes. The NHS England's r epor t 
Better Bir ths: impr oving out comes of mat ernity ser vices in England – a fiv e year f orward 
view f or mat ernity car e recommends continuity of car er by 1 midwif e who is par t of a small 
team of midwiv es based in t he community , so t hat t hey can get t o kno w the w oman and 
provide suppor t to her t hroughout pr egnancy all t he wa y to the postnatal period. 
Various healt h professionals or pr oviders ma y be in volved throughout t he pr egnancy , and 
the committ ee emphasised t he need f or good communication betw een diff erent healt h 
professionals and pr oviders. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The timing of t he booking appointment and t he number of appointment s reflect s curr ent 
clinical practice. The r ecommendation about w omen who do not ha ve a booking 
appointment arranged b y 9+0 weeks ma y lead t o mor e women att ending booking 
appointment s bef ore 11 weeks and it ma y also r educe ho w long it tak es to secur e a 
booking appointment. Ho wever, this ma y also be challenging f or ser vices t o organise. 
The r ecommendation about off ering additional or longer ant enatal appointment s 
depending on need ma y lead t o a small incr ease in t he number of ant enatal appointment s, 
but t his is lik ely to be negligible and pot entially ha ve benefit s later on. 
The r ecommendation on t he use of int erpreters is not new but is not w ell implement ed in 
all unit s, so ma y involve a change in practice. 
In curr ent practice, pr oviding continuity of car er can be difficult t o achie ve and t here can Antenatal car e (NG201)

63be significant r esour ce implications; ho wever, the recommendation r eflect s NHS England's

The committ ee agr eed t hat t he recommendations w ould not r esult in a major change in 
practice but should r educe v ariation in practice and impr ove car e for women. 
Return t o recommendations 
Involving par tner s 
Recommendations 1 .1.14 to 1.1.16 
Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The committ ee recognised t hat w omen's home and f amily cir cumstances v ary, and it is up 
to the w oman t o decide who she ma y want t o involve in her ant enatal car e. Involving 
partners is an impor tant par t of ant enatal car e, and t he W orld Healt h Organization has 
emphasised t he impor tance of engaging wit h par tners during pr egnancy , childbir th and 
postnatally . The committ ee discussed t he impact t hat a par tner's suppor t, lack of suppor t, 
or their w ellbeing can ha ve on t he w ellbeing of t he pr egnant w oman. The committ ee 
recognised t hat t he w oman's par tner is oft en also an e xpectant par ent and being in volved 
in the ant enatal car e, if t he w oman so wishes, can pr ovide inf ormation and suppor t for 
them as w ell. 
The committ ee discussed t hat par tners can f ace man y types of barriers when engaging 
with ant enatal ser vices. Ther e was good quality e vidence on par tners' views and 
experiences of ant enatal car e that sho wed that w omen appr eciat e being able t o involve 
their par tners in ant enatal car e, but t hat t his can be difficult, f or example, because of t he 
partner's w ork patt erns. Ther efore, the committ ee agr eed t hat t he ser vices should 
consider adapting when t o off er ant enatal classes (f or example, in t he evenings or at t he 
weekends) t o enable par tners t o be in volved if t he w oman wishes. 
Evidence sho wed that par tners can f eel lik e bystanders in appointment s if, for example, 
there is no space f or them t o sit wit h their par tner. The committ ee agr eed wa ys that 
antenatal ser vices could pr omot e par tner in volvement. The committ ee agr eed t hat 
partners ar e not alwa ys giv en inf ormation, including on ho w par tners can suppor t the 
woman during and aft er pr egnancy , and t he general pr egnancy inf ormation t hat w omen

63Increased use of vir tual platf orms f or appointment s ma y also impr ove par tners' 
involvement in ant enatal car e. For example, t his could enable t he par tner t o att end 
remot ely if t he w oman has a f ace-t o-face appointment, or f or the couple t o att end 
toget her if she has a video appointment. Ho wever, the committ ee recognised t hat 
evidence on video consultations and appointment s was not r eview ed for this guideline, 
and t he benefit s, harms and e xperiences r elated to them is impor tant t o consider when 
planning ser vices. The committ ee also agr eed t hat it is impor tant t o car efully assess an y 
potential inequalities issues t hat could be associat ed wit h video appointment s, for 
example, among people wit h sensor y impairment s or language barriers, minority gr oups, or 
in relation t o access t o devices or int ernet connection. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t he recommendations ma y incr ease and pr omot e the 
involvement of par tners, while r especting t he w oman's decisions. The r ecommendations 
are not e xpect ed to have a lar ge resour ce impact or be difficult t o implement alt hough 
there ma y be some or ganisational changes needed t o suppor t making t he timing of

Why the c ommi ttee made the r ecommenda tions 
The r ecommendations w ere not de veloped b y the usual NICE guideline syst ematic r eview 
process. A new e vidence r eview was not consider ed necessar y because t he issues ar e

63factors t o be identified and managed. The committ ee used t heir kno wledge and 
experience t o list t he factors t hat should be discussed so t hat appr opriat e action can be 
taken, and car e tailor ed to the w oman's needs. F or example, it is impor tant t o not e which 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological r emedies t he w oman uses so t hat curr ent 
medication can be r eview ed in light of pr egnancy . It is impor tant t hat w omen do not 
automatically st op using t heir r egular medication wit hout consultation. This discussion also 
allows for individualised advice on saf e medicine use during pr egnancy and can help wit h 
identifying an y healt h issues t hat ma y have otherwise not come up. 
The committ ee also agr eed t hat it is impor tant t o discuss t he w oman's home and f amily 
situation and t he available suppor t she has. Ther e ma y be issues t hat can impact on her 
wellbeing, f or example, lack of suppor t, illness in t he family or a par tner's substance use 
issues. 
Sometimes t here ma y be a r eason t o review t he w oman's pr evious medical r ecords, for 
example, when her pr evious mat ernity car e has been in a diff erent or ganisation, she 
cannot r ecall details of a pot entially significant issue, or t he discussion someho w triggers a 
concern. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat healt hcare professionals should be awar e of t he 
dispr opor tionat e mat ernal mor tality and stillbir th rat es among w omen and babies fr om 
black and Asian back grounds and t hose living in depriv ed ar eas, as highlight ed by the 
2020 MBRRA CE-UK r epor ts on mat ernal mor tality and perinatal mor tality . This incr eased 
risk of deat h indicat es that int erventions t o impr ove engagement, suppor t and closer 
monit oring need t o be e xplor ed. F uture resear ch could help understand t he mechanisms 
underlying t hese disparities and what int erventions could impr ove the out comes. In 
general, action on t he wider det erminant s of healt h, including diff erent social, economic 
and en vironmental f actors, is also needed t o overcome such inequalities. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat domestic abuse put s bot h the w oman and her bab y at risk of 
harm, so it is impor tant t hat all pr egnant w omen ar e ask ed about it in a kind, sensitiv e wa y. 
Pregnancy can sometimes be a trigger f or domestic abuse or e xisting domestic abuse can 
continue or w orsen during pr egnancy , so it is impor tant t hat w omen f eel that t hey can 
disclose it saf ely so t hat t hey can be suppor ted, and int erventions put in place if needed. 
Although par tner in volvement in ant enatal car e is w elcome, it is also impor tant t o ensur e 
that t here is an oppor tunity t o discuss domestic issues priv ately wit h the w oman.

Identifying underlying car diac pr oblems is impor tant because car diovascular disease is t he 
leading cause of deat h among w omen in t he UK during and aft er pr egnancy , accor ding t o 
the 2019 r epor t MBRRA CE-UK: Sa ving liv es, impr oving mot hers' car e – lessons learned t o

problems, such as w omen wit h a family hist ory of car diac abnormalities or w omen who 
were brought up in a countr y wit h a high incidence of rheumatic f ever. Clinical assessment 
cannot identify all car diac pr oblems t hat cause mat ernal mor tality , but it might pick up

of underlying car diac conditions allo ws these w omen t o receiv e appr opriat e car e during

The committ ee also agr eed t he impor tance of inf ormation sharing betw een t he mat ernity 
unit and t he GP , and agr eeing t his wit h the w oman. This is par ticularly impor tant if t he 
woman has self -referred (because t he GP ma y be unawar e of her pr egnancy), and if

Risk assessment star ting in early pr egnancy enables incr eased monit oring of babies who 
are at an incr eased risk of f etal gr owth restriction, which is associat ed wit h fetal morbidity 
and mor tality . The committ ee w ere awar e of a vailable risk assessment t ools, such as t hose 
in the Royal College of Obst etricians and Gynaecologist s' guideline on t he in vestigation 
and management of t he small-f or-gestational-age f etus or the NHS sa ving babies' liv es 
care bundle v ersion 2. 
Evidence sho wed that ultrasound scans and symph ysis fundal height measur ement do not 
accurat ely pr edict a bab y being born small or lar ge for gestational age. Ho wever, the 
committ ee agr eed t hat t he curr ent r outine practice of using symph ysis fundal height 
measur ement t o monit or fetal gr owth should be used, because it is a simple and lo w-cost 
intervention and can aler t to fur ther in vestigations when concerns arise about t he bab y 
being eit her lar ger or smaller t han e xpect ed for gestational age. When t he symph ysis 
fundal height measur ement is lar ge for gestational age, ultrasound scans could be used t o 
assess t he siz e of t he bab y and t he volume of amniotic fluid. Small-f or-gestational-age 
babies ar e at an incr eased risk of perinatal mor tality and morbidity; t herefore, when t his is 
suspect ed, fur ther in vestigations should be done t o monit or the gr owth and w ellbeing of 
the bab y, taking int o consideration t he full clinical pictur e. 
The committ ee w ere awar e that man y women ma y request r outine ultrasound scans in lat e

corticost eroids ha ve well-kno wn harms, t he benefit s can outw eigh t hem so t hat some 
units use cor ticost eroids in se vere cases of nausea and v omiting in pr egnancy , and so a 
resear ch recommendation on t he eff ectiv eness of cor ticost eroids f or women wit h severe 
nausea and v omiting in pr egnancy was made. 
Some w omen wit h moderat e-to-se vere nausea and v omiting in pr egnancy might need 
intravenous fluids. The e vidence sho wed no diff erence in most out comes betw een off ering 
intravenous fluids in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Off ering t hem t o an outpatient is 
less e xpensiv e, reduces time spent in hospital and, in t he committ ee's e xperience, is 
generally pr eferred by women. Inpatient car e ma y be needed when se vere nausea and 
vomiting persist s despit e treatment. Hyper emesis gra vidarum can ha ve serious harmful 
consequences, and tr eatment and car e in hospital ma y be needed. It should be not ed that 
this guideline only co vers tr eatment s to manage nausea and v omiting in pr egnancy , and 
compr ehensiv e management of h yperemesis gra vidarum, which ma y include nutritional 
interventions, is not co vered by this guideline on r outine ant enatal car e. 
How the r ecommenda tions mig ht affect practice 
The tr eatment options ar e all used in curr ent practice but t here ma y be a change in 
practice in encouraging shar ed decision making f or diff erent options. This ma y mean t hat 
those pr escribing medicines ma y need t o spend mor e time discussing t he options wit h the 
woman. 
An incr ease in giving intra venous fluids as an outpatient ser vice inst ead of an inpatient 
service could bring cost sa vings.

The committ ee recommended considering eit her antacid or alginat e therap y for women

The committ ee did not mak e any recommendations about acupunctur e or pr oton pump

in alle viating hear tburn and t hat PPI use in t he first trimest er is not harmful t o the bab y, it

find an incr ease in v aginal dischar ge distr essing or uncomf ortable, so it is impor tant t o 
reassur e women t hat it is a normal f eatur e of pr egnancy . However, women should also be 
made awar e of t he sympt oms and signs of inf ection t hat ma y need fur ther action, because 
there is a small chance t hat some inf ections could lead t o complications. 
Candidiasis (t hrush) is oft en an easily identifiable cause of sympt omatic v aginal dischar ge 
and ma y not need a f ormal in vestigation. Ho wever, if there is doubt about t he cause, a 
vaginal swab could be used. It is impor tant t hat possible se xually transmitt ed inf ections

impact on t he bab y. 
The e vidence on antifungal tr eatment t o treat sympt omatic v aginal dischar ge because of 
vaginal candidiasis was v ery limit ed, imidaz ole being t he only drug class being studied. 
However, imidaz ole (f or example, clotrimaz ole or econaz ole) was consist ently sho wn to be 
effectiv e. 
The e vidence on t he benefit s and harms of antibiotics t o treat sympt omatic v aginal

oral amo xicillin (which is not commonly pr escribed in curr ent practice f or this indication) 
and oral metr onidaz ole. The committ ee w ere awar e of e vidence among asympt omatic

rather t han t o a ph ysiot herapist because, in some cases, inf ormation and advice could be 
given over the telephone or in an email or lett er rat her t han in a f ace-t o-face appointment. 
Moderat e quality e vidence fr om 1 randomised contr olled trial sho wed that a non-rigid 
lumbopelvic belt t oget her wit h general inf ormation about anat omy, body postur e and 
ergonomic advice r educed pelvic gir dle pain int ensity , compar ed wit h exercise advice and 
information, and inf ormation only . However, it did not ha ve an impact on functional status 
in daily activities. No e vidence was identified about adv erse eff ects of using a lumbopelvic 
belt. Pr oviding a non-rigid lumbopelvic belt was also f ound t o be cost eff ectiv e based on 
an economic e valuation, but because t he clinical e vidence base was limit ed, t he 
committ ee agr eed not t o mak e a str ong r ecommendation. 
The committ ee agr eed t hat t here was not enough e vidence t o sho w that manual t herap y 
alone had an y benefit s for women wit h pelvic gir dle pain, so did not mak e a

The committ ee agr eed t hat a r eview in secondar y car e is needed when une xplained
