1. Determination of fetal sex is an important component of
obstetric ultrasound examination and should not beconsidered optional.
2. Health care providers need to consider parental wishes regarding
disclosure or nondisclosure of fetal sex when reporting ultrasound
ﬁndings or reviewing the ﬁndings with parents.
3. Health care providers need to be cognizant of increasing
direct access of patients/parents to their ultrasound reports.
ABSTRACT
Objective: To provide guidance on ultrasound review of the fetal
perineum as well as fetal sex determination and disclosure.
Target Population: All individuals with ongoing pregnancies.
Options: To include a review of the fetal perineum and determination
of fetal sex as a component of the anatomic review during theroutine second-trimester obstetric ultrasound and adhere to patientwishes regarding the disclosure of fetal sex.
Outcomes: Prenatal diagnosis of fetal genital and sex anomalies or
variants, parental and pregnancy caregiver knowledge of fetal sex,and adherence to parental wishes regarding knowledge of fetal sex.
Bene ﬁts, Harms, and Costs: Bene ﬁts include the potential to improve
perinatal outcomes through the diagnosis of fetal genital anomalies
and respect for women ’s rightful autonomy over personal health
information. Potential harms or costs include a possible error in fetalsex determination, increased time for patients and health care
providers in scheduling and performing the imaging, and theminimal risk of patients choosing to abort a pregnancy if the fetus is
not the desired sex.
Evidence: Evidence built on the literature from the prior version of
this statement through a review of international guidelines,
Canadian legal rulings, and a literature search of PubMed and the
Cochrane Database. English language research articles, reviewarticles, and systematic reviews between January 1, 2003, andDecember 31, 2023, were included. Search terms included fetal
ultrasonography ,sex determination , and genitalia . The references
of relevant articles were assessed, and applicable articles wereincluded as well.
Intended Audience: All care providers for pregnant individuals in
Canada.
Social Media Abstract: Fetal genitalia should be examined in
pregnancy and the sex safely disclosed to the patient if they want
this information.
CONSENSUS-BASED GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENTS:
1. Diagnostic imaging providers and other health care providers
should respect parental wishes regarding the disclosure of fetal sex.
2. Diagnostic imaging providers should make every effort to determine
fetal sex during an obstetric ultrasound examination from the sec-
ond trimester onwards and should include this information in the
ultrasound report.
3. If fetal sex cannot be determined, re-examination or appropriate
referral is recommended.
4. The obstetric ultrasound examination reports should contain a
visible alert at the beginning of the report regarding the presence ofinformation on fetal sex, thus giving parents the option of not
reading any further.

In Canada, diagnostic ultrasound units are inconsistent
in their policies on the determination and disclosure of
fetal sex to patients. Fetal sex determination by ultrasound
has been recommended as part of the complete fetal
anatomic review with the caveat that determination may be
restricted by local practice or by dif ﬁculty in accurately
determining the actual fetal sex. However, once fetal sex isdetermined, a patient ’s request for disclosure should be
respected. This can be achieved by communicating directly
with the patient but should always be documented in the
report to the referring health professional.

Good Practice Statement 1
FETAL SEX DETERMINATION AND DISCLOSURE
The Supreme Court of Canada (McInerney v. MacDonald
[1992]) concluded that a patient is entitled to examine and
copy from his or her medical record all information the
physician considered in administering advice or treat-
ment.4The physician must justify denying access to the
record on the basis that doing so would not be in the
patient ’s best interest. Based on this ruling, it is legally
difﬁcult to defend nondisclosure. Disclosure of fetal sex
upon request respects a woman ’s rightful autonomy over
her personal health information.
Those who oppose fetal sex determination and disclosure
have concerns about the risk of error, the time involved in
determining fetal sex, and that the information may lead
women to abort pregnancies when the fetus is not the
wanted sex.
The risk of error in fetal sex determination is estimated to
be less than 2% in the second and third trimesters, but
prospective parents should be made aware of this possi-
bility with disclosure.5Fetal sex determination with ﬁrst-
trimester ultrasound is less reliable and, even in a
focused research setting, was not possible in more than
10% of cases and was compounded with erroneous pre-
diction occurring more than 10% of the time.6This degree
of error is not acceptable, and reliance on ﬁrst-trimester
ultrasound for determination of fetal sex is not recom-
mended. If early identi ﬁcation of fetal sex is desired
because of an increased risk of X-linked conditions or totailor the management of potential fetal congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) with
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is highly accurate and available
after 10 weeks gestation.7
Genital anomalies occur relatively frequently and are of
clinical importance. For example, hypospadias occurs in 1
out of 250 live male infants born worldwide,8,9while Ca-
nadian data show that 1 in 156 males born in Nova Scotiahave hypospadias.
10Antenatal diagnosis of hypospadias can
be dif ﬁcult but is of clinical relevance as this anomaly is also
associated with other genetic, anatomic, and growth ab-
normalities. As a more severe example, perineal anomalies
such as bladder exstrophy often present with ambiguous
genitalia, and antenatal diagnosis is therefore bene ﬁcial.
These cases warrant review by multiple disciplines to
optimize outcomes for affected pregnancies. Also, with the
increasing use of NIPS to screen for common autosomaltrisomies, pregnant women often choose to also screen for
sex chromosome aneuploidy as an early way to determine
fetal sex. Sex discordancy between NIPS genotype and
ultrasound phenotype is possible, allowing for the possible
identi ﬁcation of various conditions affecting normal sex
differentiation, such as those seen with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia in female fetuses.
11It is for reasons such as
these that examination of the fetal perineum should be
considered part of the fetal anatomic review, and every
effort should be made to have a complete assessment. Any
concerns should also prompt referral to select specialties,usually starting with maternal efetal medicine. Although
there is no evidence that fetal sex determination extends the
exam time, duration of examination is no longer of rele-
vance given the clinical importance of accurately assessing
this area of fetal anatomy.
Good Practice Statements 2 and 3
A small number of pregnant women may still consider
abortion when the fetus is an unwanted sex; however, this
matter is best addressed by the health professionals who
are providing care for these women. Given that fetal sex
can now be readily determined through maternal serum
cfDNA as early as 10 weeks gestation,12it has become
much less likely that fetal sex determination during the
second-trimester ultrasound would signi ﬁcantly contribute
to such abortions.
Although diagnostic imaging units may wish to maintain a
policy of nondisclosure of fetal sex, this information
should always be included in their reports. This would
allow the referring physicians or midwives to not onlyABBREVIATIONS

rare occasions, use this information to assess genetic risks.
However, both diagnostic imaging units and care providers
should also recognize the potential that patients might
access reports and inadvertently ﬁnd out the fetal sex
when their desire had been to not know this information.
As a result, the SOGC recommends that a bolded alert
always be placed at the start of the report indicating that
fetal sex is included in the results. Patients will then knownot to read further, if applicable.
Good Practice Statement 4
CONCLUSION
In summary, the SOGC recommends that fetal genitalia be
assessed as a part of the routine second-trimester obstetric
ultrasound9and that this examination now be considered
an essential element in the complete anatomic review. Fetal
sex should be determined, and a patient ’s request for
disclosure should be respected. This could be communi-
cated directly to the patient but should always be part of thereport to the referring health professional. A bolded alert
should always be placed at the start of the report indicating
that fetal sex is included. If fetal sex cannot be determined,
re-examination or appropriate referral is recommended.
