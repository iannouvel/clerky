1.0 Background 
 
The role of the on -call consultant is to support trainees and enhance the safety and quality 
of care for pregnant women / people and families. 
 
Ward rounds are an important part of patient care allow ing the whole team to share 
information and gain an oversight of the clinical condition , the social circumstances and the 
psychological impact and wellbeing of all pregnant women / people under their care. This 
enables staff to monitor, anticipate and respond in a timely way to emerging problems 
(HSIB 2020). 
Ward rounds also offer pregnant women / people the opportunity to ask questions and be 
involved in their care planning. 
Furthermore, ward rounds are an excellent opportunity for bedside teaching and clinical 
education. 
 
The role of the consultant may be to lead the ward round or to support other team 
members in doing so. At all times, consultants should be mindful of the professional 
behaviours they role model during ward rounds , includ ing respectful and courteous 
communication with pregnant women / people , families and all team members. 
 
Typically for an obstetric ward round, the midwifery coordinator, obstetric consultant, 
junior tier and anaesthetic team should be present. However, it is not essential for all those 
present on the ward round to enter the room of each woman / person and the team should 
be mindful of patient dignity and preferences. This is particularly the case for birthi ng 
women / people in active labour, those separated from their babies immediately after birth 
and those who have suffered a pregnancy loss. 
 
Where all team members do not see all pregnant women / people , it remains important 
that information is shared with all team members and everyone can input into the woman / 
person ’s care. This can be achieved during a board round before the ward round and 
updated again after the ward round. 
 
Acute obstetric consultants should conduct twice daily ward rounds, one of which should be 
in the evening (RCOG 2016) and the Ockenden Immediate Essential Actions echo this. 
 
There should also be a gynaecology ward round. Gynaecology consultants must ensure that 
they fulfil the standard that all pregnant women / people should be reviewed within 14 
hours of admission. This will ensure that clear decisions in relation to diagnostics and 
theatre are made. 
 
Regarding presence within the unit, and requirement for escalation; setting clear 
expectations for when the on -call consultant is to attend we reduce variation and confusion. SOP001 Consultant ward rounds and Presence 
University Sussex Hospital NHS Trust East Page 4 of 8 
 Providing defined requirements for attendance to the unit will break down barriers to 
escalation and promote better team working. 
 
2.0 PURPOSE 
 
• Meeting RCOG standards on the Role of the Consultant 
• Implementing Ockenden Immediate Essential Actions 
 
3.0 SCOPE 
 
This SOP applies to the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist on call and the teams 
they work in. 
 
4.0 RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
It is the responsibility of t he chief of service, obstetric lead and clinical director to 
• Develop the SOP 
• Ensure compliance with policies and procedures 
• Update the SOP as the need arises 
 
Compliance with t his SOP applies to all medical and obstetric staff caring for pregnant 
women / people . 
 
5.0 PROCEDURE for Ward Rounds 
 
In the updated scope of consultant job plans, ward rounds should occur twice per day. This 
should be a full departmental ward round in the morning and in the evening at least a board 
round with targeted ward round . 

On weekdays as a full departmental (labour ward, antenatal ward and where required, 
postnatal ward) round at: 
 
• 08.30 at RSCH site 
(NB. There is a consultant led gynaecology ward round at 08.00 -08.30) 
 
• 09.00 at PRH site 
• 17.30 board round / targeted ward round at PRH 
• 20.30 board round / targeted ward round (pre - or post - board round) at RSCH site 
• 20.30 telephonic board round with the night team at PRH Due to reduced consultant numbers and funding at PRH site, the evening weekday 
ward round will take place at 17.30 with a virtual round at 20.30. 
Once recruitment is complete, this will be revised to be in -line with RSCH site. SOP001 Consultant ward rounds and Presence 
University Sussex Hospital NHS Trust East Page 5 of 8 
 
At weekends : 
 
• Full departmental ward round at 08.30 on both sites. 
• Evening consultant board round and targeted board round at 20.30 at both sites 
• There should be flexibility within the scope of timing of a weekend ward round – eg. if 
the consultant has been present on the unit most of the day during a busy weekend, it 
would be reasonable to do an earlier evening review and not stay until 21:00.

6.0 Procedure for escalation to the On-call Consultant 
Consultant presence on the labour ward is expected as follows: 
• At RSCH the consultant presence on LW will be from 08.30 -21.00 Monday to Friday 
with consultant on-call from home from 21.00 -08.30 
• At PRH the consultant presence on LW will be from 08 .30-18.00 Monday to Friday 
with consultant on-call from home from 18 .00-08.00 
• At both sites there is consultant presence from 08.30 -12.30 Saturday, Sunday and 
Bank holidays, with on-call from home thereafter (and presence on labour ward for 
evening board and ward round as highlighted above) 
• Where the consultant is on-call from home, escalation should occur as highlighted 
below 
As per the RCOG Good Practice, ‘ Responsibility of Consultant On -call’ the following guidance 
is given with regards to consultant awareness and responsibility when on-call 
Where the registrar is unable to escalate due to clinical need, other members of the MDT 
should do so. 
All consultant contact details should be readily available on the ward and via switchboard.

 Where a consultant has been in overnight, and has clinical duties the following day, the 
consultant should make the management team aware that these may need to be 
covered / cancelled. 
Upon recruitment of a full complement of consultant staff, there should be provisions 
in the job plan to account for this.
