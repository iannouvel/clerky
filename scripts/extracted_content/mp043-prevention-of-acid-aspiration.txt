University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust Key Principles 
 
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards t o determine a course of action. 
Professional judgement may be use d in the application of a protocol. 
Scope 
 
This protocol applies to: 
• All women in labour 
Responsibilities 
 
Midwives, Obstetricians & Anaesthetists: 
• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance 
• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol 
 
Management Team: 
• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations 
• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff

University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust 1 Background 
 
 Late pregnancy and labour are associated with a particularly in creased risk of acid 
aspiration for a number of reasons: these include reduced rate of gastric emptying 
secondary to pain and opiates, a reduction in the barrier pressure at the lo wer 
oesophageal sphincter secondary to hormonal effects, and an incre ased intragastric 
pressure from the presence of the gravid uterus. Women with significant heartburn 
or obesity are at particular risk. 
2 Prevention of gastric acid aspiration: 
 
All women who require peri -partum anaesth esia for operative delivery or other 
procedures, such as, but not limited to: 
• Trial of instrumental delivery in theatre 
• Caesarean 
• MROP 
• Repair of perineal tear 
• Cervical suture 
 
should be managed with a neuraxial anaesthetic technique, unless specific contra -
indications apply, such as: 
• Maternal refusal of regional anaesthesia 
• Significant clotting abnormalities 
• Severe maternal or foetal compromise necessitating general anaesthesia 
 
2.1 Rapid Sequence Induction techniques should be considered for any pregnant 
woman or person requiring surgery in the second trimester, and must b e used 
from 20 weeks gestation and up to 48 hours post delivery. 
 
2.2 Reducing the risk in labour 
2.2.1 Low risk women in active labo ur progressing normally do not require 
antacid prophylaxis (p lease see Table 1) and may eat and drink as 
desired. 
2.2.2 Women whose active labour is not progressing normally or who have 
been identified as high risk for surgical intervention (see Table 1) should 
receive oral omeprazole 20 mg daily and metoclopramide 10mg orally 8 
hourly throughout labour. 
2.2.3 Labouring women who have been identified as high risk for either a 
difficult intubation or for aspiration should receive regular omeprazole 
and metoclopramide as above throughout labour (see Table 1).

labour 

2.3.4 The following group of women should be encouraged not to eat, & to limit oral 
intake to water, cle ar squash or isotonic sports drinks during active labour: 
 
• BMI > 40 at booking 
• Multiple pregnancy 
• Breech presentation 
• Oxytocin for augmentation 
• Abnormal cardi otocograph / fetal scalp pH 
• Significant meconium staining of liquor 
• Some labourers with epidural analgesia (discuss with anaesthetist)* 
*Not everyone with epidurals will be at increased r isk of surgical intervention. The 
anaesthetist should decide whether the patient needs to be given regular antacid Low Risk High Risk 
Fetal maturity (37 and 42 weeks) BMI >40 at booking 
Spontaneous onset Known or predicted difficult airway 
Singleton fetus Hiatus hernia 
Cephalic presentation Severe heartburn during pregnancy 
requiring regular medication (e.g. 
frequent Gaviscon) 
Normal maternal observations Hypertension/ pre -eclampsia 
Normal fetal heart rate Known fetal abnormality, IUGR 
Acceptable progress in labour Multiple pregnancy 
Clear liquor Malpresentation or position 
Maternal age between 16 and 40 Poor obstetric history / Previous

etc. 
Abnormal fetal heart rate detected 
Previous shoulder dystocia 
Previous 3rd stage problems

epidural. 
 
2.4 Reducing the risk in elective caesarean section: 
2.4.1 All women scheduled for elective caesarean section should receive oral 
omeprazole 20mg before going to be d the night before the scheduled 
procedure (@ approx. 22:00) and again the next morning before leaving 
home to come to the hospital . Metoclopramide 10mg will be given on 
labour ward on arrival 
2.4.2 Women should be encouraged to drink clear fluids up until 2 hours 
before the scheduled time for their procedure. This may include non -
fizzy energy drinks. 
2.4.3 If General Anaesthesia is required, the mother should receive sodium 
citrate 0.3M 30mls prior to induction of anaesthesia. 
 
2.5 Reducing the risk in emergency caesarean section 
2.5.1 Women who require an emergency caesarean section during labour 
should receive omeprazole 20mg PO or pantprazole 40mg IV and 
Metoclopramide (10mg/IV) if not taken orally within the last 6 hours, as 
well as 30mls Sodium Citrate 0.3M. 
2.5.2 Consideration should be given to emptying the stomach with a large 
bore orogastric tube after securing the airway with a cuffed oral 
endotracheal tube if the woman has eaten a meal within the last 6 
hours. 
2.5.3 Consideration should be given to Ultrasound assessment of the gastric 
antrum where there is any doubt regarding the sufficiency of gastric 
emptying if expertise to do so is available.
