1. Key recommendations
/C15 The diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of the membranes is made by maternal history followed by a
sterile speculum examination. [Grade D]
/C15 If, on speculum examination, no amniotic ﬂuid is observed, clinicians should consider performing aninsulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) or placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) testof vaginal ﬂuid to guide further management. [Grade B]
/C15 Following the diagnosis of preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, (PPROM) an antibiotic(preferably erythromycin) should be given for 10 days or until the woman is in established labour(whichever is sooner). [Grade A]
/C15 Women who have PPROM between 24+0and 33+6weeks’ gestation should be offered corticosteroids;
steroids can be considered up to 35+6weeks’ gestation. [Grade A]
/C15 A combination of clinical assessment, maternal blood tests (C-reactive protein and white cell count) andfetal heart rate should be used to diagnose chorioamnionitis in women with PPROM; these parametersshould not be used in isolation. [Grade D]
/C15 Women whose pregnancy is complicated by PPROM after 24+0weeks’ gestation and who have no
contraindications to continuing the pregnancy should be offered expectant management until 37+0weeks;
timing of birth should be discussed with each woman on an individual basis with careful consideration ofpatient preference and ongoing clinical assessment. [Grade A]
/C15 In women who have PPROM and are in established labour or having a planned preterm birth within 24 hours,intravenous magnesium sulfate should be offered between 24
+0and 29+6weeks of gestation. [Grade A]
2. Background and scope
Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates up to 3% of pregnancies and is associated with 30 –
40% of preterm births.1PPROM can result in signiﬁcant neonatal morbidity and mortality, primarily from
prematurity, sepsis, cord prolapse and pulmonary hypoplasia. In addition, there are risks associated withchorioamnionitis and placental abruption.
2
The median latency after PPROM is 7 days and tends to shorten as the gestational age at PPROM advances.3,4
This guideline comprises recommendations relating to the diagnosis, assessment, care and timing of birth of womenpresenting with suspected PPROM from 24
+0to 36+6weeks of gestation. It also addresses care in a subsequent
pregnancy. An infographic and audio version to supplement this guideline are available online (Infographic S1,

3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
The Cochrane Library and electronic databases (DARE, EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed) were searched
looking for the following terms in the title or abstract ‘preterm prelabour rupture of membranes’, ‘amnioinfusion’,‘chorioamnionitis,’ ‘intra-amniotic infection’, ‘IGFBP-1’, ‘PAMG-1’, ‘amniocentesis’, ‘antenatal corticosteroids’ and‘tocolytics’. The search was restricted to articles published until January 2019. The full search strategy is available toview online as supporting information (Appendix S1 and S2).
This guideline was developed using the methodology described in Clinical Governance Advice 1 (a-c).

4. Diagnosis
4.1 How is the diagnosis of PPROM made?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
The diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of
the membranes is made by maternalhistory followed by a sterile speculumexamination demonstrating liquor4D Given that this is the ‘gold standard ’,
further trials are unlikely to add to theevidence for this recommendation
If, on speculum examination, no amniotic
ﬂuid is observed, clinicians should
consider performing an IGFBP-1 orPAMG-1 test of vaginal ﬂuid to guide
further management2++ B Recommended in NG25.
5Studies have
reported high levels of sensitivity andspeci ﬁcity for these markers
The role of ultrasound assessment of
amniotic ﬂuid volume is unclear4 U No speci ﬁc studies identi ﬁed in the role of
liquor volume in supporting the diagnosisof PPROM
The presence of a pool of ﬂuid in the vagina at sterile speculum examination is highly suggestive of
membrane rupture, and when this is clearly observed no further diagnostic tests are required.
5Some
clinicians recommend that the woman lies ﬂat or in the left lateral for a period of time before speculumexamination to allow the amniotic ﬂuid to accumulate, though no evidence was identiﬁed to support thesepractices. Based on clinical evaluation, the diagnosis of PPROM can be equivocal in 10 –20% of cases.
When a pool of amniotic ﬂuid is not clearly observed, consideration should be given to testing for IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 if these tests are available, and further management undertaken as per NG25.
5Several
studies investigating these biochemical markers have found high levels of sensitivity and speciﬁcity.8,9
NG 25 emphasises that the test results for IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1 should not be used alone to decide whatcare to offer the woman and that clinical condition, medical and pregnancy history, and gestational ageEvidence

should be taken in to account. Testing for nitrazine is not recommended, and no further tests are
required if the woman is in established labour.5
No studies were identiﬁed speciﬁcally addressing ultrasound to determine amniotic ﬂuid volumes in womenpresenting with suspected PPROM. Ultrasound examination demonstrating oligohydramnios may be useful to supportthe clinical diagnosis of PPROM.
If PPROM is not conﬁrmed, the woman can return to her previous schedule of antenatal care; NG25
recommends that women should be advised to return if they have any further symptoms suggestive ofPPROM or preterm labour.
5Evidence
level 4
It is routine practice in the UK to obtain a vaginal swab for microbiological testing while diagnosing
PPROM, although evidence to support this practice is lacking. Group B streptococcus colonization may beidentiﬁed, which would inﬂuence the timing of birth (section 7.1). A prospective cohort study assessed thevaginal microbiome in women following PPROM; this concluded that following PPROM the vaginalmicrobiome was abnormal but the proﬁle did not correlate with latency duration.

5. Assessment
5.1 What is required antenatally to identify infection?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Acombination of clinical assessment,
maternal blood tests (C-reactive protein and
white cell count) and fetal heart rate should
be used to diagnose chorioamnionitis inwomen with PPROM; these parametersshould not be used in isolation4D Recommended by NG25
5
Women should be advised of, and observed
for, symptoms of clinical chorioamnionitis(lower abdominal pain, abnormal vaginaldischarge, fever, malaise and reduced fetalmovements)4D Recommended by NG25
5
One of the risks associated with PPROM is ascending infection leading to chorioamnionitis, and subsequent
fetal and neonatal infection. NG255recommends that a combination of clinical assessment (pulse, blood
pressure, temperature and symptoms), maternal blood tests (C-reactive protein and white cell count) and fetalheart rate using cardiotocography, should be employed to diagnose clinical infection. If the results of the clinicalassessment or any of the tests are not consistent with each other, it is recommended that the woman shouldcontinue to be observed and consideration should be given to repeating the tests as per NG25.
5Evidence
level 4
The white cell count will rise 24 hours following administration of corticosteroids and should return to
baseline 3 days following administration.11While a study investigating several maternal serum markers
for predicting histological chorioamnionitis after PPROM concluded that a raised C-reactive protein wasmost informative,

C-reactive protein has a sensitivity of only 68.7% and speciﬁcity of 77.1% in diagnosing histological
chorioamnionitis.13
When cared for as an inpatient, women with PPROM should have their vital signs, including pulse, blood pressure,respiratory rate and temperature, recorded on an obstetric early warning chart.
14They should also be observed for
clinical symptoms and signs of infection. When cared for as an outpatient, women should be advised of thesymptoms of chorioamnionitis and be reviewed regularly (including blood tests [white cell count and C-reactiveprotein], clinical recordings and fetal heart rate monitoring), for example, in a day care unit, maternity triage orantenatal ward, one or two times each week; if the woman has any concerns, she should attend the hospitalimmediately.
5.2 Should neonatologists be involved in the woman’s care?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Neonatologists should be informed when
the diagnosis of PPROM is con ﬁrmed and
delivery is anticipated4 U It is important to ensure that the neonatal
unit has the appropriate staff and facilitiesto care for the neonate should deliveryoccur
Women with PPROM should have the
opportunity to meet with a neonatologistantenatally to discuss their baby ’s care4 U This would be regarded as good practice
PPROM is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality, and often leads to preterm birth.

Neonatologists should be informed once the diagnosis of PPROM has been made and delivery is anticipated to
ensure that the neonatal unit has the appropriate staff and facilities to care for the neonate should deliveryoccur.
Where possible, once the diagnosis has been conﬁrmed, women with PPROM and their partners should be offered
the opportunity to meet with a neonatologist to discuss their baby’s care.
6. Management
6.1 Should antibiotics be given?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Erythromycin should be given for 10 days

A Cochrane review investigating the role of antibiotics for women with conﬁrmed PPROM found that the
use of antibiotics is associated with a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in chorioamnionitis (RR 0.66, 95% CI
0.46–0.96). There was a signiﬁcant reduction in the numbers of babies born within 48 hours (RR 0.71, 95%
CI 0.58 –0.87) and 7 days (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 –0.89). Neonatal infection, use of surfactant, oxygen therapy
and abnormal cerebral ultrasound prior to discharge from hospital was also reduced. There was nosigniﬁcant reduction in perinatal mortality
15or on the health of the children at 7 years of age.16The
antibiotic of choice and optimal duration of treatment are not clear; erythromycin 250 mg four times a dayfor 10 days or until the woman is in established labour (whichever is sooner), is recommended in NG25.
5
Penicillin may be used in women who cannot tolerate erythromycin. Alternative antibiotic regimens havebeen investigated.
17,18Co-amoxiclav should be avoided as it is associated with an increased risk of neonatal
necrotising enterocolitis,19and antibiotics should not be given unless the diagnosis of PPROM is conﬁrmed.Evidence
level 1 ++
6.2 What is the role of antenatal corticosteroids?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
In women who have PPROM from 24+0
weeks, antenatal corticosteroids
should be:Corticosteroids recommended by NG255and
supported by a meta-analysis of randomisedcontrolled trials
/C15offered between 24+0and 25+6
weeks of gestation2++ B Large cohort studies demonstrate bene ﬁts of
steroids for babies born between 24+0and
25+6weeks of gestation
/C15offered between 26+0and 33+6
weeks of gestation1++ A High-quality evidence that steroids reduce
the incidence of intraventricularhaemorrhage and the need for mechanicalventilation in PPROM
/C15considered between 34+0and
35+6weeks of gestation1++ A Given the high ‘number to treat ’and the
potential side effects of steroids,administration should be evaluated on anindividual basis
A meta-analysis of 17 randomised controlled trials has demo nstrated that the administration of corticosteroids to
women with PPROM reduces the risks of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 –0.98) and
intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 –0.96). No difference was observed between steroid and
control groups concerning the risk for necrotising entero colitis, neonatal sepsis and Apgar score of less than 7 at
5 minutes. Perinatal mortality was similar between steroid and control groups.
20A meta-analysis of observational
studies suggest no increased risk of chorioamnionitis or neonatal sepsis with maternal steroid use.21Evidence
level 1 ++
NG255addresses the administration of corticosteroids to women with PPROM from 24+0until
35+6weeks of gestation, recommending that when offering or considering corticosteroids a discussion
should take place with the woman about how steroids may help and the potential risks associated withtheir administration. Furthermore, NG25 recommends that repeat courses of corticosteroids should notbe routinely offered but that the interval since the last course, the gestational age and the likelihood ofbirth in the next 48 hours, should be taken in to account.

This Green-top Guideline covers the care of women presenting with suspected PPROM from 24+0weeks’
gestation. NG255recommends that corticosteroids should be considered between 24+0and 25+6weeks’
gestation. There is now good evidence that corticosteroid administration has beneﬁts when given to
women who give birth at less than 25+6weeks’ and indeed, at less than 24+0weeks’.22,23In contrast to
NG255we therefore recommend that corticosteroids should be offered from at least 24+0weeks’
gestation.Evidence

by meta-analyses of randomisedcontrolled trials that have shown areduction in cerebral palsy
Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that the administration of magnesium
sulfate to women in established preterm labour or having a planned preterm birth in the following24 hours, reduces cerebral palsy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 –0.88) and motor dysfunction in the offspring

6.4 Should tocolytic agents be used?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Tocolysis in patients with PPROM is not
recommended1++ A A Cochrane review found that tocolysis
does not signi ﬁcantly improve perinatal
outcome and might be associated with an
increased risk of chorioamnionitis
A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, tocolysis in PPROM is associated with an average
73 hours longer latency of delivery (95% CI 20 –126) and fewer births within 48 hours (RR 0.55, 95% CI
0.32–0.95).29Tocolysis was associated with an increased risk of a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7 and
an increased need for ventilation support. For women before 34+0weeks of gestation, tocolysis increased
the risk of chorioamnionitis. The review concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to support the useof tocolysis in women with PPROM, as there is an increase in maternal chorioamnionitis withoutsigniﬁcant beneﬁts to the neonateEvidence

6.5 Can women be monitored at home?
Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
The decision to offer outpatient care to
women with PPROM should be made onan individual basis, taking into accountmarkers of delivery latency3 U Retrospective cohort studies found no
differences in maternal or neonataloutcomes when planned home versushospital care was compared
The optimal method of monitoring to
predict adverse fetal outcome afterPPROM has not been determined2++ B A Cochrane review found insuf ﬁcient
evidence to allow recommendations
A Cochrane review to assess the safety, cost and women’s views about planned home versus hospital
care for women with PPROM identiﬁed only two relatively small trials (116 women) so that meaningfuldifferences between the groups could not be detected.
32Retrospective cohort studies from Canada (173
women),33and France (414 women),34found no difference in maternal morbidity, or neonatal morbidity
or mortality between the groupsEvidence
level 3
If delivery seems imminent, then in-patient care is indicated to prepare the woman for birth (including, if relevant,
the administration of intravenous magnesium sulphate).
The decision to offer outpatient care to women with PPROM, following a period of in-patient care, should
be made on an individual basis. Factors including past obstetric history, support at home and distancefrom the hospital should be taken into account in discussion with the woman about her preferences, andmarkers of delivery latency should be assessed (the presence of antepartum haemorrhage, amniotic ﬂuidvolume, gestational age at which PPROM occurs and clinical and laboratory markers of infection).
34,35
When considering the gestational age at which PPROM occurs, delivery latency remains relatively constantfrom 24
+0to 28+0weeks’ gestation at 8 –10 days (median) and then decreases to 5 days (median) at
31+0weeks.3Evidence

Amnioinfusion might improve neonatal outcomes in PPROM by preventing umbilical cord compression,
postural deformities, pulmonary hypoplasia and intrauterine infection.
40A Cochrane systematic review of
ﬁve trials (using the data from four) found that amnioinfusion is associated with: improved fetal umbilicalartery pH at delivery, reduced variable decelerations in labour, neonatal death, neonatal sepsis, pulmonaryhypoplasia and puerperal sepsis.
40Since the positive ﬁndings were due to one trial with unclear allocation

Recommendation Evidence
LevelStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women whose pregnancy is complicated

and who have no contraindications tocontinuing the pregnancy should beoffered expectant management until37
+0weeks; timing of birth should be
discussed with each woman on anindividual basis with careful consideration

assessment1++ A A Cochrane review found bene ﬁts from
expectant management, rather than earlydelivery, following PPROM in women withotherwise uncomplicted pregnancies.
The care of women with PPROM who are
known to be colonised with group B
streptococcus, is addressed in Green-top
Guideline No. 364D See RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 36.
6
The previous edition of this Green-top Guideline recommended that delivery of the baby should be considered
at 34+0weeks’ gestation. More recently, a Cochrane review of 3617 women explored the effect of planned early
delivery versus expectant management for women with PPROM.43The authors conclude that in women with
PPROM ‘with no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy, expectant management with careful monitoringis associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby’. The Cochrane review found no differencesbetween early birth and expectant management in neonatal sepsis or infection. Early delivery increased theincidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05 –1.53), and an increased rate of caesarean
section (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 –1.44). There were no differences in overall perinatal mortality or intrauterine
deaths when comparing early delivery with expectant management. Early birth was associated with a higher rateof neonatal death (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.17 –5.56) and need for ventilation (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 –1.58).
43Evidence
level 1 ++
The results and conclusions of the Cochrane review are inﬂuenced by those trials assessing ‘late’ PPROM (34+0to
36+6weeks’ gestation) such as the PPROMPT trial2and it is less clear whether expectant management to
37+0weeks’ gestation is appropriate for women who experience PPROM at earlier gestations. The Cochrane review
acknowledges that research is required to determine which groups of women with PPROM would not beneﬁt fromexpectant management, including gestational age at presentation.
The individual studies included in the Cochrane review
43had a number of ‘exclusion criteria’ including: active labour,
chorioamnionitis, concerns about fetal wellbeing, monochorionic multiple pregnancy, hypertensive disorders andother contraindications to continuing the pregnancy. Therefore the timing of birth should be discussed with eachwoman on an individual basis with careful consideration of patient preference and ongoing clinical assessment.

44This study also found that a short inter-pregnancy interval is
associated with greater riskEvidence
level 2 +
In pregnancies following PPROM, women should be cared for by an obstetrician with an interest in preterm birth;
ideally this would be in a dedicated preterm labour clinic. Modiﬁable risk factors, such as smoking45and respiratory
diseases46should be addressed. There is evidence that screening for lower genital tract infections and midwife
continuity throughout antenatal care are beneﬁcial in preventing preterm birth.47Clinicians may offer these women
genital tract screening for infection and/or serial transvaginal ultrasound scans to determine the cervical length, butthe evidence to support these interventions is lacking.

9. Recommendations for future research
/C15Studies are required to determine the antibiotic of choice and duration of treatment following PPROM.
/C15Controlled trials are required to determine whether magnesium sulphate has a role in PPROM when delivery isanticipated between 30
+0and 33+6weeks of gestation.
/C15Studies comparing a single bolus of magnesium sulphate with a longer intravenous infusion are required.
/C15Methods to monitor the fetus following PPROM require further investigation.
/C15The role of sealants to ‘repair’ fetal membranes is currently under investigation.
/C15Studies are required to determine whether there is a role for amnioinfusion in PPROM.
/C15Trials are needed to determine which groups of women with PPROM would not beneﬁt from expectant management.
10. Auditable topics
/C15Proportion of women with PPROM who are offered antibiotics for 10 days following PPROM, or until the
woman is in established labour (100%).
/C15Proportion of women who experience PPROM between 24+0and 33+6weeks of gestation who are offered
corticosteroids (100%).
/C15Proportion of women less than 30+0weeks’ gestation who receive magnesium sulphate within 24 hours prior to
birth (100%).
/C15Proportion of women with PPROM who are given the opportunity to discuss their care with a neonatologist (100%).
/C15Proportion of women with PPROM who birth in a centre without adequate facilities to care for their baby (0%)

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken
