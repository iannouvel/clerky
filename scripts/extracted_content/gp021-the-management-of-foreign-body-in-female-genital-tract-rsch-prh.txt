 OBJECTIVE STANDARDS 
1.0 Introduction: 
 
1.1 Foreign body insertion in the female genital tract is not an uncommon 
presentation in Gynaecology. 
1.2 This protocol provides guidance to help patient assessment and 
management. 
 
2.0 Causes: 
 
2.1 Missed tampon can simply be forgotten. 
2.2 Foreign bodies could be inserted accidentally by children. 
2.3 Foreign bodies could be inserted by patients themselves. 
2.4 Foreign bodies might be an indication of sexual abuse or domestic violence. 
2.5 Patients with mental health issues can insert foreign bodies either as self -
harm, seeking healthcare attention or sexual gratification. 
 
3.0 Referral: 
 
3.1.1 Patients in shock, because of bleeding, patients suspected of 
infection , including toxic shock syndrome, as well as p atients with 
suspected sharp foreign bodies, like broken glass or sharp metal, will 
need emergency referral . 
3.1.2 Patients with long forgotten foreign body with no suspicion of infection 
and no immediate risk their health can be seen during the day ti me 
either at the Gynaecology Assessment Unit (GAU) on the 
Gynaecology Ward or the Emergency and Ambulatory Care Unit 
(EACU) to be assessed. If surgery is required, then patients can be 
prepared for it and surgery can be booked as a scheduled procedure 
(category 3), as outlined below. 
3.1.3 Children (age < 16 years old) may need to be seen at the Royal 
Alexandra Children’s Hospital. 
3.1.4 A flow chart is shown to illustrate this (Flow chart 1). 
3.1.5 In the case of any doubt, advice can be sought from the on call 
Gynaeco logy middle grade or Consultant. 
 
4.0 Assessment: 
 
4.1 History: 
 
4.1.1 The patient, her relatives / carers may know the nature and number of 
the foreign body. Patients already in Mental Health Units may come 
with Mental Health staff members. 
4.1.2 At times, the foreign bod y might be accidentally detected on 
examination or investigation. 
4.1.3 It is important to ascertain whether this is the first time or not and 
whether the insertion was done by the patient / with her consent or 
against her wishes. 
4.1.4 It is helped to try to establ ish the duration of time the foreign body / 
bodies had been in place. This can be easy when the event of 
insertion is known to the patient and/or her relative(s) / carer(s). At 
times, this event may not be known and the foreign body / bodies 
might come to light later, for example by noticing discharge or University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust 5 
Protocol: The management of foreign body in female genital tract 
Date Agreed : Amended : Review Date: 
 bleeding or by accidental detection on examination and/or 
investigation. 
4.1.5 Checking for sexual abuse / domestic violence requires sensitivity and 
empathy. 
4.1.6 Advice may need to be sought from Mental Health Team regarding 
mental health issues. 
 
4.2 Examination: 
 
4.2.1 Principles for obtaining consent from children and patients lacking 
capacity apply for examination . 
4.2.2 For children, the child best interest should be noted and their co -
operation as well as parental agreement are important. 
4.2.3 Patients with mental health issues, including those detained under a 
section of the Mental Health Act, may have more complicated lega l 
issues. Support and advice can be soug ht from their treating team or 
Psychiatric Liaison T eam. 
4.2.4 Features of mental health, genetic disorder and domestic violence 
should be noted. These include scars, bruising, burns and swellings. 
4.2.5 General examination sho uld enable detecting signs of shock, like 
rapid heart rate and low blood pressure, in the case of severe 
bleeding, and infection, like raised temperature and heart rate. 
4.2.6 Local examination should be only carried out when safe for the 
examiner and with pat ient consent. A sharp foreign body can injure 
the examiner. 
4.2.7 Blood loss, discharge and urine / faecal matter should be noted. 
4.2.8 Speculum examination will enable visualising the foreign body and 
may enable its removal, with forceps. Prior administration of ana lgesia 
may help. 
 
4.3 Investigations: 
 
4.3.1 Full blood count will detect anaemia, as a result of bleeding, and 
leucocytosis, as a result of infection. 
4.3.2 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c -reactive protein will be elevated 
in the case of infection. 
4.3.3 Clotting and l iver as well as kidney function would be deranged in 
sepsis. 
4.3.4 Swabs should be obtained from any discharge that raises suspicion of 
infection, for culture and sensitivity. 
4.3.5 Blood cultures will need to be obtained in patients suspected of 
septicaemia. 
4.3.6 X-ray would pick up metal foreign bodies. Radiolucent foreign bodies 
may require other forms of imaging. These will need discussion with 
Radiology colleagues. 
4.3.7 The same consent requirements for examination apply for 
investigations. 
4.3.8 Urology and/or Colo -Rectal / General Surgical colleagues may need to 
be involved, if there is any suspicion of the foreign body perforating 
the urinary tract or gastro -intestinal tract. 
 
5.0 Treatment: 
 
5.1 Arrangement: 
 University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust 6 
Protocol: The management of foreign body in female genital tract 
Date Agreed : Amended : Review Date: 
 5.1.1 The same consent considerations for examination and investigation 
apply to treatment. 
5.1.2 Children may need to be admitted to the Royal Alexandra Children’s 
Hospital. 
5.1.3 Patients in shock, because of bleeding, will need resuscitation. 
Bleeding may not be extern al. Intravenous access should be 
established and intravenous fluid administered. Blood transfusion 
might be required. 
5.1.4 Patients suspected of infection will need antibiotic treatment, after the 
appropriate samples have been obtained for culture and sensitiv ity. 
5.1.5 Patients suspected of septicaemia may need admission to the High 
Dependency Unit (HDU) or the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU), after 
discussion with the Anaesthetic / Intensivist colleagues. 
5.1.6 Safe guarding rules should be followed, if there is suspicio n of sexual 
abuse or domestic violence. 
5.1.7 Patients with suspected sharp foreign bodies, like broken glass or 
sharp metal, and those with bleeding or toxic shock syndrome will 
need urgent removal of the foreign bodies (category 1). 
5.1.8 Patients with long forgott en foreign body where there is suspicion of 
infection but not serious enough to endanger their health will need 
emergency removal of the foreign bodies (category 2). 
5.1.9 Patients with no sharp foreign bodies, who are not bleeding or 
suspected of having toxic shock syndrome or infection can have their 
foreign bodies removed as a booked emergency (category 3). They 
can be admitted through Theatre Admission Unit on the day or at the 
Princess Royal Hospital for Confidential Enquiries into Peri -Operative 
Death (CEP OD) list. 
5.1.10 The grading is shown in table 1. 
5.1.11 Patients who require input from Urology and/or Bowel Surgical 
colleagues will need to have procedures organised as combined 
procedures. 
 
5.2 Procedure: 
 
5.2.1 Speculum examination followed by removal of the foreign body would 
be carried out. Whenever possible, a photo should be obtained and 
kept into the notes. This is likely to obviate the need for histo -
pathological examination, thought this examination might at times be 
required. 
5.2.2 The foreign body may need to be sent for microbiology, though a 
swab might be sufficient. 
5.2.3 Injuries should be looked for and repaired, if required. 
5.2.4 Antibiotics might be required. 
5.2.5 The use of catheters and bowel care will be according to the advice 
from the Urology / Bowel Surgical colleagues, if involved. 
 
6.0 After Care 
 
6.1 Patients are usually discharged home on the day, unless otherwise indicated. 
6.2 Habitual insertion of foreign bodies whilst in Mental Health Units may need 
Psychiatric / Mental Health Team help. Ensuring that patients do not have 
access to such foreign bodies, especially sharp ones, may help, though it can 
be difficult. Care arrangements can be discussed with the Psychia tric / Mental 
Health Team. 
6.3 Safe-guarding colleagues should be informed, as required. University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust 7
