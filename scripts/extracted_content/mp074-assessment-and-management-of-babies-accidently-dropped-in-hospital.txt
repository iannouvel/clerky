Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 4 of 8 Key Principles: 
 
A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards used to determine a course of action. 
Professional judgement and clinical context should be considered in the application of a 
protocol. 
 
Scope: 
 
This protocol applies to 
• All babies who are dropped by any person be it a member of staff, visitor or parent 
whilst in hospital. This is not applicable to those that are dropped at home or 
outside of hospital premises . 
• It is not applicable to older children over one year who would follow the normal 
Accident and Emergency pathway in the event of a fall injury. 
 
Responsibilities 
 
Midwives, Obstetricians & Neonatologists : 
• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance 
• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol 

Management: 
• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations 
• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff 
• To ensure that protocols are available for service users on request

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 5 of 8 1 Rationale 
 
The risks of accidentally dropping a baby are well known, particularly when a parent 
falls asleep while holding a baby; or when a parent or healthcare worker holding the 
baby slips, trips or falls. However, despite healthcare staff routinely using a range of 
approaches to make handling of babies as safe as possible, and advising new parents on 
how to safely feed, carry and change their babies, on rare occasions babies are 
accidentally dropped. 
The majority of incidents were in obstetric/maternity inpatient units by mothers who 
were drowsy or asleep or accidentally lost hold of t heir babies. Some occurred on 
neonatal w ards and others admitted from home as a result of an unplanned home 
delivery with a precipitate la bour. A number of these babies s uffered significant harm, 
fractured skulls, intracranial bleeding and seizures. 
Recent surveys by NHS Improvements using the National Reporting and Learning 
System (NRLS) identified 250 babies accidentally dropped in 2017/18. 91% whilst babies 
were in the care of their parents or family members, 4% due to a precipitate birth, 1% 
during delivery with staff present, and 1% whilst the baby was being cared for by staff. 
The remaining 3% of reports of dropped babies were unclear. 
The immediate response is vital to ensuring any injuries to an accidentally dropped 
baby are detected and treated as quickly as possible, but as automatic transfer of the 
baby to the emergency department is not always appropriate, clinical staff need easily 
accessible practical advice in managing this situation. 
 
2 Prevention 
 
New parents can be very tired and advice should be given regarding not to fall asleep 
with babies in the bed or chair. Whilst in the hospital setting staff can support this by 
regularly reviewing women and help to place babies into the cots. This also support s 
the sudden infant death syndrome advice SIDS regarding co sleeping. 
Parents should be advised not leave the baby unattended on a bed, sofa or changing 
table, even for a second, as they could roll off. 
 
3 Management of a dropped newborn infant 
 
This guideline is only targeting newborn infants that are dropped whilst on labour ward, 
postnatal ward or neonatal unit. Any baby that is at home or elsewhere outside the 
hospital setting fall under the responsibility of the children’ s emergency department 
(CED) for assessment. Assessment and Management MP074 
of babies accidentally dropped 
in hospital. (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 6 of 8 3.1 Within the hospital settings babies should be moved either in the mother’s 
arms on a bed/chair or in a cot for longer distances (i.e. from one level to 
another). They should only be carried for short distances. 
3.2 Any inpatient newborn infant that has been reported to the staff as dropped 
must be immediately reviewed by a midwife, nursery nurse or neonatal nurse, 
a full set of observations should be taken and a neonatal doctor /ANNP should 
be asked urgently to attend for a full clinical assessment . If the infant is 
unconscious, unresponsive, cyanosed or not breathing a neonatal emergency 
2222 ’ call should be put out . The baby should be safely moved to the 
resus citaire and have immediate resuscitation measures initiated according to 
the NLS algorithm . 
3.3 Whilst waiting f or the neonatal assessment the staff member present 
(midwife, nursery or neonatal nurse) should undertake neonatal observations ; 
saturation level, heart rate, temperature and level of response to stimuli and 
record on the NEWS chart with a visual assessment and immediate treatment 
of any obvious injury. 
3.4 If there is no available neonat al doctor/ANNP to review the baby, consider the 
use of a senior neonatal nurse. C onsider transfer to the children’s emergency 
department (CED) for assessment if a member of the neonatal team is not 
available 
3.5 A full clinical and neurological assessment with a documented management 
plan and a history of the incident should be made by the neonat al 
doctor/ANNP in the presence of a parent and communicated to the allocated 
midwife i f the assessment shows abnormal findings or there are any other 
concerns such as suspected non -accidental injury a senior neonatal doctor 
should be informed. 
3.6 The baby may have to be admitted to the neonatal unit. 
3.7 Medication and Vitamin K administration should be reviewed . 
3.8 It may be necessary to have photographs taken of any injury sustain ed and 
stored in the notes for future reference 
3.9 For a suspected severe head injury a CT scan may be ordered by a senior 
neonatal doctor dependent on neurological and clinical findings and 
considerations. (see 4. CT scan criteria) . A cranial ultrasound scan may 
alternatively be considered by the neonatal doctor/ANNP in infants where the 
CT indications are ambiguous but this should not delay a CT scan if indicated. 
The indication needs to be discussed with the radiologist on call. 
3.10 Dependent on the CT results further specialist advice/ possible transfer to the 
most appropriate place should be sought by the neonatal team including a 
senior neonatal doctor . Assessment and Management MP074 
of babies accidentally dropped 
in hospital. (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 8 3.11 Infants that fulfill no indications for CT scan should continue to have regular 
observations by the midwife/nursery nurse as per the management plan made 
by the neonat al doctor /ANNP, the frequency and extent depending on the 
findings and observations already taken . If a skull fracture is suspected an X -ray 
investigation might be indicated. 
3.12 The neonatal doctor/ANNP should continue to review these babies until 
reassured the re are no sequel ae before considering discharge home . 
3.13 All dropped newborn infants should have normal observation s for at least 12 
hours prior to discharge and be discharged by the neonatal doctor/ANNP . 
3.14 For infants that require neonatal follow up appointments should be arranged 
prior to going home. 
3.15 On discharge parents should be made aware of any observational changes that 
they need to be concerned about and the where to seek advice / help taking 
into account the possibility of late presentation of intracranial bleeds. 
3.16 The discharge summary/baby notes should contain clear documentation of the 
event and any injury the baby sustained treatment and follow up required for 
other health professionals involved with the family. 
3.17 Complete a Datix 
3.18 Communicate incident to social worker if patient known to them, clear 
documentation in the notes. 

4 CT scan Criteria in line with NICE recommendations 
The recommendations have been modified for the neonatal population Assessment and Management MP074 
of babies accidentally dropped 
in hospital. (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 8 4.1 Suspicion of non -accidental injury (also see 6. Safeguarding Issues) 
4.2 Post -traumatic seizure 
4.3 Suspected open or depressed skull fracture or tense fontanelle 
4.4 Any sign of basal skull fracture (haemotympanum, 'panda' eyes = periorbital 
ecchymosis , cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the ear or nose, Battle's sign = 
mastoid ecchymosis ). 
4.5 Focal neurological deficit. 
4.6 For children under 1 year, presence of bruise, swelling or laceration of more 
than 5 cm on the head (in the case of a newborn infant consider that these 
may be birth injuries rather than related to the fall) 
4.7 Fall directly on the head from more than 3ft ( 90 cm ) 
 
4.8 Clinically relevant observations/signs/circumstances as judged by neonatal 
doctor/ANNP (abnormal drowsiness, witnessed prolonged loss of 
consciousness, persistent vomiting, height of the fall ) 
5 Safeguarding Issues 
Any suspicion of non -accidental injury should be escalated to the safeguarding team for 
further advice and investigation.
