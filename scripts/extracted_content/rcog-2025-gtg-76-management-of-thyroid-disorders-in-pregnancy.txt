This is the first edition of this guideline. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
• To diagnose thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy, trimester- and manufacturer- specific pregnancy reference ranges for 
serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) are recommended for correct interpretation of thyroid 
function tests. [Grade B]
• To achieve the recommended daily iodine intake of 200–250μg when planning pregnancy, and during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding, consideration should be given to increasing dietary intake of iodine- rich foods or consuming daily oral sup -
plementation of 150μg iodine in the form of potassium iodide, as present in common prenatal supplements. [Grade C]
• Subpopulations with specific risk factors who are known to have a higher prevalence of overt thyroid disorders should be 
tested for thyroid dysfunction as soon as possible in pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester. [Grade D]
• Pre- pregnancy, in women with overt hypothyroidism and severe subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (TSH >10 mU/L, accom -
panied by normal fT4), titration of levothyroxine to achieve a preconception TSH ≤ 2.5 mU/L is recommended. [Grade B]
• Women should be counselled to self- initiate an empirical increase in their dose of levothyroxine as soon as they have a 
positive pregnancy test by doubling the dose of levothyroxine on 2 days of each week. [Grade A]
• For pregnant women treated with levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, TSH and fT4 concentrations should be checked every 
4–6 weeks until 20 weeks of gestation then once again at 28 weeks of gestation. [Grade A]
• Aim to keep the TSH below 2.5 mU/L while keeping the fT4 within the normal trimester- and manufacturer- specific preg -
nancy reference range. [Grade C]
• Pre- pregnancy, in women with SCH (TSH between the upper limit of the non- pregnant range and 10 mU/L, accompanied 
by normal fT4), particularly those already known to be thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positive, treatment with lev -
othyroxine should be considered preconception, with titration to achieve a preconception TSH ≤ 2.5 mU/L. [Grade C]
• During pregnancy, in women with SCH (TSH between the upper limit of the trimester- and manufacturer- specific preg -
nancy reference range and 10 mU/L, accompanied by normal fT4), levothyroxine should be considered, especially if newly 
diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy. [Grade C]
• Routine testing for TPOAb in women with euthyroidism is not recommended in pregnancy. [Grade B]
• Levothyroxine treatment is not recommended for women with TPOAb in the absence of thyroid dysfunction during preg -
nancy. [Grade A]

2 of 32 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 20251 | Purpose and Scope
Thyroid disease is a common endocrine disorder in women 
of childbearing age. There is variation in clinical practice and 
 approach to thyroid diseases globally, in part influenced by 
differences in population iodine status. There remains contro -
versy regarding testing for and management of thyroid disor -
ders before conception, during pregnancy and postpartum. This 
guideline presents the available evidence for best practice and, 
where evidence is lacking, consensus opinion by a multidisci -
plinary, cross- specialty team of authors is presented.
Preconception testing for thyroid dysfunction in the subfertile 
and recurrent miscarriage populations is not within the scope 
of this guideline and is addressed in a separate RCOG Scientific 
Impact Paper [ 1].
This guideline is for healthcare professionals who care for 
women, non- binary and trans people with thyroid disorders in 
pregnancy.
Within this document we use the terms woman and women's 
health. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not 
only women for whom it is necessary to access women's health 
and reproductive services in order to maintain their gynaeco -
logical health and reproductive wellbeing. Gynaecological and 
obstetric services and delivery of care must therefore be appro -
priate, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of those individuals 
whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were 
 assigned at birth.
2 | Introduction and Background Epidemiology
Dynamic changes occur in thyroid function through the course 
of pregnancy, to provide adequate concentrations of thyroid hormone to the woman and fetus [ 2–4]. Overall, demands on 
maternal thyroid hormone production increase by approxi -
mately 50% during pregnancy; this requires both an adequate 
supply of iodine for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones and 
the absence of significant thyroid disease.
Increased oestrogen in pregnancy raises thyroxine- binding 
globulin concentrations, starting very early in pregnancy, and 
plateauing by approximately 18–20 weeks of gestation. To main -
tain adequate free thyroid hormone concentrations, thyroxine 
(T4) and tri- iodothyronine (T3) production by the thyroid gland 
increases during the first half of pregnancy, a new steady- state 
is reached by mid- gestation and the synthesis of thyroid hor -
mones returns to pre- pregnancy rates. First trimester increases 
in human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which has weak 
thyroid- stimulating activity, transiently increases free thyrox -
ine (fT4) and free tri- iodothyronine (fT3) and decrease thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) [ 5]. From mid- gestation, as hCG 
declines, serum fT4 and fT3 concentrations decline gradually, 
while serum TSH concentrations rise slightly.
Iodine requirement increases considerably during pregnancy as 
there is increased consumption of iodine for thyroid hormone 
synthesis and increased renal iodine clearance [ 6]. The placenta 
may also be an organ of storage for iodine [ 7]. The fetal thyroid 
begins to take up iodine from 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and 
begins to produce and release appreciable amounts of thyroid 
hormone from 18 to 22 weeks of gestation. Breast milk produc -
tion from the second half of gestation adds further to maternal 
iodine demand [ 8].
Maternal thyroid hormones are essential for the maintenance 
of pregnancy and may influence placental development [ 9]. 
Transplacental passage of maternal T4 is essential for normal 
fetal development, especially neurodevelopment during the first 
half of gestation [ 10–12 ]. The fetus is completely dependent upon • If a woman is already known to be positive for TPOAb but euthyroid, they should be offered thyroid function test measure -
ments in the first trimester (preferably at first contact with a healthcare professional, including primary care booking) and 
at 20 weeks of pregnancy to detect development of hypothyroidism. [Grade C]
• For hyperthyroidism requiring treatment with antithyroid drugs while trying to conceive, use propylthiouracil (PTU) in 
preference to carbimazole (CMZ), at the lowest effective dose to maintain fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the refer -
ence range. [Grade B]
• When pregnant, where a woman with a history of hyperthyroidism has been euthyroid for 6 months or more on a low dose 
of an antithyroid drug, consider discontinuing antithyroid drugs with close thyroid function monitoring. [Grade D]
• If antithyroid drug treatment is required, PTU is the recommended drug during early pregnancy. If a woman conceives on 
CMZ a switch to PTU should be made as soon as possible before 10 weeks' gestation. [Grade D]
• During the first half of pregnancy, women on antithyroid drugs should have thyroid function monitored every 2–4 weeks 
with measurement of serum TSH and fT4. After 20 weeks of pregnancy, 4–8 weekly testing may be appropriate. [Grade D]
• Titration of antithyroid drugs should target fT4 concentrations in the upper half of the trimester- and manufacturer- specific 
pregnancy reference range. [Grade D]
• With the new finding of a suppressed serum TSH accompanied by an increased fT4 concentration in pregnancy, Graves' dis -
ease should be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis using a range of clinical features, and measurements 
of TSH- receptor antibodies (TRAb) and free tri- iodothyronine (fT3). [Grade C]
• Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis requires symptomatic and supportive management only. [Grade C]

3 of 32maternal T4 prior to commencing production of its own thyroid 
hormone but remains reliant on maternal supply of iodine [ 2] 
and continues to receive maternal T4 until birth [ 13].
Worldwide, iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable 
neurodevelopmental defects [ 14]. Among populations of severe 
iodine deficiency (defined by a median urinary iodine concen -
tration in a population of below 20μg/L) there is increased risks 
of endemic goitre, hypothyroidism, neurological and develop -
mental impairment, subfertility, miscarriage, infant mortality, 
trophoblastic or embryonic/fetal disorders, profound intellec -
tual impairment, deaf- mutism and motor rigidity in children, 
and childhood and adult learning difficulties [ 15]. In these areas 
of severe iodine deficiency, thyroid nodules have been reported 
in up to 30% of pregnant women [ 16]. In regions of mild to mod -
erate iodine deficiency, pregnant women are also at increased 
risk for the development of goitre [ 17] and thyroid disorders 
[18], with one observational study reporting an association with 
small- for- gestational- age (SGA) fetuses and preterm birth [ 19]; 
others showed no association with any adverse obstetric out -
come [ 20]. However, associations between lower maternal uri -
nary iodine concentrations and altered executive function [ 21], 
attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders in children [ 22] and 
impaired cognitive outcomes [ 21, 23, 24 ] have been reported. 
Meanwhile, in areas with adequate dietary iodine intake, vari -
ations in maternal urinary iodine concentrations have been 
shown to have limited influence on neonatal and infant devel -
opmental outcomes.
In iodine- replete and mildly iodine deficient populations, 
 autoimmunity is the commonest aetiology for thyroid disorders 
(Table  1). Untreated and inadequately- treated overt hypothy-
roidism (OH) is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous 
miscarriage, perinatal death, pre- eclampsia, pregnancy- induced 
hypertension, preterm birth, low birth weight and postpartum 
haemorrhage [ 25–27 ]. Untreated overt hyperthyroidism, com -
monly due to Graves' disease, is also associated with increased risks, in particular pre- eclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth 
restriction and maternal heart failure [ 28–30 ].
Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is common, affecting 
1%–5% of pregnancies in Europe [ 28], and is usually benign and 
self- limiting. Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is rarer and usually 
caused by Graves' disease; prevalence in pregnancy: 0.5%–1.3% 
pre- existing Graves', 0.05% new onset Graves', 0.1% toxic nod -
ular disease [ 4, 29 ]. Autoimmune Graves' disease is mediated 
by the presence of stimulating TSH- receptor antibodies (TRAb), 
and commonly improves with advancing gestation. Gestational 
transient thyrotoxicosis usually does not require treatment, 
whereas hyperthyroidism (caused by Graves' or toxic nodular 
disease) does. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as below 
normal serum TSH concentrations with normal concentrations 
of circulating thyroid hormones. Current evidence indicates that 
it is not associated with adverse fetal or pregnancy outcomes and 
therefore, does not require treatment (see Appendix F ) [31, 32 ].
Thyroid autoimmunity is the presence of circulating antithy -
roid autoantibodies that are targeted against the thyroid, with 
or without thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid peroxidase antibod -
ies (TPOAb) are the most common antithyroid autoantibodies. 
The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies varies between 5% 
and 31% across studies and populations [ 33]. In a large cohort 
of 19 556 women with a history of miscarriage or subfertil -
ity, thyroid autoantibodies were present in approximately 10% 
[34]. Euthyroidism with thyroid autoimmunity has been asso -
ciated with increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth and 
postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) [ 33, 35 ]. When looking at thyroid 
autoimmunity in conjunction with thyroid dysfunction, there 
may additionally be an association with increased risks of pre- 
eclampsia and gestational diabetes [ 36–38 ].
The incidence of clinically apparent nodules or goitre presenting 
in pregnancy in iodine- replete and mildly iodine- deficient areas 
is low [ 39]. Ultrasound- detected nodules are more common with TABLE 1 | Common thyroid function disorders in pregnancy.

thyroid hormones, which may not be due to excess thyroid hormone production or hyperthyroidism. Hence, hyperthyroidism comprises a subset of thyrotoxic cases.

or goitre is diagnosed in pregnancy, local symptoms such as 
tracheal compression should be assessed, and malignancy and 
 hyperthyroidism excluded.
There is controversy concerning the need and cost- effectiveness 
of routinely testing for thyroid disease (Table  1) and for thyroid 
autoimmunity in the first trimester of pregnancy or in women 
who are planning for pregnancy. Whether levothyroxine treat -
ment improves pregnancy and offspring outcomes in subclinical 
hypothyroidism (SCH) and isolated hypothyroxinaemia (IH) 
 remains debatable. Controversies in the care of these conditions 
for the general obstetric population will be discussed in this 
guideline. Uncertainties in the management of thyroid function 
abnormalities in the care of subfertility and recurrent miscar -
riage is addressed specifically in a separate RCOG Scientific 
Impact Paper [ 1].
Both inadequate and excessive treatment of thyroid disorders, 
the choice of treatment, as well as delayed commencement and 
adjustment of treatment, can also result in detrimental effects 
on the pregnancy and fetus. Therefore, care should be opti -
mised prior to conception, during pregnancy and after birth, 
and should be provided by clinicians with appropriate expe -
rience (see Appendix  C for suggested designated roles and 
responsibilities of healthcare professionals, and care path -
ways). There should be a clear designated primary clinician 
and this will depend upon local expertise. This is important 
to ensure continuity of care over the course of pregnancy, 
 minimise confusion with regards to treatment adjustments 
and to improve overall experience. Where possible, women 
and people with thyroid disorders should be seen in joint 
multidisciplinary clinics, both when planning pregnancy and 
during pregnancy, comprising clinicians with obstetric and 
endocrine expertise.
3 | Identification and Assessment of Evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodol -
ogy for developing RCOG Green- top Guidelines (GTGs) [ 42]. 
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
Effects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE and Trip were 
searched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all 
relevant articles published until July 2023. The databases were 
searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 
terms, including all subheadings and synonyms, and this was 
combined with a keyword search. Search terms included ‘*thy -
roid diseases’, ‘*euthyroid sick syndromes’, ‘*goitre’, ‘*hyperthy -
roidism’, ‘*hyperthyroxinemia’, ‘*thyroid dysgenesis’, ‘*thyroid 
nodule' and ‘*thyroiditis'. The search was limited to studies on 
humans and papers in the English language. Relevant guidelines 
were also searched for using the same criteria in the National 
Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available 
 evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and graded 
accordingly. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of recommendations may be found in 
Appendix  A.

used for guidance. 
In the absence of 
appropriate information 
it is reasonable to set an 
upper limit for TSH of 
4.0 mU/L in pregnancy3 C Use of a TSH of 
4.0 mU/L as the 
upper limit of the 
first trimester 
reference range is 
a pragmatic choice, 
and many studies 
use this threshold 
in reporting 
associations with 
risk of pregnancy

For pregnant women 
who are on any thyroid- 
related medication, use 
of specific treatment

are recommended (see 
Sections  7–9), instead

not applicable [ 43] and carry the risk of misdiagnosis [ 44, 45 ].

thyroid function tests it is recommended that thyroid dysfunc -
tion in pregnant women is diagnosed using trimester- and man -
ufacturer- specific pregnancy reference ranges for serum TSH 
and fT4 [ 45–47 ]. [Evidence level 2+]
Ideally these references should be derived on a population with 
similar iodine status and family origin to the population to 
which they are being applied, and these should be provided by 
the laboratory.
Where such pregnancy reference ranges are not issued by the 
laboratory alongside thyroid function test results, published 
thyroid function reference ranges in pregnancy for the particu -
lar assay manufacturer may be applied (see Appendix  D for the 
commonly used assays in the UK) [ 46], and the laboratory should 
also inform clinicians when there are changes in assays used.
In conditions where hCG may be higher such as multiple preg -
nancies, TSH concentrations are correspondingly lower [ 48].

Iodine requirements vary depending on age and physiological 
status [ 49], with pregnant and lactating women and people hav -
ing the highest requirements. [Evidence level 2++]
There is international consensus about the required total iodine 
intake being 200–250μg iodine daily. However, different organ -
isations have made slightly different recommendations on how 
the increased iodine needs could be met [ 14, 50–52 ]. An import -
ant distinction needs to be made between total iodine ingested 
and the dietary supplementation that may be required to achieve 
the total daily iodine intake.
Iodine content is low in most naturally occurring foods [ 53] 
and for most people across the world, the chief source of 
 dietary iodine is added iodine, either from salt- fortification or 
from dairy products where iodine is added to animal feed or 
because of the use of iodine- containing antiseptics. Important 
sources of iodine in the diet include cow's milk (non- organic 
milk 50–100μg per 200 mL), yoghurt (50–100μg per 150 g), and 
eggs (20–26μg per egg), and the iodine content of fish such as 
cod (~70–190μg per 100 g) and haddock (~325–430μg per 100 g) 
is high. In general, marine fish (average ~20μg per 100 g) have 
a higher iodine content than freshwater fish (average ~6.5μg 
per 100 g) [54]. Given the concern of mercury contamination, 
pregnant women should not consume more than 2–3 servings 
of fish a week. Individuals who have a low intake of foods with 
higher iodine content (e.g., dairy products, fish and iodised 
salt) could be considered at risk of having low iodine intake, 
and iodine supplementation should be recommended. In par -
ticular, women with a predominantly plant- based diet are at 
risk of iodine insufficiency [ 55]. Food factsheets for women in 
the UK are available [ 56]. However, excessive intake of highly 
iodine- rich foods should be avoided.
Median urinary iodine concentrations are markers of population 
iodine status. Urinary iodine testing is not beneficial for individ -
ual assessment since there is substantial diurnal and day- to- day

6 of 32 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025variation in urinary iodine excretion and, therefore, urinary 
 iodine concentrations cannot be used to identify particular indi -
viduals with iodine deficiency [ 57, 58 ]. [Evidence level 2++]
Surveys of urinary iodine in some geographical areas around the 
world continue to reveal significant numbers of young women 
with suboptimal iodine nutrition, particularly during pregnancy 
and lactation, even in areas where iodisation of salt has been 
implemented [ 59–61 ]. [Evidence level 2+]
There is controversy about whether women and people of 
 reproductive years in the UK are deficient in iodine. A previ -
ous nationwide UK study of 14–15- year- old girls in 2009 found 
mild iodine deficiency [ 62] but the National Diet and Nutrition 
Survey [ 63] found, on average, adequate iodine status in women 
of childbearing age (16–49 years of age) and children (4–18 years 
of age) by 2016. A more recent study [ 64] of urinary iodine 
concentrations in pregnancy in three UK cities demonstrated 
 iodine concentrations were insufficient in the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy. In the UK, there is an absence of con -
clusive evidence to date regarding sufficiency of iodine intake 
by women in the reproductive years and there is evidence that 
at least 50% of women are iodine deficient in the first trimester 
of pregnancy. In addition, studies have shown that knowledge of 
iodine requirements and sources is very poor among pregnant 
women and people in the UK [ 64].
The timing of supplementation is likely to be important. If 
 iodine supplementation is commenced pre- pregnancy in iodine- 
deficient populations, improved maternal thyroid function can 
be observed, depending on dose and the timing of initiation; 
beneficial effects of iodine on fetal development are likely to be 
greater with commencement of supplementation at an earlier 
gestation [ 65]. [Evidence level 3]
While there is strong evidence that correction of severe iodine 
deficiency at a population level will reduce intellectual impair -
ment in children [ 66, 67 ], studies investigating the benefits of 
individual iodine supplementation in pregnancy in populations 
of mild–moderate iodine- deficiency have shown inconsistent 
 results [ 68–74 ].
A 2017 Cochrane meta- analysis included over 2700 women, 
mostly from populations of mild to moderate iodine deficiency 
[75]. Iodine supplementation decreased the likelihood of post -
partum hyperthyroidism and increased the likelihood of gas -
trointestinal symptoms in pregnancy. There were no clear 
differences between groups for prevalence of hyperthyroidism 
in pregnancy, hypothyroidism or maternal TPOAb positivity in 
pregnancy or postpartum, or preterm birth. Iodine supplemen -
tation was associated with a non- significant trend of a lower 
perinatal mortality, with all of the observed perinatal deaths 
occurring in one trial conducted in a severely iodine deficient 
setting. There were no clear differences in neonatal outcomes. 
[Evidence level 2–]
A study of daily iodine supplementation commencing in the 
early second trimester in pregnant women from a mild to 
moderately iodine deficient population demonstrated small 
negative effects on maternal T4 concentrations, but no effects 
on child development [ 76]. [Evidence level 1–] The median urinary iodine concentration in the placebo group in this study 
remained within the recommended range in the second and 
third trimesters, which may have been caused by a physiologi -
cal increase in renal iodine clearance, or the recruited women 
may have had adequate iodine exposure before pregnancy, 
or because women enrolled in the study were told about the 
importance of iodine in pregnancy and may have increased 
their iodine intake [ 77].
There were insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclu -
sions on the benefits and harms of routine iodine supplementa -
tion before, during or after pregnancy. Because of study design 
limitations and wide confidence intervals, and due to the small 
number of trials included, these findings must be interpreted 
with caution. Almost all the evidence came from settings with 
mild to moderate iodine deficiency and, therefore, may not be 
applicable to settings with severe deficiency, but may be applica -
ble to the UK population. Modelling has suggested that univer -
sal iodine supplementation in pregnancy could be cost- effective 
[8, 78 ], but this is not yet practised in the UK.
Excess iodine exposure in pregnancy at sustained levels exceed -
ing 500μg daily can cause serious adverse health effects for both 
the women and fetus, and should be avoided. This may occur 
through ingestion of supplements, water or foods with high 
 iodine content, or because of medical treatments or procedures. 
Acute iodine poisoning may cause gastrointestinal or cardio -
vascular symptoms and coma [ 79], and tends to occur in iodine 
replete areas. It is unlikely that oral iodine supplementation in 
doses present in common prenatal supplements taken during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding by UK woman will lead to iodine 
levels that will cause such adverse health effects in women and 
their babies. [Evidence level 3]
Women with diagnosed and treated overt thyroid disorders 
may safely consume common prenatal supplements containing 
 iodine (approximately 150μg daily). [Evidence level 4]

constitute a small proportion of abnormal results with the vast 
majority falling into the gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, 
SCH and IH groups, where the benefit of treatment is not yet 
proven.
The Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening (CATS) study 
in the UK and Italy was a prospective randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) investigating the benefit of pregnant population 
screening ( n = 21 846) for an increased TSH concentration (SCH 
or OH) or a low fT4 concentration (IH) for improving neuro -
cognitive outcomes of children [ 91]. In total 5% screened posi -
tive, of which 390 were in the intervention group who initiated 
levothyroxine 150μg per day at a mean of 13+3 weeks of gesta -
tion, and 404 were in the control untreated group. This study 
demonstrated no difference between groups in child cognitive 
function at 3 years of age.
Another study in the US screened 97 228 pregnant women 
 between 8 and 20 weeks of gestation and found 6.8% of results 
abnormal, consisting of 0.5% with OH, 0.3% overt hyperthy -
roidism, 3% SCH and 3% IH. Women with SCH ( n = 677) and 
IH ( n = 526) were randomised in a placebo- controlled trial 
which showed no significant effect of levothyroxine ther -
apy, when commenced at a median gestation of 17 weeks 
(beyond the first trimester when maternal thyroid hormones are 
believed to have the greatest effect), on child cognitive func -
tion and other indexes of neurodevelopment up to 5 years of 
age, as well as on adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes 
[92]. [Evidence level 1–]
6.2 | Should Thyroid Function Testing Be Carried 
out in a Targeted Population of Pregnant Women 
Who Are at Risk of Thyroid Dysfunction?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for

Subpopulations 
with specific risk 
factors who are 
known to have a 
higher prevalence 
of overt thyroid 
disorders should be 
tested for thyroid 
dysfunction as 
soon as possible 
in pregnancy 
(preferably in the 
first trimester)2— D A risk- based approach to 
thyroid function testing 
during pregnancy 
remains controversial as 
there is a lack of global 
consensus on the factors 
that should trigger 
such testing. However, 
there are some well- 
established risk factors, 
and early identification 
and treatment of overt 
thyroid disorders 
improves pregnancy 
outcomes, therefore a 
risk- based approach 
is justified
Risk- based testing 
in pregnancy 
should be for 
TSH and fT4 
simultaneously4 GPP This avoids any 
additional delays in 
making a diagnosis 
and facilitates starting 
treatment in the first 
trimester where possibleSince untreated overt thyroid dysfunction is associated with 
poorer pregnancy and child outcomes, it is reasonable to con -
sider targeted testing strategies based on existing observational 
data until new information comes to light. However, test -
ing is more likely to uncover subclinical thyroid conditions. 
Subclinical thyroid dysfunction in obstetric populations is typi -
cally not the dominant factor dictating obstetric and childhood 
outcomes, but could add significantly to the risk imposed by 
co- morbidities. Therefore, treatment efficacy and cost effective -
ness is likely not equivalent in women of low and high obstetric 
risk, although no such comparative study has been conducted.
Targeted testing as soon as possible in pregnancy, preferably at 
first contact with a healthcare professional by the middle of the 
first trimester, should be offered to women at an increased risk 
of thyroid dysfunction. Consideration for testing should be given 
to three broad groups of women (Table 2 ).
6.2.1 | Women With a Personal History of a Thyroid 
Disorder or at Risk of Progressive Thyroid Dysfunction 
in Pregnancy
These include those with a history of any thyroid disorder or thy -
roid insult, women on thyroid disruptive medication or with typ -
ical discriminatory signs and symptoms of a thyroid disorder. It 
has been shown that at 8 years post head or neck irradiation, 67% 
of women developed hypothyroidism [ 93]. After post- partum 
thyroiditis, 10% remain permanently hypothyroid while approxi -
mately 20%–30% become hypothyroid in 3–5 years and 50%–60% 
by 8–10 years post- birth [ 94–98 ]. One later study even reported 
a rate of permanent hypothyroidism as high as 54% at the end 
of the first postpartum year. Study differences are likely due to 
differences in population iodine status and participant charac -
teristics, and study methodology. [Evidence level 2++]
In cases of thyroid autoimmunity and previous thyroid dam -
age, in addition to the established risk of progression when not 
pregnant, the risk of development of hypothyroidism further 
 increases in pregnancy [ 99, 100 ].
6.2.2 | Women With Autoimmune Conditions Who Are 
at Risk of Hypothyroidism and Obstetric Complications
Autoimmune disorders in general are associated with a higher 
prevalence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It is espe -
cially important to diagnose overt thyroid diseases in women 
known to have an autoimmune disorder that already puts 
them at a higher risk of pregnancy complications. The inci -
dence of newly diagnosed OH in pregnancy in type 1 diabetes 
and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported to 
be 16% [ 101] and 11% [ 102], respectively. Importantly, preterm 
birth occurred in 18% of women with euthyroidism with SLE 
compared with 65% if the woman had SLE with thyroid dys -
function detected at any time in pregnancy or postpartum 
[102], suggesting a synergistic effect of thyroid dysfunction 
and SLE on pregnancy risk. Also the risk of congenital heart 
block in cases of maternal positivity for anti- Ro or anti- La was 
also higher if the woman had concurrent thyroid dysfunction 
[103]. [Evidence level 3]

or Stillbirth
Observational studies have linked overt and subclinical thy -
roid dysfunction with late pregnancy loss [ 104, 105 ]. [Evidence 
level 2–]
In line with RCOG Green- top Guideline No. 55 Late Intrauterine 
Fetal Death and Stillbirth [ 106], which recommends thyroid 
function testing as part of the immediate post- partum investiga -
tion for stillbirth, thyroid function testing should be considered 
in women with a previous history of stillbirth or second trimes -
ter miscarriage if they had not previously had a normal thyroid 
function test documented post- adverse event.
7 | Hypothyroidism
Retrospective observational studies of presumed treated OH 
have shown no difference in pregnancy outcome compared with 
women without OH. However, the adequacy of OH treatment 
or the absence of hypothyroidism in the control group was not 
specifically ascertained [ 107]. Treatment needs to be adequate, 
and ideally optimised pre- conception, with appropriate advice 
given before pregnancy on instituting an empirical dose increase 
upon conception to prevent hypothyroidism in early pregnancy. 
Adverse pregnancy outcomes including premature birth, low 
birth weight, pregnancy loss, and impaired neurological develop -
ment in babies are more common and severe in OH than in SCH. 
A retrospective study of more than 1000 pregnant women on 
levothyroxine replacement therapy, demonstrated that the risk 
of pregnancy loss increased proportionally to the degree of TSH 
elevation above 4.5 mU/L in the first trimester [ 108]. Similarly, the incidence of neurodevelopmental defects and lowering of 
children's IQ at 7–9 years of age demonstrated a graded response 
with higher maternal TSH concentrations during pregnancy 
 associated with higher risk to children [ 109]. [Evidence level 2+]
The goal of levothyroxine treatment is to normalise and main -
tain maternal serum TSH values within the trimester- specific 
pregnancy reference range, and to mimic physiological changes 
and prospectively prevent abnormalities in thyroid function. 
Hence, dose titration using the lower half of the TSH reference 
range as a guide is commonly adopted during pregnancy (i.e., 
0.1–2.5 mU/L) [ 110]. [Evidence level 2–]
In pregnancy, SCH may be defined as an increased TSH above 
the upper limit of the trimester- specific pregnancy reference 
range, with severe SCH defined as cases with TSH greater 
than 10 mU/L, accompanied by normal concentrations of thy -
roid hormones. The annual rate of progression of SCH to OH in 
the non- pregnant population ranges from 2% to 6% [ 111]. Risk 
factors for progression include increased TPOAb and an initial 
TSH above 10 mU/L [ 112]. In pregnant women who are TPOAb 
positive, post- hemithyroidectomy, or treated with radioactive 
iodine, progression to OH is more likely due to the inability of 
the thyroid to augment production when needed during preg -
nancy. [Evidence level 2+]
Observational studies have linked SCH with adverse preg -
nancy outcomes. Meta- analyses of individual participant data 
(n = 47 045, 19 cohorts) showed that SCH was associated with 
a higher risk of pre- eclampsia (odds ratio [OR] 1.53; 95% confi -
dence interval [CI] 1.09–2.15) [ 113], preterm birth (OR 1.29; CI 
1.01–1.64) [ 114], and SGA at birth (OR 1.24; CI 1.04–1.48) [ 115].

9 of 32Other meta- analyses reported increased risks of pregnancy 
loss (OR 1.93; CI 1.40–2.64); hypertensive disorders of preg -
nancy (OR 1.54; CI 1.21–1.96) [ 116]; placental abruption (OR 
2.16; CI 1.15–4.06) [ 117]; breech presentation at term (OR 2.3; 
CI 1.50–3.51); and an increased incidence of neurodevelop -
mental defects (correlated with degree of TSH elevation) [ 109]. 
[Evidence level 2–]
Levothyroxine treatment is recommended for pregnant 
women with severe SCH (TSH above 10 mU/L) where there is 
considerable risk of further progression to OH. Levothyroxine 
treatment should also be considered for those with SCH where 
the TSH is between the upper limit of the pregnancy reference 
range and 10 mU/L, particularly if TPOAb positive, in order to 
reduce the risk of developing OH and associated complications 
in pregnancy [ 51, 118 ]. Even though the two largest trials of 
treatment of SCH [ 91, 92 ] (discussed in Section  6) reported no 
difference in maternal and child outcomes with levothyroxine 
treatment, they were still limited statistically by both sample 
size and late commencement of treatment, usually from the 
second trimester of pregnancy. When these trials were con -
sidered together with others in a systematic review and meta- 
analysis totalling seven RCTs and six observational studies 
(N = 7342) [ 119] it was concluded that levothyroxine treat -
ment of SCH may reduce the risk of pregnancy loss (relative 
risk [RR] 0.79; CI 0.67–0.93) and neonatal death (RR 0.35; CI 
0.17–0.72). [Evidence level 2–]
Another meta- analysis included only studies which defined SCH 
in pregnancy using a TSH threshold of greater than 4 mU/L; 
this study which included three RCTs and three observational 
studies ( N = 7955) [ 120] reported a reduction in pregnancy loss 
(OR 0.55; CI 0.43–0.7), as well as preterm birth (OR 0.63; CI 
0.41–0.98) and gestational hypertension (OR 0.78; CI 0.63–0.97) 
with levothyroxine treatment. [Evidence level 2–]
IH is considered to be a distinct biochemical entity, usually 
defined as a fT4 concentration below the 2.5th percentile, 
with a TSH within the reference range. However, there 
 remains some variability of IH definition, and an absence of 
established regional reference ranges (that account for iodine 
status) in TPOAb negative populations could lead to misclas -
sification of IH status [ 121]. The most common cause of IH is 
 iodine deficiency [ 84]. Other proposed causes include obesity 
[122], iron deficiency [ 123], and exposure to organochlorine 
pesticides [ 124].
Some studies have shown an association between hypothy -
roxinaemia and poorer cognitive development of the children 
[125–127 ]. Results from observational studies of IH on preg -
nancy outcomes are conflicting and a meta- analysis identified 
placental abruption alone to be increased in women with IH 
(pooled OR 2.3; CI 1.1–4.8) [ 117, 128 ] but a causal link has not 
been established. [Evidence level 2–]
Existing randomised trials of women with SCH and IH diag -
nosed in pregnancy, with levothyroxine treatment mostly com -
menced in the second trimester of pregnancy, did not show 
improvement in child neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 91, 92 ], 
however, they were underpowered to assess efficacy within the 
subgroup of women who commenced levothyroxine in the first trimester of pregnancy (less than 12 weeks of gestation). The 
potential consequences of levothyroxine overtreatment should 
also be considered (see below).
Transplacental delivery of specifically maternal T4 is essen -
tial for the developing fetal brain from early first trimester of 
pregnancy [ 12, 126 ]. The recommended treatment of maternal 
hypothyroidism is oral levothyroxine. It is strongly recom -
mended that other thyroid preparations that contain non- T4 
forms of thyroid hormone, such as desiccated thyroid or com -
bined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy are not used 
in pregnancy, as these may result in insufficient transfer of 
maternal T4 to the fetal brain. Women already on such treat -
ments should be strongly advised to switch to a levothyrox -
ine only preparation, but a graded switch can be considered.

10 of 32 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025In women with known OH and SCH, a preconception TSH of 
2.5 mU/L or less is recommended as it may offer some protection 
against the development of hypothyroidism in early pregnancy 
[129, 130 ]. When pregnant, the required levothyroxine dose 
 increment may vary from 25% to 50%, depending upon the aeti -
ology of hypothyroidism and pre- pregnancy TSH value. Given 
the median gestation of requiring a dose increase in pregnancy 
is around 5 weeks' gestation [ 131], a self- initiated empirical dose 
increase by approximately 25%–30% as soon as there is a positive 
pregnancy test can significantly reduce the risk of developing 
 hypothyroidism in pregnancy, without any adverse consequences 
on the pregnancy, provided regular thyroid function monitoring 
in pregnancy is instituted [ 132, 133 ]. [Evidence level 1+]

following reversion back

Following the initial empirical dose increase in women who 
were on levothyroxine prior to conception, up to 40% may require 
further dose adjustments during pregnancy [ 133]. Therefore, 
regular thyroid function monitoring is required, especially in 
the first 20 weeks of gestation, the period over which thyroxine- 
binding globulin concentrations rise, in conjunction with the 
other previously outlined physiological changes in pregnancy 
before steady- state is achieved. [Evidence level 1++]
The aim of dose titration to keep the TSH below 2.5 mU/L is to 
prevent even transient abnormalities in thyroid function tests 
by anticipating the normal dynamic changes of pregnancy that 
 affect thyroid hormone requirements.
Thyroid function monitoring is also required to prevent the 
potential risks of overtreatment with levothyroxine. A Danish 
registry linkage study reported an association of maternal 
 hyperthyroidism with a higher risk of attention deficit 
 hyperactivity disorder being diagnosed in their children [ 137]. 
Naturally higher maternal fT4 concentrations during preg -
nancy in women who were not on levothyroxine replacement 
were also associated with lower birthweight [ 115] and increased 
offspring risk of autistic traits [ 127] in meta- analyses, as well 
as reduced brain cortical volumes and lower IQ (reduction 
in mean of 1.4–3.7 points) in a population- based study [ 138]. 
[Evidence level 2+]
However, no studies have reported on the neurodevelopmental 
effects of overtreatment with levothyroxine on the offspring in 
a hypothyroid pregnant population. Nonetheless it is prudent 
to maintain fT4 concentrations within the normal trimester-

pregnancy reference ranges was not associated with adverse 
 effects [ 31, 32 ]. [Evidence level 2+]
In women who experience nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, 
administration of levothyroxine at a time of day when they 
are less likely to be sick is a useful strategy. Alternatively, the 
daily levothyroxine dose can be split into two doses over this 
period of pregnancy to reduce the chances of the medication 
being incompletely absorbed. If they are unable to tolerate 
any oral levothyroxine, parenteral options (e.g., intravenous 
liothyronine) should be discussed with an endocrinologist. 
[Evidence level 4]
Following birth, maternal levothyroxine dosing should be 
 restored to pre- pregnancy levels, if this provided adequate 
 replacement, with a serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks thereaf -
ter. As thyroxine- binding globulin concentration may take up to 
4 weeks to return back to pre- pregnancy levels following birth 
[139], with reported associations between hypothyroidism and 
reduced breastfeeding success [ 140], [Evidence level 3] it is rea -
sonable to return to pre- pregnancy doses 2 weeks postpartum 
[117]. [Evidence level 4]

1.33, CI 1.15–1.56) [ 114]. [Evidence level 2+]
There have been several randomised studies investigating 
whether levothyroxine treatment can improve pregnancy out -
comes in women positive for TPOAb [ 99, 142 ]. The largest trial 
on the subject (TABLET trial) randomised 952 euthyroid TPOAb 
positive women, with a history of either subfertility or miscar -
riage, to receive levothyroxine 50μg once daily or placebo com -
menced preconception [ 99]. There was no improvement in live 
birth outcome at or beyond 34 weeks in those taking levothy -
roxine and no difference in any of the secondary pregnancy or 
neonatal outcomes. [Evidence level 1++]
However, around 7% of women with euthyroidism with TPOAb, 
went on to develop hypothyroidism, either within 1 year of try -
ing to conceive or during the first and second trimesters of preg -
nancy [ 143]. [Evidence level 2++]
Currently, there is no evidence that any treatment improves 
pregnancy outcomes for women with euthyroidism with TPOAb 
[144], therefore, TPOAb testing should not be routinely offered 
in pregnancy. [Evidence level 1+]
Maternal passage of TPOAb across the placenta is not associ -
ated with clinically relevant fetal thyroid dysfunction [ 145, 146 ]. 
[Evidence level 3]
9 | Hyperthyroidism and Thyrotoxicosis
Untreated or poorly controlled hyperthyroidism is associated 
with a number of adverse outcomes, but it remains unclear 
whether these consequences relate to maternal hyperthyroid -
ism, to fetal hyperthyroidism (caused by transplacental transfer 
of thyroxine or stimulating TSH- receptor antibodies [TRAb]) or 
to antithyroid drug treatment, which may cause fetal hypothy -
roidism as well as direct toxicity [ 147]. Large record linkage stud -
ies [148–151 ] have confirmed increased risks of pre- eclampsia, 
stillbirth, maternal admission to intensive care unit, lower birth 
weight and higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disor -
der and autism in children when comparing women with hyper -
thyroidism and control subjects [ 152, 153 ]. Observational studies 
reported increased risks of intrauterine growth restriction, pre- 
eclampsia, preterm birth and maternal heart failure [ 154–157 ]. 
[Evidence level 2++]
The risk is directly related to control of maternal hyperthyroid -
ism, both in terms of severity of hyperthyroidism and how soon 
in pregnancy euthyroidism is achieved [ 147, 158, 159 ]. [Evidence 
level 2+]
Maintenance of euthyroidism with optimal treatment through -
out pregnancy coupled with adequate antenatal care, has not 
been associated with increased obstetric risks except for a possi -
ble residual risk of placental abruption [ 154, 156 ] [Evidence level 
2+] and antithyroid drug associated teratogenicity [Evidence 
level 2++] , where applicable (see Section 9.2 ).9.1 | How Should Women With Graves' Disease Be 
Counselled Before Pregnancy?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
Pre- pregnancy counselling 
is recommended in women 
with hyperthyroidism to 
minimise maternal and fetal 
adverse outcomes4 GPP The risks to the woman 
and fetus are directly 
related to control 
of hyperthyroidism 
early in pregnancy
The option of definitive 
treatment with radioactive 
iodine or thyroidectomy 
should be discussed, 
especially in women with 
more severe disease. 
Following definitive 
treatment, women should 
wait at least 6 months before 
attempting to conceive. They 
should also have had serum 
fT4 within the reference 
range on two measurements 
3 months apart [ 160]2+ C Maintenance of 
euthyroidism during 
pregnancy is easier in 
women who have been 
rendered hypothyroid 
by definitive treatment. 
They would require 
levothyroxine 
replacement, with dose 
titrations in pregnancy. 
Further, the risk of 
teratogenicity with 
antithyroid drugs 
can be avoided
A persistently increased TSH- 
receptor antibody (TRAb) 
level (usually taken as greater 
than 3 times the threshold for 
positivity) assessed around 
6 months post- treatment is 
associated with increased 
risk of fetal Graves' disease 
and consideration may 
be given to further delay 
conception3 D Retrospective studies 
show increased risks 
of fetal/neonatal 
Graves' disease with 
TRAb more than 
3 times the assay 
threshold for positivity. 
TRAb levels decrease 
slowly following 
definitive treatment
Hyperthyroidism requiring 
treatment with antithyroid 
drugs while trying to 
conceive should use 
propylthiouracil (PTU) in 
preference to carbimazole 
(CMZ), at the lowest effective 
dose to maintain fT4 
concentrations in the upper 
half of the reference range2++ B PTU is associated with 
less teratogenic risks. 
Higher cumulative 
doses of antithyroid 
drugs are associated 
with increased risk 
of teratogenicity. 
The risk of inducing 
fetal hypothyroidism 
through transplacental 
passage of the drugs 
should be kept low 
by maintaining fT4 
in the upper half of 
the reference range
All women of childbearing age who develop hyperthyroid -
ism should have a discussion regarding potential future 
pregnancy. The risks and benefits of all treatment options, 
including antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine (131I) admin -
istration or surgery should be discussed [ 160]. With defini -
tive treatment, maintenance of euthyroidism with exogenous 
levothyroxine is simpler to achieve during pregnancy without 
risk of antithyroid drug- associated teratogenicity. [Evidence 
level 2+]
If the woman is on levothyroxine replacement following defin -
itive thyroid ablation or thyroidectomy, then optimal TSH and 
fT4 concentrations should be achieved prior to trying concep -
tion, and they should be advised of an empirical dose increase

13 of 32upon conception, in accordance with guidance for treatment of 
autoimmune hypothyroidism (Section  7.1).
Following radioiodine treatment, TRAb concentrations may 
rise [ 155, 156 ], increasing the risk of fetal Graves' disease caused 
by transplacental passage of maternal TRAb [ 157] even when 
 maternal thyroid function tests are normal [Evidence level 2–] . 
Hence, pregnancy should be delayed by 6 months [ 161].
Surgery may be the better option in women with high TRAb 
concentrations since antibody levels usually normalise within 
months following thyroidectomy [ 153], and cure is immediate. 
However, the risks of surgery and lifelong need for levothyrox -
ine treatment will need to be considered. [Evidence level 3]
If the woman continues on antithyroid drugs, propylthiouracil 
(PTU) is the recommended drug preconception and during the 
first trimester. A large cohort study found that higher cumula -
tive doses of antithyroid drugs are associated with increased risk 
of teratogenicity [ 154]. [Evidence level 2++]
The fT4 concentrations should be maintained in the upper half 
of the normal range, and a low TSH concentration would be 
 acceptable in this context. [Evidence level 3]
Consideration should be given to discontinuing antithyroid drugs 
preconception once euthyroidism (TSH in the reference range) is 
maintained for at least 6 months on a low dose [ 51]. Early discon -
tinuation to reduce teratogenic risks needs to be weighed against 
risks of a hyperthyroid flare in the periconception period which 
has the attendant risks of adverse effects in pregnancy (see 
Section  9.2. for a full discussion). [Evidence level 3]
9.2 | What Is the Optimal Care of Women With 
Graves' Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy? (see 
Appendix F)
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
When pregnant, where a 
woman with a history of 
hyperthyroidism has been 
euthyroid (preconception TSH 
in the non- pregnant reference 
range) for 6 months or more on a 
low dose of an antithyroid drug 
(CMZ < 10 mg or PTU < 200 mg 
daily), consider discontinuing 
antithyroid drugs with close 
thyroid function monitoring4 D Women who are 
in remission from 
Graves' disease are 
unlikely to relapse 
during pregnancy 
and the teratogenic 
risks of antithyroid 
drugs outweigh 
the risk of relapsed 
Graves' disease
If antithyroid drug treatment 
is required, PTU is the 
recommended drug during 
early pregnancy. If a woman 
conceives on CMZ a switch to 
PTU should be made as soon 
as possible before 10 weeks' 
gestation, with an advised dose 
ratio of 1:20 (CMZ:PTU). There 
is no benefit of switching to 
PTU if a woman presents after 
10 weeks' gestation3 D PTU is the preferred 
antithyroid drug 
during the period of 
organogenesis as it is 
associated with less 
teratogenic risksRecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
During the first half of 
pregnancy, women on 
antithyroid drugs should have 
thyroid function monitored 
every 2–4 weeks with 
measurement of serum TSH and 
fT4. When stopping antithyroid 
drug treatment, when switching 
between antithyroid drugs and 
following dose adjustments, 
give consideration to fortnightly 
testing. After 20 weeks of 
pregnancy 4–8 weekly testing 
may be appropriate3 D Thyroid function 
may change rapidly 
during pregnancy 
in women on 
antithyroid drugs 
so regular testing 
is advisable
Titration of antithyroid drugs 
should target fT4 concentrations 
in the upper half of the 
trimester- and manufacturer- 
specific pregnancy reference 
range3 D Transplacental 
passage of 
antithyroid drugs 
may induce fetal 
hypothyroidism and 
should be avoided 
by maintaining fT4 
in the high normal 
pregnancy reference 
range. Serum 
TSH may remain 
low throughout 
pregnancy and 
fT4 testing is more 
informative in 
this situation
Serial ultrasound scans to assess 
fetal biometry with umbilical 
artery Doppler at monthly 
intervals from 26 to 28 weeks is 
recommended in those who at 
any time during pregnancy had 
uncontrolled Graves' disease, 
required antithyroid drug 
treatment or had a TRAb level 
three times above the threshold 
for positivity3 D Uncontrolled 
hyperthyroidism and 
high levels of TRAb 
are associated with 
intrauterine growth 
restriction and fetal 
Graves' disease. A 
TRAb level usually 
three times above 
the threshold 
for positivity is 
associated with 
increased risk of 
fetal/neonatal 
Graves' disease
TRAb measurement in the 
first trimester is recommended 
in all women with a history 
of Graves' disease, even 
following definitive treatment. 
If it is above the threshold for 
positivity or if the woman is 
on antithyroid drugs, a further 
measurement at 20 and 28 weeks 
of gestation is recommended3 D TRAb can remain 
raised even after 
definitive treatment. 
The fetal thyroid 
begins to produce 
appreciable amounts 
of thyroid hormone 
and can respond to 
transplacental TRAb 
from 18- 20 weeks 
of gestation. TRAb 
levels usually 
gradually decline 
after 20 weeks 
of gestation and 
rarely increase 
beyond this point
Neonates of women with 
known Graves' disease, of 
those receiving antithyroid 
medication during pregnancy 
and those with increased TRAb 
levels should have their thyroid 
function monitored soon after 
birth and at 1–2 weeks post- birth3 D Transplacental TRAb 
or antithyroid drugs 
can induce neonatal 
hyperthyroidism 
or hypothyroidism, 
respectively. 
Early detection 
and treatment of 
the neonate can 
minimise adverse 
health consequences

14 of 32 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025Treatment with antithyroid drugs (thionamides) represents the 
mainstay of treatment of active hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. 
Carbimazole (CMZ, used mainly in the UK), its active metabo -
lite methimazole (MMI, used in the USA; 20 mg CMZ is equiv -
alent to 15 mg MMI), and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the main 
antithyroid drugs. Minor adverse effects of antithyroid drugs, 
including skin rash, occur in 3%–5% of women. Serious adverse 
effects are rare and include agranulocytosis occurring in 0.15% 
with either drug and liver failure in 0.1%, the latter pertaining 
almost exclusively to PTU [ 162].
Potential teratogenic effects have been mainly linked to CMZ/
MMI, and to a lesser extent, PTU. CMZ/MMI may induce an 
embryopathy, including dysmorphic features, aplasia cutis, cho -
anal and oesophageal atresia, abdominal wall defects, urinary 
and eye abnormalities, and ventricular septal defects. In addi -
tion to the background risks, teratogenic effects may be present 
in 2%–4% of pregnancies if exposure occurs during 6–10 weeks 
of gestation [ 159, 163, 164 ]. [Evidence level 2–]
A meta- analysis has found CMZ/MMI exposure to be associated 
with an increased odds of congenital anomalies of 1.88 (95% CI 
1.33–2.65) compared with no antithyroid drug exposure, with 
an escalating gradient of risk with increasing CMZ/MMI dose 
[165]. [Evidence level 2++]
PTU has been linked to less severe and potentially resolvable 
birth defects, including face and neck cysts and urinary tract 
abnormalities, which may occur in 2%–3% of children exposed 
to the drug during early pregnancy [ 163]. These studies on both 
drugs do not take account of pregnancies terminated for congen -
ital anomalies, and may therefore represent an underestimate of 
the teratogenic risk.
For PTU the largest studies conducted using national registries 
found odds ratios of 1.16–1.41 for congenital anomalies [ 163, 165 ] 
but a meta- analysis of smaller studies showed no significant dif -
ferences compared with the unexposed [ 166]. Of note, the range 
of defects associated with CMZ/MMI and PTU is different 
and they should be considered as two separate teratogens. The 
potential for a higher teratogenic risk with double exposure (the 
switching of one to the other drug during the first trimester) has 
not been borne out by a statistically significant increased odds in 
studies thus far, possibly due to small sample sizes [ 163, 165, 166 ]. 
If the woman is already past 10 weeks of gestation there is lim -
ited benefit in switching from CMZ/MMI to PTU as the highest 
risk period for teratogenesis is over. [Evidence level 3]
If a woman has been euthyroid (TSH in reference range) for 
6 months or more on low dose antithyroid drugs (defined as 
CMZ less than 10 mg daily or PTU less than 200 mg daily), con -
sideration should be given to discontinuing antithyroid drugs, 
before the period of highest teratogenic risk (6–10 weeks of ges -
tation) [ 51, 164, 167 ]. This period of time also coincides with 
rising hCG concentrations which may exacerbate any residual 
hyperthyroidism, thus close thyroid function monitoring every 
2 weeks until the mid- trimester of pregnancy (when hCG begins 
to decline) is recommended. [Evidence level 3]
Many women will require reducing doses of antithyroid medica -
tion as gestation progresses, and most can discontinue treatment in the late second or early third trimester of pregnancy as thy -
roid autoimmunity subsides [ 168]. If treatment with antithyroid 
drugs is still required beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy, a switch 
to CMZ should be considered in view of risk of PTU- associated 
hepatotoxicity [ 30, 51 ]. A recommended conversion dose ratio is 
20:1 (200 mg PTU = 10 mg CBZ). [Evidence level 3]
The lowest effective dose of antithyroid drugs should be used 
targeting serum fT4 at the upper half of the pregnancy ref -
erence range (or total T4 at 1–1.5 times the upper limit of the 
non- pregnant reference range) in order to minimise the risk of 
fetal hypothyroidism from transplacental passage of the drug 
[169, 170 ]. Titration should not be primarily based on TSH con -
centrations (which may be low), and there is no role for fT3 or 
total T3 measurements. [Evidence level 2+]
Women who have discontinued antithyroid drugs in pregnancy 
and maintained normal fT4 concentrations on two consecutive 
occasions 2–4 weeks apart following cessation of treatment may 
have less frequent thyroid function monitoring. This can be done 
at 4–8 week intervals for the remainder of pregnancy. [Evidence 
level 3]
Women in remission from Graves' hyperthyroidism who entered 
pregnancy whilst not taking antithyroid drugs and who have a 
low or undetectable TRAb level preconception or at pregnancy 
booking should have thyroid function testing every four weeks 
until mid- trimester. If euthyroidism is maintained then thyroid 
function monitoring at 4–8 week intervals for the remainder of 
pregnancy is acceptable. [Evidence level 3]
The management of toxic nodular hyperthyroidism with antithy -
roid drug therapy in pregnant women is similar to Graves' hyper -
thyroidism except that it is associated with an even higher risk 
of fetal hypothyroidism since the fetal thyroid is not stimulated 
by TRAb. Thus, the dose of antithyroid drugs must be kept to the 
minimum with frequent thyroid function monitoring targeting 
the upper half of the pregnancy reference range. [Evidence level 3]
9.2.1 | Rare or Infrequent Situations
Block and replace regimens with high doses of antithyroid drugs 
and levothyroxine are not recommended as this increases both 
maternal and fetal risks. Furthermore, antithyroid drugs cross 
the placenta more efficiently than levothyroxine, and the fetal 
thyroid is very sensitive to antithyroid drugs, resulting in in -
creased risks of fetal hypothyroidism and goitre [ 51, 153, 171 ]. 
In rare cases of isolated fetal hyperthyroidism a block replace 
regimen may be indicated [ 172]. [Evidence level 3]
In selected cases of severe maternal adverse effects to antithy -
roid drugs, or in cases of a large goitre with potential compro -
mise of the airway, thyroidectomy may be indicated and ideally 
should be undertaken in the second trimester of pregnancy [ 51]. 
Thyroidectomy beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy is associated 
with increased risks of preterm birth [ 173] and should therefore 
be avoided where possible and undertaken with caution when 
it cannot be safely deferred. Close peri- operative management 
of fT4 and calcium concentrations is needed to minimise risks.

15 of 32Beta- adrenergic blocking agents such as propranolol, may be 
used temporarily for control of hyperthyroid symptoms as long 
as benefits outweigh risks. The lowest possible dose should be 
used for the shortest possible duration, to minimise potential 
risks of infants being SGA at birth [ 174]. [Evidence level 2–]
9.2.2 | Fetal Monitoring
The half- life of PTU and CBZ/MMI are all less than 48 h so 
 exposure prior to the last menstrual period is unlikely to affect 
the fetus. The woman should be made aware of the limitations 
of ultrasonography at their 20 week fetal anomaly scan, as it can 
only detect some but not all anomalies associated with antithyroid 
drugs. Anomalies such as aplasia cutis, eye abnormalities and cho -
anal atresia are very challenging to detect by ultrasonography.
Women with a history of hyperthyroidism but who have 
 remained in remission without antithyroid drug treatment or 
any previous definitive radioiodine thyroid ablation/thyroid -
ectomy, with undetectable circulating TRAb, and have been 
euthyroid during the pregnancy, do not require additional fetal 
surveillance. In these scenarios, a history of hyperthyroidism 
would not be considered a risk factor for having a SGA fetus, 
consistent with another RCOG guideline [ 175]. [Evidence level 3]
In those who at any time during pregnancy display Graves' 
 hyperthyroidism, require antithyroid drug treatment, or have 
 detectable TRAb, there is an increased risk of intrauterine growth 
restriction and fetal Graves' disease. The underlying mechanisms 
may not only be placental- mediated, but transplacental TRAb, 
antithyroid drugs and increased fetal thyroid hormones may 
disrupt metabolic regulation, growth and development of the 
fetus. Results of a 20–24 week uterine artery Doppler would not 
alter care and is therefore not necessary. Instead, serial ultraso -
nographic scans of fetal biometry with umbilical artery Doppler 
at monthly intervals from 26- 28 weeks is recommended. Any 
abnormal findings should be managed in accordance with rec -
ommendations contained in the RCOG guidelines on the man -
agement of the SGA fetus [ 175]. [Evidence level 3]
Fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism is estimated to occur in 
1%–5% of women with active or previous Graves' hyperthyroid -
ism and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
[176]. Measurement of TRAb during early pregnancy is advised, 
and if increased a repeat measurement at 20 and 28 weeks of 
pregnancy is recommended [ 51]. The fetus is particularly at 
risk of fetal Graves' disease or in utero hyperthyroidism and 
growth restriction if TRAb levels are significantly raised (more 
than 3 times the threshold of positivity) [ 177, 178 ], if maternal 
hyperthyroidism is uncontrolled and if pre- eclampsia or utero -
placental insufficiency is present. Increased fetal surveillance 
should include 2–4 weekly auscultation of fetal heart rate for 
fetal tachycardia (greater than 170 bpm persistent for more than 
10 min). With a significantly raised TRAb level, consider start -
ing monthly ultrasonography earlier, from 20 weeks of gestation 
onwards (which is when appreciable endogenous fetal thyroid 
activity commences). This allows monitoring of fetal growth, 
amniotic fluid volume (severe polyhydramnios secondary to 
external compression of oesophagus by a goitre and reduced 
swallowing), presence of cardiac dysrhythmia and failure, fetal hydrops and, where expertise is available, presence of fetal goitre 
[179, 180 ]. When fetal Graves' disease is detected or suspected, 
care should be undertaken in a multidisciplinary setting, includ -
ing Fetal Medicine specialists. [Evidence level 3]
9.2.3 | Peripartum Care and Neonatal Hyperthyroidism
Timing and mode of birth is mostly dictated by obstetric 
indications. In those who at any time during pregnancy display 
Graves' hyperthyroidism, require antithyroid drug treatment, 
or have detectable TRAb, continuous fetal monitoring during 
labour and birth in a consultant- led unit should be considered. 
[Evidence level 4]
Maintaining euthyroidism will reduce maternal cardiovas -
cular risks during labour and in the immediate post- partum 
period, and anaesthetic risks if assisted birth is required. 
Following birth, neonates of women with known Graves' dis -
ease, of those receiving antithyroid medication during preg -
nancy and those with increased TRAb levels should have their 
thyroid function monitored soon after birth and at 1–2 weeks 
post- birth for signs of neonatal hyperthyroidism. Such moni -
toring should be undertaken by the neonatal/paediatric team. 
Neonatal hypothyroidism can also arise due to maternal over- 
treatment with antithyroid drugs, hence the need for careful 
antenatal thyroid function monitoring and titration. [Evidence 
level 2–]

Gestational transient 
thyrotoxicosis requires 
symptomatic and 
supportive management 
only3 C In gestational transient 
thyrotoxicosis, there is no 
evidence that treatment 
with antithyroid drugs 
improves obstetric 
and fetal outcomes
Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is caused by high concen -
trations of hCG stimulating the TSH receptors of the thyroid 
gland [ 171] giving rise to low serum TSH and high fT4 concen -
trations. Where hCG concentrations are higher, for example, in 
multiple pregnancies, hydatiform mole and choriocarcinoma, 
gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is more common [ 29, 30 ]. 
Since hCG levels peak around 10 weeks of gestation and subside 
by 18–20 weeks of gestation, gestational transient thyrotoxico -
sis usually presents in the first and early second trimesters of 
pregnancy. This condition is transient, self- limiting and is not 
associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. [Evidence level 2–]
Thyrotoxicosis that is hCG- induced is more common in women 
who also experience hyperemesis gravidarum, but nausea and 
vomiting are not symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and each may 
occur independently. [Evidence level 3]
If a thyroid function test shows thyrotoxicosis, gestational tran -
sient thyrotoxicosis should be distinguished from Graves' disease 
and nodule- related hyperthyroidism. New onset Graves' disease 
and nodular hyperthyroidism require prompt treatment in preg -
nancy (0.05% of pregnancies) and are far less common than gesta -
tional transient thyrotoxicosis (1%–5% of pregnancies) [ 28, 29, 171 ]. 
A number of clinical and laboratory features help in the distinc -
tion between these conditions (Table  3). Clinical features, includ -
ing palpitations, tremor, anxiety, heat intolerance and tachycardia, 
are non- discriminatory. A lack of symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and 
weight loss prior to pregnancy, the absence of a goitre, ophthal -
mopathy or a personal/family history of thyroid disease, as well 
as the presence of significant nausea and vomiting are more indic -
ative of gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. TRAb and serum T3 
concentrations are raised in Graves' disease but generally not in 
gestational transient thyrotoxicosis [ 29, 51, 171 ]. [Evidence level 3]
Serum hCG concentrations are not useful in distinguishing 
 between Graves' disease and gestational transient thyrotoxicosis 
[182]. Where there is doubt, a repeat thyroid function test 2 weeks 
later, demonstrating a declining fT4 concentration without anti -
thyroid treatment, would be supportive of gestational transient 
thyrotoxicosis. TSH concentrations will take longer to recover, 
often remaining suppressed, and are less helpful. [Evidence level 3]
Management of gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, if symp -
tomatic, is largely supportive with anti- emetics, maintenance 
of hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances if the 
women has hyperemesis gravidarum. Transient treatment with 
beta blockers may be used to control symptoms of thyrotoxico -
sis and tachycardia [ 29, 30 ]. There is no evidence that treatment 
with antithyroid drugs improves obstetric and fetal outcomes in 
women with gestational transient thyrotoxicosis [ 183]. [Evidence 
level 3]9.4 | How Should Women With a History 
of Hyperthyroidism Be Cared for in the Postpartum 
Period?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
A thyroid function test is 
recommended 6–8 weeks 
after birth in women with 
a history of pre- existing 
hyperthyroidism3 C Increased autoimmunity 
postpartum increases 
the risk of relapsed 
Graves' disease
Both CMZ and PTU are 
considered safe during 
breastfeeding and the 
lowest effective dose should 
be administered during 
the period of lactation, if 
necessary, with monitoring 
of the child's growth and 
development3 C There is minimal transfer 
of these antithyroid 
drugs to breast milk. 
After initial surveillance 
for neonatal thyroid 
dysfunction is completed, 
thyroid function testing 
of breastfed babies is not 
recommended unless 
there are concerns 
about infant wellbeing
Consideration may be given 
to administering the total 
daily dose of CMZ or PTU in 
two or three smaller doses 
a day4 GPP Splitting the dose 
reduces peak circulating 
concentrations and hence 
the transfer to breast milk
The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in the postpar -
tum period in the general obstetric population is PPT (see 
Section  11). However, the increased autoimmunity in the 
postpartum period is also associated with a 3–4 times higher TABLE 3 | Features distinguishing gestational transient 
thyrotoxicosis from Graves' hyperthyroid disease [ 29, 51, 171 ].

17 of 32risk in the incidence of new onset Graves' hyperthyroid dis -
ease [ 168] and higher rates of relapsed Graves' disease in 
those with a pre- existing diagnosis prior to pregnancy [ 184]. 
Management differs by aetiology, and in this section, only the 
management of pre- existing hyperthyroidism and Graves' dis -
ease is discussed.
Antithyroid drugs are the preferred therapeutic option in post -
partum hyperthyroidism since the administration of radioactive 
iodine is difficult in view of radiation protection guidance and 
surgery is invasive, and both may pose practical difficulties in 
women with young children [ 29, 30 ].
Observational studies indicate that both CMZ (up to a daily 
dose of 20 mg) and PTU (up to a daily dose of 450 mg) are safe 
during breastfeeding [ 185, 186 ]. CMZ [ 187] and to a lesser extent 
PTU [ 188] are transferred into breast milk in small amounts: 
0.1%–0.2% and 0.007%–0.077% of the ingested amount, respec -
tively. [Evidence level 3]
Antithyroid drugs in breast milk may delay the manifestation 
or reduce the risk of neonatal hyperthyroidism caused by per -
sistent in utero- derived TRAb. The growth and development of 
breastfed infants of women taking antithyroid drugs should be 
monitored, but routine assessment of thyroid function (beyond 
the initial surveillance for neonatal thyroid dysfunction) in the 
infant during breastfeeding is not required, unless antithyroid 
drug doses exceed the recommendations above [ 51] or there are 
concerns about infant wellbeing. [Evidence level 3]
10 | Thyroid Nodules and Thyroid Cancer
The prevalence of thyroid nodules in pregnancy based on 
 ultrasound studies in areas with mild- to- moderate iodine defi -
ciency varies between 15% and 21% [ 40, 41 ], but the incidence 
of clinically apparent nodules presenting in pregnancy in non- 
iodine- deficient areas is likely to be under 1% [ 39]. [Evidence 
level 2+]
Ultrasound- detected nodules are more common with increasing 
parity and age [ 40, 41 ], and may increase in size during preg -
nancy [ 40, 189 ]. Thyroid cancer in association with pregnancy 
is very rare, with a prevalence of 14 in 100 000 [ 190] and is more 
likely to be diagnosed postpartum than at other times in preg -
nancy [ 39, 190 ]. [Evidence level 2+]

safely performed at any 
gestation2+ B Proven diagnostic use 
and safety in pregnancy
If thyroid surgery is 
required this should 
ideally be performed 
between 14 and 22 weeks 
of gestation3 C To reduce the risk 
of miscarriage and 
preterm labour
Women with an enlarged 
thyroid in pregnancy 
should be reviewed by an 
obstetric anaesthetist3 D To manage possible airway 
obstruction and anticipate 
risk of a difficult intubation 
in the event a general 
anaesthetic is required
Women with compressive symptoms from thyroid enlargement 
should be referred urgently to an ENT surgeon/Endocrinologist 
(depending on local expertise) for airway assessment and con -
sideration of surgical intervention. Surgical intervention should 
ideally be made between 14 and 22 weeks' gestation, where pos -
sible, to minimise maternal and fetal morbidity, pregnancy loss 
and preterm birth [ 173, 191 ]. [Evidence level 3]
The primary aims in care when a new thyroid nodule is diag -
nosed are three- fold: to assess local symptoms, and to exclude ma -
lignancy and hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound is the most sensitive 
test for detecting thyroid nodules, measuring their dimensions, 
identifying their content and evaluating any associated changes 
in the thyroid gland [ 192]. Radioactive agents should be avoided 
for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in pregnancy [ 193]. If fine 
needle aspiration is required for diagnostic purposes this may be 
performed at any gestation [ 136, 194–196 ]. [Evidence level 2+]

many of the studies was limited or did not use the contemporary 
tools for the detection of recurrence. Most clinical outcome data 
show no difference in the rate of recurrence or long- term sur -
vival of women following treatment for well- differentiated thy -
roid cancer identified during pregnancy [ 194]. A meta- analysis

18 of 32 BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 2025[202] with a total of 406 329 cases found that women who devel -
oped thyroid carcinoma during pregnancy did not exhibit a sig -
nificantly increased risk of lymphatic metastasis (OR 0.94, 95% 
CI 0.53–1.67) or distant metastasis (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86–1.24). 
[Evidence level 2+]
Generally, surgery for most common thyroid cancers diagnosed 
in pregnancy can be deferred until after birth unless there is 
substantial growth, significant airway compression, or rapidly 
progressive disease. [Evidence level 3]
11 | Postpartum Thyroiditis
PPT is defined as the development of thyroid dys -
function, excluding other thyroid diseases, within the 
first 12 months following a pregnancy in a previously 
euthyroid woman [ 203]. This is an autoimmune disorder asso -
ciated with antibodies to TPO and thyroglobulin [ 204], caused 
by a reactivation of the immune system following the relative 
 immune suppression during pregnancy [ 205].
PPT occurs in 5%–10% of unselected pregnancies [ 206]. Women 
with other autoimmune disorders are at increased risk, in par -
ticular, those with type 1 diabetes mellitus [ 207], systemic lupus 
erythematosus [ 102] and a previous history of Graves' disease 
[208]. PPT may also occur in those with Hashimoto's thyroid -
itis [ 209] or with a personal or family history of thyroid disease 
[205]. Overall, 30%–50% of women with positive TPOAb develop 
PPT with higher risk in those with higher TPO antibody concen -
trations [ 210]. [Evidence level 3]
The classical form of PPT is triphasic with an initial thyrotoxic 
phase followed by a transient hypothyroid phase and then a return 
to euthyroidism. The clinical course is variable with 20%–40% of 
women exhibiting the classical form, 20%–30% developing only 
thyrotoxicosis and 40%–50% presenting with isolated hypothy-
roidism [ 205, 210 ]. The thyrotoxic phase usually occurs between 
2 and 6 months postpartum but may present up to 12 months fol -
lowing birth. The hypothyroid phase typically presents between 
3 and 12 months postpartum and results in permanent hypo -
thyroidism in up to 50% [ 51, 211, 212 ]. Risk factors for perma -
nent hypothyroidism include multiparity, higher concentrations 
of TPOAb, greater maternal age, more severe hypothyroidism, 
thyroid hypoechogenicity on ultrasound scanning and a history of 
pregnancy loss [ 51, 205, 213 ]. The risk of relapse of PPT with subse -
quent pregnancies is as high as 70%, especially in TPOAb positive 
women [ 205]. Some studies have indicated a link between TPOAb 
positivity [ 214–216 ], PPT [ 217] and postpartum depression, but an 
RCT of levothyroxine prophylaxis in TPOAb positive women did 
not lower rates of postpartum depression [ 218]. [Evidence level 1+]
11.1 | How Should Postpartum Thyroiditis Be 
Diagnosed?
RecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
Routine testing for PPT is 
not recommended4 D This condition is 
mostly self- limitingRecommendationEvidence 
quality StrengthRationale for 
recommendation
In women with risk 
factors for PPT who 
experience symptoms of 
thyrotoxicosis, thyroid 
function tests should be 
performed4 D Case series have shown 
higher risk of PPT in 
women with these risk 
factors and symptoms
To confirm the diagnosis 
of PPT in the presence 
of an abnormal thyroid 
function test, perform 
serial thyroid function 
testing every 6 weeks with 
symptom assessment, 
and exclude other 
aetiologies. At any point, 
if thyroid function tests 
show thyrotoxicosis 
measure TRAb and 
consider isotope scans 
to distinguish between 
Graves' disease and PPT2— C PPT is characterised 
by evolving clinical 
features and biochemistry 
indicative of thyroid 
dysfunction. Increased 
TRAb and diffuse uptake 
of isotopes are consistent 
with Graves' disease
The thyroidal inflammation in PPT is usually painless and 
many women are asymptomatic, but a small diffuse goitre 
may be present. During the thyrotoxic phase, irritability, pal -
pitations or heat intolerance may develop [ 51, 205, 219 ]. The 
hypothyroid phase is more frequently symptomatic and cold 
intolerance, dry skin, fatigue and concentration difficulties 
may be present [ 220]. TPOAb positive women with PPT usually 
have more symptoms than those without raised concentrations 
of TPOAb [ 221].
The major challenge is to distinguish thyrotoxicosis caused by 
PPT from de novo or recurrent Graves' disease in the postpar -
tum period. Thyrotoxic symptoms during the first 3 months 
postpartum are more likely due to PPT and those presenting 
6 months following birth are often caused by Graves' disease 
[222]. Ophthalmopathy, a large goitre with bruit, and raised 
TRAb levels confirm Graves' disease whereas a raised T4:T3 
ratio is found in PPT. Uptake of radioactive isotope (Technetium 
[99mTc] or radioiodine [123I]) is increased in Graves' disease and 
low in PPT. Both isotopes may be used in breastfeeding women 
as long as the breast milk is discarded for at least 3 days after the 
radioisotope investigation [ 51, 205, 223 ]. Thyroid ultrasonogra -
phy usually reveals a non- homogeneous hypoechogenic texture 
[224] and histopathological evaluation demonstrates lympho -
cytic infiltration in PPT [ 205].

Consider treatment of 
symptomatic women in 
the thyrotoxic phase with 
beta- blockers4 C Beta blockers are very 
effective in controlling 
symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, 
if required. Propranolol 
and metoprolol are safe 
in breastfeeding
Levothyroxine replacement is 
appropriate for women who 
are very symptomatic during 
the hypothyroid phase of PPT 
or actively trying to become 
pregnant4 D Levothyroxine is a safe 
and effective treatment to 
relieve symptoms, including 
during breastfeeding. If 
planning pregnancy, optimal 
control of thyroid function 
is associated with improved 
pregnancy outcomes
Those who are not 
treated can be managed 
expectantly with thyroid 
function monitoring every 
6 weeks until restoration of 
euthyroidism4 D PPT usually resolves 
spontaneously but a 
proportion of women 
will develop permanent 
hypothyroidism
Following restoration of 
euthyroidism, monitor serum 
TSH annually in women 
with a history of PPT as 
they continue to be at risk 
of developing permanent 
hypothyroidism2++ C Approximately 50% of women 
with a history of PPT develop 
permanent hypothyroidism

of PPT, test for thyroid 
dysfunction when planning 
to get pregnant and as soon 
as possible in pregnancy2++ C Optimal control of thyroid 
function preconception 
and in pregnancy is 
associated with improved 
pregnancy outcomes
There is insufficient evidence 
to recommend levothyroxine 
prophylaxis, or either iodine 
or selenium supplementation 
to prevent or treat PPT1— B The evidence from small 
RCTs is inconclusive
If levothyroxine is started in the hypothyroid phase, tapering off 
the dose may be attempted after 12 months, although this is not 
appropriate if women are actively trying for pregnancy and indi -
vidualised treatment decisions should be taken [ 51, 205 ]. In view 
of the relatively high risk of development of permanent hypothy -
roidism [Evidence level 2++] , serum TSH should be monitored 
annually in women with a history of PPT [ 211, 225 ]. Additional 
testing may be appropriate when they are trying to conceive and 
as soon as possible when pregnant.
Two RCTs of levothyroxine or iodine supplementation during and 
after pregnancy in TPOAb positive women have failed to demon -
strate efficacy in prevention of PPT [ 226, 227 ]. One single trial has 
indicated potential benefit of selenium supplementation in pre -
venting PPT in TPOAb positive women [ 228]. However, there is 
insufficient evidence to recommend its routine use in this setting.
12 | Recommendations for Future Research
• Further controlled trials of iodine supplementation from 
preconception or early gestation in women in the UK and in 
other iodine replete or mildly iodine deficient populations, 
with follow up of the children for measurement of neuro -
cognitive and behavioural outcomes.• Cost–benefit analyses of universal versus risk- based thy -
roid function testing in different health settings and 
subpopulations.
• Treatment of SCH and IH from preconception or early preg -
nancy for improvement of pregnancy and child outcomes, 
 especially in obstetric populations deemed at high- risk due to 
co- morbidities.
• Clinical trials comparing different management approaches 
of hyperthyroidism before and during pregnancy, and eval -
uating impact on obstetric and fetal outcomes.
13 | Auditable Topics
• At least 95% of thyroid function tests performed and 
 reported in pregnancy should have used or quoted trimes -
ter- and manufacturer- specific pregnancy reference ranges, 
where available.
• At least 90% of women with risk factors for thyroid dys -
function (in accordance with this guideline, Section  6) 
should have been offered testing during the first trimes -
ter with thyroid function tests comprising TSH and fT4 
simultaneously.
• Levothyroxine treatment for OH and SCH should be offered 
at appropriate TSH thresholds in accordance with this 
guideline on 95% of occasions.
• At least 90% of women who were already on levothyroxine 
treatment pre- pregnancy for hypothyroidism should have 
been counselled before pregnancy or in early pregnancy to 
empirically increase their levothyroxine dose by an appro -
priate amount as soon as possible in pregnancy.
• Following each dose change of levothyroxine, repeat thy -
roid function tests should be performed in 4–6 weeks and 
levothyroxine dose titrated in accordance with this guide -
line on 95% of occasions.
• Prior to conception, all women of childbearing age who 
develop hyperthyroidism should have had an informed dis -
cussion regarding management options and preparation for 
potential future pregnancy.
• At least 90% of women who conceived on CMZ should have 
been advised to either stop treatment or change to PTU 
 before 10 weeks of gestation, as clinically appropriate, in 
accordance with this guideline.
• In women on antithyroid drugs in pregnancy, frequency 
of thyroid function monitoring and appropriate titration of 
medication should be conducted in accordance with this 
guideline (to maintain fT4 concentrations in the upper half 
of the trimester- specific pregnancy reference range) on 95% 
of occasions.

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines 
Committee of the RCOG.Disclaimer
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists pro -
duces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical prac -
tice. They present recognised methods and techniques of 
clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consider -
ation by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant 
health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding 
a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be 
made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical 
data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treat -
ment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or 
guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to 
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of man -
agement. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or 
guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case 
notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.

Explanation of Grades and Evidence Levels
Classification of evidence levels
1++ High- quality meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a very low risk 
of bias
1+ Well- conducted meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a low risk 
of bias
1— Meta- analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials or randomised controlled trials with a high risk of bias
2++ High- quality systematic reviews of case–control or cohort studies or high- quality case–control or cohort studies with a very low risk 
of confounding, bias or chance and a high probability that the relationship is causal
2+ Well- conducted case–control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or chance and a moderate probability that the 
relationship is causal
2— Case–control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding, bias or chance and a significant risk that the relationship is not 
causal
3 Non- analytical studies, e.g. case reports, case series
4 Expert opinion
Grades of recommendation
AAt least one meta- analysis, systematic review or RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target population; or a systematic 
review of RCTs or a body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the target population and 
demonstrating overall consistency of results
BA body of evidence including studies rated as 2++ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall consistency 
of results; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++ or 1+
CA body of evidence including studies rated as 2+ directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall consistency 
of results; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++
DEvidence level 3 or 4; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+
Good Practice Points (GPP)
GPPRecommended best practice based on the clinical experience of the guideline development groupa
a On the occasion when the guideline development group find there is an important practical point that they wish to emphasise but for which there is not, nor is there 
likely to be any research evidence. This will typically be where some aspect of treatment is regarded as such sound clinical practice that nobody is likely to question it. 
These are marked in the guideline, and are indicated by ✓ or GPP. It must be emphasised that these are NOT an alternative to evidence- based recommendations, and 
should only be used where there is no alternative means of highlighting the issue.

Suggested Designated Roles and Responsibilities of Healthcare Professionals and Care Pathways
GP/midwife/any healthcare professional: 
First contact in pregnancy 
Perform thyroid func/g415on test s
Consider if medica/g415on needs changing
-If on levothyroxine: advise empirical dose 
increase 
-If on CMZ: convert to PTU if <10 weeks
If necessary, refer early to specialist 
endocrinologist/obstetrician/other depending on
local set upWoman with known thyroid disease before pregnanc y
Endocrinologist/GP: 
Discuss implica/g415ons of disease for pregnancy, op/g415mise thyroid 
control according to treatment targets 
GP to follow-up (in accordance with this guideline) un/g415l 
appointment available in specialist clinic for further 
follow-up during pregnanc yWoman with no history of thyroid disease
 GP/midwife/any healthcare professional: 
First contact in pregnancy 
Perform risk assessment (according to sec/g415on 6)
If at risk, oﬀer screening for thyroid dysfunc/g415on and 
perform thyroid func/g415on tests as soon as possible, 
preferably by the middle of the ﬁrst trimester 
GP/midwife/any healthcare professional: 
Interpret results using trimester-speciﬁc reference ranges
If abnormal, commence treatment if appropriate (in 
accordance with this guideline )
If necessary, refer early to specialist 
endocrinologist/obstetrician/other depending on local set 
up for further management in pregnanc y

Thyroid Function Reference Ranges in Pregnancy
Where trimester- and manufacturer- specific pregnancy reference ranges are not issued by the laboratory, the published thyroid function reference 
ranges in pregnancy for the specific assay manufacturer may be applied [ 46]. The reference ranges of commonly used manufacturers in the UK can 
be found in the table below.
Abbott Architect Beckman Access/Dxl Roche Cobas/Elecsys Siemens Advia Centaur
First trimester TSH: 0.09–3.46 TSH: 0.06–3.32 TSH: 0.12–4.10 TSH: 0.06–3.67
fT4: 10.9–18.7 fT4: 8.7–15.6 fT4: 11.6–20.3 fT4: 11.9–19.2
Second trimester TSH: 0.32–3.31 TSH: 0.32–3.31 TSH: 0.11–4.26 TSH: 0.47–4.46
f T4: 9.7–17.2 fT4: 6.8–12.4 f T4: 9.9–17.7 fT4: 11.6–17.6
Third trimester TSH: 0.38–4.34 TSH: 0.34–5.02 TSH: 0.50–4.71 TSH: 0.60–4.60
fT4: 8.8–14.9 fT4: 6.0–11.7 fT4: 8.7–15.2 fT4: 9.6–16.5
Median upper and lower limit of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; expressed in mU/L) and free thyroxine (fT4; expressed in pmol/L) for studies 
published between January 2000 to December 2020. Articles in which thyroid hormones were measured using one of four assay methods: Abbott 
Architect, Beckman Access or Dxl, Roche Cobas or Elecsys, and Siemens Advia Centaur, were selected. Only studies that reported reference intervals 
as 2.5–97.5 centiles with gestational age information at time of blood sampling were included. Studies were excluded if they were not in English, had 
less than 120 participants, did not exclude women with positive antibodies or thyroid disease, or were conducted in areas with excess or deficient 
iodine nutrition status.
