5.0 Introduction 
 
Population studies indicate that the risk of stillbirth increases from 1 per 3000 o ngoing 
pregnancies at 37 weeks to 3 per 3000 ongoing pregnancies at 42 weeks and to 6 per 3000 
ongoing pregnancies at 43 weeks. 
 
NHS Mater nity Statistics, England - 2020 -21 - NHS Digital showed that 34 % of 
women /people in England had their labours induced. 
 
UH Sussex (SRH & WH) data for 2021 - 22 showed that of 4626 birthing women/people, 
32.04 % (1482) had their labour induced. This compare s to 45% (2087) who had 
spontaneous labour and 22.85% (1057) that had caesarean birth with no labour. 
 
Of these women /people that were induced: 
 
 56.14 % (832) had a spontaneous vaginal birth . 
 27.80 % (412) had a caesarean section . 
 16.06 % (238) had an instru mental birth (medical assistance to birth vaginally) . 
 
Staff should be aware that according to the MBRRACE -UK 2020 report on perinatal 
mortality, women /people from some minority ethnic backgrounds or who live in deprived 
areas have an increased risk of stillbirth and may benefit from closer monitoring and 
additional support. The report showed that across all births (not just those induced): 
 
• Compared with white babies (34/10,000), the stillbirth rate is 
- More than twice as high in black babies (74/10,000) 
- Around 50% higher in Asian babies (53/10,000) 
• The stillbirth rate increases according to the level of deprivation in the area the 
mother lives in, with almost twice as many stillbirths for women /people living in the 
most deprived areas (47/10,000) compared with the least deprived areas 
(26/10,000). 
 
6.0 Information and decision making 
 
At the booking appointment, the clinician should signpost the woman/person to online 
maternity information . This in formation provision should be documented on the Maternity 
Information System (MIS). 
 
At 38 weeks w omen/people should be informed that most women/people will go into labour 
spontaneously by 42 weeks. See table 1 below:

Explain to women/people that induction of labour is a medical inter vention that will affect 
their birth options and their experience of the birth process. This could include that: 
 
 The reasons for induction being offered. 
 When, where, and how induction can be carried out. 
 The risks and benefits of IOL in specific circum stances and the proposed induction 
methods. 
 The alternative options if the woman/ person chooses not to have an IOL with clear 
documentation as to why the woman/person declines and the discussions that 
have taken place along with plan of action (see Section 1 8.0). This should also 
include a plan for follow up with senior involvement at regular intervals to give the 
woman/person opportunities to discuss plan going forward. 
 That induction may not be successful and what the woman’s options would be. 
 The alternative options if the woman /person chooses not to have induction of 
labour, or decides at a later stage, that she no longer wishes to proceed with the 
induction process. 
 The clinician should signpost the woman/person to online maternity information . 
 Women/people should be informed when thei r IOL is booked that there is a 
possibility that their induction may not be undertaken on the day offered 
depending on the unit activity. 
 The decision to delay any induction should be made jointly between the labour 
ward coordinator and the obstetric consultant in line with escalation guidance. 
 If an IOL is delayed, a plan should be made by the obstetric consultant and 
documented in the Delayed Induction Book . This should include wheth er a CTG 
should be offered (including frequency) whilst awaiting IOL. If the woman/person 
is not admitted, they should be contacted every 6 hours by the co-ordinator to 
update the situation and asked to ring Triage if they have any concerns regarding 
thems elves or fetal wellbeing.

Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
 
It is also important that women/people are made aware that induction of labour involves: 
 
 Vaginal examinations to assess the cervix are needed before and during 
induction, to determine the best method of induction and to monit or progress. 
 Their choice of place of birth will be limited, as they may be recommended 
interventions (for example, oxytocin infusion, continuous fetal heart rate 
monitoring and epidurals) that are not available for home birth or in midwife -led 
birth unit s. 
 There may be limitations on the use of a birthing pool. 
 There may be a need for an assisted vaginal birth (using forceps or ventouse), 
with the associated increased risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury (for example, 
third- or fourth -degree perineal t ears). The woman/person should be made aware 
that this risk also exists with a spontaneous onset of labour. 
 Pharmacological methods of induction can cause hyperstimulation – this is when 
the uterus contracts too frequently or contractions last too long, w hich can lead to 
changes in fetal heart rate and result in fetal compromise. This can usually be 
treated with a dose of terbutaline which can help to relax the uterus to stop the 
contractions. 
 The arrangements for support and pain relief as an induced lab our may be more 
painful than a spontaneous labour. This should include all forms of analgesia and 
a discussion of the risks and benefits of each. 
 Their hospital stay may be longer than with a spontaneous labour. 
 
All involved clinical staff need to invite the woman/person to ask questions and involve them 
in any decision making. When offering induction of labour: 
 
 Give pregnant women/people time to discuss this information with others (for 
example, their partners, birthing companion or family) if they wish to do so before 
making a decision. 
 Ensure women/people have the opportunity to ask questions, and time to think 
about their options. 
 Recognise that women/people can decide to proceed with, delay, decline or stop 
an induction. Respect the woman/person’s de cision, even if healthcare 
professionals disagree with it, and do not allow personal views to influence the 
care they are given. Recor d the woman/person’s decision on the Maternity 
Information System (MIS) . 
 Women/people should be made aware that there may be delays to the induction 
process at times when acuity is high, and that this is to allow safe 1:1 care. 
 
Induction of labour can be booked via labour ward and antenatal clinic and recorded on MIS .

7.0 Methods of induction of labour 
 
As of January 201 9, UH Sussex ( SRH & WH ) offers the following methods for preparing for 
and inducing labour: 
 
 Membrane sweep . 
 Cervical balloon catheter for cervical ripening (see Section 1 1.0) – this is currently 
first line choice fo r inducing labour however, this should be in discussion with the 
woman/person to decide the most favourable method in their circumstances and 
counselled on the risks vs benefits accordingly. 
 Dinoprostone v aginal PGE2 (Prostin/ Propess) (see Section 1 2.0) 
 Artificial rupture of membranes (see Section 1 3.0) 
 Oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) IV infusion ( see Section 1 4.0) 
 
The risks and benefits of different methods to ind uce labour should be discussed with the 
woman/person. Include that: 
 
 Dinoprostone vaginal PGE2 (Prostin/ Propess) can cause hyperstimulation (see 
NICE Appendix C: Risks of hyperstimulation associated with different 
pharmacological methods of inducing labour ). 
 When using pharmacological methods of ind uction, uterine activity and fetal 
condition must be monitored regularly. 
 If hyperstimulation does occur, the induction treatment will be stopped by giving 
no further medication, or by removal of vaginally administered products when 
possible. Terbutaline m ay also be considered to help relax the uterus. 
 There are differences in the ease with which different vaginal products can be 
removed, for example, dinoprostone controlled -release vaginal delivery systems 
(Propess) can be more easily removed than gel or vaginal tablets (Prostin). 
 Hyperstimulation can be treated with tocolysis, but hyperstimulation caused by 
misoprostol may be more difficult to reverse. Misoprostol is not currently 
recommended for routine use in UH Sussex ( SRH & WH ). 
 Mechanical methods are less likely to cause hyperstimulation than 
pharmacological methods. 
 Follow the manufacturers’ guidance on the use of Propess or Prostin preparations 
for the induction of labour, including when to remove dinoprostone controlled -
release vaginal delivery sys tems. 
 
The following do not have available evidence to support the use as a method of inducing 
labour: 
 
 Oral dinoprostone 
 Intravenous dinoprostone 
 Extra -amniotic dinoprostone 
or PGF2 
 Intracervical dinoprostone 
 Vaginal PGF2 
 Intravenous oxytocin alone  Hyalur onidase 
 Corticosteroids 
 Oestrogen 
 Relaxin 
 Mifepristone (except in combination 
for intrauterine fetal death) 
 Vaginal nitric oxide donors.

Be aware that the available evidence does not support the following methods for induction of 
labour: 
 Herbal supplemen ts 
 Acupuncture 
 Homeopathy 
 Castor oil  Hot baths 
 Enemas 
 Sexual intercourse 

7.1 Situations when induction of labour should not be routinely undertaken 
 
 History of precipitate labour. 
 Suspected large baby. 
 Maternal /birthing parent request alone (without r isk factors). 
 Fetal growth restriction with compromise (abnormal dopplers). 
 Breech presentation, however it may be considered if the birth needs to be 
expedited, and external cephalic version is unsuccessful, declined or 
contraindicated, and the pregnant w oman/person chooses not to have a planned 
caesarean birth. This would not be recommended at UH Sussex (SRH&WH) but if 
requested by the woman/person would need to be discussed with obstetric 
consultants. 
 
The decision for IOL for women/people with additiona l risk factors (including IOL prior to 41 
weeks) should be made by the obstetric consultant or there should be documented evidence 
of a discussion with an obstetric consultant. 
 
There should be a documented plan in the maternal notes to include timings of obstetric 
reviews and plans for fetal surveillance . 
 
8.0 Assessment before commencing induction including membrane sweeps 
 
Before commencing induction of labour , including membrane sweeps, ensure the position of 
the baby and the woman /person ’s condition ar e suitable for induction the following should be 
performed. 
 
 Assess maternal/birthing parent wellbeing. 
 Review the antenatal notes in the Maternity Information System. 
 Check the gestation dates by the dating scan and the indication for induction of 
labour. 
 Confirm no evidence of a low -lying placenta on previous scans before membrane 
sweeping and induction of labour. 
 Abdominally assessing the level and stability of the fetal head in the lower part of 
the uterus at or near the pelvic brim. 
 Confirming a normal fetal heart rate pattern using either intermittent auscultation if 
low risk or antenatal cardiotocography interpretation (until Dawes Redman criteria 
met) if risk factors present. 
 Confirming the absence of significant uterine contractions (not Braxton -Hicks) 
using cardiotocography or palpation if cardiotocograph is not indicated. Be mindful 
that a toco does not indicate strength or duration of contraction, factors such as 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 12 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
misplacement or maternal position can fail to detect contractions accurately. 
Manual palpation of contractions should always be performed assessing 
frequency, strength and resting tone between contractions, and this assessment 
documented. 
 The midwife should ensure that women/people have a chance to ask questions 
and that informed consent i s gained and documented in the maternal/birthing 
parent notes. 
 
For progression to dinoprostone (Prostin/Propess ) or Cervical Ripening Ballon or oxytocin 
(syntocinon ) infusion also perform: 
 
 National guidance recommends carrying out an ultrasound scan if there are any 
concerns about the position of the baby (for example, if it might be in the breech 
position). At UH Sussex ( SRH & WH ) a presentation scan is recommended prior 
to each induction of labour. 
 Confirming a normal fetal heart rate pattern using ant enatal cardiotocography 
interpretation (Dawes Redman criteria met) . 
 Registrar or consultant review for any woman/person with medical, obstetric or 
social risk factors. For women/people who are assessed as high risk, induction of 
labour should be obstetrici an-led. 
 Any concerns regarding this need to be communicated to the Labour Ward 
coordinator who will discuss the case with the obstetric registrar or consultant on 
Labour Ward. 
 Commence the ‘Labour Risk Assessment’ within the labour care record. This 
includes maternal/birthing parent and fetal observations as well as a review of the 
antenatal notes and Medway. 
 Presentation scan to assess for undiagnosed breech . 
 
8.1 Bishop Score 
 
 The Bishop Score is a group of measurements made by doing a vaginal 
examinati on, and is based on the station, dilation, effacement (or length), position, 
and consistency of the cervix. 
 During this preliminary vaginal examination, obstetricians and midwives should 
palpate for umbilical cord presentation and avoid dislodging the baby 's head. 
 The Bishop score is a numerical value obtained by doing a vaginal examination, 
and is based on the dilation, effacement (or length), position and consistency of 
the cervix and the station of the head with respect to the ischial spines of the 
pelvis. A score of 8 or more generally indicates that the cervix is ready to dilate, 
(previously the terms 'ripe' or 'favourable' were widely used) and when there is a 
high chance of spontaneous labour, or response to interventions made to induce 
labour. For th e purposes of this guideline, a Bishop score of less than or equal to 
6, or a score greater than 6, was used to help determine choice of 
pharmacological or mechanical methods to induce labour. ( NICE 2021 )

For women in whom the Bishop Score is assessed as ‘ favourable’ or more than 6, artificial 
rupture of membranes , followed by and intravenous oxytocin infusion can be considered as 
a primary method of inducing labour . (See section 13.0) 
 
For women/people in whom the Bishop Score is assessed as 6 or less, a Cervical Ripening 
Balloon Catheter (CRB) will be offered. (See section 11.0) 
 
If the CRB is not recommended, for example high head, or cannot be inse rted, offer 
induction of labour with dinoprostone as vaginal tablet, vaginal gel (Prostin) or controlled -
release vaginal delivery system (Propess). ( See section 12.0) 
 
9.0 Membrane sweep 
 
At the 38 week antenatal appointme nt, pregnant women/people should be offered 
information about the risks associated with pregnancies that last longer than 42 weeks, and 
their options. The information should cover: 
 
 Membrane sweeping makes spontaneous labour more likely, and so reduces th e 
need for formal induction of labour to prevent prolonged pregnancy. 
 What the membrane sweep procedure involves and that it is a vaginal 
examination to assess the readiness of the cervix (recorded as the Bishop score) 
will help to decide which method of induction they will be offered first. 
 Discomfort and vaginal bleeding are possible from the procedure. 
 Induction of labour offered between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks due to increasing 
likelihood of caesarean birth, the baby needing admission to a neonatal intens ive 
care unit and increased likelihood of stillbirth and neonatal death. (See table 2 
below) 
 Induction of labour from 41+1 weeks may reduce these risks, but the impact of 
induction on their birth experience should also be considered when making their 
decis ion.

Table 2: Risks associated with different induction of labour timing strategies NICE 2021 
 
Pregnant women/people aiming for a vagi nal birth should be offered a vaginal examination 
for membrane sweeping from 39 weeks, additional sweeps may be offered if labour does not 
start spontaneously following the first sweep. 
 
 An obstetrician may make a plan with the woman/person for sweeps bef ore 39 
weeks if medically indicated; this should be fully documented on MIS . This needs 
to be decided on an individual basis. 
 Additional membrane sweeping may be offered if labour does not start 
spontaneously. 
 Sweeps can be done in the community or hosp ital setting by midwives or 
obstetricians. 
 
Women/people who have BMI 30 or more: 
 
 Women/people with a BMI 30 or more should have IOL discussed at 36 -38 weeks 
and be offered IOL by 40 weeks. Elective induction of labour at term in obese 
women/people may r educe the chance of caesarean birth without increasing the 
risk of adverse outcomes; the option of induction should be discussed with each 
woman/person on an individual basis. RCOG Green -top Guideline No. 72 (2018) 
 
10.0 Required observations during IOL (prior to established labour) 
 
Women/people undergoing IOL should be made aware to contact their midwife, maternity 
unit (if an out -patient IOL) or obstetrician: 
 
 When contractions begin . 
 Contractions start (in an agreed timeframe, depending on the method used) . 
 Membranes rupture . 
 PV bleeding . 
 Any other concerns, such as reduced or altered fetal movements, excessive pain 
or uterine contractions, side -effects or loss o f the pessary/CRB.

10.1 Maternal /birthing parent observations 
 
 Maternal /birthing parent observations must include an assessment of temperature, 
pulse, and blood pressure and respiration rate on admission for IOL. 
 A fluid balance chart should be commend ed for all women/people undergoing 
induction. (See CG21009 Maternity Fluid Management as an in patient or in 
labour ). 
 Antenatal inpatients should have a m inimum of 4 -hourly observations which 
should be recorded on the MEOWS chart. 
 
10.2 Fetal observations 
 
 Observe fetal movements. 
 Abdominal palpation to establish presentation, lie, and engagement. 
 Four-hourly assessment of fetal wellbeing with auscultation of fetal heart or CTG if 
indicated (see CG1116 Fetal Monitoring Guideline ). 
 Risk assessment based on individual clinical context. 
 
Once in established labour commence care as per CG1196 Care in labour 
 
11.0 Cervical Ripening Balloon 
 
The CRB is the recommended method of cervical ripening at UH Sussex ( SRH & WH ) 
unless otherwise indicated. 
 
The woman/person should be informed that the CRB works over a 12 -hour period to ripen 
the cervix mechanically prior to artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) and a s such the next 
planned examination will not be performed until 12 hours after insertion unless indicated. 
 
11.1 Situations where the CRB should not be used 
 
 Placenta praevia, vasa praevia, or placenta percreta . 
 Abnormal lie or breech . 
 Prolapsed umbilical cord. 
 Previous hysterotomy, classic uterine incision, myomectomy or any other full -
thickness upper segment uterine incision (including uterine perforation) 
 Pelvic structural abnormality 
 Active primary genital herpes infection 
 Invasive cervical cancer 
 Abnor mal fetal heart -rate patterns 
 Any contraindication to labour induction 
 Ruptured membranes 
(Cook Medical G19891 - BALLOON, CERVICAL RIPENING accessed 21/02/22)

Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
11.2 Further considerations 
 
Cook Medical G19891 - BALLOON, CERVICAL RIPENING recommends that CRB should 
not be used in the following circumstances however this may be considered on an individual 
basis: 
 Multiple gestational pregnancy 
 Polyhydramnios 
 Presenting part above the pelvic inlet 
 Severe maternal hypertension 
 Previous lower segment caesarean birth 
 
11.3 Criteria for outp atient CRB 
 
 The benefits and risks of returning home as an outpatient should be discussed 
with the woman/person, and their decision respected. 
 Women/people should be made aware that timing of CRB removal and 
subsequent planned ARM may be influenced by acu ity on labour ward. 
 Social considerations - the baby of the woman/person should not be subject to a 
Child Protection Plan. Discuss plan of care of women/people with babies on a 
Child Protection Plan with the safeguarding team and community midwife. 
 Gestat ional age of at least 38 weeks. 
 Have the capacity to consent . 
 The woman /person should have birth partner who will stay with them at home on 
the day . 
 The woman /person should have access to a working phone. 
 Cephalic presentation – the fetal head must be enga ged in the pelvis . 
 The woman/person must be happy to go home and have transport to return. 
 Consideration should be given to the distance from home, and road/weather 
conditions. 
 Normal cardiotocograph (CTG) pre and post insertion of the CRB. Dawes Redman 
analysis can be used pre and post CRB insertion as long as there are no palpable 
or reported uterine activity . 
 
A plan for outpatient CRB can be made on an individual basis for women /people having 
consultant -led care with medical or obstetric conditions that do not increase their risk during 
induction. The discussion must be documented on MIS . 
 
MIS must be reviewed by the on -call obstetric consultant to check suitability for discharge 
home following the insertion of the CRB. 
 
Ensure the woman /person is aware of both the reasons to contact the hospital and the time 
to return and ensure DS has an accurate contact number for the woman /person . 
 
They should be given a time to return to Labour Ward 12 hours later and this should be 
booked through the Labour Ward co ordinator. The Labour Ward coordinator must take these 
women /people into account when they are assessing acuity as they are not suitable for 
divert in cases of unit escalation. An assessment should be undertaken at 12 hours and if 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 17 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
induction cannot proceed immediately due to acuity there must be a discussion with the co -
ordinator and obstetrician, this discussion should be fully documented on MIS including any 
phone calls made by the woman/person or by the mate rnity unit to the woman/ person. 
 
11.4 Criteria for inpatient CRB 
 
 Women /people risk assessed as requiring consultant -led care and/or risk factors 
on assessment should be admitted as an inpatient on the Maternity Ward for 
observations throughout. 
 Low risk women /people being induced solely for prolonged pregnancy (between 
41+0 and 42 weeks gestation) who have chosen to remain in hospital should be 
admitted to the Antenatal Ward . 
 
11.5 Insertion of Cervical Ripening Balloon Catheter 
 
 Perform assessment from section 8.0. 
 See Appendix 2 for standard operating procedure. 
 
11.6 Removal of CRB 
 
 See Appendix 2 for standard operating procedure. 
 Commence IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) following ARM (see section 14.0). 
 A personalised plan to be made if ut erine activity present in multi parous 
women /people e.g. mobilising for 1 -2 hours before ARM. This plan should be 
clearly documented on MIS . 
 
11.7 Spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) and CRB 
 
If SROM occurs prior to induction, CRB should not be used. If labour augmentation is 
required with prostaglandins then Prostin should be prescribed and administered. 
 
If SROM occurs after CRB has been inserted it should be remov ed, observe uterine activity, 
assess the fetal wellbeing with a CTG and perform a full set of maternal /birthing parent 
observations (consider if VE indicated as part of these observations). If there are no fetal 
concerns and uterine activity is insignifica nt, an IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) infusion should be 
commenced as soon as possible after removal of the CRB. 
 
If the woman/person is at home, they should be invited into the unit for assessment, if the 
woman/person declines this, it should be documented on M IS. 
 
11.8 Potential problems following CRB insertion 
 
Risks associated with use of the Cervical Ripening Balloon and labour induction may 
include, but are not limited to: 
 Placental abruption 
 Uterine rupture 
 Spontaneous rupture of membranes 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 18 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
 Spontaneous ons et of labour 
 Device expulsion 
 Device entrapment and/or fragmentation 
 Maternal discomfort during and after insertion 
 Failed dilation or need for caesarean birth 
 Cervical laceration 
 Bleeding 
 Risk of pre -term labour and birth in subsequent pregnancy 
(Cook Medical G19891 - BALLOON, CERVICAL RIPENING accessed 21/02/22) 
 
11.9 In the event the balloon falls out 
 
If at any point the CRB falls out, an ass essment should be performed to ARM and IV 
oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) started if there is obvious uterine activity. 
 
If the woman/person is at home, they should be invited into the unit for assessment, if the 
woman/person declines this, it should be documented on MIS. 
 
There should be low threshold for a presentation scan following balloon removal/falling out 
and prior to ARM for all women/people with risk factors such as: raised BMI, high head, 
borderline polyhydramnios. 
 
11.10 Active vaginal bleeding 
 
Active v aginal bleeding requires an urgent obstetric registrar or consultant review, 
commencement of CTG and immediate removal of the CRB. 
 
If women /people are at home when the bleeding occurs they should phone the maternity unit 
for advice. They should be asked to attend Labour Ward immediately or call an ambulance if 
substantial bleeding. This advice should be documented clearly on MIS . 
 
11.11 Women /people who are assessed as unsuitable for ARM 12 hours post -CRB 
 
The obstetrician should consider, discuss and do cument any of the following options with the 
woman /person : 
 
 ARM (if possible) 
 Rest for 24 hours 
 Use of Prostin (BNF guide for dosing) 
 Caesarean section 
 
Decision about further management should be in accordance with the woman /person ’s 
wishes, and should take into account the clinical circumstances. 
 
The obstetrician should agree and document an individualised management plan following 
discussion with the woman /person . 
 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 19 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
11.12 Urinary retention 
 
In some women /people , the CRB may cause temporary urinary retention due to the 
presence of the uterine balloon. If this occurs, the uterine balloon can be deflated to 20mls . 
In the presence of urinary retention, the midwife shou ld discuss the plan of care with a 
registrar / consultant. 
 
11.13 Cord presentation / prolapse 
 
In December 2019, a number of cord presentation/prolapse incidences were investigated 
following CRB for induction of labour. Although there was no direct link to the use of the 
balloon, it was decided via multi -disciplinary team decision to reduce the CRB volume to 
40mls (for each uterine and vaginal balloon) to see if the volume was causing head 
displacement. It is the responsibility of the assessing professio nal to do thorough abdominal 
and vaginal examinations prior to performing an ARM for suitability. Findings, judgements, 
and actions taken should be documented in detail on MIS . 
 
Carry out continuous cardiotocography during induction after the membranes ha ve ruptured, 
if the presenting part is not stable and not well -applied to the cervix. In this situation, discuss 
the risks and benefits of induction of labour with the woman /person , and if necessary 
consider caesarean birth. If the presenting part stabilis es and the cardiotocogram is normal, 
use intermittent auscultation unless there are clear indications for further cardiotocography. If 
the woman/person is at home, they should be invited into the unit for assessment, if the 
woman/person declines this, it s hould be documented on MIS. 
 
12.0 Dinoprostone ( Prostin /Propess ) 
 
If deemed more appropriate, dinoprostone Prostin gel may be administered and should be 
inserted into the posterior fornix of the vagina. Dinoprostone Propess ® may be kept in stock 
for emer gency use when Prostin is unavailable – see BNF here . 
 
Use of dinoprostone (Prostin ) should be discussed on an individual basis with the 
woman /person and a senior obste trician. 
 
Prostin E2® gel dosing r egime (BNF) : 
 
 Primigravida (unfavourable Bishop Score): 2mg gel inserted into posterior fornix, 
followed by 1 -2 mg gel if required af ter 6 hours. Maximum 4 mg per course. 
 Multiparous: 1mg gel inserted into posterior fornix, followed by 1 -2 mg gel if required 
after 6 hours. Maximum 3mg per course. 
 
12.1 Post dinoprostone ( Prostin ) administration 
 
 CTG should be continued for a minimum of 20 minutes . Dawes Redman analysis 
can be used pre and post dinoprostone (Prostin) as long as there are no palpable 
or reported uterine activity. Please see Fetal Heart Monitoring (including Fetal 
Blood Sampling) guideline. 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 20 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
 Following this, if CTG has met criteria, the woman/person can then move around, 
eat and drink as normal and should be encouraged to be as active as possible. 
 The woman/person c an then be transferred to the antenatal ward for 4 hourly fetal 
wellbeing assessments. 
 The woman/person should be advised to inform the midwife if she has any 
concerns, increase in contractions, SROM, vaginal bleeding or decreased fetal 
movements. 
 Bishop Score should be reassessed 6 hrs after insertion of Prostin, to monitor 
progress, with a view to performing an ARM or senior obstetrician review. 
 
When uterine contractions begin after administering dinoprostone, assess fetal wellbeing 
and uterine contract ions with intrapartum cardiotocography interpretation and: 
 
 If the cardiotocogram is confirmed as normal, review the individual circumstances 
and, if considered low risk, use intermittent auscultation unless there are clear 
indications for further cardioto cography. 
 If the fetal heart rate is abnormal or there are excessive uterine contractions: 
- Continue or restart continuous cardiotocography. 
- Do not administer any more doses. 
- Remove any vaginal pessaries if possible. 
- Consider terbutaline . 
- Seek o bstetric review. 
 
If labour has not established 6 hours after Prostin gel and ARM is not possible, or there are 
any problems, the woman/person should be referred for obstetric review. 
 
Labour Ward should be informed and transfer arranged if the following occur: 
 
 Labour becomes established 
 SROM 
 Evidence of fetal compromise 
 Contractions greater than 5 in 10 minutes 
 Vaginal bleeding 
 Maternal /birthing parent complications 
 Decreased fetal movements. 
 
12.2 Potential side effects/maternal reaction 
 
 Nausea or vo miting 
 Diarrhoea 
 Hypotension 
 Maternal tachycardia 
 Genital oedema 
 Hyperstimulation (see guidance on use of Terbutaline in Section 1 9.0) 
 
If there is any maternal reaction to Prostin the m idwife providing ca re must infor m the Labour 
Ward c oordinator and discuss with the on -call obstetric r egistrar.

Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 

13.0 Artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) 
 
For pregnant women/ people with a Bishop Score of 6 or more discuss with them that they 
can have an amniotomy as a primary method of induction of labour . It is advisable to 
commence an oxytocin infusion immediately , unless they are having uterine contractions . If 
a woman/ person chooses to delay starting this , they should be made aware that this may 
mean labour takes longer and there may be an incre ased risk of neonatal infection (NICE 
2021 ). If a pregnant woman/ person has chosen not to commence an oxytocin infusion a 
discussion should be had with a senior obstetrician and individ ual plan made as to whether 
the woman or person stays on labour ward or transfers to the antenatal ward. This 
discussion should be fully documented on MIS . 
 
14.0 Use of intravenous (IV) oxytocin (Syntocinon) 
 
IV Syntocinon should be used: 
 
 When in -coordin ate contractions or failure to progress in spontaneous labour is 
diagnosed (see Care in Labour Guideline ). 
 During the induction of labou r process (in the absence of membranes). 
 
IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) should not be commenced within 6 hours 
of Prostin administration 
IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) must be prescribed by a senior obstetrician/ 
consultant 
for all women/people 
 
14.1 Obstetric a ssessment prior to commencing IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) 
 
A senior obstetrician should perform and document an assessment and individualised 
management plan in the labour record prior to commencement of IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ). 
This may include the followin g: 
 
 Parity 
 Maternal or fetal risk factors 
 Review of CTG 
 Abdominal palpation 
 Cervical assessment 
 Dose schedule for oxytocin ( Syntocinon ), including frequency of increment. 
 When oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) should be stopped. 
 Monitoring arrangements for the woman/ person and fetus. 
 Time of next re -assessment. 
 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 22 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
 
14.2 Maternal and fetal observations during IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) infusion 
 
 A baseline CTG should be taken at least 30 mins prior to commencing oxytocin 
(Syntocinon ). 
 All women/people with oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) must have continuous CTG. 
 Apply a fetal scalp electrode (FSE) with consent if external monitoring is 
ineffective. 
 Record maternal pulse hourly and blood pressure, respirations and temperature 4 
hourly (more often if any evidence of hypertension). 
 Fluid balance hourly with 4 hourly cumulative balance as per CG21009 Maternity 
fluid management as an in -patient or in labour 
 Commence partogram when starting oxytocin ( Syntocinon ). 
 The woman/person should be offered a vaginal examination 4 hours after 
commencing oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) in established labour. 
 If there is less than 2 cm progress after 4 hours of oxytocin ( Syntocinon ), further 
obstetric review is required to consider caesarean section. 
 If there is 2 cm or more progress, vaginal examinations should be performed 4 
hourly. 
 Discuss maternal analgesia choices and review as required. 
 
14.3 Continuous electronic f etal monitoring during IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) 
infusion 
 
If the FHR trace is normal, oxytocin (Syntocinon ) may be continued until the woman/person 
is experiencing 4 or 5 contractions every 10 minutes. Oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) should be 
reduced if contraction s occur more frequently than 5 contractions in 10 minutes. 
 
If the FHR trace is classified as suspicious, this should be reviewed by an obstetrician and 
the oxytocin ( Syntocinon) dose should only be increased to achieve 4 or 5 contractions 
every 10 minutes . 
 
If the FHR trace is classified as pathological, oxytocin ( Syntocinon) should be stopped and a 
full assessment of the fetal condition undertaken by an obstetrician before oxytocin 
(Syntocinon) is recommenced. 
 
14.4 Indications to stop IV oxytocin (Synt ocinon ) infusion 
 
 Pathological CTG (or other fetal concerns). 
 Prior to transfer to theatre for emergency birth (may be recommenced once in 
theatre e.g. for instrumental birth). 
 
This should be documented on MIS . Urgent obstetric review is required with the above 
indications.

14.5 Oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) Infusion rate 
 
IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) will be prescribed as: 
10 international units oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) in 
500mls Normal Saline 
 
TIME RATE DOSE 
Start 3 ml/hr 1 milliunits/min 
30 mins 6 ml/hr 2 milliunits /min

150 mins 48 ml/hr 16 milliunits /min 
180 mins 60 ml/hr 20 milliunits /min 
 
Commence infusion at 3mls per hour. 
 
 Increase the infusi on rate every 30 minutes until contractions are 4 -5 in 10 minutes . 
 Where contractions exceed 5 in 10 minutes, reduce oxytocin ( Syntocin on), inform 
labour ward Co -ordinator and consider tocolysis using Terbutaline 0.25 mg 
subcutaneously . 
 
If further increas e needed, this should be discussed with the available registrar or 
consultant. 
 
TIME RATE DOSE 
210 mins 72 ml/hr 24 milliunits /min 
240 mins 84 ml/hr 28 milliunits /min 
270 mins 96 ml/hr 32 milliunits /min 
 
14.6 Use of IV oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) during second stage of labour 
 
If a woman /person reaches full cervical dilatation and the contractions are felt to be 
inadequate ; or they have had a prolonged 1st stage, they must be reviewed early in the 
second stage (or, ideally in late first stage) by the obst etric registrar or consultant for the 
consideration of a oxytocin ( Syntocinon) infusion. 
 
If starting oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) in the second stage, the infusion rate can start at 12 
ml/hr.

14.7 Women/people requiring fluid restriction 
 
For women/people on fluid restriction due to severe pre -eclampsia, use modified oxytocin 
(Syntocinon ) regime (see Appendix 7 ). 

15.0 Special circumstances 
15.1 Induction of preterm labour (prior to 37 weeks) with or without 
 ruptur e of membranes 
 
It is important that a consultant obstetrician or senior registrar fully counsel’s women /people 
when IOL is indicated prior to or at 37 weeks gestation including indication, methods, and 
the risk / benefits. 
 
If the fetal head is not suffi ciently engaged into the pelvis prior to induction, options should 
be carefully considered and discussed with the woman /person on an individual basis to 
ensure the best outcome. 
 
Sensitive consideration should be applied for women /people induced due to pr evious 
pregnancy loss, ensuring they are fully counselled on the risks and benefits of induction and 
gestation of induction. 
 
Please see CG20013 Preterm birth risk pathway for managing preterm birth. 
 
15.2 Intrauterine fetal death 
 
Where intrauterine fetal death has been confirmed, care should proceed in accordance with 
the guideline for intra -uterine fetal death. See CG1120 Intrauterine death including i nduction 
for a fetal abnormality 
 
15.3 Fetal abnormality 
 
In cases where there is a known fetal abnormality the neonatal team should be involved 
before commencing IOL. The woman/person (and partner where appropriate) and the 
midwife providing care should be fully involved in these discussions and the decisions made . 
 
15.4 Previous caesarean section 
 
The plan for IOL as documented within the Birth After Cae sarean Section Guideline should 
be followed. Use of a CRB can be considered . (See section 11.0) 
 
Advise women/people that they can choose not to have induction of labour or caesarean 
birth, even when it may benefit their or their baby's health.

Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
15.5 Diabetes 
 
Timing of IOL for diabetes should be managed in accordance with the Diabetes in 
Pregnan cy Guideline and the plan documented on MIS . 
 
15.6 Obesity 
 
Elective induction of labour by 40 weeks in women with a BMI 30kg/m2 or more may reduce 
the chance of caesarean birth without increasing the risk of adverse outcomes; the option of 
induction sho uld be discussed with each woman on an individual basis. RCOG (2018) 
Green -top Guideline No. 72 
 
15.7 Maternal /birthing parent request 
 
Induction of labour should not ro utinely be offered on maternal /birthing parent request alone 
prior to 39 weeks gestation. This decision must be undertaken by, or following consultation 
with, a senior obstetrician . 
 
Women /people requesting IOL for non -medical reasons should be seen in th e hospital 
Antenatal Clinic to fully discuss the risks and benefits of their request. They should be made 
aware that early IOL carries an increased risk of failure and requirement for instrumental 
birth. Early IOL should be discouraged where possible. 

16.0 Pre-labour rupture of membranes at 37 weeks or over 
 
If spontaneous rupture of membranes over 37 weeks is reported without contractions the 
woman /person should be assessed as soon as possible (home assessment or to attend the 
hospital out of hours). (See appendix 6 ) Complete the BSOTs ‘Antenatal Triage assessment 
care for ruptured membranes’. 
 
Where women/people have additional risks consider immediate assessment. 
 
 Fetal movement, heart rate and liquor colour s hould be assessed at this initial 
contact . 
 
If pre -labour rupture of membranes is confirmed, offer pregnant women/people a choice of 
expectant management for up to 24 hours, or induction of labour with dinoprostone vaginal 
PGE2 as soon as possible. Discus s the benefits and risks of these options with the woman, 
and take into account her individual circumstances and preferences. This discussion should 
be documented on MIS . The woman/ person should be informed that: 
 
 60% of women/people with SROM labour withi n 24 hours. 
 The risk of serious neonatal infection doubles from 1 in 200 to 1 in 100 after 24 
hours of ruptured membranes (i.e. from 0.5% to 1%). 
 Delaying starting induction for 24 hours following SROM may mean there is an 
increased risk of neonatal infec tion.

Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
16.1 PROM at term with meconium stained liquor 
 
Where there is any meconium -stained liquor the woman /person should be reviewed as soon 
as possible by an Obstetrician for an individualised plan of care. 
 
16.2 PROM at term with Group B Streptococcu s (GBS) 
 
Pregnant women/people with a history o f GBS, should be asked to come to Labour Ward 
and be induced as soon as possib le using a oxytocin ( Syntocinon ) infusion. See CG11100 
Management of women/people and neonates with risk factors for neonatal sepsis (inc GBS) 
 
16.3 Expectant management of lower risk PROM 
 
For women/people who choose expectant management after prelabour rupture of the 
membranes at term (at or over 37+0 weeks), offer induction of labour if labour has not 
started naturally after approximately 24 hours. 
 
Respect the woman/person’s choice if they wish to wait for spontaneous onset o f labour for 
over 24 hours after prelabour rupture of membranes at term. Discuss the woman/person's 
options for birth from this point onwards with them. 
 
Until IOL is commenced or if expectant management beyond 24 hours is chosen by the 
woman/person: 
 
 Lower vaginal swabs and maternal C -reactive protein are not indicated. 
 Women /people should be advised to record their temperature every 4 hours during 
waking hours and to report immediately any developing pyrexia or change in the 
colour or smell of their vagi nal loss to detect any i nfection that may be developing. 
 Women /people should be informed that bathing or showering is not associated with 
an increase in infection, but that h aving sexual intercourse may be. 
 Fetal movement and fetal heart rate should be mon itored at initial contact, and every 
24 hours following SROM until established labour. Women /people should be advised 
to report any decrease or change in fetal movements. 
 If labour has not started 24 hours after rupture of the membranes, advise the 
woman/p erson to give birth where there is access to neonatal services and neonatal 
sepsis observations should be performed at birth, 1 and 2 hours of age, followed by 
observations every 2 hours until 12 hours of age (see CG11100 Management of 
women/people and neonates with risk factors for neonatal sepsis (inc GBS) ). 
 
17.0 Unsuccessful induction of labour 
 
Unsu ccessful induction is defined as labour not starting despite all efforts / methods ( ARM 
not possible after CRB insertion and / or 2 doses Prostin 6 hours apart ). 
 
If induction is unsuccessful, healthcare professionals should discuss this with the 
woman /person and provide support. The woman /person ’s condition and the pregnancy in 
general should be fully reassessed, and fetal wellbeing should be assessed using CTG. 
 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 27 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
Decisions about further management should be made in accordance wi th the 
woman/ person’s wish es, with obstetric consultant opinion, and should take into account the 
clinical circumstances. This could include: 
 
 Offering a rest period if clinically appropriate and then re -assessing the 
woman /person. 
 Expectant management 
 Further attempts to induce la bour with further prostaglandins 
 Caesarean birth within the next 24 - 48 hours as long as fetal and 
maternal /birthing parent well-being is maintained. 
 
For women/people who choose caesarean birth after an unsuccessful induction, 
recommendations in the CG12030 Caesarean Section Birth should be followed. 
 
The decision and discussions to abandon IOL should be documented on MIS . 
 
18.0 Declining induction of labour for prolonged pregnancy 
 
If a woman/person declines to have induction of labour , their decision should be respected. 
Healthcare professionals should document the woman/person’s decision on MIS and 
discuss the woman/person’s options from this point on, for example expectant management 
or caesarean birth, and document an agree d care plan. 
 
If there are no additional risk factors and there is a documented discussion of the risks and 
benefits, women/people do not need to be seen initially by an obstetrician. The plan of care 
should be documented on MIS by the midwife providing care. 
 
Offer women/people who choose to await the spontaneous onset of labour the opportunity to 
discuss their decision again at all subsequent reviews, i f they wish to do so. 
 
Advise women/people to contact their midwife or maternity unit if they change their mind 
before their next appointment, or as soon as possible if they have concerns about their baby 
(for example reduced or altered fetal movements). 
 
If the baby is not born by 40+10 weeks , the woman /person should be reviewed by a member 
of the obstetric team for an ongoing individualised plan of care. 
 
Pregnant w omen /people may be offered (from 42 weeks) twice weekly CTG in the Day 
Assessment Unit and weekly ultrasound scan to revie w maximum amniotic pool depth. If 
either of these checks is not within normal limits, immediate referral to an obstetrician 
(registrar or consultant) should be made. 

Advise pregnant women/people that: 
 
 Monitoring only gives a snapshot of the current situation, and cannot predict 
reliably any changes after monitoring ends, but provides information on how their 
baby is at the moment and so may help them make a decision on options for birth. 
CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 28 of 39 
Pre-JOGG. Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use . 
 Adverse effects on the baby (includi ng stillbirth), and when these events might 
happen, cannot be predicted reliably or prevented even with monitoring. 
 
If there are additional risk factors identified women/people should be offered an appointment 
with an obstetrician (registrar or consultant level) and /or midwife manager. 
 
19.0 Uterine hyper stimulation 
 
Hyper stimulation has been shown to be rare when using the CRB , although can happen 
with dinoprostone (see NICE Appendix C: Risks of hyperstimulation associated with different 
pharmacological methods of inducing labour ). 
 
If uterine hyper stimulation occurs (more or equal to 5 contractions per 10 minutes) during 
induction of labour: 
 
 Carry out a fetal assessment . 
 Do not administer any more doses of medicines to induce labour and remove any 
vaginal pessaries or CRB if possible . 
 
Inform the on -call registrar / consultant and request a review. Tocolysis should be 
considered with abnormal FHR patterns. 
 
The suggested regime is Terbutaline 0.25 mg subcutaneously, which should be given after 
obstetric review - See BNF . 
 
20.0 Uterine rupture 
 
If uterine rupture is suspected during induced labour, carry out an immediate category 1 
caesarean birth. (See CG1151 Uterine Rupture ) 

CG1119 IOL & A ugmentation of Labour & use of Oxytocin v9.2 June 2023 Page 29 of 39
