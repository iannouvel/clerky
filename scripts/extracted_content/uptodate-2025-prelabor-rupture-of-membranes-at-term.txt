Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management
INTRODUCTION
Prelabor rupture of the membranes (PROM) refers to rupture of the fetal membranes prior
to the onset of regular uterine contractions. It may occur at term ( ≥ 37+0 weeks of gestation)
or preterm (<37+0 weeks of gestation); the latter is designated preterm PROM (PPROM).
Midtrimester PROM typically refers to PPROM at approximately 16 to 26 weeks of gestation;
this is an arbitrary definition, which varies slightly among investigators. The frequencies of
term, preterm, and midtrimester PROM are approximately 8, 3, and <1 percent of
pregnancies, respectively. Why membranes rupture at term and whether different etiologies
account for prelabor versus intrapartum membrane rupture is not well understood.
The key issue in term PROM is whether to wait for spontaneous labor to begin or induce
labor. Over 50 percent of expectantly managed patients will be in active labor within one day
and 95 percent will be in active labor within three days, but they are at higher risk for
developing maternal infection than those who are induced [1].  
The management of term PROM will be reviewed here. Issues regarding midtrimester PROM
and PPROM are discussed separately:

https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 1/11labor begins has not been studied extensively. In the absence of high-quality data
supporting the safety of delaying evaluation, the most prudent approach is for prompt
assessment to confirm membrane rupture, determine fetal position, evaluate maternal and
fetal status, and discuss options for further management. (See "Labor and delivery:
Management of the normal first stage", section on 'Initial examination'.)
ACTIVE OR EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT?
Our approach — The key decision in managing uncomplicated term PROM is whether to
initiate delivery or take an expectant approach. We suggest prompt delivery for patients withThe diagnosis of PROM is based upon a characteristic history (ie, leaking fluid per vagina)
and confirmatory speculum examination in which fluid is seen flowing from the cervical os.
If the diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic testing is performed on fluid pooled in the
posterior fornix. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PROM are the same across
gestation and are discussed in detail separately. (See "Preterm prelabor rupture of
membranes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation and
diagnosis'.)●
Digital cervicovaginal examination should be avoided before labor, as it has been
associated with an increased risk of chorioamnionitis.
Fetal well-being is evaluated with a nonstress test. (See "Nonstress test and contraction
stress test".)●
Fetal position is determined by transabdominal physical examination (Leopold's
maneuvers) and/or with ultrasound examination (ultrasound dominates the modern
evaluation of fetal presentation in the setting of PROM).●
Maternal evaluation includes assessment for contractions, signs of infection (eg, fever,
fetal tachycardia, maternal leukocytosis), and oligohydramnios (either single deepest
pocket <2 cm or amniotic fluid index ≤ 5 cm), as well as review of the prenatal record and
current maternal status for medical and obstetric complications that impact decision
making regarding timing of delivery.●
We obtain a baseline complete blood count, recognizing that leukocytosis is a nonspecific
finding and can be associated with inflammation apart from infection. A marked elevation
in the white blood cell count (greater than 20,000 per cubic millimeter) or a significant left
shift suggests chorioamnionitis. In other cases, impending chorioamnionitis should be
suspected when leukocytosis occurs with other premonitory signs or symptoms of
infection or the white blood cell count is rising. (See "Clinical chorioamnionitis", section on
'Diagnosis'.)22/02/2025, 06:07 Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management - UpToDate
https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 2/11term PROM. Labor is induced as soon as feasible, unless there are contraindications to labor
or vaginal birth, in which case cesarean birth is performed as soon as feasible.
Our approach is based primarily on our concern about increased risks of maternal and
newborn infection with expectant management, as well as our patients’ general preference
for expedited delivery. Prompt intervention also reduces the risk for other serious but less
common complications that may occur during expectant management, such as cord
prolapse or abruption, and intervention was the most cost-effective approach in one model
[2]. However, labor tends to be longer with induction than when labor begins spontaneously.
For patients who decline prompt intervention, we suggest developing a time limit for
expectant management through shared decision-making (see 'Duration of expectant
management' below). Signs of infection or other pregnancy complications are an indication
for termination of expectant management and delivery by the most appropriate method for
the clinical situation.
Our approach is supported by a 2021 meta-analysis of nine randomized trials including
nearly 3800 patients with singleton gestations ≥ 36 weeks of gestation with PROM who were
induced with oxytocin at ≤ 12 versus >12 hours after membrane rupture [3]. Compared with
expectant management (ranging from 24 to 96 hours in most trials), induction at ≤ 12 hours
resulted in:
A subgroup analysis of induction of labor at ≤ 6 hours after membrane rupture showed
similar results. The quality
of evidence of the included trials was low to moderate, given that use of antibiotics was not
clearly defined, some outcomes were not reported in some trials, and older trials included
digital cervical examination.
The significant reduction in risk of neonatal sepsis demonstrated in the analysis is
particularly important because it can result in death. (See "Neonatal bacterial sepsis:Less neonatal sepsis (6.1 versus 11.8 percent; RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.79) ●

https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 3/11Treatment, prevention, and outcome in neonates ≥ 35 weeks gestation", section on
'Outcome'.)
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends delivery for patients
with PROM at ≥ 37+0 weeks but also states that a short period of expectant management
may be offered [4].
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT (PREFERRED APPROACH)
Oxytocin induction — For patients with no contraindications to labor and vaginal birth, we
suggest induction with oxytocin, without preinduction cervical ripening. Oxytocin is easier to
titrate than prostaglandins, and may be less expensive, depending on the prostaglandin
preparation chosen. (See "Induction of labor with oxytocin", section on 'Oxytocin
administration'.)
Meta-analyses of randomized trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit from initial use of
any prostaglandin rather than oxytocin in patients with prelabor rupture of the membranes
(PROM), including those with unfavorable cervixes [5-8]; however, data for the latter
subgroup are limited, as discussed below.
Alternatives for patients with an unfavorable cervix
Misoprostol or prostaglandin E2 — Although we do not perform preinduction cervical
ripening in patients with term PROM, some clinicians may choose to use prostaglandin E1
or E2 for this purpose if their assessment of the advantages and disadvantages for an
individual patient favors use of a cervical ripening agent. Only a few small trials have
evaluated preinduction cervical ripening in patients with term PROM and an unfavorable
cervix [9,10], so the absence of a statistically significant benefit in these trials does not
negate the possibility of a modest clinical effect, as observed in populations with intact
membranes. These agents may also induce labor, obviating the need for oxytocin [11]. (See
"Induction of labor: Techniques for preinduction cervical ripening", section on
'Prostaglandins'.)
Balloon catheter — We suggest not using balloon catheters for cervical ripening in the
setting of PROM. High-quality data supporting safety and efficacy in these patients are not
available, the risk for chorioamnionitis is increased [12], a benefit has not been
demonstrated compared with using oxytocin alone [13], and both oxytocin and
prostaglandins are safe and effective alternatives.
In a meta-analysis of randomized trials (4 trials, 605 participants), patients with mostly
term PROM managed with a balloon catheter had an increased risk of intraamniotic
infection [12]:22/02/2025, 06:07 Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management - UpToDate
https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 4/11The frequencies of other outcomes, including endometritis and suspected neonatal
infection, were similar in both groups. More and larger trials are needed to improve the
precision of these findings. (See "Induction of labor: Techniques for preinduction cervical
ripening", section on 'Mechanical methods'.)  
EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT
Candidates — After weighing the risks and benefits of induction versus expectant
management (see 'Active or expectant management?' above), patients with otherwise
uncomplicated pregnancies who are averse to prompt intervention may choose to undergo a
period of expectant management. These patients should have reassuring fetal testing, no
contraindications to labor and vaginal birth, and no signs of clinical chorioamnionitis or
other medical or obstetric complications that increase maternal/fetal risk if birth is deferred.
(See "Clinical chorioamnionitis", section on 'Clinical findings' and "Clinical chorioamnionitis",
section on 'Diagnosis'.)
Meconium stained amniotic fluid has been associated with an increased risk of clinical
chorioamnionitis and positive amniotic fluid cultures, nonreassuring intrapartum fetal heart
rate patterns, and meconium aspiration syndrome [14-16]. However, there is no evidence
that immediate induction of labor will reduce the risk of these complications; therefore, we
believe amniotic fluid lightly stained with meconium is not a strong contraindication to
expectant management if this is the approach that the patient chooses and antepartum fetal
assessment is otherwise reassuring (reactive nonstress test with no variable decelerations).
In some of these cases, meconium-like staining is residual hemoglobin pigment from
decidual hemorrhage. By comparison and in the absence of data from randomized trials to
guide practice recommendations, we believe induction and continuous fetal monitoring are
reasonable when meconium is thick. Patients with meconium-stained amniotic fluid were
excluded from the seminal trial that compared outcomes of labor induction with expectant
management for term PROM [1].
Duration of expectant management — There are no strong data on which to base a
recommendation for the maximum duration of expectant management in patients with no
pregnancy complications that warrant delivery. In the seminal term PROM trial, which limited
expectant management to 96 hours post rupture, the risk of chorioamnionitis appeared to
increase significantly after 24 hours [15], suggesting that 24 hours is a reasonable limit.
However, waiting longer would increase the number of pregnant people who would begin toCompared with use of any pharmacologic agent alone (21 of 271 [7.7 percent] versus 15
of 334 [4.5 percent]; RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.91-3.73).●
Compared with use of oxytocin alone (15 of 154 [9.7 percent]) versus 5 of 174 [2.9
percent]; RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.17-8.70).●22/02/2025, 06:07 Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management - UpToDate
https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 5/11labor spontaneously. In the term PROM trial, 50 percent of patients with PROM managed
expectantly were in active labor by approximately 17 hours and 95 percent were in active
labor by approximately 75 hours after membrane rupture [1].
Expectant management in hospital or at home? — We suggest hospitalizing patients with
PROM. When the termPROM study group compared outcomes of expectant management at
home with expectant management in the hospital, patients who were sent home were more
likely to develop clinical chorioamnionitis (10.1 versus 6.4 percent) [17]. In multiple logistic
regression analyses, patients managed at home had a higher risk of neonatal infection (odds
ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.00-3.90) and nulliparas managed at home more likely to receive
antibiotics before giving birth (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.24). Another risk of home
management is the possibility of rapid labor and delivery before the patient can get to the
hospital [18].
For patients who request expectant management at home until labor or a complication
ensues, we believe the following criteria are reasonable after initial evaluation on the labor
and delivery unit (see 'Initial evaluation' above):
Antibiotic prophylaxis — As discussed above, our approach to minimizing risk for infection
is prompt induction of labor and use of intrapartum group B streptococcus (GBS) antibiotic
prophylaxis when indicated by standard guidelines, rather than expectant management with
(or without) use of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis. (See 'Our approach' above.)
We believe use of prophylactic antibiotics for PROM at or near term should be avoided, given
the unmeasured potential adverse effects of antibiotic use, the potential for development of
resistant organisms, and the relatively low risk of maternal infection in untreated patients.
There is no convincing evidence of maternal or neonatal benefit from use of prophylactic
antibiotics for PROM at or near term [20,21]:Cephalic presentation ●

below.)●

https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 6/11The relative risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis are different preterm. Available
evidence, although limited, supports the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in preterm PROM
(PPROM) because it prolongs latency, which is desirable in preterm gestations but not a goal
in term PROM. (See "Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes: Management and outcome",
section on 'Administer prophylactic antibiotic therapy'.)
Group B streptococcus colonization — A positive screening culture for GBS (or other
criteria for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis) does not necessarily preclude expectant
management, but we agree with guidelines from those major organizations that have
recommended induction for these patients [4,23,24]. In a secondary analysis, the termPROM
trial evaluated the effect of induction of labor on neonatal infection in pregnant patients with
PROM who were GBS-positive [25]. Induction with oxytocin was associated with a lower rate
of neonatal infection than expectant management (2.5 versus >8 percent). However, prenatal
GBS culture and chemoprophylaxis were performed at the discretion of the provider, which
limits the generalizability of these results.
We approach the issue of GBS in term PROM as follows:In a meta-analysis of five trials antibiotic prophylaxis for term or near-term involving a
total of 2699 participants, compared with placebo or no treatment, use of broad-spectrum
antibiotic prophylaxis resulted in no statistically significant reductions in chorioamnionitis
(2.7 versus 3.7 percent), endometritis (0.4 versus 0.9 percent), or latency from PROM to
delivery (mean difference 0.5 hours) [20]. Although no statistically significant difference in
neonatal sepsis (1 versus 1.4 percent) or perinatal death (0.6 versus 0.3 percent) was
observed, a clinically significant difference cannot be excluded given the even smaller
number of these events. In the 37 percent of pregnancies in which latency was longer than
12 hours, subgroup analysis revealed a lower rate of maternal infection with antibiotic
prophylaxis, but no statistical improvement in neonatal outcomes. No data were available
on potential harms.●
A large retrospective cohort study including over 5300 patients with term PROM confirmed
these finding. Administration of a cephalosporin within 6 hours, between 6 and 12 hours,
or after 12 hours of PROM was not associated with a reduction in maternal or neonatal
infections [22].
Antepartum GBS culture result positive – In patients with ruptured membranes and a
positive GBS culture, maternal intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk for
early onset neonatal GBS disease should be initiated as soon as possible after PROM,
whether induction or expectant management is undertaken. (See "Prevention of early-
onset group B streptococcal disease in neonates".)●22/02/2025, 06:07 Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management - UpToDate
https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-at-term-management/print 7/11Maternal and fetal monitoring — There are no standards for maternal-fetal monitoring in
expectantly managed term PROM and no data from randomized trials on which to base
recommendations. However, there is consensus that digital vaginal examination and vaginal
intercourse should be avoided to reduce the risk of intrauterine infection.
We would advise patients who choose expectant management to do the following:
Indications for delivery — Expectant management is terminated when the time limit
defined by the clinician and patient is reached or any standard indication for delivery
develops (eg, suspected chorioamnionitis, nonreactive nonstress test, low biophysical profile
score, preeclampsia).

Management ●
We suggest prompt induction of labor in patients with term PROM (Grade 2C).
Compared with expectant management, induction of labor is associated with a reduction
in maternal and neonatal infection and lower treatment costs, with no increase in
cesarean birth. (See 'Active or expectant management?' above.)•
We suggest induction with oxytocin (Grade 2B). Oxytocin is as effective as
prostaglandins, is easier to titrate, and may be less expensive, depending on the
preparation. Data supporting the safety of balloon catheter use for cervical ripening in
PROM are sparse. (See 'Active management (preferred approach)' above.)•22/02/2025, 06:07 Prelabor rupture of membranes at term: Management - UpToDate
