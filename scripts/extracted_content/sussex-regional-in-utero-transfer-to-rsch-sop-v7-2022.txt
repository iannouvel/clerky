Key Principles 
A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of step by step instructions ensuring 
that a potential ly complex process can be undertaken in a timely way. Professional 
judgement may be used in the application of a SOP. 
 
Scope 
This SOP applies to: 
• All members of staff who come into contact with the pregnant person being 
transferred during the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum periods. 
• Women being transferred from home to hospital, from site to site and from this 
Trust to another Trust. 
 
Responsibilities 
It is the responsibility of all midwifery and medical sta ff to: 
• Access, read, understand, and apply this guidance 
• Attend any mandatory training pertaining to this guidance 
 
It is the responsibility of the division to: 
• Review the SOP in line with national recommendations 
• Ensure the SOP is accessible to all relevant staff 
• Monitor outcomes of the SOP 
 
Definition s 
Preterm labour is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO)1 as the onset of 
regular uterine contractions between viability and 37/40 weeks gestation associated 
with cervical effacement and dilatation. Current guidelines describe a ‘threshold of 
viability’ between 22 and 26 weeks. 
Preterm birth is defined as birth between 26+6 weeks to 36+6 weeks gestation. 
Extreme preterm birth is defined as birth between 22+6 weeks to 26+6 weeks 
gestation.

Aims 
• Timely in -utero transfer is achieved for those pregnant mothers most at risk. 
• 85% of births in Sussex , below 27 completed weeks of pregnancy occur at a 
maternity unit with a NICU. 
• The number of unnecessary transfers is reduced . 
• Patient experience of transfer is improved . 
• The t ime spent on arranging transfer is reduced . 
 
Indications 
An in-utero transfer is required when a pregnant person is likely to deliver a baby who 
requires expertise unavailable at the local baby unit; or when a woman has an illness 
in pregnancy requiring expertise not available at the local maternity unit. 
The following criteria apply for in -utero transfer of threatened preterm delivery with in 
the South East Coast Neonatal Network . 
Local Neonatal Units (LNU): 
• <27 weeks gestation and/or an expected birth weight of <800g and <28 weeks 
gestation multiples shoul d be transferred in -utero to a NICU for delivery. 
Special Care Units (SCU): 
• <32 weeks gestation and/or an expected birth weight of <1250g should be 
transferred in -utero to a NICU or LNU if appropriate . 
Ex-utero transfer of extreme preterm babies immediately after birth is associated with 
increased neonatal morbidity and mortality . Importantly some may represent missed 
opportunities for in -utero transfer . 
 
Trust to Trust Transfer 
The tertiary maternity site within Sussex is located at the Royal Sussex County 
Hospital (RSCH) in Brighton. 
The tertiary centre should accept people in Sussex who are in preterm labour below 
32 weeks gestation. The expectation is that all below 27 weeks gestation will be 
accepted. It may be acceptable to transfer in -utero to a LNU at gestations between 27 
and 32 weeks. Currently there is no LNU within Sussex. Transfer out of the local area 
to a NICU or LNU should be avoided as it may increase the risk of transfer and be 
associated w ith increased stress and expense for the pregnant woman and her family. 
5 
 
Identifying a pregnant person with preterm labour is extremely important and should 
involve senior obstetric, neonatal and midwifery staff. 
A thorough clinical assessment of every preg nant person in threatened preterm labour, 
or deemed to be at risk of delivering preterm, should be performed by the obstetric 
middle grade before discuss ion of in -utero transfer with the obstetric and neonatal 
consultant. 
Transfer following preterm prolonged rupture of membranes should be considered if 
there is evidence of uterine activity or clinical chorioamnionitis. 
Full communication between units is vital in the management planning of an in-utero 
transfer. This must include a MDT discussion within both the transferring and the 
receiving maternity unit. The decision to transfer can then be reviewed and 
documented in both the notes and on the MIT system. 
 
Although the Trevor Mann Baby Unit (TMBU) will always accept a Sussex in-utero 
transfer when it is safe to do so , the neonatal staff should be informed as soon as 
possible to allow any necessary reorganisation of resources. 

Transfer 
 
Once a decision has been made to transfer i.e. preterm birth is probable or medically 
indicated for either maternal or fetal condition, the m idwife providing c are for the 
pregnant person should ensure the following : 
 
• Medical staff at each site are in agreement to transfer the pregnant pe rson 
• Labour ward coordinators at each site know about and agree to the transfer 
• Neonatal unit is informed 
• Maternal consent is gained and documented in notes 
• SBAR transfer form is completed in full and placed in the notes 
 
The obstetrician providing care should write a clear plan of action in maternal notes . If 
necessary a copy of all documentation can be kept by the transferring unit, the original 
must accompany the birthing person. 
 
All in-utero transfers by ambulance will be classed as an emergency unless otherwise 
indicated. 
 
The labour ward co -ordinator should arrange for an ambulance by phoning ambulance 
control. 
 
6 
 
• It should be stated that the transfer is an immediate, blue light transfer by a 
paramedic ambulance. 
 
• The time of the call s hould be documented in the maternal notes by the person 
making the call. 
 
• The time of the arrival of the ambulance and time of departure from the 
transferring maternity unit should be documented in the maternal notes by the 
midwife providing care. 
 
• The time of arrival at the receiving labour ward should be documented in the 
maternal notes , or a new electronic record commenced, by the midwife 
providing care. 
 
• The midwife providing care should accompany the pregnant person in the 
ambulance (bringing approp riate equipment for eventualities during transfer) 
 
• The maternity notes should accompany the pregnant person. On arrival the 
midwife providing care should give a full handover to the receiving midwife . If 
possible include the labour ward co -ordinator and on call registrar . The 
handover should be documented in the notes and the SBAR form signed as 
confirmation of a complete and proper handover. 
 
Transfer refused or not completed 
 
There may be some incidences when transfer is refus ed. This might be due to the 
labouring person’s wishes or lack of capacity / staffing at the tertiary centre. Any 
potential refusal of a Sussex in -utero transfer should be escalated by the RSCH labour 
ward coordinator to their obstetric labour ward and NICU consultants. Options to 
facilitate acceptance should be fully explored within MTD discussion s at both the 
transferring and receiving units. Freeing up capacity or reorganisation of staffing may 
be possible with only minor delay. It will be necessary to have further unit to unit 
discussion s at this stage. The transferring unit must record the decision making 
process in the pregnant person’s no tes and on the MI S. 
 
Failure to achieve an in -utero transfer at <27 weeks for LNUs or <32 weeks gestation 
for SCUs will trigger the referring maternity and neonatal teams to joint ly complete an 
exception report. There is a Sussex , Standard Operating Proce dure for the review and 
learning from preterm babies born outside a unit appropriate for their gestation or 
weight . The completed e xception report is sent to the Neonatal Network Manager , 
South East Coast Operational Delive ry Network and the LMS Safety Lead .

Appendix 3 – SOP for reviewing the learning from preterm births born 
outside of appropriate unit 
 
Standard Operating Procedure for review and learning from preterm babies born 
outside a unit appropriate for their gestation or weight 
 
Purpose 
To provide a framework to support multidisciplinary review and learning of all cases 
where a baby has been born in a maternity unit that does not have the recommended 
level of neonatal unit support, according to the South East Coast Neonatal Network 
Guidance and Process (V4 Sept 2017) 
To support NHS KLOE target of 85% of deliveries under 27 weeks in the right place; 
and development of a perinatal pathway for delivery in accordance with NICE quality 
standard. This work is in support of GIRFT and the Neonatal Critical Care Review. 
 
Scope 
All maternity units within the Sussex LMS footprint 
• Eastbourne & Hastings NHS Trust (SCU) – Level 1 
• Brighton & Sussex University Hospital Trust (NICU) – Level 3 at RSCH site, 
(SCU) – Level 1 at PRH site 
• Western & Sussex NHS Foundation Trust (SCU) – Level 1 at the Worthing site, 
(LNU) – Level 2 at St Richards’s site 
 
The LNU on the St Richard’s site falls within the Wessex neonatal ODN despite the 
maternity department being part of Sussex LMS. This LNU is also under review as 
part of the neonatal critical care review. 
 
Categories of unit 
Whilst every hospital with a labour ward h as the capability to look after a sick or 
preterm baby who needs intensive care as an emergency; and can do so for a brief 
period of time – the expertise of an intensive care unit is demonstrated to improve 
outcomes for these infants. Additionally babies who are born in the wrong centre will 
then need to undergo a transfer ex -utero, which has also been demonstrated to 
worsen outcomes; as well as causing increased demand for neonatal transfer 
services. 
Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) are sited alongsi de specialist obstetric and 
fetal medicine services, and provide the whole range of medical neonatal care for their 
local population, along with additional care for babies and their families referred from 
12 
 
the Neonatal Network. Many NICUs in England are co -located with neonatal surgery 
services and other specialised services. Medical staff in a NICU should have no clinical 
responsibilities outside the neonatal and maternity services. 
Local Neonatal Units (LNUs) provide neonatal care for their own catchment 
population, except for the sickest babies. They provide all categories of neonatal care, 
but they transfer babies who require complex or longer -term intensive care to a NICU, 
as required. 
LNU’s in South East Coast provide care for; 
• singletons from 27 weeks upwards and birth weight above 800g, 
• multiple births from 28 weeks upwards and birth weight above 800g. 
LNU’s can provide short term ventilation for up to 48 hours. The majority of babies 
over 27 weeks of gestation will usually receive their full care, inc luding short periods 
of intensive care, within their LNU. Babies expected to deliver below 27 weeks 
gestation and/or below 800g should be transferred out in -utero to a NICU for delivery. 
LNUs may receive transfers in from other neonatal services in the Net work; as per 
Network Pathways. 
Although LNUs are able to provide short duration of intensive care, where this is likely 
to continue early contact should be made with the NICU to alert them to the case; in 
order to offer support and planning in case of the need for transfer. 
Special Care Units (SCUs) provide care for babies that do not require intensive care. 
SCU’s in South East Coast Neonatal Network provide care for; 
• Babies of 32weeks upwards with an expected birth weight of above1250g 
Babies expected to deliver below the above criteria should be transferred out in -utero 
for delivery where possible. 
Any baby requiring intensive care post -delivery should be stabilised and transferred 
out to an appropriate centre. 
 
Exception Reporting 
An established proce ss is already in place that is led by the South East Coast 
Operational Delivery Network (ODN) whereby an exception report is completed for all 
births that occur outside the recommended setting according to the neonatal network 
guidance. 
In order to maximi se learning opportunities to prevent future occurrence of babies born 
outside the recommended care setting, each case should be reviewed by a 
multidisciplinary team soon after occurrence. 

13 
 
Review Team 
The review team should have representation from each of the following: 
• Consultant Obstetrician 
• Consultant Neonatologist/Paediatrician with specialist neonatal knowledge 
• Midwife 
• Neonatal Nurse 
The review may be undertaken within an already established MDT meeting such as a 
Perinatal Mortality & Morbidity meeting. 
On-line representation from obstetric and/or neonatal team members from the Level 3 
unit may be helpful in maximising learning opportunities. 
 
Trust process 
• When a baby meets the criteria for an exception report to be completed, a Datix 
should be generated from within the relevant Trust within 48 hours of the baby 
being born. 
• An exception report should be completed within 7 days by an obstetric 
consultant and forwarded to the Maternity Governance Lead for inclusion at the 
next designate d forum for case review and discussion. There is a proforma for 
reporting: Exception report for births in the wrong place (South East Coast 
ODN). A copy of which can be seen in appendix 4 of this document. 
• Following the MDT review, the finalised and comple ted exception report should 
be sent to the ODN and LMS. 
• A summary of the case review and learning should be shared at the next LMS 
Quality & Safety Forum. The LMS Safety Lead will contact each Trust ahead of 
the forum to ascertain whether there are any ca ses to be presented. 
• Learning from each case will be shared by the LMS with the ODN at the next 
ODN Governance Meeting.
