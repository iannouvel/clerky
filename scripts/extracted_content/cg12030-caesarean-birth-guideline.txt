 Caesarean Section (CS) Birth Guideline 
 
1.0 Aim 
 
To provide evidence -based guidance on the management of pregnant women and people 
who require caesarean birth (CS) and ensure care of women experiencing CS is safe, 
consistent and of high quality. 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This guideline applies to: 
 
• Midwives 
• Obstetricians 
• Anaesthetists 
• Maternity recovery staff 
• Operating Department Practitioners 
• Maternity Assistants 
 
3.0 Responsibilities 
 
A guideline is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. 
Professional judgement may be use in the application of a guideline . 
 
Midwives & obstetricians: 
• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. 
• To use their professional judgement in application of this guideline. 
 
Management: 
• To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations. 
• To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. 
 
4.0 Introduction 
 
At UH Sussex West between 2018 and 2019, 32.4% of births were undertaken by caesarean 
section (CS). In the UK for June 2020 29% of pregnant women and people had a CS (13% 
had an elective CS and 16% had an emergency CS) (Maternity Services Monthly Statistics 
June 2020 – NHS Digital ). The indications for the procedure vary. 
 
This guideline has been developed to help ensure consistency and quality of care 
experienced by women and people in these groups: 
 
• Pregnant women and people who have a clinical indication for a CS. 
• Pregnant women and people who are considering a CS in the absence of a clinical 
indication. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 7 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 The purpose of this guideline is to enable clinicians to give appropriate, research -based 
advice to women and people and their families. This will enable the woman and people to 
make properly informed decisions about their care.

5.0 Classification of urgency of caesarean birth 
 
The following classifications should be used to describe the urgency of caesarean births 
undertaken within this Trust. 
 
Category Definition Decision to delivery 
interval 
 
Category 1 Involves an immediate threat 
to the life of the mother and 
person and/or fetus 
Within 30 minutes 
 
Category 2 Maternal and birthing parent or 
fetal compromise which is not 
immediately life-threatening 
Within 75 minutes 
 
Category 3 No maternal and birthing 
parent or fetal compromise but 
requires early birth No maternal and birthing 
parent or fetal compromise 
but needs early birth 
 
Category 4 
Elective Delivery timed to suit woman 
and person and service 
provision 
 
Perform Category 1 and 2 caesarean births as quickly as possible after making the decision 
(particularly for Category 1); taking into account the condition of the woman and person and 
the unborn baby when making decisions about rapid delivery. 
 
6.0 Planned caesarean birth 
 
• Caesarean birth should be recommended only when delivery confers benefit to the 
woman and person or baby. 
• The indication should be clearly documented in the notes with all the factors that 
influence the decision documented, and which of these is the most influential. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 8 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • Women and people who have had one or more previous CS should be counselled 
regarding birth options. (See CG1152 Birth after Caesarean Section (BAC) 
Guideline ) 
 
6.1 Planned CS is recommended in the following situations: 
 
• A term singleton breech (if ECV contraindicated or unsuccessful). 
• A twin pregnancy with the first twin breech. 
• Primary genital herpes in third trimester. 
• Placenta praevia, where placenta partly or completely covers the internal cervical 
os (minor or major). 
• Previous upper uterine segment CS or hysterotomy. 
• HIV who are not receiving any retroviral therapy. 
• HIV and a viral load equal to or greater than 400 copies per ml at 36 weeks 
regardless of anti -retroviral therapy. 
• HIV and taking zidovudine monotherapy. 
• Pregnant women and people who are co -infected with Hepatitis C virus and HIV 
should be offered planned CS because it reduces mother and birth parent -to-child 
transmission of both Hepatitis C virus and HIV. 
 
This list is not exhaustive, and CS may be indicated for complex or rare conditions. 
 
6.2 Planned CS should not be routinely offered to pregnant women and people 
with: 
 
• 1 previous CS 
• Preterm labour 
• Twin pregnancy (first twin cephalic at term) 
• A ‘small for gestational age’ baby 
• Hepatitis B 
• Hepatitis C 
• Recurrent genital herpes at term 
• BMI >50 (with no other risk factors) 
 
Ideally, pregnant women and people who may require a planned caesarean birth should 
have consultant involvement in the decision -making. 
 
Discuss the risks and benefits of CS and vaginal birth with the woman and person, taking 
into account their circumstances, concerns, priorities and plans for future pregnancies 
(including the risks of placental problems with multiple CS) See Appendix 1 . 
 
A pregnant woman and person is entitled to decline the offer of treatment such as CS, 
even when the treatment would clearly benefit their or their baby's health. Declining an 
offer of treatment needs to be one of the woman and person's options. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 9 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 Women and people with HIV positive pregnancy should not routinely be offered a 
planned CS if: 
 
• They are on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) with a viral load of less 
than 400 copies per ml at 36 weeks or 
• Or they are on any anti-retroviral therapy with a viral load of less than 50 copies 
per ml. 
 
Inform women and people that in these circumstances the risk of HIV transmission is the 
same for a CS and a vaginal birth. 
 
Inform women and people on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) with a viral load of 50–400 copies 
per ml that there is insufficient evidence that a CS prevents mother -to-child transmission of 
HIV. Take into account the actual viral load, the trajectory of the viral load, length of time on 
treatment, adherence issues, obstetric factors and the woman and person’s views in 
considering planned caesarean birth or vaginal birth. 
 
For further guidance on delivery management of women and people with HIV, see CG1199 
Management of infectious diseases . 
 
7.0 Morbidly adherent placenta 
 
The highest risk factors for the development of a morbidly adherent placenta (including 
placenta accreta, placenta increta and placenta percreta) are placenta praevia and previous 
Caesarean section (or uterine surgery). The risk in the presence of both of these risk factors 
is around 5 -10%. 
 
Placenta accreta should be suspected in any pregnant woman and person with an anterior 
placenta praevia and a previous caesarean section. 
 
For antenatal screening, antenatal management, and additional caesarean birth 
recommendations see CG12004 APH & Intrapartum Haemorrhage . 
 
8.0. Elective caesarean birth: enhanced recovery programme 
 
Since 2016, all women and people undergoing an elective caesarean birth are offered a 
programme of enhanced recovery (ERP). 
 
“The underlying principle is to enable patients to recover from surgery and leave hospital 
sooner by minimising the stress responses on the body during surgery." (Department of 
Health, 2010). 
 
Benefits: 
• Improved patient experience and increased confidence in organisation. 
• Improved clinical outcomes and multi -disciplinary team working. 
• Reduction in length of stay. 
• Less in hospital acquired infections. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 10 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 
The key principles are that the woman and person is in the best possible condition for 
surgery, the woman and person has the best possible management during and after their 
operation and they experiences the best post -operative rehabilitation as detailed below: 
 
When to start ERP 
 
• Commence the pathway at the time the decision is made for an elective caesarean 
birth and the date is booked. 
• Signpost the woman and person to the RCOG online patient information: 
Considering a caesarean birth patient information leaflet | RCOG 
• All women and people who are booked for an elective caesarean birth are eligible to 
commence on the ERP. However it may be that they are not suitable to complete all 
parts of the pathway or need to come off the pathway all together. 
 
It is important to note that for a variety of reasons women and people may not feel ready to 
go home on day 1. If they have met the ERP criteria they can be medically discharged, but 
no woman and person should feel that they is being rushed to leave before they are ready. 
This should be discussed on an individual basis. 
9.0. Maternal and birthing parent request for CS 
 
• Maternal and birthing parent request is not on its own an indication for CS 
(Appendix 5 ). 
• Pregnant women and people who request a caesarean birth (when there is no 
clinical indication) should have a documented discussion with a member of the 
maternity team about the overall risks and benefits of a caesarean birth compared 
with vaginal birth ( Appendix 1 ). 
• Explore, discuss and record specific reasons for the request. 
• Where there is anxiety about childbirth - offer referral to a healthcare professional 
with expertise in providing perinatal mental health support. 
• For women and people requesting a CS and considering vaginal birth as still not 
acceptable; after discussion and offer of support, a planned CS should be offered. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 11 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • CS for maternal and birthing parent request must be booked by a Consultant 
Obstetrician. 
• The clinician can decline a request for CS, but should offer referral for second 
opinion. 
 
10.0 Timing of planned CS & corticosteroids 
 
The risk of respiratory morbidity is increased in babies born by CS before labour, but this risk 
decreases significantly after 39 weeks. Therefore, planned CS should not routinely be carried 
out before 39 weeks. 
 
For women and people undergoing planned caesarean birth between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks 
an informed discussion should take place with the woman and person (and their family 
members or carers as appropriate) about the potential risks and benefits of a course of 
antenatal corticosteroids and also the potential risks and benefits of birth before 39 weeks. 
This should be fully documented on MIS. Women and people may be offered further 
monitoring to provide reassurance if appropriate. 
 
Although antenatal corticosteroids may reduce admission to the special care baby unit 
(SCBU) for respiratory morbidity, it is uncertain if there is any reduction in RDS, transient 
tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) or SCBU admission overall, and antenatal corticosteroids 
may result in harm to the neonate which includes hypoglycaemia and potential 
developmental delay (see appendix14 ). RCOG (2022) 
 
11.0 Antenatal preoperative assessment 
 
This should usually be done in the Antenatal Clinic. 
 
• Document the discussion and the indication for CS and that the decision has been 
discussed with a Consultant/Associate Specialist. 
• Book a date (after 39 weeks unless otherwise indicated), by phoning Labour Ward. 
• If the woman and person has had a previous CS, document awareness of the 
placental site (from most recent ultrasound scan). If the placenta is anterior and 
low the women and people should be referred for further imaging to assess the risk 
of placenta accreta. 
• Complete the consent form in the clinic documenting discussion on risks to inform 
the woman and person's decision, ensuring that they are offered a copy (consent 
must be reconfirmed on the day of operation by the operating surgeon). 
(See Appendix 1 for risks and benefits). 
• Blood for FBC (can be taken at or after 36 weeks) and G&S (within 72 hours of 
ELCS). 
• Prescribe antacid prophylaxis. 
• Consider use of pro-kinetic drug e.g. Metoclopramide. 
• Book anaesthetic appointments if any concerns and check that appropriate early 
referral is made. 
• Ensure patient is directed to online maternity information Considering a caesarean 
birth patient information leaflet | RCOG CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 12 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 11.1 For healthy women and people with an uncomplicated pregnancy do not 
routinely offer: 
 
• Cross -matching of blood. 
• Clotting screen. 
• Preoperative ultrasound to localise the placenta. 
 
Note: High risk women and people for planned CS should have a Group and Save (G&S) or 
cross -match, taken within 72 hours of the planned surgery, as clinically indicated. 

12.0 On admission 
 
• All women and people who attend for an elective Caesarean should have maternal 
and birthing parent observations, routine enquiry about fetal movements and 
auscultation of the fetal heart performed within an hour of admission. Further 
observations/FH monitoring should be performed in a timeframe agreed with the 
obstetric team depending on reasons for surgery. 
• Welcome and admit to Labour Ward. 
• Ensure patient identification applied. 
• Notes and consent checked by midwife and operating obstetrician. 
• If indication is malpresentation, confirm presentation by ultrasound. 
o If presentation is found to be cephalic, check that malpresentation is the 
only indication for CS, discuss findings with the woman and person and 
cancel if appropriate. 
• Complete theatre checklist and pressure ulcer risk assessment on MIS. 
• Anaesthetist to review. 
• Insert cannula using aseptic non-touch technique and take blood for FBC, U&Es 
and group & save if not already taken at pre -operative assessment. 
• Insert urinary catheter after anaesthetic to prevent over distension of the bladder 
because the anaesthetic block interferes with normal bladder function. 
• Fluid balance monitoring should be commenced post catheter insertion and 
completed both during the caesarean section and post operatively. (See CG21009 
Maternity fluid management as an in patient or in labour ). 
 
13.0 Unplanned CS 
 
• The consultant obstetrician/associate specialist must be involved in the decision 
for emergency CS and the discussion documented clearly on MIS. 
• In the case of a Category 1 CS for severe fetal or maternal compromise, the 
Consultant should be informed as soon as possible ( Appendix 2 ). 
• All the factors that influence the decision should be documented, and which of 
these is the most influential. 
• If the CS is for an abnormal CTG, a fetal blood sample should be considered, and 
if this is not done, the reason documented. 
• Pelvimetry, maternal and birthing parent height, estimations of fetal size 
(ultrasound or clinical examination) do not accurately predict cephalopelvic 
disproportion and should not be used to predict ‘failure to progress’ during labour. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 13 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • The reason for performing caesarean births which are classified 1 (within 30 mins) 
or 2 (within 75 mins) must be recorded by the obstetrician making the decision, 
along with the time of decision and birth. Remember that rapid delivery may be 
harmful in certain circumstances. For instance a Category 1 CS is not always 
achievable in cases of raised BMI or maternal co -morbidity due to issues of 
maternal and birthing parent safety. If there is delay for any reason; this must be 
documented on MIS. 
• If IV access not already obtained, cannulate with consent and take bloods for FBC, 
U&Es and G&S. 
• Paired cord blood sampling should be taken at CS for suspected fetal compromise. 
• An appropriately trained paediatrician should be present in theatre for CS 
performed under GA or where there is evidence of fetal compromise. 
• Risk assess for impacted fetal head (see appendix 10). 

13.1 Category 1 CS 
 
• Decision to birth time should be within 30 minutes. 
• Dial 2222 and state ‘Cat 1 Caesarean Section’ . 
• Verbal consent may be adequate depending on the urgency of the situation. 
• Transfer immediately to theatre. 
• Liaise with Anaesthetist regarding mode of anaesthesia. 
• Give appropriate preoperative antacids/pro -kinetics. 
• Administer facial oxygen and ensure left lateral tilt. 
• Complete Theatre Checklist and CAT 1 essential questions (in red) on WHO 
Surgical Safety checklist. (See appendix 9 ) 
• Catheterise in theatre. 
 
14.0 Theatre procedure for all CS 
 
• Give antiemetic as per Trust policy. 
• Use prophylactic vasopressors either by infusion (NICE recommended) or as 
multiple bolus doses to keep maternal and birthing parent blood pressure at >90% 
of baseline and avoid decreases of <80% baseline. Monitor the NIBP at least 
every 2 minutes. 
• When using an alpha -agonist vasopressor, a bradycardia may occur. Give 
intravenous ephedrine boluses to manage hypotension during caesarean birth if 
the heart rate is low and blood pressure is less than 90% of baseline, or 
glycopyrrolate. 
• Use intravenous crystalloid co-loading in addition to vasopressors to reduce the 
risk of hypotension occurring during caesarean birth. 
• Include pre-oxygenation, cricoid pressure and rapid sequence induction in general 
anaesthesia for caesarean birth to reduce the risk of aspiration. 
• Use a fluid warming device with all obstetric theatre cases. NICE 
recommendations are that > 500ml of fluid should be warmed and all blood 
products should be administered warmed. 
• Consider forced air warming for women and people who shiver, feel cold, or have 
a temperature of less than 36°degrees Celsius during caesarean birth. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 14 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • Women and people who are having a CS should be offered regional anaesthesia 
because it is safer and results in less maternal and birthing parent and neonatal 
morbidity than general anaesthesia. However, women and people who have 
additional risk factors, such as a diagnosis of placenta praevia, will have an 
individualised plan discussed with them and recommendations made. 
• Offer women and people diamorphine (0.3 to 0.4 mg intrathecally) for analgesia to 
reduce the need for supplemental analgesia after a caesarean birth. Epidural 
diamorphine (2.5 to 5 mg) is a suitable alternative where intrathecal diamorphine 
has not been given. Preservative Free Morphine (PFM) in combination with 
fentanyl may be used as an alternative if diamorphine is unavailable. There may 
be more itching and nausea with PFM. (See Appendix 7 ) 
• Clean the surgical site using appropriate skin preparation. 
• Consider the use of intra-operative cell salvage; if there is risk of haemorrhage e.g. 
placenta praevia/accreta, multiple pregnancy, anticoagulant therapy or other risk 
factors for haemorrhage in an elective CS. Use IOCS for all emergency CS. (See 
appendix 1 of CG12029 PPH guideline v5.3 for risk factors). 
• A single birth companion may accompany a woman having a CS under regional 
anaesthesia. 
• If a general anaesthetic is required, the birth companion will be asked to leave the 
theatre before induction of anaesthesia. 
• For emergency CS performed outside of obstetric theatres – see Appendix 3 for 
required equipment and personnel. 
 
14.1 Theatre documentation 
 
• Complete pre-operative checklist on MIS. 
• Ensure all sections of the Maternity ‘WHO’ surgical safety checklist are completed 
in theatre at the appropriate times, and the final checks before the woman and 
person leaves theatre. 
 
It is the responsibility of the operating surgeon to ensure this documentation is complete. 
 
15.0 Prophylactic antibiotics 
 
Women and people should be offered Intravenous (IV) prophylactic antibiotics and be 
informed that: 
• Endometritis, urinary tract and wound infections occur in about 8% of women and 
people who have had a caesarean birth. 
• IV antibiotics given before skin incision, reduces the risk of this more than 
prophylactic antibiotics given after skin incision. 
• All IV antibiotics may be given before knife -to-skin (KTS) and are considered safe 
except Augmentin which is given after delivery as it may have an effect on the 
baby. 
 
Peak tissue levels are 30-60 minutes after administration therefore if surgery is delayed for 
more than 3 hours after administration; give another full dose of the IV antibiotics. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 15 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 The responsibility for administering prophylactic antibiotics rests with the anaesthetist, as 
with other surgical procedures. 
 
• For Category 2, 3 and 4 CS administer IV Cefuroxime 1.5g and Metronidazole 
500mgs before skin incision. 
• For Category 1 CS, administer prophylactic antibiotics as above; whenever it is 
safe to do so. 
 
Refer to the Trust Adult Antimicrobial Guide . If MRSA positive, contact on call microbiologist 
for advice with regard to prophylactic antibiotics. 

16.0 Surgical techniques 
 
For uncomplicated CS at term: 
 
16.1 Advised surgical techniques: 
 
• The operating table for CS should have a lateral tilt of 15°. 
• Use a transverse lower abdominal incision. 
• Subsequent tissue layers are opened bluntly and, if necessary, extended with 
scissors and not a knife. 
• Use blunt extension of the uterine incision. 
• Rupture the membranes and deliver the baby avoid lifting the baby high up in the 
‘lion king’ pose and provide skin to skin if baby does not require resuscitation (see 
optimal cord clamping in skin to skin guidance). 
• Use controlled cord traction for removal of the placenta. 
• Close the uterine incision with two suture layers. 
• Check haemostasis. 
• Close sheath with 1/0 braided absorbable suture (currently Polysorb). 
• Use sutures rather than staples to close the skin after caesarean section to reduce 
the risk of superficial wound dehiscence. 
• Close the skin incision with a monofilament absorbable subcuticular suture. 
• Use single layer or double layer uterine closure in caesarean birth, depending on 
the clinical circumstances. Note that single layer closure does not increase the risk 
of postoperative bleeding or uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy. 
• In the rare circumstances that a midline abdominal incision is used at CS, mass 
closure with slowly absorbable continuous sutures should be used because this 
results in fewer incisional hernias and less dehiscence than layered closure. 
• Consider need for PICO dressing (see appendix 6). 
• Check umbilical artery and vein pH if CS performed for fetal compromise. 
• Consider women and person’s preferences for birth (e.g. music playing in theatre) 
along with any other birth preferences that will influence the environment. 
• Facilitate early skin-to-skin contact for mother and birthing parent and baby. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 16 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 16.2 Surgical techniques not advised routinely 
 
• Close subcutaneous space (unless >2cm of fat). 
• Use superficial wound drains. 
• Use separate surgical knives for skin and deeper tissues. 
• Use forceps to deliver baby’s head. 
• Suture either the visceral or parietal peritoneum. 
• Exteriorise the uterus. 
• Manually remove the placenta. 
 
The effects of different suture material or methods of skin closure are uncertain. 
 
17.0 Consultant presence at CS 
 
17.1 Consultants are required to attend all CS for: 
 
• Major placenta praevia. 
• Placenta accreta. 
• Women and people who decline blood products. 
• Uterine rupture. 

17.2 Other indications: 
 
The Consultant will decide whether to attend, depending on the complexity of the case and 
the experience of the registrar on duty. However, the consultant is required to attend if 
requested by any member of staff. 
 
17.3 Cases where consultant presence may be indicated include: 
 
• Delivery at less than 34 weeks. 
• Previous complicated abdominal surgery or multiple procedures. 
• Transverse lie. 
• Maternal and birthing parent medical complications. 
• BMI >40. 
• Large or multiple uterine fibroids. 
• Caesarean section at full dilatation due to the risk of head impaction and causing 
fetal injury during disimpaction if not experienced in this procedure. (See appendix 
10: Impacted Fetal Head ) 
• Please see appendix 12 for a more comprehensive list for consultant attendance. 
 
17.4 Prevention of post partum haemorrhage (PPH) 
 
All women and people undergoing caesarean birth are recommended to have Carbetocin 
instead of oxytocin for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony. 
Please see Carbetocin to prevent PPH at CS UHS -CG-0009 -2023 for administration, 
contraindications and cautions. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 17 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • Carbetocin is recommend for routine administration immediately after delivery of 
the baby during caesarean birth to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Carbetocin is 
a longer -acting analogue of oxytocin, with a similar mechanism of action and 
adverse effects profile. 
• The increased duration of action of Carbetocin compared with oxytocin eliminates 
the requirement for an infusion after the initial dose making it the preferred first-line 
drug for routine administration immediately after birth. 
• If Carbetocin does not provide adequate uterine tone, a second -line drug should 
be considered early. A second line agent should be guided by clinical context and 
presence of contraindications, for example Ergometrine, Misoprostal, Carboprost 
as per CG12029 PPH guideline . 
 
18.0 Postoperative care 
 
18.1. Immediate recovery care following CS 
 
• After CS, women and people should be observed on a one-to-one basis. 
• If the CS was under a general anaesthetic, a healthcare professional with airway 
skills should carry out continuous, one -to-one observation of the woman and 
person until they have regained airway control, and are haemodynamically stable, 
and able to communicate. 
• See the Maternity guideline for CG11103 Recovery post regiona and GA 
anaesthesia for required observations and Appendix 4 (for summary). 
• Use Maternity MEOWS and fluid monitoring form on MIS to document 
observations and fluid balance. Observations outside of normal parameters should 
be escalated to the appropriate personnel as per MEOWS score. 
• Be aware that although it is rare for women and people to need intensive care 
following childbirth, this occurs more frequently after CS (about 9 per 1000). 

18.2. Further care of the woman and person and baby immediately after CS 
 
• Encourage skin to skin contact as soon as reasonably possible. This should be 
uninterrupted for as long as the mother wishes, until after the first feed or at least 
for an hour. See CG20015 Parent -to-baby skin ontact guideline 
• Provide additional support to help the woman and person to feed and care for their 
baby. 
• Breastfeeding - Lactogenesis 2 can be delayed by caesarean birth so proactive 
measures should be made that include: 
o Aim to breastfeed within first hour, if this is not possible hand express to 
stimulate lactation. 
o Hand express after each feed to continue to stimulate milk supply. Store any 
colostrum collected for use later if required. 
o Frequent safe skin to skin contact. 
o Bring baby to the breast as often as possible and feed regularly to encourage 
abundant milk supply. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 18 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 o Baby driven positions that support attachment (laid back swing nursing 
position) which involves limited positioning of the mother and birthing parent. 
Alternatively side lying position or rugby position work well too. 
o Offer both breasts at each feed allow baby to feed for as long as it likes. 
o Adequate pain relief to adopt feeding positions and responsiveness to 
feeding cues (alongside staff responding to call bells to support lifting of 
baby). 
o Avoid unnecessary supplementations due to the effect on milk supply. If 
above is supported there should be no ongoing concerns. 
 
Babies born by CS are more likely to have a lower temperature, and thermal care should be 
in accordance with good practice for thermal care of the newborn baby, this includes skin to 
skin with the mother and birthing parent. 
 
18.3. Risk of thromboembolic disease 
 
Women and people who have had a caesarean birth may be at increased risk of 
thromboembolic disease (both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). The VTE 
risk assessment should be performed on admission, and post-birth with prophylaxis offered 
according to risk. 
 
• Any woman and person who has undergone spinal anaesthesia will have a yellow 
wristband attached by the anaesthetist. The midwife should assess the woman 
and person for straight leg rise after 4 hours (see appendix 11 ). If able to straight 
leg rise (SLR), yellow wristband can be removed. If unable to SLR, notify the 
anaesthetist and leave yellow wristband in place. Dalteparin should only be 
given once the regional anaesthetic block has resolved and the woman and 
person is able to straight leg raise (SLR). 
• Re-assess and document the VTE score and give dalteparin in accordance with 
CG1153 Obstetric VTE and aim to start, or resume, 6 hours post operatively 
unless there are specific contraindications. 
• LMWH should not be given for 4 hours after use of spinal anaesthesia or after the 
epidural catheter has been removed. 
• Ensure the woman and person is reweighed post birth, before starting or 
recommencing VTE prophylaxis, to ensure correct dose is prescribed. 
 
Postnatally pay particular attention to respiratory symptoms (such as cough or shortness of 
breath) or leg symptoms (such as painful swollen calf), and seek obstetric review if these 
symptoms occur postnatally. See CG1153 Obstetric VTE and Trust Venous 
Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention Policy for further guidance. 
 
18.4. Analgesia 
 
Discuss options for pain relief after caesarean birth with women and people and explain that: 
 
• Pain after caesarean birth can be controlled using oral or injectable medicines and 
will depend on the severity of pain, whether they had spinal or epidural 
anaesthesia, or general anaesthesia. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 19 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • Reassure if they wish to breastfeed, they will usually be able to do this and care for 
their baby while taking pain relief medicines. The anaesthetist will discuss with the 
woman and person if they are offering medication that may affect breastfeeding 
and the baby, such as tramadol, oxycodone or very large doses of opioids. 
 
Immediate post CS analgesia: 
 
• Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) blocks should be considered as a part of 
post-operative multimodal pain management for CS, especially when the CS has 
been performed under general anaesthesia. Morphine oral solution: prescribe 
20mg PRN 2 hourly while in hospital. 
• A diclofenac suppository 100mg can be inserted PR post operatively in theatre 
with consent gained prior to the caesarean birth. 
 
Regular post CS analgesia: 
 
• A combination of paracetamol and, unless contraindicated, a non -steroidal anti - 
inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen will reduce opioid requirements. The maximum 
dose of Ibuprofen is 600mg TDS which should be given with daily omeprazole on 
this dose. (The dose of Ibuprofen will be reduced to 400mg TDS on discharge from 
hospital.) 
• If there is any concern about dehydration or renal function whilst on the higher 
dose of ibuprofen, give IV fluids or stop the NSAIDS. If there is any concern about 
gastric irritation increase the dose of Omeprazole to 40mg or stop the NSAIDS. 
• Offer PRN morphine oral solution and PRN antiemetic to women and people who 
have received spinal or epidural anaesthesia for caesarean birth. The dose of 
Morphine oral solution is 10 -20mg 2 hourlyPRN and Ondansetron every 8 hours 
PRN. It is recommended that senna or macrogol are offered daily whilst taking 
opioids to prevent constipation. 
• Encourage the woman and person to take paracetamol and NSAID regularly and 
not just when needed for pain relief. 
• Consider prescribing a second line anti-emetic, like cyclizine for women and 
people taking opioids, if needed for nausea and vomiting. 
• Advise women and people that some over-the-counter medicines contain codeine, 
and should not be taken while breastfeeding because this can lead to serious 
neonatal sedation and respiratory depression. 
 
Discharge medication: 
• Following caesarean section, women and people will be advised to take 
paracetamol, ibuprofen (400mg TDS), senna. 
• Ideally both ibuprofen and paracetamol should be provided by the woman and 
person, although a supply from ward TTO stock can be supplied if necessary. 
• If being discharged before day 3, morphine oral solution should also be considered 
to support an earlier discharge and enhanced recovery. If prescribing morphine 
oral solution on discharge prescribe the smallest effective dose, there must 
be 4 hours between dosages and state max number of dosages per day for 
limit of 3 days post birth. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 20 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 • If a woman and person is discharged home on opioids, advise them to contact 
their healthcare provider if they are concerned about their baby (for example 
drowsiness, breathing difficulties, constipation or difficulty feeding). 
 
For women and people with severe pain after caesarean birth, when other pain relief is 
not sufficient: 
 
• Perform a full assessment to exclude other causes for the pain (for example, 
sepsis, haemorrhage including haematomas, urinary retention). 
• Consider Pain Team review for those whose pain is not managed with regular 
routine analgesia. 
• Ensure the woman and person’s pain control is optimised then discuss with the 
woman and person that alternative pain relief medicines are available. If the 
woman and person chooses, to try alternative opioids consider a short course of 
tramadol or oxycodone at the lowest effective dose. 
• Make sure the woman and person is aware that, if taken while breastfeeding, 
these medicines could increase the risk of neonatal sedation and respiratory 
depression. 
• In breastfeeding women and people, use opioid analgesics at the lowest effective 
dose and for the shortest duration, and not for more than 3 days after date of birth 
of the baby. (Refer to CG1127 Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) for further 
information.) 
 
18.5. Wound care 
 
• Any pressure dressing should be removed prior to transfer to the Postnatal Ward. 
• If PICO dressing present follow Appendix 6. 
• Remove the wound dressing after 6 - 24 hours. There is no difference in the risk of 
wound infection when dressings are removed 6 hours postoperatively, compared 
with 24 hours postoperatively. 
• If the wound is leaking a clean dressing should be applied. 
• Monitor the woman and person for signs of infection (fever, increasing pain, 
redness or discharge) or dehiscence. 
• If any concerns, liaise with the Infection Control and/or Tissue Viability nurses at 
the earliest opportunity. 
• Encourage women and people to keep wound clean and dry (daily showering) and 
wear loose comfortable clothing and cotton underwear. 
• If used, there should be a plan documented for the removal of clips/staples and 
any non -dissolvable sutures. 
 
18.6. Oral fluids and diet 
 
• Women and people who are feeling well and have no complications, can eat and 
drink when they feel hungry or thirsty (start with sips of clear fluid; wait for a 
minimum of 2 hours before light diet). 
• All women and people should remain on water only until discharge from recovery 
criteria is met. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 21 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 18.7. Removal of urinary catheter 
 
See ‘Bladder Care for Maternity Patients Guideline (Including Management of Urinary 
Retention )’. 
 
• Removal of the urinary catheter should be carried out once the woman and person 
is mobile after a regional anaesthetic for caesarean birth, but no sooner than 
12 hours after the last 'top-up' dose. 
• If cannula has not already been removed, removal should be considered at this 
time. 
• The recommended time is between 12 and 24 hours. 
 
If urinary symptoms present consider the possible diagnosis of: 
 
• Urinary tract infection. 
• Stress incontinence (occurs in about 4% of women and people after CS). 
• Urinary tract injury (occurs in about 1 per 1000 CS). 
• Urinary retention. 
 
18.8. Suspected ureteric injury 
 
If ureteric injury is suspected a CT (computed tomography) urogram should be requested 
within 24 hours (at the weekend discuss case with the on -call Consultant Radiologist to 
arrange). ( ToG 2016 :18:265 -72) 
 
Breastfeeding can continue following the contrast. 
 
18.9. Pregnancy and childbirth advice following CS 
 
Discuss the reasons for the caesarean birth and provide both verbal and written information 
about birth options for any future pregnancies, and document this on MIS. If the 
woman/person prefers, provide this at a later date. 
 
When advising about the mode of birth following CS consider maternal and birthing parent 
preferences and priorities, the risks and benefits of repeat CS and the risks and benefits of 
planned vaginal birth, including the risk of unplanned CS. 
 
18.10. Discharge and follow up 
 
• Average length of stay is likely to be longer after CS compared with vaginal birth. 
• Offer early discharge (after 24 hours) and home follow up to women and people 
who are recovering, apyrexial and have no complications. 
• In the event of heavy and/or irregular vaginal bleeding following CS, healthcare 
professionals should consider that this is more likely to be due to endometritis than 
retained products of conception. 
• Women and people who have undergone a Category 1 CS should be offered 
postnatal follow up in the Consultant clinic at around 6 weeks. Plans for CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 22 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 subsequent pregnancies should be discussed and documented at this time if not 
previously occurred. 
• Discuss Birth Afterthoughts service if appropriate. 
• Women/ people who have had a dural tap, failed spinal/epidural, general 
anaesthetic with awareness or difficult anaesthetic experience should be referred 
to anaesthetic obstetric clinic. This should also be noted in their discharge 
summary by the obstetric team and in a letter to their GP. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 23 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 19.0 Audit 
 
CS Rate is monitored via clinical dashboard and Category 1 CS are monitored via patient 
safety. 
 
Suggested audit standards: 
 
• Documented evidence of informed consent including discussion regarding risks 
and benefits of CS. 
• Use the following decision -to-birth intervals to measure the overall performance of 
an obstetric unit: 
o 30 minutes for category 1 CS 
o Both 30 and 75 minutes for category 2 CS. 
• Pregnant women and person who have had 1 or more previous caesarean births 
have a documented discussion of the option to plan a vaginal birth. 
• Pregnant women and person who request a caesarean birth (when there is no 
clinical indication) have a documented discussion with members of the maternity 
team about the overall risks and benefits of a caesarean birth compared with 
vaginal birth. 
• Pregnant women and people who request a caesarean birth because of anxiety 
about childbirth are offered a referral to a healthcare professional with expertise in 
perinatal mental health support. 
• Pregnant women and people who may require a planned caesarean birth have 
consultant involvement in decision -making. 
• Pregnant women and people having a planned caesarean birth have the 
procedure carried out at or after 39 weeks 0 days, unless an earlier delivery is 
necessary because of maternal WHO Surgical Safety Checklist birthing parent or 
fetal indications. 
• Women and people being considered for an unplanned caesarean birth have a 
consultant obstetrician involved in the decision. 
• Women and people in labour for whom a caesarean birth is being considered for 
suspected fetal compromise are offered fetal blood sampling to inform decision - 
making. 
• Women and people who have had a caesarean birth are offered a discussion and 
are given written information about the reasons for their caesarean birth and birth 
options for future pregnancies. 
• Women and people who have had a caesarean birth are monitored for 
postoperative complications. CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 24 of 41

 Appendix 1: Risks of planned CS v vaginal birth 
 
Discuss the benefits and risks of both caesarean and vaginal birth with women and people, 
taking into account their circumstances, concerns, priorities and plans for future 
pregnancies. 
• There are benefits and risks associated with both vaginal and caesarean birth, 
some of which are very small absolute risks and some are greater absolute risks, 
and the pregnant woman and person will need to decide which risks are more (or 
less) acceptable to them. 
• There are other risks not included in these tables that might be relevant to their 
individual circumstances (for example placental adherence problems from multiple 
caesarean births, fetal lacerations in caesarean birth, term birth injuries with 
vaginal birth or caesarean birth). 
Further detail on calculated risk can be found at: NICE NG192 Caesarean Birth (2021)

 Appendix 4: Required observations following caesarean birth 
 
As a minimum the following observations should be recorded every 5 minutes for the first 15 
minutes, and recorded on the Maternity Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) on MIS. 
The MEOWS score instructions should be followed for abnormal observations ( CG1148 
Recognition and management of severely ill pregnant women ) 
 
• Level of consciousness (using AVPU as per MEOWS score). 
• Heart rate. 
• Blood pressure. 
• Respiratory rate. 
• Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. 
• Verbal pain. 
• Vaginal bleeding. 
• Overall appearance (well or unwell). 
• Evidence block height and motor block resolving. (see appendix 11) 
 
These observations, if stable should then be recorded ½ hourly for 1 hour . Following this, 
hourly observations should continue until the pre-discharge from recovery checklist criteria 
on MIS is met, before commencing 4 hourly observations. If not stable, perform observations 
more frequently and seek medical review. 
 
This pre-discharge checklist must be fully completed including date and time of assessment 
prior to discharge to the Postnatal Ward. 
 
The following observations should be closely monitored and documented: 
 
• Nausea/vomiting. 
• Wound -bleeding from operation site, wound drains. 
• Uterine fundus. 
 
Additional observations to be recorded hourly for the first two hours 
 
• Urine output – Obstetrician and Anaesthetist should be informed if urinary output falls 
below 30mls per hour on 2 consecutive occasions. 
• Temperature. 
 
These observations, if stable for 2 hours can be reduced to 4 hourly.

PICO incision/wound management pathway for women/people undergoing c -section 
Clearpore dressing 
(Trust standard of post-op 
dressing) 
BMI less than 35 
If Clearpore dressing is heavily 
stained with ooze prior to 
planned removal, refer to 
obstetric team to assess for 
PICO application. 
•Leave dressing in place for 
6-24 hours. 
•Check dressing regularly for 
signs of excessive ooze or 
infection. 
Apply PICO in theatre 
•Apply as per manufacturer’s instructions. 
•Ensure device is operating correctly with a good seal. 
•Write date of application on the back of the PICO pump. 
•Fully complete PICO Patient Selection Form and return to 
the Purple PICO Folder. 
BMI 35 or more 
•Day 6 post CS the pump will expire. Remove PICO Pad and 
dispose of expired pump. 
•Reassess the patient’s incision, if dry and completely 
closed, discontinue PICO. 
•Monitor PICO Pad for the amount of ‘staining’ or ‘strike 
through’. 
•Leave PICO Pad in place until it is completely full or day 6 
post CS – whichever is sooner. 
•If ‘dressing full’ indicator lights up/or the PICO Pad is 
completely full before day 6, refer to ADAU for assessment 
of incision and application of a second PICO Pad. Appendix 6: PICO wound management 
 Appendix 7: Neuraxial Preservative Free Morphine (PFM) 
CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 33 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 

Preservative Free Morphine for Epidural or Intrathecal Use is now available at SRH and WH in line with 
other hospitals within University Sussex Hospitals Trust. 
Special Care: 
Please ensure that ONLY the PRESERVATIVE FREE formulation of MORPHINE (PFM) is used via 
the INTRATHECAL or EPIDURAL routes. 
Safety Features: 
• PFM is only presented as 1mg/ml vials. 
• PFM is only stored in clear/yellow bags in designated neuraxial CD cupboards on Labour Ward 
at SRH & WH. 
• Care when drawing up the PFM as very low volumes are required, discard drawing up needle to 
inject into syringe for neuraxial injection. 
 
Suggested 
Dose of PFM Obstetrics (LSCS) OAA Recommendation 
Intrathecal Dose 0.1 – 0.15 mg 
(100-150 micrograms) Add in Fentanyl 10-20 micrograms 
Epidural Dose 2 mg -3 mg Flush with 2ml N Saline 
 
Standard Intrathecal Dose for LSCS: 100micrograms PFM and 15micrograms Fentanyl with your 
usual dose of bupivacaine 
PFM will remain in the CSF longer when compared with diamorphine or fentanyl but recent publications 
recommend the same monitoring post operatively as for diamorphine but consider the caveats. 
Based on the suggested doses the average duration of analgesia is 18-24 hours and side effects are 
rare. 
Caveats: 
• There is a dose dependent increased risk of delayed respiratory depression and a slightly 
higher incidence of pruritis and nausea/vomiting. 
• Reduce dose/avoid in the elderly, COPD, morbid obesity, sleep apnoea, liver and renal failure. 
• Naloxone should always be prescribed in the postoperative period. 
• Ondansetron is first line for reducing PFM pruritis and consider regular prescription for the 1st 24 
hours post neuraxial PFM. 
Do not prescribe regular opioids for the 1st 24 hours post neuraxial PFM with doses only 
prescribed/ given as required (PRN).

Document and debrief parents and team Appendix 10 (cont): Impacted fetal head (IFH) at Caesarean 
CG12030 Caesarean Birth Guideline v11.3 August 2023 Page 37 of 41 
Please check on the intranet that this printout is the most recent version of this document before use. 
 Working definition is: ‘Caesarean birth requiring additional techniques and/or tocolysis to 
disimpact the fetal head after standard delivery manoeuvres have failed’. 
 
There is no clear national guidance on how to manage this condition which is relatively 
common (PROMPT). 50% occur before full dilatation. 
 
Was considered rare, but NHS resolution early notification scheme identified IFH as a 
contributory factor in 9% of their cases (usually birth trauma/HIE), and Bristol reported IFH 
11% all EMCS and 32% of CS at full dilatation in 2016. 
 
Complications of IFH 
Mother Baby 
Damage to uterus Skull fracture 
Damage to urinary tract Intracranial bleed 
Uterine bleeding and PPH Nerve injury 
Longer hospital stay Hypoxic brain damage 
Hysterectomy Neonatal death 

Risk factors for IFH 
Maternal/perinatal factors Primiparity 
Macrosomia 

Intrapartum factors Full cervical dilatation 
OT/OP malposition 
Mid or low cavity station 
Oxytocin augmentation 
Epidural 
Failed operative vaginal birth 
Operator factors Less experienced obstetricians 
 
There is some evidence that reverse breech/Patwardhan’s reduces maternal/birthing parent 
trauma compared to pushing up, but there is no evidence of difference in fetal trauma. 
 
Limited evidence for use of tocolysis in these cases – GTN 2 puffs under the tongue is 
suggested because immediately available and rapid onset of action. Terbutaline 
250micrograms can be used, but needs to be drawn up and given subcutaneously.

 Situations in which the consultant MUST ATTEND 
In the event of high levels of activity e.g a second theatre being opened, unit closure due to 
high levels of activity requiring obstetrician input. 
Any return to theatre 
Team debrief requested 
If requested to do so 
Early warning score protocol or sepsis screening tool that suggests critical deterioration where 
HDU / ITU care is likely to become necessary. 
Caesarean birth for major placenta praevia / abnormally invasive placenta

 Introduced as per WHO guidance in 2015 and a Cochrane review in 2020. The Cochrane 
review in 2020 showed a reduction in risk of post -caesarean endometritis of around 50% 
(from 7.2% to 3.1%) and evidence of reduction in wound infections and post-operative fever. 
 
Vaginal preparation is to be done for all caesarean sections regardless of categorisation, 
unless it will impact the safety of mother or baby by delaying delivery. 
 
This should be done at the time of catheter insertion, if already catheterised it should be 
done just before prepping the abdomen. 
 
Equipment required: 
 
• Sachet of Tisept (no other solution is appropriate, if Tisept not available, please 
ask coordinator to order from pharmacy). 
• Rampleys sponge holding forceps. 
• Pack of swabs. 
 
Procedure: 
 
• Wrap gaze swab around the end of the Rampleys sponge forceps and soak in 
Tisept. 
• Place into the vagina and clean vagina in a circular motion for around 30 seconds. 
• Count swabs and instruments. Appendix 14: Risk and benefits for corticosteroids
