 1 Antenatal Screening for Hepatitis B 
 
Background to the screening programme is given in Appendix B . 
For Designated programme lead for maternity services and Link speciality staff please see 
Appendix A 
 
1.1 Aims 
 
The NHS Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Screening Programme ensures that all 
pregnant women and people are offered and recommended screening for Hepatitis B 
[Public Health England (PHE) 2018b] 
 
1.2 Objectives 
 
• To ensure that women with hepatitis B are identified early in pregnancy to 
facilitate appropriate assessment and management for their health by an 
appropriate specialist (eg Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and 
Wellbeing) within 6 weeks of the screening test result being received by 
maternity services. 
• To reduce the risk of mother -to-child transmission of hepatitis B 
• To facilitate appropriate neo natal referral and management. [PHE 2018b]
 
1.3 Expected Health Outcomes 
 
Our aim is to reduce the risk of a mother -to-child transmission of hepatitis B and 
safeguard the woman’s own health [ PHE 2018b] 
2 Screening for Hepatitis B in Pregnancy 
 
2.1 Pre-Screening information: enabling informed choice 
 
2.1.1 At the first antenatal contact with the midwife, the woman should be 
given verbal and written information about hepatitis B. This should 
include the benefits of screening for both the woman and her unborn 
baby [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2008, 
PHE 2018b] . 
 
2.1.2 Screening should be offered and recommended. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 7 of 33 
 2.1.3 The trust uses the NHS Screening Programmes information booklet: 
‘Screening tests for you and your baby’. This includes the section 
‘Infectious Diseases’. This leaflet may be sent to the woman or person 
by post prior to the first appointment or given out at the first 
appointment. The midwife must document in the hand held notes that 
the leaflet has been r eceived by the woman or person. 
 
2.1.4 Copies of ‘Screening tests for you and your baby’ are available in some 
other languages and can be downloaded via the Public Health England 
website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening -
tests -for-you-and-your -baby -description -in-brief. If the leaflet is not 
available in the language required from the national website, it is 
possible to ask for the leaflet to be translated via the trust’s Equality 
and Diversity Team. 
 
2.1.5 Interpreting services (including sign language) should be used for 
communicating with parents who are not fluent in English at all s tages 
of the screening pathway. 
 
2.1.6 Where there are specific communication requirements [e.g. English is 
not the woman’s first language, visual/ hearing impairment], 
appropriate interpretation services should be used at booking and all 
subsequent stages in the screening pathway. For further guidance see 
also the trusts Accessible Communications Guidelines via the Equality 
and Diversity team. 
 
2.1.7 If the midwife or doctor feels unable to answer all questions or the 
woman requests further advice/information about any aspect of 
Hepatitis B, then a direct referral can be made to the Specialist Midwife 
for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing for specialist counselling (see 
contact list Appendix A ). 
3 Offering Screening in Pregnancy 
 
3.1 The Eligible Population: All women and people should be offered screening for 
Hepatitis B early in each pregnancy regardless of the results of Hepatitis B 
screening in previous pregnancies [NICE 2008, PHE 2018b, PHE 2019] 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 8 of 33 
 3.2 The midwife or doctor should discuss the reasons why screening for Hepatitis B 
is recommended, the results process and follow -up if diagnosed with Hepatitis 
B infection. 
 
3.3 Screening should be offered early in pregnancy, ideally by 10 weeks [NICE 
2008]. The aim is to screen all women before 10 weeks, however screening can 
be offered at any point during the pregnancy. 
 
3.4 Testing should also be available on request at any stage of pregnancy should a 
woman consider herself to be at risk of infection [PHE 2018b]. 
 
3.5 Women booking late or who arrive unbooked in labour should be offered 
screening at the first available opportunity (see sections 2.3 and 2.4). 
 
3.6 Women who have booked elsewhere and transferred care to BSUH NHS TRUST 
should be offered repeat screening. This ensures a result is available in -house 
for all staff to access electronically if the hand held notes are not available and 
for completion of cohort data. If a woman declines repeat testing having been 
screened elsewhere, then a copy of the original result from the previous 
booking unit must be inserted in both the hand held notes and a further copy 
sent to the Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator and SMRHW. A booking test 
declined form (Appendix C) should be completed and the declines process 
should be implemented) 

3.7 The midwife should document in the hand held notes that discussion has taken 
place and the woman’s decision to accept [consent to screen] or decline 
screening. Screening should only be performed after documented informed 
consent; this does not require a signature from the woman. 
 
3.8 There is currently no national policy to offer repeat Hepatitis B screening later 
in pregnancy . However, in the following circumstances, the midwife should 
consider a repeat test at 28 weeks if: 
• If a woman and partner continue to engage in at -risk behaviour during the 
pregnancy (eg Intravenous drug use - IVDU) 
• If the woman is from a high risk group and/ or partner is from a high risk 
group and Hepatitis B status is unknown. High risk groups include IVDUs 
or if the woman and/or her partner were born in or have lived in countries 
with high rates of Hepatitis B infection (mainly Asian and African countries, Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 9 of 33 
 commonly China, Thailand, India, Africa & Eastern Europe) with no history 
of Hepatitis B vaccination in the past. 
• The woman discloses that partner is Hepatitis B positive and she does not 
have a clear history of vaccination [PHE 2018b] 
 
These cases should be considered on an individual basis. Advice can be sought from 
the Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing as necessary (see 
Appendix A). 
 
4 Women Booking Late 
 
4.1 Women booking late must be offered screening at the first appointment with 
the midwife. Where women book at 24 weeks gestation or later, the blood 
specimens should be marked urgent and positive results reported (as per 
positive results pathway section 5) within 24 hours (1 working day) of the 
sample being received in the laboratory [Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) 
2013]. 
 
4.2 In such cases it is the responsibility of the midwife booking the woman to 
follow up results within 5 working days of the sample being taken. The midwife 
must agree a plan with the woman to communicate the results to her. This 
plan must be documented in the hand held notes [RCP 2013]. 
 
5 Women who arrive un -booked or without screening results in 
labour 
 
5.1 Women who arrive un -booked or without screening results in labour must be 
offered screening on admission by the midwife responsible for her care. 
Consideration should be given to the stage of labour, woman’s condition and 
specific risk factors for Hepatitis B. The midwife should document all 
discussions that have taken place in the hand heldnotes [PHE 2018b]. 
 
5.2 If the woman is considered to be at increased risk of Hepatitis B infection and 
delivery is imminent it may be necessary to consider urgent screening. Results 
can normally be obtained within an hour from the laboratory during normal 
working hours. In these cases laboratory staff must be informed that the result 
is urgent. Out of normal working hours, the on -call microbiologist should be 
contacted so that there is no delay in diagnosis [PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b]. Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 10 of 33 
 
5.3 Presumptive action should be taken on a preliminary positive result taken on a 
woman in labour until such time as the result is confirmed . 
 
5.4 If consent is withheld for screening during labour, the midwife caring for the 
woman should re -offer screening after delivery and document discussions/ 
decisions in hand heldnotes [PHE 2018b]. 
 
5.5 The midwife caring for the woman in labour should inform the on -call neonatal 
doctor when either: 
• consent to screening is withheld during labour 
• a woman has been screened but delivery is likely before the result is 
available 
 
5.6 In all cases, blood results must be obtained before discharge from the hospital 
/ maternity services and documented in the hand heldnotes by the midwife 
responsible for the woman’s care. Positive results will be actioned accordingly. 
 
6 Women known to be Hepatitis B positive prior to screening 
 
6.1 Where a positive diagnosis of Hepatitis B is documented and known to the 
health professional (midwife or doctor), they should refer the woman to the 
Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing by phone 
immediately (see Appendix A ) to ensure appropriate management. 
Management for these women is the same as for women diagnosed via 
antenatal screening and detailed in section 10.0 
 
6.2 Known Hep B positive women should still be re -screened for Hep B as the 
blood markers can change with each pregnancy. Additionally they may not be 
known to local services and the positive result triggers the laboratory to inform 
the SMRHW which acts as an additional failsafe to ensure follow -up. When 
completing the form write ‘Hep B positive status known’ and include date of 
prior diagnosis and where it was performed. 
 
6.3 If the woman declines a re -screen for Hep B then this should be recorded as 
‘Hep B screening test not required – positive status known’ rather than 
declined. All other antenatal screening tests should be offered as routine. Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 11 of 33 
 7 Declining Screening 
 
7.1 Screening is optional. All women have the right to decline screening. In these 
cases the midwife should complete a booking blood test declined form (see 
Appendix C ) and return to the Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and 
Wellbeing. 
 
7.2 The decision to decline screening must be clearly documented by the midwife 
in the hand held notes. The ‘decline’ box must also be ticked on the booking 
blood request form. 
 
7.3 Where women decline screening, the midwife should ensure that the woman 
is aware she can opt for screening at any stage later in her pregnancy and is 
aware how to arrange this [PHE 2018b]. 
 
7.1 The woman should also be informed that as they have declined Hepatitis B 
screening, they will be contacted by the SMRHW to further discuss their choices. 
This contact will usually be within 10 working days of receipt of the decline form 
and ideally by 20 weeks. Ideally this discussion takes place in person. At this 
contact the SMRHW will: 
• discuss the woman decision to decline and ensure that they are fully 
aware of the benefits of screening for both themselves and their baby 
• reoffer the screening test and where this is accepted arrange testing and 
follow up of the result [PHE 2018b] 
7.2 If the woman remains unscreened at 28 weeks the midwife should re -offer 
screening at the 28 week visit along with the other blood test routinely offered 
at this appointment. The midwife should document in the hand held notes any 
discussions that take place and the woman decision to accept or decline 
screening after re -offer. 
 
7.3 The SMRHW will follow up at 32 weeks and if the woman remains unscreened, 
the SMRHW will inform the following staff by email: 
• Link Neonatal Consultant 
• Link GUM consultant 
• Link Obstetric Consultants 
• Consultant Virologist 
• Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator 
• Neonatal secretary 
• Consultant Neonatologist (who will co -ordinate a team meeting to 
formulate a postnatal management plan individual to the woman or 
person’s circumstances) [PHE 2018b] Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 12 of 33 
 8 Taking the Sample 
 
8.1 The sample may be taking at booking by the midwife or practice nurse or 
phlebotomist according to local arrangements: 
• A 5 ml sample of blood is required in a gold topped [clotted] bottle. This 
same sample can be used for HIV and Syphilis screening. 
• The requestor [midwife or doctor] should complete all fields on the 
Antenatal Booking Blood Request Form. The request from is in triplicate, 
and the requestor must ensure that all hand writing has transferred 
through and is legible on all three sheets of the form. Where adhesive 
patient labels are used, a label must be affixed onto each of the three 
sheets of the request form. The form includes tick boxes for ‘accept’ or 
‘decline’ of syphilis screening as well as boxes to indicate whether this is 
a ‘first booking’, ‘urgent’ or ‘repeat’ sample. 
8.2 The sample must be labelled according to laboratory guidelines. The minimum 
acceptable identifiers include forename, surname [no abbreviations], plus date 
of birth and NHS number or hospital ID number. The NHS number is the 
preferred number to use [PHE 2016a]. 
8.3 If a woman discloses previous hepatitis B infection, include details on the 
request form. 
8.4 Additional information should be included on the request form if relevant: 
Including family origins, recent immigration (if lived in an area of world where 
Hep B is endemic) a nd first language (if not English) to assist the SMRHWin 
follow -up of positive results. 
8.5 Samples are sent to Brighton Pathology for processing and should arrive within 
one working day of sample collection. 
 
9 Unacceptable Samples 
 
9.1 Where the sample is deemed to be unacceptable by the laboratory because of 
insufficient blood, incomplete data on the request form or for any other 
reason, the laboratory will inform the sample requestor to request a repeat. In 
such cases, a repeat sample should ideally be taken within 10 working days of 
the request being received by the maternity unit [PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b]. 
9.2 Where repeat samples take longer than 10 working days to arrange [for 
example the woman is away or declines to attend for repeat sampling within 
10 days], the midwife should document reasons why there has been a delay. Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 13 of 33 
 9.3 The midwife must always follow up the results of repeated samples and 
arrange a plan [documented in the handheld notes] being mindful that there 
has already been a delay in obtaining a result because of the need to repeat. 
 
10 Results Processes 
10.1 Accessing results (Including failsafe to ensure all women who accept screening 
receive a result) 
10.1.1 Results will be available to staff within 5 working days on ICE (the 
electronic results reporting programme) or by phoning the virology 
laboratory at RSCH on 01273 696955 X 4627 [PHE 2016a]. 
10.1.2 Failsafe - 10 day check : It is the responsibility of the sample requestor 
to follow up results within 10 working days of the sample being taken 
[see also section8.1.3 for situations where this is not possible]. The 
sample requestor should ensure positive results have been acted upon 
and follow up missing results or laboratory requests for a repeat 
sample. The sample requestor must document that results were 
followed up and acted on. An example proforma that can be used for 
recording that results were followed up is given in Appendix E. 
10.1.3 It is recognised that some community clinics do not have facilities for 
venepuncture and therefore women attend hospital phlebotomy to 
have bloods taken. In such cases, the sample requestor will not know 
when the bloods were actually taken and so cannot follow up results by 
10 days. In such cases it is essential that the requestor follows up 
results as per section 10.1.4. 
10.1.4 Failsafe - check at follow up antenatal appointment: It is the 
responsibility of the health professional (midwife or doctor) providing 
care at the next antenatal appointment (usually at the 16 week 
appointment) to check the results, document results (with 
informedconsent) in the hand held notes and inform the woman of the 
results during the appointment [PHE 2018b]. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 14 of 33 
 10.1.5 Failsafe - check at time of dating scan: As an additional failsafe, the 
Antenatal Screening Support Worker (ASSW) will ensure a full set of 
booking blood results are available at the time women attend dating 
scan. This allows early identification of missing results that can be 
actioned after the scan. With consent, missing bloods will be repeated 
at this point of contact by the ASSW. The ASSW will then inform, via 
email, the Antenatal Screening Team and named community midwife. It 
is then the responsibility of the named community midwife to follow up 
results within 10 working days and inform the woman as per 10.1.2.All 
women and people should be notified of their results following testing 
and this includes women who terminate or miscarry following 
screening. This is especially important with screen positive results to 
ensure women are referred and seen for specialist follow up within the 
timeframe detailed in section 10.0 [PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b] 
10.1.6 It is recognised that not all women will be attending for dating scan. 
This might include women booking late or transferring in from another 
trust or women who decline scans. Therefore this is will not capture all 
women which is why the failsafe checks detailed in sectionare 
mandatory. 
 
10.1.7 Women who terminate or miscarry : All women should be notified of their 
results following testing and this includes women who terminate or miscarry 
following screening. This is especially important with screen positive results to 
ensure women are referred and seen for specialist follow up within the 
appropriate timeframe [P HE 2016a, PHE 2018b].. 
11 Missing Antenatal Screening Results 
 
11.1 Results should be documented in all cases at the next antenatal appointment 
[PHE 2018b]. In rare circumstances, a result may not be available at the next 
appointment.The midwife or doctor should phone the laboratory to try and 
ascertain how long results will take and agree with the woman, a plan to 
communicate the results to them. 
11.2 If having phoned the laboratory it is apparent that there is no result, then a 
repeat screening test should be recommended and where accepted, taken that 
day or within 10 working days maximum [PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b]. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 15 of 33 
 11.3 Where a repeat sample is taken, a plan must be agreed with the woman as to 
relaying the result to her within a specified time frame. 
11.4 Full documentation of the above should be made in the hand held notes by the 
midwife or doctor trying to access results. 
12 Negative result HEP B 
 
Where a result is negative, the health professional (midwife or doctor) informing the woman 
of the result should explain the following: 
 
• A negative result does not confer protection on the woman. If a woman (or 
partner) engages in high risk behaviour there is a risk of acquiring HBV during 
pregnancy (UKNSC 2009). Informing a woman of a negative test result should 
be used as an opportunity for general sexual health promotion and for the 
dangers of becoming infected during pregnancy (DoH 2003). 
• Women should be informed that she can request repeat screening at any stage 
of the pregnancy if she request to do so or deem herself at risk or changes her 
sexual partner (PHE 2014). 
13 Follow Up Of Hepatitis Positive Result 
 
13.1 All confirmatory testing is performed in Brighton pathology laboratory. 
13.2 The virology laboratory staff will inform the Specialist Midwife for Reproductive 
Health and Wellbeing [SMRHW] and designated Health Advisors [who provide 
cover if the SMRHW is absent] by email of a Hepatitis B positive or equivocal 
result. In addition, the lab will phone the Health Advisor Office to ensure the 
result has been passed on to the Health Advisors. 
13.3 All positive results will be actioned within 2 working days of the result being 
received by the Health Advisor team. 
13.4 Hepatitis B positive results are available to all staff with access to ICE - the 
labor atory results reporting system. 
13.5 The SMRHW or HA will first attempt to contact the woman by phone within 
48hours (2 working days) of the result being received. If contact is not made by 
phone then a letter will be sent to the woman that same working day offering an 
appointment to be seen within 5 working days after the letter’s scheduled 
arrival, will be sent to the woman that same working day. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 16 of 33 
 13.6 At the first appointment, in addition to informing the woman of her result th e 
SMRHW will complete the following as appropriate: 
13.6.1 Confirmatory testing is performed on a second specimen to confirm the 
results obtained from the first specimen and to ensure that the patient 
details on the original specimen were correct (Recommendation: DoH 
2003). Hepatitis B DNA, Hepatitis A and Hepat itis C screening also 
performed. 
13.6.2 Bloods are taken to assess LFT, AFP and INR 
13.6.3 Consent is sought to document result in hand held notes and inform all 
relevant parties involved in on -going care. This includes: Consultant 
obstetrician, consultant neonatologist, community midwife and 
immunisation nurse specialist. 
13.6.4 Written parental consent is obtained to vaccinate the baby: the 
immunisation consent form in the Personal Child Health Record [PCHR] 
is completed. 
13.6.5 Copies of the Immunisation Consent Form are sent to the neonatal 
secretary for baby notes to be made up and a second copy placed in the 
maternal hand held notes. 
12.6.6 Hepatitis B investigation form is sent to local Health Protection Team 
Link (consultants for communicable diseases): who will forward 
accordingly [see contact list Appendix A ). The woman must be informed 
of the need for statutory notification of a hep B positive result (NHS 
England 2016). 
13.6.6 The SMRHW will inform the Community Child Health Information 
Service (CCHIS) who track vaccine administration of all antenatal 
women found to be Hep B positive. 
13.6.7 The SMRHW co -ordinates on -going care and support as well as partner 
notification with the woman’s consent. 
13.6.8 Screening of partner/ other children/ other family members with 
Hepatitis B immunisation as appropriate should be organised (DoH 
2003). This is co -ordinated by the SMRHW. 
13.7 Where women do not attend the first appointment, the SMRHW will review care 
with the multidisciplinary team and develop an action plan for further follow 
and ongoing care. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 17 of 33 
 13.8 The SMRHW contacts the woman to confirm Hepatitis B status from the 
confirmatory testing and inform her of the other blood test results. The SMRHW 
documents results in the GUM notes. 
13.9 The SMRHW makes written referral to the liver unit as soon as the confirmatory 
and DNA results are back which normally takes around 2 weeks. 
13.10 Vaccine is kept in the fridge on delivery suite at RSCH and in the fridge on SCBU 
at PRH. 
13.11 If immunoglobulin is required this will have been pre -ordered by the Specialist 
Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing through the Lead Antimicrobial 
Pharmacist. It will have been made available on delivery suite six weeks before 
The midwife responsible for the care of the mother during labour should inform the 
neonatal doctor on -call for labour ward that the infant will require 
immunisation. 
14 Care of Baby Born to HBV Infected Mother 
 
The section must read in conjunction with the BSUH neonatal department – medical 
guidelines: HBV (2011): Postnatal management of infants born to mothers with 
Hepatitis B. Available on the intranet. 
 
14.1 A full course of vaccination during the first years of life is usually effective in 
preventing infection of the baby. This involves: 
• an initial dose within 12 hours of birth 
• 2nd dose at one month 
• 3rd dose at two months 
• 4th dose at 12 months 
• blood test at 12 months to check for chronic persistent infection (Public 
Health England 2015). 
• A booster is also advised at 5 years. 
14.2 The vaccine schedule detailed above should be administered to babies of 
women who are positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (UK NSC 2009). 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP031 
HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 18 of 33 
 14.3 The vaccine schedule detailed in above plus Hep B immunoglobulin (HBIG) 
(within 12 hours of birth) should be given to babies of women who are positive 
for Hepatitis B e -antigen (HBeAg) as this marker indicates increased risk of 
transmission (UK NSC 2009). Babies born to mothers who have a high DNA level 
but are e antigen negative may also be given immunoglobulin after case review 
by the Hepatology Consultant. Note the immunoglobulin should be given in a 
different site to the vaccine. 
14.4 The table below clarifies which babies require Vaccine and which also require 
HBIG (Public Health England [2016 b] The Green Book) 
 
14.5 If an infant is later identified as having missed HBIG at birth despite being 
eligible, HBIG can be given up to 7 days after birth. 
14.6 The midwife responsible for caring for the woman in labour will inform the on -
call paediatrician prior to the birth that the woman is Hepatitis B positive and 
neonatal immunisation will be required. Parental consent for the baby’s 
immunisation is obtained prior to the birth by the Specialist Midwife for 
Reproductive Health and Wellbeing. The first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine should 
be given within 12 hours of birth by the on -call paediatrician, midwife or ANNP. 
(See neonatal policy for further details – including administration of 
immunoglobulin).

HepatitisB (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 19 of 33 
 14.7 If a woman books late and/or a Hepatitis B test result is not available, Hepatitis B 
vaccine is given to the infant unless a result will be available within 24 hours of 
delivery or before discharge (whichever is sooner). Information about vaccine 
and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration, dose and supplies is given in 
HSC 1998/127 [2] and in Immunisation against infectious disease. Further 
information about vaccination is available in: DoH [2006] Immunisation against 
infectious disease – ‘The Green Book’. 
14.8 Babies with a birth weight of 1500g or less, born to mothers infected with 
Hepatitis B, should receive HBIG in addition to the vaccine, regardless of the e -
antigen status of the mother (UK NSC 2009). (See neonatal policy for further 
details). 
 
14.9 See neonatal policy regarding babies born to women who are HIV positive or 
where a parent is an intravenous drug user or likely to progress to injecting. 
14.10 Mothers should be given written information about the number of injections 
their babies require, when the injections should be given and who will be 
responsible for the administration of each dose. This includes the importance of 
completing the full course of immunisation. 
 
14.11 Following administration of the first vaccine, the health professional 
administering the vaccine and or immunoglobulin documents in the baby notes 
and where possible the PCHR [red book] that these have been given. The 
midwife, ANNP or paediatrician also sends copies of the Hepatitis B Notification 
Form to the people listed on the bottom of the form. Note that there is a 
different form in use for RSCH and PRH to account for the different geographical 
areas covered by each site. 
14.12 The midwife should telephone the SMRHW to advise of date/ time of birth and 
date/time that the first vaccine was administered (message can be left on 
mobile phone). The midwife should document actions in the postnatal notes. 
 
14.13 The neonatal secretaries also send a copy of the Hepatitis B Notification form to 
the SMRHW as a second alert that the baby has been born and the first vaccine 
has been administered. 
14.14 The Child Health Record Unit informs the consultant community paediatrician 
(CCP) who arranges for a blood test form to be sent to the parents at 1 year. The 
blood test sample is taken at the Royal Alexandra Children’s Hospital. Results are 
returned to the CCP who subsequently informs the parents and GP.

Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals Page 20 of 33 
 14.15 Follow -up to ensure that babies have received their full vaccine schedule varies 
between localities. The following staffs are informed by the SMRHW by email 
with details of the woman and the baby’s GP: the Community Child Health 
Information Service Manager & Community Child Health Information Service. 
They then follow up with the practice nurse team at the surgery to ensure the 
baby has been completed the full course of vaccinations. 
15 Audit and monitoring 
 
15.1 Minimum auditable standards 
Public Health England requires that the following data is collected on a quarterly 
basis and reported annually (see Public Health England [2016 a] for full details of 
current standards and all definitions): 
• number of women booking 
• number of women eligible for screening 
• number of women tested (Coverage: Standard 2) 
• number of women declining screening 
• number of women diagnosed with new Hep B infection 
• number of women diagnosed with old HBV infection (ie: diagnosis made 
before current pregnancy) 
• number of women with high infectivity (new or previous diagnosis) 
• Number of women attending for specialist assessment within 10 working 
days of a positive result (Standard 5/6) 
• number of babies born to positive women who receive appropriate 
vaccinations within 12 hours of birth (Standard 7) 
15.2 Current data requirements of the Key Performance Indicators for screening are 
available at http://www.screening.nhs.uk/kpi ]: ID2 - timely referral of Hepatitis 
B positive women for specialist assessment. Data is submitted quarterly. 
 
15.3 The Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing will maintain a 
database of all women declining screening and the outcome 
 
15.4 The Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing will maintain a 
database of all women with a hep B positive status and outcome of babies born 
to Hep B positive mothers. This will include details regarding administration of 
vaccine and where relevant HBIG. 
15.5 An annual audit of women’s notes will take place to review documentation 
processes.

Appendix B - Background to Antenatal screening for Hepatitis B 
 
• Hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by the HBV virus. In 
many cases, the virus does not cause any symptoms (NICE 2008). 
• HBV is a blood borne infection and can be transmitted through sexual contact, 
contaminated blood e.g. needle sharing (IV drug use), having a tattoo or 
piercing with needles that have not been steri lised, sharing toothbrushes or 
razors or by vertical transmission (mother -to-child transmission) (UK NSC 
2006). 
• The risk of perinatal transmission is dependent on the status of the maternal 
infection. Approximately 70 -90% of mothers who are HBV e -antigen [HBeAg] 
positive will transmit the infection to the baby. The rate of transmission is 
approximately 10% in women with antibody to e antigen (AntiHBe) (UK NSC 
2010). 
• Infection can result in an acute or chronic infection. A chronic infection may 
result in cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. The earlier in life the infection 
occurs the greater the risk that it will lead to chronic infection, liver disease 
and early death (UK NSC 2010).
