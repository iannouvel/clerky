This is an update of the 2010 version of this guideline in the new format. It is the ﬁfth edition, which was previously
published in October 1996, February 2000, January 2005 and June 2010.
1. Key recommendations
/C15 Women should be informed that the additional risk of miscarriage following amniocentesis or CVSperformed by an appropriately trained operator is likely to be below 0.5%. [Grade B]
/C15 Amniocentesis should not be performed prior to 15+0weeks’ gestation. [Grade A]
/C15 CVS should not be performed prior to 10+0weeks’ gestation. [Grade D]
/C15 Where possible, to reduce the risk of technical challenges, CVS should be performed from 11+0weeks’
gestation onwards. [Good Practice Point]
/C15 Women with multiple pregnancies should be informed that the additional risk of miscarriage for twinpregnancy following CVS or amniocentesis performed by an appropriately trained operator is around 1%.[Grade B]
/C15 Screening results for blood borne viruses, viral load and antigen test results should be reviewed when aninvasive test is considered and individualised risk of viral transmission should be discussed. [Grade C]
2. Aim
The aim of this guideline is to provide a concise set of evidence-based standards for provision and performance ofamniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) used for prenatal diagnosis.
An infographic (Inforgrpahic S1) of this guideline is available as supplemental information, and an audio version at
www.rcog.org.uk/gtg8.
3. Background
Pregnant women are offered amniocentesis or CVS for prenatal diagnosis for a variety of reasons including a higherchance aneuploidy screening result, fetal structural anomaly, or a known risk of inherited genetic disease.

Implementation of national combined aneuploidy screening and increasing use of cell free DNA testing from maternal
blood has resulted in a signiﬁcant decline in screen positive results and therefore fewer invasive prenatal tests are
being carried out. However, both CVS and amniocentesis remain, at present, the only deﬁnitive diagnostic tests foraneuploidy in pregnancy.
CVS, carried out to obtain placental villi for analysis, is usually performed between 11
+0and 13+6weeks of gestation.
If required, CVS can be performed between 14+0and 14+6weeks’ gestation. Individualised counselling of the merits
of CVS versus amniocentesis should be provided for women considering CVS during this time period; a video
demonstrating the recommended technique for transabdominal CVS is available online at www.rcog.org.uk/gtg8.
Amniocentesis, performed to obtain amniotic ﬂuid for analysis, is usually offered from 15+0weeks; a video
demonstrating the recommended technique for amniocentesis is available online at www.rcog.org.uk/gtg8. Informedwritten consent is advised prior to either procedure, and should be in line with existing consent advice from theGMC and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommendations.
1,2The consent process must include
procedure risks, timing and method of communicating results, sample/tissue storage, beneﬁts, alternatives and optionto opt out. Wherever possible contemporaneous local data for procedure related complications should be quoted.Women should receive information on aftercare including, where appropriate, the need for prophylactic anti D innon-sensitised rhesus negative women and indications to seek medical advice following the procedure.
4. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), EMBASE, Medline and PubMed
electronic databases were searched for relevant meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials(RCTs), and cohort studies. TRIP, NICE evidence and the Guideline International Network were searched to identifyrelevant guidelines. Databases were searched for the terms ‘amniocentesis’ and ‘chorionic villus sampling’ appearingin the title or abstract. The search was limited to humans and the English language. The search was restricted toarticles published until October 2019. The full search strategy is available to view online as supporting information(Appendix S1 and S2).
The recommendations given in this guideline have been graded according to the guidance for the development of
RCOG Green-top Guideline.

5. How should care be organised in providing amniocentesis and CVS?
The scope of this guideline is conﬁned to technical aspects of the two procedures. For the woman and her family,good care in these circumstances encompasses more than the procedure. Women facing either procedure areusually anxious and clinicians should bear this in mind. The RCOG, Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Societyand College of Radiographers have produced a consensus statement on supporting women and their partnersthrough prenatal screening which,
4while developed to support the evaluative roll-out of non-invasive prenatal testing
(NIPT) for Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome within the NHS fetal anomaly screeningprogramme, is also relevant to the provision of amniocentesis and CVS.
Care for women who consent to have CVS or amniocentesis should be organised in accordance with
Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme guidance.
5This includes an appropriate environment, skilled staff,
access to allied specialties and appropriate support for continuation of pregnancy or termination ofpregnancy, depending on the choices made by the woman and her partner where chromosomal or geneticanomalies are identiﬁed.Evidence

It is important to remember that most women will not have expected screening to result in unexpected
news about their baby, and that this is therefore a very stressful time. A sensitive approach is extremely
important and choice of words, such as the use of ‘difference’ rather than ‘abnormality’ in
certain situations, is really important. All options should be presented in an unbiased manner so that thewoman and her partner can make a personal, informed choice. These options should include continuing thepregnancy with a view to keeping the baby; continuing the pregnancy with a view to having the babyadopted; continuing the pregnancy with a view to palliative care in the case of severely life limitingconditions; and ending the pregnancy at that point. It may also be appropriate to discuss religious aspects ofcare as well. Women should be given time to discuss this decision with their partner and friends if theywish, to meet with a paediatrician or learning disability nurse used to caring for people with the condition ifappropriate, or to meet with families who have a child with the identiﬁed condition if they wish eitherthrough local or national support groups for those with the condition (e.g. Antenatal Results and Choices[ARC, www.arc-uk.org] or Support Organisation for Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18 [SOFT, www.soft.org.uk)].

serious complication of amniocentesis andCVS
The only RCT on which previous estimate of additional risk of pregnancy loss following amniocentesis has
been based was published in 1986.
6The trial reported a 1% additional risk of pregnancy loss, but the
estimate was rather imprecise with 95% conﬁdence intervals including both no additional risk and 2%risk.
6It is now unlikely that an appropriately sized, high quality RCT trial will ever be repeated. Two
RCTs published in 1991 and 1993 compared CVS carried out either transabdominally (TA) ortransvaginally (TV) with midtrimester amniocentesis and found an increase in overall pregnancy lossEvidence

following CVS (11.1% versus 8.2%; RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 –1.67) which was attributed to increased
spontaneous pregnancy loss after CVS (7.1% versus 5.0%; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23 –1.85).7–9
Since then many observational studies, including large national registry-based studies, have reported much
lower complications rates for both amniocentesis and CVS, including no signiﬁcant increase in pregnancylosses above the background rate.
10Ideally, these studies should attempt to estimate the procedure-
related risk for structurally and genetically normal fetuses. Such estimates should come from cohorts withgenetic testing of all pregnancy losses, irrespective of whether they had a prior invasive test or not andinclude control groups matched for all important confounders including maternal age. These factorsshould be taken into account for future studies. Even with all these criteria fulﬁlled, in the absence ofrandomization, clinically important differences between women undergoing invasive testing and those whodo not undergo testing will remain. Nevertheless, it is plausible that lower pregnancy loss rates reportedin more recent studies reﬂect improvements in technology, techniques and experience.Evidence
level 2 ++
A systematic review including data from observational studies published between 2000 and 2014 with a
minimum of 1000 women per study reported weighted pooled procedure-related risk of pregnancy loss of0.11% (95% CI 0.04 –0.26) for amniocentesis and 0.22% for CVS (95% CI 0.71 –1.16).
11The authors
published an update including studies up to September 2017 with data from 10 studies of amniocentesiswith 64 901 procedures and 6 studies of CVS with 19 000 procedures and performed a meta-analysis.
12
The weighted pooled procedure-related risk of pregnancy loss was 0.35% for both procedures(amniocentesis 95% CI 0.07 –0.63, CVS 95% CI /C00.31 to 1.00).
12However, the pregnancy loss rates in
included studies show large variations. For amniocentesis, two studies reported higher pregnancy loss ratein the control group than after amniocentesis,
13,14while in others the excess risk following amniocentesis
varied from 0.06 to 1.24%.10,15 –21Similarly for CVS, two studies reported higher numbers of pregnancy
losses in their control groups,10,15while in the remainder reported excess pregnancy loss rates after CVS
ranged from 0.2 to 1.5%.16,22 –24It is worth noting that six out 10 studies reported amniocentesis-related
risk of 0.2% or less and three out six studies reported no additional risk from CVS.Evidence
level 2 ++
A recently updated Cochrane Review of amniocentesis and CVS for prenatal diagnosis reported low
quality randomised evidence comparing transabdominal and transvaginal CVS.9A retrospective cohort
study published in 2008 reported outcomes for 5148 CVS, 96% of which were transcervical procedures
using a catheter method.15Pregnancy losses were below the background rate regardless of CVS route
(TA/C00.2%, TC /C00.5%).15A retrospective cohort study published in 2017 reported outcomes following
4862 CVS procedures, 2833 of which were transcervical (1787 using forceps and 1046 using cannulae).16
The procedure-related pregnancy loss rate was 1.4% for transcervical CVS and 1.0% for transabdominalCVS.
16However, the risk of pregnancy loss after transcervical CVS was only 0.27% when forceps was
used and 3.12% for those done with cannula, suggesting that forceps may offer a safety advantage.16See
Table 1 for an overview of other risks associated with amniocentesis and CVS.Evidence
level 4
Procedure-related risks may be increased when procedures are performed by less skilled operators, as
there is an inverse association between experience and procedure-related pregnancy loss.15,26Recently,
Bakker et al.16stratiﬁed fetal losses by operator experience, according to number of procedures
performed and conﬁrmed lower losses with increasing experience for both transabdominal CVS and foramniocentesis. There is no evidence to specify the optimal number of procedures for trained operators toEvidence

maintain their skills. It is advised that appropriately trained operators complete, or supervise, ideally at
least 20 amniocentesis or CVS procedures annually. See Table 2 for requirements for training to carry outamniocentesis and CVS and advice on maintaining good practice.
Women should be aware that the results of CVS can be affected by conﬁned placental mosaicism in 1 –2% of cases. If
there is a fetal structural anomaly, it is reasonable to move forward with discussions regarding ongoing care,including the option of termination of pregnancy if the woman or couple wish to consider this. If there are nostructural anomalies, and QFPCR results following CVS suggest a chromosomal anomaly, a full karyotype should beawaited before any decisions are made. Discussions under these circumstances should reﬂect the RCOG, RCM andSociety and College of Radiographers consensus statement on prenatal testing.

6.2. What are the additional risks associated with invasive testing?
Severe maternal sepsis is a very rare complication. Infection may arise from organisms present on the skin,
ultrasound probe, gel or via needle puncture of the bowel. Skin decontamination, use of separate sterilegel sachet, enclosing the ultrasound probe in a sterile bag and continuous ultrasound are recommendedprior to amniocentesis and CVS. If, on inspection, amniotic ﬂuid has a cloudy or purulent appearance orthe woman shows clinical features to suggest intra-amniotic infection, the operator should considersending a small quantity of amniotic ﬂuid for microbiological analysis and consider antibiotic treatment.

7.1. At what gestation should amniocentesis be carried out?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Amniocentesis should be
performed after 15+0weeks ’gestation1+ A This trial compared amniocentesis after
15+0weeks to early amniocentesis and
found an increased risk of talipes
equinovarus in the earlier group
There is good evidence that amniocentesis should not be performed before 15+0weeks’ gestation owing
to the higher risk of pregnancy loss and the potential for talipes equinovarus.9,27A Canadian multicentre
trial published in 1998 reported 24/2612 cases of talipes equinovarus with early amniocentesis comparedto 5/2693 cases with CVS.
25Early amniocentesis also resulted in an increase of 3% in requirement for
multiple needle insertions (4.7% versus 1.7%; RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.92 –4.04).27Early amniocentesis has
cytogenetic implications, with increased risk of failed culture of 1.8% compared to 0.2% with midtrimesteramniocentesis and potential for false negative results (3 versus 0, 0.05% versus 0.0%; RR 3.00,95% CI 0.12 –73.67) when compared to midtrimester amniocentesis.
28Evidence

Individual laboratories have reported increased risk of obtaining low quantities of DNA from direct extraction when
amniocentesis is performed before 16+0weeks. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for impact on turn-around-

Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Where possible, CVS should be performed
from 11+0weeks ’gestation to reduce the
risk of technical challenges4 GPP CVS before 11+0weeks ’gestation can be
more technically challenging
Possible associations between CVS and both oromandibular disruption and limb reduction defects were
ﬁrst reported in 1991 following procedures carried out between 8+0and 9+3weeks’ gestation.29Since
then, reports have emerged refuting the association, though most procedures were performed after10
+0weeks.30It is possible that any potential risk is gestation dependent and as a result most guidelines
discourage performing CVS before 10+0weeks.9,11Additionally, CVS prior to 11+0weeks’ gestation can
be more technically challenging due to access and thinner, less developed placental tissue.Evidence

8. What are the considerations when performing amniocentesis or CVS for multiple pregnancy?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
Women considering amniocentesis or CVS
should receive detailed counselling andpregnancy mapping by suitably trainedhealthcare professionals4 GPP Mapping of the pregnancy is essential to
ensure accurate sampling
In multiple pregnancies amniocentesis or
CVS should be performed by an operatorwith the skills to perform selectivetermination of pregnancy if required4 GPP This provides reassurance of accurate fetal
identi ﬁcation to the woman and operator,
should termination of pregnancy berequested
Women with multiple pregnancies should
be informed that the additional risk ofpregnancy loss for twin pregnancy
following CVS or amniocentesis performed
by a skilled operator is around 1%2++ B It is important to be aware that the overall
risk of pregnancy loss is higher in twinpregnancies due to an increased
background risk of pregnancy loss
Women with multiple pregnancies and a
conﬁrmed diagnosis of anomaly from
amniocentesis or CVS should be providedwith information and supported in anondirective way, including referral tospecialist counselling services if required4 GPP It is important support women to make
the decisions that are appropriate for
them and their families

A high level of expertise in ultrasound scanning is essential for operators undertaking amniocentesis or
CVS in multiple pregnancies, because the pregnancy needs to be mapped with great care.31Mapping is
essential prior to any invasive testing to ensure each fetus is identiﬁed and sampled appropriately withsamples labelled correctly for analysis. As some women and couples may choose a selective termination oftheir pregnancy based on the results of amniocentesis or CVS, it is recommended that an operator skilledin performing selective termination conducts fetal mapping as it is unlikely that any operator would becomfortable performing selective termination based on labelling performed by a referring doctor. Labellingby assigning numbers should be avoided. It is more reproducible to map by lateral orientation, as maternalleft and maternal right twins or vertical orientation, as upper and lower twins, this approach isrecommended by NICE.
31Labelling is assisted in the presence of a discordant fetal structural anomaly or
discordant fetal sex, but extra care must be taken where there is no clearly identiﬁable ultrasounddifference. In such cases it is advised that two operators conﬁrm labelling.Evidence
level 4
Two systematic reviews have assessed the risks of mid-trimester pregnancy loss following amniocentesis,
with no RCTs identiﬁed in either systematic review.32,33There was considerable variation in how individual
studies deﬁned fetal loss (a single twin or both twins) and several studies did not provide any deﬁnition offetal loss. Agarwal et al. reported pregnancy loss rate following amniocentesis of 3.07%(95% CI 1.83 –4.61) and estimated procedure-related risk of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks’ gestation at
1% (2.59% versus 1.53% RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.02 –3.19). This estimate was derived from four cohort studies
with 695 procedures and 18 pregnancy losses.
34–37Vink et al.33captured publications over a longer time
period between 1970 and 2010. The pooled odds ratio for total pregnancy loss after amniocentesis was 1.8(95% CI 1.2 –2.7), derived from seven controlled studies with 1530 procedures and 73 fetal losses.
35–40Evidence
level 2 ++
It is also possible that the true amniocentesis-related risk of pregnancy loss in twins may be less than 1%
as several studies published in the last 5 years have reported no increase in pregnancy losses abovebackground risk.
41,42Evidence
level 2 +
Data for procedure-related pregnancy losses following CVS are more limited. Agarwal et al.32meta-
analysed data from four observational studies of CVS in twin pregnancies (632 procedures) and reportedan overall pregnancy loss rate of 3.8% (95% CI 2.5 –5.5) following CVS. It was not possible to estimate risk
of pregnancy loss less than 24 weeks with CVS due to heterogeneity of the data.
32For both
amniocentesis and CVS, the majority of studies have not stratiﬁed their outcomes by chorionicity and it istherefore not possible to accurately determine procedure-related losses separately for monochorionicdiamniotic and dichorionic diamniotic twins.Evidence
level 2 ++
Most operators use double uterine entry when performing amniocentesis or CVS in multiple pregnancies.
However, the limited data available suggest no signiﬁcant difference in risk for amniocentesis performedwith single or double uterine entry.
32Similarly for CVS, there appears to be no signiﬁcant differences in
pregnancy loss with transabdominal versus transcervical CVS, or with use of a single versus double needletechnique, or single versus double uterine entry.
32The risk of cross-contamination during CVS is
approximately 1% and may be mitigated by using a double uterine entry technique.32Based on currently
available evidence, operators should use the technique with which they are most comfortable.Evidence

There are insufﬁcient data available to comment on procedure-related risks for higher order multiple pregnancies.

9. What is the role of third trimester amniocentesis?
Recommendation Evidence
qualityStrength Rationale for the recommendation
The risks associated with third-trimester
diagnostic amniocentesis, including the riskof pre-term labour, are likely to be low2+ D The risk of preterm labour before
34 weeks is in the region of 3 –4% based
on limited studies
Women should be informed that there is a
higher risk of cell culture failure withamniocentesis performed in the third-trimester2++ C Overall there is a 10% risk of culture
failure for third trimester amniocentesis,but the risk is higher with advancinggestation
Third trimester amniocentesis may be offered for newly identiﬁed fetal structural anomalies, suspected fetal
infection and fetal growth restriction. Serious complications, requiring emergency birth are unusual followingthird trimester amniocentesis. Two retrospective cohorts have reported preterm labour before 37 weeks of4–8% and before 34 weeks of 3 –4%.
43,44There is an increased risk of requiring more than one needle
insertion (5% of procedures), with bloodstained samples reported in 5 –10% of procedures.45,46There is an
increased risk of culture failure following third trimester amniocentesis, with a rate of 9.7% overall reported in2007.
47A retrospective database analysis of amniocentesis procedures performed between 24+0and
39+0weeks between 2002 and 2014 reported increased overall culture failure rate of 10.2% that increased
with gestational age from 2.1% between 24+0and 27+0weeks to 40.6% between 36 and 40 weeks.48Evidence

results to appropriately weigh theindication for testing and individual risk ofmother to child transmission of viralinfection
Where screening results for blood borne
viruses are not known, testing should bedelayed until HIV status can be determined4 GPP The risk of mother to child transmission
of HIV is higher for women not on highlyactive antiretroviral therapy and withhigher viral loads
The risk of mother to child transmission of
HIV for women on highly activeantiretroviral therapy is very low2++ C Several large retrospective cohorts
reported no cases of mother to childtransmission for women on highly activeantiretroviral therapy with undetectableviral loads

10copies/ml but increases with
higher viral loads2+ C A retrospective analysis indicated no
signiﬁcant difference in mother to child
transmission of Hepatitis B below a viralload of 7log
10
There is no evidence of risk of mother tochild transmission of Hepatitis C based on
limited data available2+ C Limited available studies have not
reported mother to child transmission of
Hepatitis C
Recent studies demonstrate a very low risk of mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV for women
on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable viral loads. Four retrospectivecohorts with 317 procedures spanning 1985 to 2015 contained no cases of MTCT in women onHAART.
49–52Conversely, a retrospective cohort study published in 2017 reported 2.3% MTCT of HIV
for women not on HAART, performed prior to 2005 arising from 113 total CVS and amniocentesisprocedures.
49Evidence
level 2 ++
A multicentre retrospective case-control study including 166 amniocentesis procedures published in 2009
reported a non-signiﬁcant increase in MTCT for women without antiretroviral therapy (25.0% versus 16.2%)and for those treated with zidovudine monotherapy or a double-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitorcombinations (6.1% versus 3.3%).
51The same study found no cases of MTCT in 81 women on HAART.51
Operators need to be aware and inform women that the vast majority of evidence is based onamniocentesis and that data on CVS are limited. Where screening results for blood borne viruses are notknown, testing should be delayed until HIV status can be determined. Where screening is declined,informed consent should include discussion of the risk of MTCT and that this is increased for womenwith higher viral load and not on antiretroviral treatment.Evidence
level 2 +
The overall risk of MTCT for Hepatitis B is low, but increased viral load is a risk factor for transmission.53
A small retrospective case-control study of infants of HBsAg +women of whom 63/642 has amniocentesis
demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in MTCT when the HBV DNA was over 500 copies/ml (4.2% versus17.4%; OR 4.76 [95% CI 1.17 –19.33]).
54There is an absence of high quality data on the risk of MTCT
with Hepatitis C, but currently no evidence of risk of MTCT following amniocentesis.55Evidence

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guideline are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
