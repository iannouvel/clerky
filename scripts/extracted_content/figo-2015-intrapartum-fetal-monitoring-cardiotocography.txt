1. Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to assist in the use and interpretation
of intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG), as well as in the clinical man-
agement of speci ﬁc CTG patterns. In the preparation of these guidelines,
it has been assumed that all necessary resources, both human and ma-terial, required for intrapartum monitoring and clinical management
are readily available. Unexpected complications may occur during
labor, even in patients without prior evidence of risk, so maternity hos-
pitals need to ensure the presence of trained staff, as well as appropriate
facilities and equipment for an expedite delivery (in particular emer-
gency cesarean delivery). CTG monitoring should never be regarded as
a substitute for good clinical observation and judgement, or as an excuse
for leaving the mother unattended during labor.
2. Indications
The evidence for the bene ﬁts of continuous CTG monitoring, as
compared with intermittent auscultation, in both low- and high-risk
labors is scientiﬁ cally inconclusive [1,2]. When compared with intermit-
tent auscultation, continuous CTG has been shown to decrease theoccurrence of neonatal seizures, but no effect has been demonstratedon the incidence of overall perinatal mortality or cerebral palsy. Howev-
er, these studies were carried out in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s
where equipment, clinical experience, and interpretation criteria were
very different from current practice, and they were clearly underpow-
ered to evaluate differences in major outcomes [3]. These issues are
discussed in more detail in Section 8 of this chapter. In spite of these
limitations, most experts believe that continuous CTG monitoring
should be considered in all situations where there is a high risk of fetal
hypoxia/acidosis, whether due to maternal health conditions (such as
vaginal hemorrhage and maternal pyrexia), abnormal fetal growth
during pregnancy, epidural analgesia, meconium stained liquor, or the
possibility of excessive uterine activity, as occurs with induced or aug-
mented labor. Continuous CTG is also recommended when abnormali-
ties are detected during intermittent fetal auscultation. The use of
continuous intrapartum CTG in low-risk women is more controversial,
although it has become standard of care in many countries. An alterna-tive approach is to provide intermittent CTG monitoring alternating
with fetal heart rate (FHR) auscultation. There is some evidence to sup-
port that this is associated with similar neonatal outcomes in low-risk
pregnancies [4]. Intermittent monitoring should be carried out long
enough to allow adequate evaluation of the basic CTG features (seebelow). The routine use of admission CTG for low-risk women on en-
trance to the labor ward has been associated with an increase in cesar-
ean delivery rates and no improvement in perinatal outcomes [5],b u t
studies were also underpowered to show such differences. In spite ofthe lack of evidence regarding bene ﬁt, this procedure has also become
standard of care in many countries.
3. Tracing acquisition
3.1. Maternal position for CTG acquisition
Maternal supine recumbent position can result in aortocaval com-
pression by the pregnant uterus, affecting placental perfusion and fetal
oxygenation. Prolonged monitoring in this position should therefore
be avoided. The lateral recumbent, half-sitting, and upright positions
are preferable alternatives [6].
CTG acquisition can be performed by portable sensors that transmit
signals wirelessly to a remote fetal monitor (telemetry). This solutionInternational Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics 131 (2015) 13 –24

journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/ijgohas the advantage of allowing the mother to move freely during signal
acquisition, rather than be restrained to bed or a sofa, and should there-
fore be the preferred option when available. Telemetry systems differ in
the maximum distance allowed between patient and monitor for ade-
quate signal transmission [7].
3.2. Paper scales for CTG registration and viewing
The horizontal scale for CTG registration and viewing is commonly
called “paper speed ”and available options are usually 1, 2, or 3 cm/min.
In many countries throughout the world 1 cm/min is selected, while inthe Netherlands it is usually 2 cm/min, and in North America and Japanit is almost exclusively 3 cm/min. Some experts feel that 1 cm/min pro-
vides records of suf ﬁcient detail for clinical analysis, and this has the ad-
vantage of reducing tracing length. Other experts feel that the smalldetails of CTG tracings are better evaluated using higher papers speeds.
The vertical scale used for registration and viewing may also be different,
and available alternatives are 20 or 30 bpm/cm.
The paper scales used in each center should be the ones with which
healthcare professionals are most familiar, because tracing interpreta-
tion depends on pattern recognition and these patterns may appear
very different. Inadvertent use of paper scales to which the staff is unac-
customed may lead to erroneous interpretations of CTG features. For ex-
ample, at 3 cm/min variability appears reduced to a clinician familiar
with the 1 cm/min scale, while it may appear exaggerated in the oppo-
site situation (see examples below).
3.3. External versus internal FHR monitoring
External FHR monitoring uses a Doppler ultrasound transducer to
detect the movement of cardiac structures. The resulting signal requires
signal modulation and autocorrelation to provide adequate qualityrecordings [8]. This process results in an approximation of the true
heart rate intervals, but this is considered to be suf ﬁciently accurate
for analysis. External FHR monitoring is more prone to signal loss, to in-
advertent monitoring of the maternal heart rate ( Fig. 1 )[9], and to sig-
nal artefacts such as double-counting ( Fig. 2 ) and half-counting [8],
particularly during the second stage of labor. It may also not record
fetal cardiac arrhythmias accurately.
Internal FHR monitoring using a fetal electrode (usually known as
scalp electrode, but it can also be applied to the breech) evaluates thetime intervals between successive heart beats by identifying R waves
on the fetal electrocardiogram QRS complex, and therefore measures
ventricular depolarization cycles. This method provides a more accurate
evaluation of intervals between cardiac cycles, but it is more expensive
because it requires a disposable electrode. It is very important that the
fetal electrode is only applied after a clear identi ﬁcation of the presenting
part and that delicate fetal structures such as the sutures and fontanelsare avoided. Internal FHR monitoring requires ruptured membranes
and has established contraindications, mainly related to the increased
risk of vertical transmission of infections. It should not be used in patients
with active genital herpes infection, those who are seropositive to hepa-
t i t i sB ,C ,D ,E ,o rt oH I V[10,11] , in suspected fetal blood disorders, when
there is uncertainty about the presenting part, or when arti ﬁcial rupture
of membranes is inappropriate (i.e. an unengaged presentation). Fetal
electrode placement should also preferably be avoided in very preterm
fetuses (under 32 weeks of gestation).
External FHR monitoring is the recommended initial method for
routine intrapartum monitoring, provided that a recording of acceptable
quality is obtained, i.e. that the basic CTG features can be identi ﬁed.
Minimum requirements for using this method are that careful reposi-tioning of the probe is carried out during the second stage of labor,
that in all atypical FHR tracings maternal heart rate monitoring is
ruled out (see below), and if any doubt remains, fetal auscultation,

ultrasound evaluation, or internal FHR monitoring are performed. If an
acceptable record cannot be obtained with external monitoring or if a
cardiac arrhythmia is suspected, then internal monitoring should be
used, in the absence of the previously mentioned contraindications.
3.4. External versus internal monitoring of uterine contractions
External monitoring of uterine contractions using a tocodynamometer
(toco) evaluates increased myometrial tension measured through the
abdominal wall. Incorrect placement, reduced tension applied to the
supporting elastic band, or abdominal adiposity may result in failed or
inadequate registration of contractions. In addition, this technology
only provides accurate information on the frequency of contractions.
It is not possible to extract reliable information regarding the intensity
and duration of contractions, nor on basal uterine tone.
Internal monitoring of uterine contractions using an intrauterine
catheter provides quantitative information on the intensity and duration
of contractions, as well as on basal uterine tone, but it is more expensive
as the catheter is disposable, and requires ruptured membranes.
Contraindications include uterine hemorrhage of unknown cause and
placenta previa. It may also be associated with a small risk of fetal injury,placental hemorrhage, uterine perforation, and infection [12].T h e
routine use of intrauterine pressure catheters has not been shown tobe associated with improved outcomes in induced and augmented
labor [13], and so it is not recommended for routine clinical use.
3.5. Simultaneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate
Simultaneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate (MHR) can be
useful in speci ﬁc maternal health conditions and in cases where it is dif-
ﬁcult to distinguish between maternal and fetal heart rates (for example
complete fetal heart block) [9]. Some CTG monitors provide thepossibility of continuous MHR monitoring, either by electrocardiogra-
phy or pulse oximetry. In some recent models, the latter technology
has been incorporated in the tocodynamometer, allowing continuous
MHR monitoring without the use of additional equipment. Providing
that the technology is available and does not cause discomfort to the
mother, simultaneous MHR monitoring should be considered whenperforming continuous CTG, especially during the second stage of
labor, when tracings show accelerations coinciding with contractions
and expulsive efforts [9], or when the MHR is elevated.
3.6. Monitoring of twins
Continuous external FHR monitoring of twin gestations during
labor should preferably be performed with dual channel monitors thatallow simultaneous monitoring of both FHRs, as duplicate monitoring
of the same twin may occur and this can be picked up by observing
almost identical tracings. Some monitors have embedded algorithms
to alarm when this situation is suspected. During the second stage of
labor, external FHR monitoring of twins is particularly affected by
signal loss, and for this reason some experts believe that the present-
ing twin should preferably be monitored internally for better signalquality [14], if no contraindications to fetal electrode placement are
present. Other experts believe that external monitoring of bothtwins is acceptable, provided that distinct and good quality FHR signals
can be obtained.
3.7. Storage of tracings
All CTG tracings need to be identi ﬁed with the patient name, place of
recording, “paper speed, ”and date and time when acquisition started
and ended. In hospitals where paper CTG recordings are used, the latter
should be considered as part of the patient record and preserved as

such. In hospitals using digital CTG archives [15], a secure ﬁle backup
system needs to be in place, and all tracings should be readily available
for review by the clinical staff.
4. Analysis of tracings
CTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features
(baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions)
followed by overall CTG classi ﬁcation.
4.1. Evaluation of basic CTG features
4.1.1. Baseline
This is the mean level of the most horizontal and less oscillatory FHR
segments. It is estimated in time periods of 10 minutes and expressed in
beats per minute (bpm). The baseline value may vary between subse-
quent 10-minute sections.
In tracings with unstable FHR signals, review of previous segments
and/or evaluation of longer time periods may be necessary to estimate
the baseline [16], in particular during the second stage of labor and to
identify the fetal behavioral state of active wakefulness ( Fig. 3 )t h a t
can lead to erroneously high baseline estimation.
Normal baseline : a value between 110 and 160 bpm.
Preterm fetuses tend to have values toward the upper end of thisrange and post-term fetuses towards the lower end. Some experts
consider the normal baseline values at term to be between 110-
150 bpm.Tachycardia : a baseline value above 160 bpm lasting more than
10 minutes.Maternal pyrexia is the most frequent cause of fetal tachycardia, and it
may be of extrauterine origin or associated with intrauterine infection.Epidural analgesia may also cause a rise in maternal temperatureresulting in fetal tachycardia [17]. In the initial stages of a non-
acute fetal hypoxemia, catecholamine secretion may also result intachycardia. Other less frequent causes are the administration of
beta-agonist drugs [18](salbutamol, terbutaline, ritodrine, fenoterol),
parasympathetic blockers (atropine, scopolamine), and fetal arrhyth-mias such as supraventricular tachycardia and atrial ﬂutter.
Bradycardia : a baseline value below 110 bpm lasting more than
10 minutes.Values between 100 and 110 bpm may occur in normal fetuses,
especially in postdate pregnancies. Maternal hypothermia [19],
administration of beta-blockers [20], and fetal arrhythmias such as
atrioventricular block are other possible causes.
4.1.2. Variability
This refers to the oscillations in the FHR signal, evaluated as
the average bandwidth amplitude of the signal in 1-minute segments.
Normal variability : a bandwidth amplitude of 5 −25 bpm.
Reduced variability : a bandwidth amplitude below 5 bpm for more
than 50 minutes in baseline segments [21] (Figs. 4 and 5 ), or for
more than 3 minutes during decelerations [22] (see Figs. 8 and 9 ).
Reduced variability can occur due to central nervous system
hypoxia/acidosis and resulting decreased sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic activity, but it can also be due to previous cerebral injury
[23], infection, administration of central nervous system depressants
or parasympathetic blockers. During deep sleep, variability is usuallyin the lower range of normality, but the bandwidth amplitude is sel-
dom under 5 bpm. There is a high degree of subjectivity in the visualevaluation of this parameter, and therefore careful re-evaluation is
recommended in borderline situations. Following an initially normal
CTG, reduced variability due to hypoxia is very unlikely to occur dur-
ing labor without preceding or concomitant decelerations and a rise
in the baseline.

Increased variability (saltatory pattern): a bandwidth value ex-
ceeding 25 bpm lasting more than 30 minutes ( Fig. 6 ).
The pathophysiology of this pattern is incompletely understood, but
it may be seen linked with recurrent decelerations, when hypoxia/acidosis evolves very rapidly. It is presumed to be caused by fetalautonomic instability/hyperactive autonomic system [24].
4.1.3. Accelerations
Abrupt (onset to peak in less than 30 seconds) increases in FHR
above the baseline, of more than 15 bpm in amplitude, and lasting
more than 15 seconds but less than 10 minutes.
Most accelerations coincide with fetal movements and are a sign of a
neurologically responsive fetus that does not have hypoxia/acidosis.
Before 32 weeks of gestation, their amplitude and frequency may be
lower (10 seconds and 10 bpm of amplitude). After 32 −34 weeks,
with the establishment of fetal behavioral states, accelerationsrarely occur during periods of deep sleep, which can last up to
50 minutes [21]. The absence of accelerations in an otherwise normal
intrapartum CTG is of uncertain signi ﬁcance, but it is unlikely to indicate
hypoxia/acidosis. Accelerations coinciding with uterine contractions,
especially in the second stage of labor, suggest possible erroneous re-
cording of the maternal heart rate, since the FHR more frequently decel-
erates with a contraction, while the maternal heart rate typically
increases [9].
4.1.4. Decelerations
Decreases in the FHR below the baseline, of more than 15 bpm in
amplitude, and lasting more than 15 seconds.
Early decelerations : decelerations that are shallow, short-lasting,
with normal variability within the deceleration and are coincident
with contractions. They are believed to be caused by fetal head com-pression [25] and do not indicate fetal hypoxia/acidosis.Variable decelerations (V-shaped): decelerations that exhibit a
rapid drop (onset to nadir in less than 30 seconds), good variabilitywithin the deceleration, rapid recovery to the baseline, varyingsize, shape, and relationship to uterine contractions ( Fig. 7 ).
Variable decelerations constitute the majority of decelerations dur-ing labor, and they translate a baroreceptor-mediated response toincreased arterial pressure, as occurs with umbilical cord compres-sion [26]. They are seldom associated with an important degree of
fetal hypoxia/acidosis, unless they evolve to exhibit a U-shaped com-ponent, reduced variability within the deceleration (see late deceler-ations below), and/or their individual duration exceeds 3 minutes[22,27] (see prolonged decelerations below).
Late decelerations (U-shaped and/or with reduced variability):
decelerations with a gradual onset and/or a gradual return tothe baseline and/or reduced variability within the deceleration(Fig. 8 ). Gradual onset and return occurs when more than
30 seconds elapses between the beginning/end of a decelerationand its nadir. When contractions are adequately monitored, late de-celerations start more than 20 seconds after the onset of a contrac-tion, have a nadir after the acme, and a return to the baseline afterthe end of the contraction.These decelerations are indicative of a chemoreceptor-mediated re-sponse to fetal hypoxemia [25,27] . In the presence of a tracing with
no accelerations and reduced variability, the de ﬁnition of late decel-
erations also includes those with an amplitude of 10 −15 bpm.
Prolonged decelerations : lasting more than 3 minutes.
These are likely to include a chemoreceptor-mediated component andthus to indicate hypoxemia. Decelerations exceeding 5 minutes, withFHR maintained at less than 80 bpm and reduced variability withinthe deceleration ( Fig. 9 ), are frequently associated with acute fetal
hypoxia/acidosis [22,28 –30]and require emergent intervention.

4.1.5. Sinusoidal pattern
A regular, smooth, undulating signal, resembling a sine wave, with
an amplitude of 5 −15 bpm, and a frequency of 3 −5 cycles per minute.
This pattern lasts more than 30 minutes, and coincides with absent
accelerations ( Fig. 10 ).
The pathophysiological basis of the sinusoidal pattern is incompletely
understood, but it occurs in association with severe fetal anemia, as is
found in anti-D alloimmunization, fetal-maternal hemorrhage, twin-to-
twin transfusion syndrome, and ruptured vasa previa. It has also been de-
scribed in cases of acute fetal hypoxi a, infection, cardiac malformations,
hydrocephalus, and gastroschisis [31].
4.1.6. Pseudosinusoidal pattern
A pattern resembling the sinusoidal pattern, but with a more jagged
“saw-tooth ”appearance, rather than the smooth sine-wave form
(Fig. 11 ). Its duration seldom exceeds 30 minutes and it is characterized
by normal patterns before and after.
This pattern has been described after analgesic administration to the
mother, and during periods of fetal sucking and other mouth movements[32].I ti ss o m e t i m e sd i f ﬁcult to distinguish the pseudosinusoidal pattern
from the true sinusoidal pattern, leaving the short duration of the formeras the most important variable to discriminate between the two.
4.1.7. Fetal behavioral states
This refers to periods of fetal quiescence re ﬂecting deep sleep
(no eye movements), alternating with periods of active sleep (rapid
eye movements) and wakefulness [33,34] . The occurrence of different
behavioral states is a hallmark of fetal neurological responsivenessand absence of hypoxia/acidosis. Deep sleep can last up to 50 minutes
[21] and is associated with a stable baseline, very rare accelerations,
and borderline variability. Active sleep is the most frequent behavioralstate, and is represented by a moderate number of accelerations andnormal variability. Active wakefulness is rarer and represented by alarge number of accelerations and normal variability ( Fig. 1 ). In the lat-
ter pattern, accelerations may be so frequent as to cause dif ﬁculties in
baseline estimation (see Fig. 1 ). Transitions between the different pat-
terns become clearer after 32 −34 weeks of gestation, consequent to
fetal nervous system maturation.
4.1.8. Contractions
These are bell-shaped gradual increases in the uterine activity signal
followed by roughly symmetric decreases, with 45 −120 seconds in
total duration.
Contractions are essential for the progression of labor, but they com-
press the vessels running inside the myometrium and may transiently
decrease placental perfusion and/or cause umbilical cord compression
[35]. With the tocodynamometer, only the frequency of contractions
can be reliably evaluated, but increased intensity and duration canalso contribute to FHR changes.
Tachysystole : This represents an excessive frequency of contrac-
tions and is de ﬁned as the occurrence of more than ﬁve contractions
in 10 minutes, in two successive 10-minute periods, or averaged
over a 30-minute period.
5. Tracing classi ﬁcation
Tracing classi ﬁcation requires a previous evaluation of basic CTG fea-
tures (see above). Tracings should be classi ﬁed into one of three classes:
normal, suspicious, or pathological, according to the criteria presented
inTable 1 . Other classi ﬁca
 tion systems including a larger number of
tiers are recommended by some experts [36,37] . Due to the changing
nature of CTG signals during labor, re-evaluation of the tracing should
be carried out at least every 30 minutes.

6. Clinical decision
Several factors, including gestational age and medication adminis-
tered to the mother, can affect FHR features (see above), so CTG analysis
needs to be integrated with other clinical information for a comprehen-
sive interpretation and adequate management. As a general rule, if the
fetus continues to maintain a stable baseline and a reassuring variability,
the risk of hypoxia to the central organs is very unlikely. However, the
general principles that should guide clinical management are outlined
inTable 1 .
7. Action in situations of suspected fetal hypoxia/acidosis
When fetal hypoxia/acidosis is anticipated or suspected (suspicious
and pathological tracings), and action is required to avoid adverse neo-
natal outcome, this does not necessarily mean an immediate cesareandelivery or instrumental vaginal delivery. The underlying cause for the
appearance of the pattern can frequently be identi ﬁed and the situation
reversed, with subsequent recovery of adequate fetal oxygenation andthe return to a normal tracing.
Excessive uterine activity is the most frequent cause of fetal hypoxia/
acidosis [35] and it can be detected by documenting tachysystole in the
CTG tracing and/or palpating the uterine fundus. It can usually be re-versed by reducing or stopping oxytocin infusion, removing adminis-
tered prostaglandins if possible, and/or starting acute tocolysis with
beta-adrenergic agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline, ritodrine) [38–40],
atosiban [41], or nitroglycerine [42]. During the second stage of labor,
maternal pushing efforts can also contribute to fetal hypoxia/acidosis
and the mother can be asked to stop pushing until the situation
is reversed.
Aortocaval compression can occur in the supine position and lead to
reduced placental perfusion. Excessive uterine activity may also be asso-
ciated with the supine position [43,44] , possibly due to the stimulation
of the sacral plexus by the uterine weight. In these cases, turning themother to her side is frequently followed by normalization of the CTG
pattern. Transient cord compression is another common cause of CTG
changes (variable decelerations), and these can sometimes be reverted
by changing the maternal position or by performing amnioinfusion [45].
Sudden maternal hypotension can also occur during labor, usually
after epidural or spinal analgesia [46], and it is usually reversible by
rapid ﬂuid administration and/or an intravenous ephedrine bolus.
Other less frequent complications affecting the maternal respiration,
maternal circulation, placenta, umbilical cord, or the fetal circulation
can also result in fetal hypoxia/acidosis [35], and their management is
beyond the scope of this document.
Oxygen administration to the mother is widely used with the objec-
tive of improving fetal oxygenation and consequently normalizing CTGpatterns, but there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials thatthis intervention, when performed in isolation, is effective when mater-
nal oxygenation is adequate [47]. Intravenous ﬂuids are also commonly
used for the purpose of improving CTG patterns, but again there is noevidence from randomized clinical trials to suggest that this interven-
tion is effective in normotensive women [48].
Good clinical judgement is required to diagnose the underlying
cause for a suspicious or pathological CTG, to judge the reversibility of
the conditions with which it is associated, and to determine the timing
of delivery, with the objective of avoiding prolonged fetal hypoxia/
acidosis, as well as unnecessary obstetric intervention. Additional
methods may be used to evaluate fetal oxygenation [49]. When a suspi-
cious or worsening CTG pattern is identi ﬁed, the underlying cause
should be addressed before a pathological tracing develops. If the situa-
tion does not revert and the pattern continues to deteriorate, consider-
ation needs to be given for further evaluation or rapid delivery if a
pathological pattern ensues.
During the second stage of labor, due to the additional effect of ma-
ternal pushing, hypoxia/acidosis may develop more rapidly. Therefore,
urgent action should be undertaken to relieve the situation, including
discontinuation of maternal pushing, and if there is no improvement,delivery should be expedited.
8. Limitations of cardiotocography
Cardiotocography has well-documented limitations, and it is neces-
sary to be aware of these for safe use of the technology.
It has been well demonstrated that CTG analysis is subject to consid-
erab
le intra- and interobserver disagreement, even when experienced
clinicians use widely accepted guidelines [50–52]. The main aspects
that are prone to observer disagreement are the identi ﬁcation and clas-
siﬁcation of decelerations, the evaluation of variability [51], and the
classi ﬁcation of tracings as suspicious and pathological [51,52] . The sub-
jectivity of observer analysis has also been demonstrated in retrospec-
tive audit of tracings, where CTG features are frequently assessed to be
more abnormal in cases with known adverse neonatal outcome [53].
Many studies have evaluated the ability of suspicious and patholog-
ical CTGs to predict the occurrence of hypoxia/acidosis. Different CTG in-
terpretation criteria, different intervals between tracing abnormality
and birth, and different criteria to de ﬁne adverse outcome have been
used, resulting in mixed ﬁndings [54]. However, it is recognized that
hypoxia/acidosis has not been documented shortly after a normal CTG
tracing. On the other hand, suspicious and pathological tracings have a
limited capacity to predict metabolic acidosis and low Apgar scores,
i.e. a large percentage of cases with suspicious and pathological tracings
do not have these outcomes [54]. While there is a strong association be-
tween certain FHR patterns and hypoxia/acidosis, their capacity toTable 1

aThe presence of accelerations denotes a fetus that does not have hypoxia/acidosis, but their absence during labor is of uncertain signi ﬁcance.
bDecelerations are repetitive in nature when they are associated with more than 50% of uterine contractions [29].22 D. Ayres-de-Campos et al. / International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics 131 (2015) 13 –24

discriminate between newborns with or without metabolic acidosis is
limited. Thus, they are sensitive indicators, but have a low speci ﬁcity
and low positive predictive value. However, it should not be forgottenthat the aim of intrapartum fetal monitoring is to identify situations
that precede hypoxia/acidemia so as to avoid fetal injury. The subjectiv-
ity of CTG interpretation and the fact that hypoxia is a continuum that
may not reach the threshold of metabolic acidosis or injury are probablyimportant contributing factors to these limitations.
A large number of randomized controlled trials have been conducted
comparing continuous CTG monitoring with intermittent auscultation
as screening methods for fetal hypoxia/acidosis during labor, in both
low- and high-risk women [1,2]. However, these trials took place in
the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and used different CTG interpretationcriteria, so it is dif ﬁcult to establish how their results relate to current
clinical practice. With these limitations in mind, they indicate a limitedbeneﬁt of continuous CTG for fetal monitoring in all women during
labor, as the only signi ﬁcant improvement was a 50% reduction in neo-
natal seizures (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was not evaluated in
most trials), and no differences were found in the incidences of overall
perinatal mortality and cerebral palsy. However, it is widely recognized
that the trials were underpowered to detect differences in these out-
comes [3]. Only a small proportion of perinatal deaths and cerebral
palsies are caused by intrapartum hypoxia/acidosis, so a large numberof cases are needed to show any bene ﬁt. On the other hand, continuous
CTG was associated with a 63% increase in cesarean delivery and a 15%increase in instrumental vaginal deliveries [1].
Unnecessary obstetric intervention confers additional risks for the
mother and newborn [55,56] , and the former may result from poor
CTG interpretation, limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of fetaloxygenation, and inadequate clinical management. It is recognized
that, for consistent implementation, clinical guidelines need to be
as simple and objective as possible, to allow rapid decision-making
even in complex and stressful situations. In addition, regular and struc-
tured training of the labor ward staff is essential to ensure proper use of
this technology.
