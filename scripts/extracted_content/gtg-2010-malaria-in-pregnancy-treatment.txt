The diagnosis and treatment of malaria 
in pregnancy
Green–top Guideline No. 54b
April 2010RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b 2 of 29 © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThe diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy
This is the first edition of this guideline.
1. Purpose and scope
The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based information on the diagnosis
and treatment of malaria in pregnancy, in situations that are likely to be encountered in UK medical practice.For initial rapid assessment and management, see Appendix 1.
2. Background
Malaria is the most important parasitic infection in humans and is the tropical disease most commonlyimported into the UK, with approximately 1500 cases reported each year and rising, apart from 2008.
1
Approximately 75% of cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum and there is an average of 5–15 deaths a
year (mortality rate approximately 0.5–1.0%).1Immigrants and second- and third-generation relatives
returning home assuming they are immune from malaria are by far the highest risk group. They may take noprophylaxis or may be deterred by the cost, may not adhere to advice, may receive poor advice or somecombination of these factors.
2,3Prevention of malaria is covered in Green-top Guideline No. 54A.4
In the UK, the prevalence of imported malaria in pregnancy is unknown. A review of the burden of malaria in pregnancy estimated that about one in four women in sub-Saharan Africa in areas of stabletransmission has malaria at the time of birth.
5Online and telephone enquiries with the Health Protection
Agency (www.hpa.org.uk) and Eurosurveillance archives (www.eurosurveillance.org) and reviews ofpublished reports failed to uncover a report of maternal death from malaria in UK for the past 10 years.
6
Maternal deaths from malaria are unlikely to be reported when they occur in endemic countries.
Malaria in pregnancy is detrimental to the woman and her fetus and collective data demonstrate that the risk
of adverse effects from untreated malaria in pregnancy outweigh those of treatment.5,6–10The protozoan
parasites P . falciparum , P. v i v a x , P . malariae and P . ovale (extremely rarely P . knowlesi ),11are transmitted by
the bite of a sporozoite-bearing female anopheline mosquito. After a period of pre-erythrocytic developmentin the liver, the blood stage infection, which causes the disease, begins. Parasitic invasion of the erythrocyteconsumes haemoglobin and alters the red cell membrane. This allows 
P . falciparum infected erythrocytes to
cytoadhere (or stick) inside the small blood vessels of brain, kidneys and other affected organs. Cytoadherenceand rosetting (adherence of uninfected red blood cells) interfere with microcirculatory flow and metabolismof vital organs. The hallmark of falciparum malaria in pregnancy is parasites sequestered in the placenta.Sequestered parasites evade host defence mechanisms: splenic processing and filtration. Sequestration is notknown to occur in the benign malarias due to 
P. v i v a x , P. o v a l e and P . malariae . In pregnancy, the adverse
effects of malaria infection result from:
●the systemic infection, comparable to the effects of any severe febrile illness in pregnancy: maternal and fetal
mortality, miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth
●the parasitisation itself: fetal growth restriction and low birth weight, maternal and fetal anaemia, interactionwith HIV , susceptibility of the infant to malaria.
P . falciparum causes greater morbidity (maternal and fetal, principally low birth weight and anaemia) and
mortality than non-falciparum infections5,7–10but there is mounting evidence that P. v i v a x is not as benign as
had been previously thought.12–14Response to antimalarial treatment is multifactorial but is associated with
the degree of prior immunity acquired from repeated exposures in childhood and the background level of
drug resistance. The higher the transmission of malaria, the greater the degree of prior immunity and the morelikely the woman will respond favourably to a drug treatment.
15,16RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b 3o f 2 9 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists3. Identification and assessment of the evidence
A literature search was performed using Medline (November 2009). Keywords used were ‘severe malaria’,
‘uncomplicated malaria’, ‘burden malaria’, ‘congenital malaria’, ‘anaemia malaria’, ‘pregnancy’, ‘treatment’,‘antimalarials’ ‘artesunate’, ‘artemether’, ‘artemether-lumefantrine’, ‘atovaquone-proguanil’, ‘chloroquine’,‘clindamycin’, ‘dihyroartemisinin-piperaquine’, ‘mefloquine’, ‘quinine’, ‘primaquine’, ’UK’, ‘epidemics’, ‘maternalmortality’, ‘pharmacokinetic’ and ‘pregnancy’. Reference lists of the articles identified were hand searched foradditional articles. Other sources used in the development of this guideline included UK malaria treatmentguidelines, published
3and online at the Health Protection Agency, international guidelines from the World
Health Organization17and websites covering malaria and pregnancy. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted
and annotated as ‘good practice points’. Articles on intermittent preventive treatment were specificallyexcluded, as this practice is not recommended in the UK.
4. Limitations of the data used in this guideline
There is no published evidence of treatment efficacy for malaria in pregnant women in the UK or any othernon-endemic country.
18,19There are no randomised controlled trials of antimalarials in the first trimester of
pregnancy.18The evidence for best treatment in pregnancy is gained from endemic areas17,19,20and is not
supported by the availability of drugs or licensing regulations within the UK. Treatment response in UKpregnant women can only be extrapolated from, and is likely to be worse than, treatment responses in semi-immune women. Treatment responses are likely to be closest to those observed in areas of low and unstablemalaria transmission, where malaria in pregnancy is usually symptomatic. Data on malaria in pregnancy,especially epidemic malaria, where the severe effects on pregnant women were recorded, is historical.
21,22In
this guideline, the best available evidence for treatment in pregnancy is published in parallel with UKtreatment guidelines,
3with comments on the guidelines. Availability of drugs within the UK can change and
this guideline promotes the use of evidence-based prescription choices in this vulnerable group.
Overall, 13 randomised controlled trials on the treatment of uncomplicated P . falciparum in pregnancy were
completed in the past 20 years in eight different countries (Africa and Asia) and have included 2254 women
from high and low transmission areas and a total of 16 different antimalarial drug regimens.23–35Seventy-seven
percent (10/13) of the trials followed the women post-treatment until delivery but 46% (6/13) attempted toevaluate the infants at 1 year of life. A 2009 Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that data on uncomplicatedmalaria in pregnancy were scant and, while some combinations appeared effective, data on safety were lacking.

5. Definition of terms used in this guideline
5.1 Severe and complicated malaria
The severe signs of malaria are non-specific and other causes must be excluded before assigning the signs andsymptoms to malaria (Box 1). The parasitaemia of severe malaria can be less than 2%. Pregnant women with2% or more parasitised red blood cells are at higher risk of developing severe malaria and should be treatedwith the severe malaria protocol.
3
5.2 Uncomplicated malaria
Uncomplicated malaria in the UK is defined as fewer than 2% parasitised red blood cells in a woman with nosigns of severity and no complicating features.
3
5.3 Congenital malaria
Congenital malaria in the very young infant or newborn results from the passage of parasites or infected redblood cells from the mother to the newborn while in utero or during delivery and not by the bite of thefemale anopheline mosquito.5 of 29 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsMisdiagnosis has been reported to occur when the leading symptoms are jaundice or respiratory38–40and
possibly gastrointestinal (certainly in children) in nature. Misdiagnosis and delay of treatment are the most
common reasons cited for death from malaria in Europe41,42and the USA.43For the non-falciparum malarias,
the history of travel may be more than 1 year before the onset of symptoms3,43and, for any woman who has
taken prophylaxis, compliance does not rule out the diagnosis of malaria. In the only case series of importedmalaria in pregnant women in Europe (Marseille, France), the majority (14 of 18) had fever and the fourwomen who did not, had thrombocytopenia or anaemia associated with splenomegaly.
44
A history of travel to the tropics and the non-specific nature of the symptoms and signs will lead clinicians toconsider investigating other travel-related diagnoses, according to the region visited; for example, influenza-like illnesses including H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, HIV , meningitis/encephalitisand viral haemorrhagic fevers, hepatitis, dengue fever, scrub and murine typhus and leptospirosis. However,for malaria diagnosis a blood film is vital.
6.2 How should malaria in pregnancy be diagnosed?
Microscopic diagnosis allows species identification and estimation of parasitaemia, so that appropriate
antimalarials can be prescribed.
Rapid detection tests may miss low parasitaemia, which is more likely in pregnant women, and rapid
detections tests are relatively insensitive in P. v i va x malaria.
Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are the standard tools available. The diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy,
as in non-pregnant patients, relies on microscopic examination (the current gold standard) of thick and thinblood films for parasites (Appendix 2) or the use of rapid diagnostic tests which detect specific parasiteantigen or enzyme. Rapid diagnostic tests are less sensitive than malaria blood film.
45,46A positive rapid
diagnostic test should be followed by microscopy to quantify the number of infected red blood cells(parasitaemia) and to confirm the species and the stage of parasites. The rapid diagnostic tests should notreplace blood films, which should always be prepared, even if they cannot immediately be read (assistancecan be provided in the UK; Box 3).A
CBox 2. Symptoms and signs of malaria
Symptoms
● Fever/chills/sweats
● Headache
● Muscle pain
● Nausea
● Vomiting
● Diarrhea
● Cough
● General malaise
Signs
● Jaundice
● Elevated temperature
● Perspiration
● Pallor
● Splenomegaly
● Respiratory distressIn a febrile patient, three negative malaria smears 12–24 hours apart rules out the diagnosis of malaria.
In a case series of pregnant women from France, all women were identified as positive for malaria by
microscopy.44There are occasions for suspicions to remain high and expert advice should be sought in such
circumstances. Women who have taken prophylaxis may have their parasitaemia suppressed below the levelof microscopic detection (total biomass 108 parasites) and details of prophylaxis (name, where it was bought– in case of fake drug – dosing and adherence) should be sought. Stop prophylaxis on admission to hospital.Pregnant women with a high background immune level may have negative peripheral blood thick films butparasites sequestered in the placenta (for example, a recently arrived woman from a high malaria-endemiccountry with an unexplained anaemia).
47
Other important prognostic factors that should be reported on a peripheral blood smear result are:
●the presence and count of mature trophozoites and schizonts of P . falciparum
●finding malaria pigment in more than 5% of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the peripheral blood
film.48,49

Women with malaria in pregnancy should have the severity of their condition assessed and documented
as an aid to management.
The clinical condition is the most important indicator of severity and should be assessed promptly (Box 1). A
helpful summary of the key points for use in the emergency department has been made available via theBritish Infection Society website (www.britishinfectionsociety.org). The severity of malaria determines thetreatment and predicts the case fatality rate. In uncomplicated malaria, fatality rates are low: approximately0.1% for 
P . falciparum . In severe malaria, particularly in pregnancy, fatality rates are high (15–20% in
nonpregnant women compared with 50% in pregnancy).17,38,50,51Brabin estimated mortality to be 2–10 times
higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women in endemic areas.52The non-falciparum species are
rarely fatal but caution should still be observed.12,53
Once the disease has been classified as severe/complicated (as defined in Section 5.1 and Box 1 of thisguideline) or uncomplicated malaria (as defined in Section 5.2 of this guideline) prompt treatment should beinstituted.
7. How is malaria infection treated during pregnancy?
Treat malaria in pregnancy as an emergency.
Admit pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria to hospital and pregnant women with severe and
complicated malaria to an intensive care unit.
Intravenous artesunate is the treatment of choice for severe falciparum malaria. Use intravenous
quinine if artesunate is not available.
Use quinine and clindamycin to treat uncomplicated P . falciparum (or mixed, such as P . falciparum and
P. v i va x ).
Use chloroquine to treat P. v i va x , P. ova l e or P . malariae .
Primaquine should not be used in pregnancy.
Seek advice from infectious diseases specialists, especially for severe and recurrent cases.Do not persist with oral therapy if vomiting is persistent.
Treat the fever with antipyretics.
Screen women with malaria for anaemia and treat appropriately.Write a management plan for follow-up, to ensure detection of relapse.
7.1 Drug treatment
Delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with death from severe malaria.42,54–56Use the treatment

AB7.2 Who should prescribe treatment for malaria infection in pregnancy? 
In the UK, treatment prescription is limited to physicians. Treatment in pregnancy, particularly of severe and
recurrent malaria, is best given with expert advice (Table 2).
7.3 Where should treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection take place?
In the UK, it is advisable to hospitalise all pregnant women with P . falciparum , as the clinical condition can
deteriorate rapidly.3,59–62Blood films are usually monitored every 24 hours but clinical deterioration is an
indication for a repeat blood film.

switched to oral artesunate 2 mg/kg (or IM artesunate 2.4 mg/kg) 
once daily, plus clindamycin. If oral artesunate is not available, use a 
3-day course of Riamet® (GSK) or atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®,Novartis) or a 7-day course of quinine and clindamycin at 450 mg 3 times a day 7 days.
ALTERNATIVELY

aSevere and complicated malaria published evidence, see Appendix 3.1; 
bUncomplicated malaria published evidence, see Appendix 3.2; 
cNon-falciparum malaria published evidence, see Appendix 3.3; IM = intramuscular, IV = intravenoushave directly addressed the question of routine iron and folate supplementation as part of uncomplicated
malaria treatment. In P . falciparum malaria treatment trials in women with low premunition, 90% of women
developed anaemia (haemoglobin less than 10 g/dl), either on admission or during follow-up.80Premunition
is the degree of naturally acquired host immunity to malaria. It depends on repeated exposure to infectiousanopheline bites, so most UK-based residents will have low or no premunition. Mild and moderate malaria-associated anaemia is treated with ferrous sulphate and folic acid at the usual doses.
7.6 Does pregnancy affect the efficacy of malaria treatments?
Treatments in pregnancy may have lower efficacy than in non-pregnant patients but this apparent effect couldresult from lowered concentrations of antimalarials in pregnancy.
26,30,32Women should be advised of the risk
of recurrence and a suitable follow-up plan devised; for example, if symptoms or fever return, a repeat bloodfilm is necessary. Alternatively, weekly screening by blood film can provide early detection and treatment ofmalaria. This has been shown to reduce maternal death from malaria in Thailand.
10There is no evidence of
weekly blood film use in the UK but Thailand is a low endemic area so immune levels would not be muchhigher than those in women from the UK who were not immune.
Malaria in pregnancy is unique and the ability of 
P . falciparum to sequester in the placenta challenges the
normal way antimalarial drug efficacy is assessed.37Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed prolonged
submicroscopic carriage with subsequent recurrence has been reported in pregnant women for months
following drug treatment for uncomplicated P . falciparum . Most recurrence is around day 28–42 but late-
reported recurrence, so far unique to pregnancy, has been reported to occur at 85 days with quinine,2898 days
with artesunate, 63 days with artemether-lumefantrine30and 121 days with mefloquine.81Weekly screening by
blood film until delivery allows these women to be detected positive before becoming symptomatic.10
7.7 How should recurrence be treated?
The treatment efficacy of antimalarials for recurrent malaria in pregnancy has been described in only a hand-ful of trials.
30,82–84The cure rates for uncomplicated malaria with quinine fell from 77.0% to 61.0% ( P= 0.03)
and for mefloquine from 72.0% to 62.5% ( P> 0.05) when these drugs were used to treat primary and
recurrent infections.82The alternative regimen for recurrent malaria at that time (1995–1997) was artesunate
monotherapy, which had a cure rate of 84%. In another study, the PCR-confirmed cure rates of women treatedin the second and third trimesters of pregnancy were highest when the infection on admission to the studywas primary (the first for the pregnancy) and lowest when the infection was recrudescent (failure of previousdrug treatment in pregnancy).
82Infections that recur following treatment are likely to be intrinsically less
sensitive to the drugs used against them. A highly effective 7-day treatment has more chance of curing thepatient. All the trials of recurrent malaria in pregnancy rely on artemisinin derivatives.
Unfortunately, the options for treatment of recurrent infection in pregnancy in the UK are limited but, if
quinine and clindamycin has failed as first-line treatment, an alternative should be considered. Atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate
83and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine84have been used in pregnant women with
multiple recurrent infections with good effect. Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®, GlaxoSmithKline) isavailable in the UK and, as noted earlier, was highly effective against uncomplicated 
P . falciparum malaria even
when it was not combined with artesunate.85Note that oral artesunate can be obtained from IDIS Pharma
(Table 2). The World Health Organization recommended regimen of 7 days of artesunate (2 mg/kg/day or 100 mg daily for 7 days) and clindamycin (450 mg three times daily for 7 days) could be given.
8. How are pregnancy-related complications of severe malaria managed?
Monitor for hypoglycaemia regularly, as it can be profound and persistent in malaria in pregnancy and
can be exacerbated by quinine.
10 of 29 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsBRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b 11 of 29 © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsPrevent mortality from pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome by clinical
assessment of jugular venous or central venous pressure, aimed at keeping right arterial pressure lessthan 10 cm H2O.
Women who are severely anaemic should be transfused slowly, preferably with packed cells and
intravenous frusemide 20 mg. Alternatively, exchange transfusion may be considered in centres wherethis can be performed safely.
Secondary bacterial infection should be suspected if the patient becomes hypotensive.
Severe malaria in pregnancy is a medical emergency and women should be treated in a high-dependency or
intensive care unit, according to their condition and without delay. The World Health Organization’s 2006malaria treatment guidelines detail the treatment of severe malaria and do not need to be repeated here.
17
Common clinical manifestations and management of severe malaria have been summarised (Table 3).17,50While
hypoglycaemia, pulmonary oedema, severe anaemia and secondary bacterial infection can occur in severemalaria in non-pregnant patients, they are more common and severe in pregnant women.
3,39,40,50,86
Hypoglycaemia is commonly asymptomatic, although it may be associated with fetal bradycardiaand other signs of fetal distress. In the most severely ill women, it is associated with lactic acidosisand high mortality.
68In patients who have been given quinine, abnormal behaviour, sweating and
sudden loss of consciousness are the usual manifestations. The hypoglycaemia of quinine is causedby hyperinsulinaemia and remains the most common and important adverse effect of this drug.
87
The hypoglycaemia may be profound, recurrent and intractable in pregnancy73,87,88and regular
monitoring of glucose is required while under quinine treatment. It may present late in the diseasewhen the patient appears to be recovering. Quinine at treatment doses does not induce abortionor labour.

Manifestation or complication Management
Coma (cerebral malaria) Monitor using Glasgow Coma Score. Maintain airway, place patient on her left side, exclude
tr
eatable causes of coma (e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacterial meningitis)
Hyperpyrexia Administer tepid sponging, fanning and antipyretic drugs
Convulsions Maintain airway; treat promptly with intravenous or rectal diazepam
Hypoglycaemia Check blood glucose regularly, correct hypoglycaemia and maintain with glucose-containing
(blood glucose < 2.2 mmol/l or infusion. Quinine induced hypoglycaemia can occur quite late in the course even after the 
<40 mg/100 ml) patient appears to be recovering
Severe anaemia Transfuse with packed red cells
(haemoglobin <8 g/100 ml or 
packed cell volume <24%)
Acute pulmonary oedema Prevent by monitoring jugular venous pressure(JVP)/central venous pressure (CVP) to keep 
(possible overlay of acute respiratory right arterial pressure <10 cm H2O. Treat by propping patient up at an angle of 45 degrees,
distress syndrome) give oxygen, give a diuretic, stop intravenous fluids, intubate and add positive end-expiratory
pressure/continuous positive airway pressure in life-threatening hypoxaemia
Renal failure Exclude pre-renal causes, check fluid balance and urinary sodium; if in established renal failure,
add haemofiltration or haemodialysis or, if unavailable, peritoneal dialysis. The benefits of
diuretics/dopamine in acute renal failure are not proven
Spontaneous bleeding and Transfuse with screened fresh whole blood (cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma and platelets 
coagulopathy if available); give Vitamin K by injection
Metabolic acidosis Prevent by careful fluid balance; observation of JVP/CVP by central venous access helps 
optimise fluid balance and avoids overfilling. Exclude or treat hypoglycaemia, hypovolaemia and septicaemia. If severe, add haemofiltration or haemodialysis
Shock Suspect septicaemia, take blood for cultures; give parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobials,
correct haemodynamic disturbancesPulmonary oedema may be present on admission or may develop suddenly and unexpectedly. It
may develop immediately after childbirth.38Pulmonary oedema is a grave complication of severe
malaria, with a high mortality of over 50%.39,40,86,90–93The first indication of impending pulmonary
oedema is an increase in the respiratory rate, which precedes the development of other chest signs.Ensure that the pulmonary oedema has not resulted from iatrogenic fluid overload and monitor thecentral venous pressure and urine output. In some women, acute respiratory distress syndrome canoccur in addition to the pulmonary oedema. Once this syndrome develops, the patient needs fluidrestriction.
Severe anaemia is associated with maternal morbidity, an increased risk of postpartum
haemorrhage and perinatal mortality.
8,39,51,52,90,93–96Women who go into labour when severely anaemic
or fluid-overloaded may develop acute pulmonary oedema after separation of the placenta. Monitorhaemoglobin and transfuse as necessary. Exchange transfusion may be considered but there is noclear evidence base.
97
Secondary bacterial infection, principally Gram-negative septicaemia, has been reported; the patientis collapsed with a systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg in the supine position.
55,98,99Blood
cultures should be taken if the patient shows signs of shock or fever returns after apparent feverclearance, Broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone) should be started immediately. Oncethe results of blood culture and sensitivity testing are available, give the appropriate antibiotic.
9. Obstetric management specific to malaria infection in pregnancy
9.1 Common obstetric problems with acute symptomatic malaria
Preterm labour, fetal growth restriction and fetal heart rate abnormalities can occur in malaria in
pregnancy.
In severe malaria complicated by fetal compromise, a multidisciplinary team approach (intensive care
specialist, infectious disease specialist, obstetrician, neonatologist) is required to plan optimalmanagement of mother and baby.
Stillbirth and premature delivery in malaria in pregnancy are best prevented with prompt and effective
antimalarial treatment.
Uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy is not a reason for induction of labour.
Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis should be weighed up against the risk of haemorrhage and
should be withheld if the platelet count is falling or less than 100, indicating thrombocytopenia.
Peripartum malaria is an indication for placental histology and placenta, cord and baby blood films to
detect congenital malaria at an early stage.
Inform women of the risk of vertical transmission and, in the presence of positive placental blood films,
that fever in the infant could indicate malaria; a blood film from the baby is required for confirmation.
Commonsense obstetrics applies to the management of the adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy.
Efficacious and prompt treatment of malaria in the woman reduces the systemic effects of parasitaemia andreduces the adverse effects on the fetus, such as fetal distress.
In severe malaria, cardiotocograph monitoring may reveal fetal tachycardia, bradycardia or late
decelerations in relation to uterine contractions, indicating fetal distress, particularly in the

and should be prescribed. Maternal hypoglycaemia should be excluded as the cause of fetal distress,
particularly if treatment is with quinine. Tocolytic therapy and prophylactic steroid therapy at theusual obstetric doses should be considered if there are no contraindications.

Historic records indicate a high fetal loss rate with malaria in pregnancy.101,102In a more recent 
study from the Kenyan coast, Dorman et al.103found that the risk of preterm delivery in women
with histological evidence of past placental malaria infection compared with women withoutinfection was more than twice as high (relative risk [RR] 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]1.31–4.13; 
P= 0.004).
Abnormalities in fetal and placental circulation have been noted on Doppler studies. In one study,23 women with acute malaria reported that the umbilical artery resistance index increased by 5 to20% (
P< 0.05), with evidence of cerebral redistribution.103,104In the second observational study in
Kenya, malaria infection at 32–35 weeks of gestation was associated with abnormal uterine arteryflow velocity waveforms on the day of blood testing (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.24–3.59; 
P= 0.006).103
In women with severe malaria, obstetric advice should be sought at an early stage. The paediatricianshould be alerted and the mother’s blood glucose checked frequently, particularly whenintravenous quinine is administered. Fetal distress is common and has been related to malaria fever:late (type II) decelerations of the fetal heart rate were recorded in six women before treatment but,in most women, signs of fetal distress diminished as the maternal temperature fell.
73Standard
obstetric principles apply: the life of the woman comes first. There are no formal studies butinstrumental birth in the second stage of labour in the presence of maternal or fetal distress isindicated, if there are no contraindications. In severe malaria, the role of early caesarean section forthe viable fetus is unproven.
Acute malaria can cause thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.
105Two studies have examined the effects
on postpartum haemorrhage, which was reported to be higher in malarious areas compared with
non-malarious areas of Papua New Guinea.106One further trial found an increased mean blood loss
in women with malaria but no increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage.107
In more than 3000 pregnant women who have participated in uncomplicated malaria treatmenttrials
7,24,26–29,43,53,80,82–84,108–121and have been prospectively followed from diagnosis of malaria through
treatment and birth, no routine induction of labour occurred unless it was indicated on obstetricgrounds.
There is usually no need for pregnant women with malaria infection to receive thromboprophyl-
axis. Acute malaria causes thrombocytopenia
105and, in severe malaria, can cause disseminated
intravascular coagulation.50Thrombocytopenia recovers with treatment: 90% by day 7 and 100% by
day 14, irrespective of the type of antimalarial treatment.105
Antimalarial drugs can clear peripheral parasitaemia more quickly than from the placenta.122
Maternal malaria close to delivery can result in congenital malaria, which can cause significantmortality.
123Congenital malaria may present in the first weeks to months of life. A negative placental
blood film at delivery in a woman who has had malaria in pregnancy eliminates the risk ofcongenital malaria significantly. Placenta- and cord-positive blood films result in a higher chance ofcongenital malaria than placenta-positive, cord-negative blood films. Send the placenta forhistopathology, as it is more sensitive than microscopy for detection of placental parasites.

Does a case of malaria in pregnancy in the UK need reporting?
In the UK, malaria in pregnancy must be reported to the public health authorities and the Health Protection
Agency (www.hpa.org.uk) and slides, plus a blood aliquot, should be sent to the Malaria Reference Laboratoryfor confirmation, which is performed free of charge.

histopatholgy.
Blood films are also commonly called ‘malaria slide’, ‘thick
and thin films’, ‘malaria smear’ or ‘blood slide’. A few dropsof the patient’s blood are required for the test. A briefsummary is provided in Figure 1.
There are many useful websites (including videos) on how
to prepare a thick and thin blood film. For detailedinstructions, try: www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Malaria.htm or www.helid.desastres.net – select ‘Parasitic and VectorBorne Disease’ from the topic list (Basic Malaria Microscopy,Learning Unit 4) or see the laboratory handout from:www.shoklo-unit.com/lab.shoklo-unit.com/index.html.
Cord blood film or placental blood films require a few drops
of blood collected from those sites.
Cord specimens can be obtained before delivery of the
placenta. Hold the clamped end of the cord above the levelof the umbilicus. Wipe the cord clean, puncture the cordwith a syringe and needle (small gauge) and withdraw bloodfrom the vessel (0.2 ml is plenty) and reclamp the cordabove the puncture site. The blood obtained needs to godirectly onto the glass slide before it clots (see Figure 1).
Placental blood can be obtained by placing the placenta
maternal surface upward. Choose a site midway between theedge of the placenta and the cord, wipe it clean with gauze,make an incision about 1 cm deep and 3–4 cm in lengthwith a scalpel blade (do not pierce the fetal surface) and usea syringe and needle (or haematocrit tube) to withdrawblood that pools in the incised area. Place this blood onto theglass slide before it clots.
Label all blood films clearly with the site from which they
were obtained (for example, mother, cord, placenta or baby)before sending to the laboratory. This histopathologicalsection can be obtained from the same site on the placentaby cutting a 1 × 1 × 1 cm (or smaller) block from thematernal surface through to the fetal surface and placing itin fixative.
Step 4. Allow the slide to dry before stainingStep 3. Stir the thick dropStep 1. Put 3 drops of blood onto the slide
Step 2. Use another slide to spread the drop

The first line of treatment in the UK for severe malaria in pregnancy is intravenous quinine1while the World
Health Organization (WHO) and an increasing number of countries throughout the world recommend
intravenous (IV) artesunate as the preferred first-line drug for all severe malaria in adults including pregnantwomen.
2This recommendation was based partly on two WHO informal consultations on the safety of
artemisinins in pregnancy.3The first of these reported normal pregnancy outcomes in 124 women exposed
in the first trimester. The conclusions were that there was insufficient evidence to support the use ofartemisinin in the first trimester but that it should not be withheld if the life of the woman was endangeredor if other antimalarials were considered unsuitable. The recommendation also relied upon a meta-analysis ofartemisinins for severe malaria
4and a large, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) of
severe malaria carried out mostly in adults (including pregnant women) in South East Asia, where the trial wasstopped prematurely because of a significantly increased risk of mortality in the intravenous quinine group(22% compared with 15% in the IV artesunate group).
5Mortality was reduced by 34.7% (95% confidence
interval 18.5–47.6; P= 0.002) when IV artesunate was used or, for every 13 people treated with IV artesunate
rather than IV quinine, one death was averted. In the same trial, quinine use was associated withhypoglycaemia (relative risk 3.9, 
P= 0.002). This is pertinent in pregnancy, since severe and recurrent
hypoglycaemia associated with severe malaria pregnancy is exacerbated by quinine use, which stimulatesinsulin secretion.
6,7These effects are more likely in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and it is in
these trimesters that the efficacy and safety data of use of artemisinin derivatives are reassuring.8A meta-
analysis of all RCTs comparing parenteral quinine with artesunate indicated that artesunate was associatedwith a 35% reduction in mortality.
4Artesunate kills circulating ring-stage parasites and so prevents
sequestration, which quinine does not, and it is this mechanism of action,9not quinine resistance, that has
been proposed for the significant reduction in mortality with IV artesunate compared when compared withIV quinine.
5Every effort should be made to obtain IV artesunate (see Table 2 of the main report for contact
details) for pregnant women with severe malaria, regardless of trimester, in an effort to prevent maternaldeath. Parenteral quinine should be given without delay if artesunate is unavailable but treatment should beswitched to artesunate as soon as possible.
Parenteral artesunate is not currently licensed in the UK. The IV artesunate used in the multicentre study was
not made to internationally recognised good manufacturing practice standards.
5Good manufacturing practice
IV artesunate is still not available and has not been licensed in the UK.1TropNetEurop has advocated strongly
for the use of IV artesunate for severe malaria.10It can be made available in the UK from specialist tropical
disease centres in London, Oxford and Liverpool or commercially from and Idis Pharma, who can send IV andoral artesunate to patients who need it (see Table 2 of the main report for contact details).
Treatment of malaria should never be delayed (IV quinine should be used promptly while obtaining IV
artesunate). The UK guidelines explain expert consultation is required before the artesunate will be issued.
1
Severe malaria in pregnancy provides an urgent and pressing reason for artesunate to be issued (although thisis not in the current guidelines).
1IV clindamycin is a very slow-acting antimalarial and it is unlikely to add any
additional value to IV artesunate, which is the fastest acting of all antimalarial drugs. In endemic countries, thetreatment course when the patient is well enough to eat and drink would be any artemisinin combinationtherapy.
2The only artemisinin available in the UK is Riamet® (Novartis; also known as Coartem in some
countries), which can be used at standard doses, alternatively, a treatment course of atovaquone-proguanil(Malarone®, GlaxoSmithKline), four standard tablets daily for 3 days could be prescribed. Artesunate can be given intramuscularly at 2.4 mg/kg/24 hours (or oral artesunate at 2 mg/kg when available) to complete7 days, with oral clindamycin for 7 days. Although not ideal, quinine and clindamycin can be given at thestandard dose for 7 days (see Table 1 of the main report) if the preferred treatment is not available.APPENDIX III: Summary of the published evidence on pregnancy treatment recommendationsRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b 22 of 29 © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsUncomplicated malaria
Quinine is not thought to be teratogenic.10–14There is no RCT on quinine efficacy in pregnancy from Africa,
where most UK patients acquire their malaria infection. Quinine is assumed to be safe and efficacious, based
on historical data15,16and on published trials, mostly from women from South East Asia.17Unacceptably high
failure rates have been reported with quinine monotherapy when treatment has been given in the context ofan RCT. In six trials from Thailand and Burma,
18–24in all except one,18there were 186 women who received
quinine monotherapy and it is no longer recommended.2Clindamycin augments the efficacy of quinine
significantly.22The single RCT on the effectiveness of 5 days of quinine in pregnancy resulted in failure rates
greater than 30%.24As quinine is a rapidly eliminated antimalarial,25cure rates are improved with 7 day
regimens, although they are poorly complied with. Note that the 5 day recommendation in the UK guidelinesis for non-pregnant adults and should not be used in pregnancy.
1Patients may deteriorate under treatment, at
which point, management should be upgraded to account for severity.
The safety of clindamycin in pregnancy has been established in non-malaria studies.26–33It has been shown to
be effective when used in combination against falciparum malaria in numerous settings,34–36including in
pregnancy.22,37–39
WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy in the second and third trimesters,2,8ahead 
of quinine and clindamycin, principally because of the adverse effects and risk of non-compliance with the 
7-day regimen. There are now reassuring data on more than 2000 pregnancy outcomes with the use ofartemisinins,
5,20–22,40,41–60principally for uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy. Most of these studies have been
RCTs in pregnant women from Africa and Asia.20,21,40–44This means there is now more published evidence on
artemisinins in pregnancy than there is for quinine. Only one of these highly effective therapies is available inthe UK (Riamet®, Novartis). For nonpregnant adults in the UK, malaria treatment guidelines prescribe threeoral regimens for uncomplicated malaria, including oral quinine and doxycycline; atovaquone-proguanil, fourstandard tablets daily for 3 days; and Riamet, four tablets/day for weight over 35 kg. While doxycycline can bereplaced with clindamycin and combined with quinine, the other two regimens have no alternatives but havebeen studied in the context of RCTs in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
Atovaquone-proguanil alone (
n= 26)61and atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate ( n= 100)20,47,49,61were safe and
efficacious for uncomplicated P . falciprum in the second and third trimesters. Tinnitus was reported in 79.3%
of those on quinine compared with 24.1% of those treated with atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate ( P< 0.001)
in the RCT.20Of the 126 women treated, most were followed through until pregnancy outcome and no
adverse effects for the mother or fetus were observed. The product information sheet for Malarone® says that,
while there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atovaquone and/or proguanil hydrochloride inpregnant women, Malarone ‘may be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus’
62. The
same product information sheet also ignores the largest single site study ever performed on Malarone, whichincluded 1596 nonpregnant patients randomised to receive atovaquone-proguanil, atovaquone-proguanil-artesunate or artesunate-mefloquine for uncomplicated malaria and followed-up for 42 days.
63Adding
artesunate to atovaquone-proguanil reduced the risk of failure three-fold (95% CI 1.1–8.2) although the curerate of atovaquone-proguanil (without the addition of artesunate) was very high, 97.2% (95% CI 95.4–98.4).Atovaquone-proguanil (with or without artesunate) is likely to be a useful 3-day treatment in the treatment of
P . falciparum in the second and third trimesters if it has not been used for prophylaxis (see Green-top
Guideline No. 54A).64
At the time of writing, there is only one published RCT on artemether-lumefantrine treatment in pregnancy(
n= 125) and, while the drug was well tolerated with no adverse effects on the mother or fetus, the efficacy
was disappointing, with a cure rate (by delivery or day 42 if later) of 82.0% (95% CI 74.8–89.3; P= 0.054).42
Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated lowered concentrations of artemether and lumefantrine in pregnancy.57
Polymerase chain reaction confirmed that failures were as early as day 14 and 53% (9/17) had occurred at 3weeks. Mathematical modelling has suggested an increase in the dose and length of treatment would result in23 of 29 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistshigher cure rates.65Two abstracts presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual
Meeting in December 2008 analysed:
●1001 pregnant women (artemether and lumefantrine treated, n= 495 and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
treated, n= 506) and their fetuses or newborns (artemether and lumefantrine treated, n= 470 and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, n= 477) and reported no adverse effects on the fetus55
●preliminary results on 304 women who received artemether-lumefantrine or quinine as part of an RCT in
Uganda on uncomplicated malaria in the second and third trimesters, which demonstrated high efficacy andno adverse effects on the fetus.
The product information sheet applies the usual pharmaceutical safeguard statement that ‘it should not be
withheld in life-threatening situations, where no other effective antimalarials are available. During the secondand third trimester, treatment should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs therisk to the fetus’, until dose optimisation studies are completed.
66However, given the reassuring data on nearly
1000 pregnant women, and the fact that it is available in the UK, it can be recommended in second and thirdtrimesters.
Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are no longer recommended for 
P . falciparum treatment, owing
to resistance,1with supporting data from poor efficacy in RCTs in pregnant women.41,43,67,68
Non-falciparum malaria
The first step in the treatment in the UK of the non-falciparum infections P. v i v a x , P. o v a l e and P . malariae (and
P . knowlesi ) is chloroquine to treat the symptoms caused by blood-stage infection (see Table 1 of the main
text).1For P. v i v a x and P. o v a l e , there is a second step: the treatment of the liver-stage hypnozoites (radical
cure), which causes relapse, sometimes years later. In nonpregnant adults, a course of primaquine is normally
prescribed.69In the UK, more than 10% of patients with imported P. v i v a x treated with chloroquine followed
by unsupervised primaquine 15 mg/day for 14 days relapse70and higher-dose primaquine 30 mg/day for 14
days has been found to be more effective.71,72Hence, there are different dosing schedules for P . ovale and P.
vivax . Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy, as it could induce haemolysis and methaemo-globinaemia
in the fetus.73,74Therefore, radical cure in pregnancy is not recommended until after delivery. There are no data
on primaquine in breast milk. Fetal red blood cells are almost entirely replaced by adult red blood cells by 6months of life. It is advisable to wait for some replacement of fetal red blood cells with adult red blood cells,which are less sensitive to haemolysis, before radical cure with primaquine in the mother. There are nopublished data on the use of primaquine treatment in young infants, so a cut-off age cannot be recommended,but 3 months of age is likely to be safe. To prevent relapse of 
P. v i v a x or P. o v a l e before delivery, weekly
chloroquine (300 mg) can be given (see Table 1 of the main report). It is safe and effective and has beenstudied in a large RCT involving 1000 women. Infants were followed to 1 year of life and no adverse effectsfor the mother or fetus were observed.
75
Evidence from nonpregnant patients has demonstrated that chloroquine-resistant P. v i v a x should be treated
in the same way as chloroquine resistant P . falciparum .45,76–79However, the UK guidelines recommend
chloroquine and alternative treatment if there are persistent parasites or symptoms present. In pregnantwomen, this could result in the onset of premature labour, whereas effective first-line treatment can preventthis outcome. The combination of quinine and clindamycin is likely to have higher cure rates than chloroquinefor women with 
P. v i v a x infection and a history of travel in Indonesia or Papua New Guinea.45,78,79
Where blood or plasma concentrations of antimalarial drugs have been measured in late pregnancy, they haveusually been found to be reduced, indicating under-dosing. For artemether, dihyroartemisinin, atovaquone,proguanil and lumefantrine, the reductions have been substantial and are likely to have contributed to poortherapeutic responses.

has been described.1This phenomenon is described in the placenta of a 19-year-old woman with falciparum
malaria, who was treated with a combination of quinidine and clindamycin. Although this therapy was
effective and diminished (her peripheral blood parasitemia from 3% at presentation to almost undetectable atthe time of delivery) vast numbers of 
P . falciparum -infected erythrocytes were present in the maternal
sinusoids of the placenta. This sequestration of infected erythrocytes produced a local parasitaemia in theplacenta of 70–80%. Additionally, rare 
Plasmodium -infected erythrocytes were also seen in the fetal blood of
the placenta. Malaria in pregnancy and parasitic involvement of the placenta are reviewed and it isemphasised that 
Plasmodium -infected erythrocytes may persist in the placenta even after clearance of
parasites from the peripheral blood.

Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in
making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematicallydeveloped using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in ClinicalGovernance Advice No. 1: Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website
at 
www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/development-rcog-green-top-guidelines-
policies-and-processes ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of
management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resourcesand limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process oflocal ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areasof clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated within the appropriate health services.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme. Once adapted for local use, theseguidelines are no longer representative of the RCOG.29 of 29 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 54b © Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThis Guideline was produced on behalf of the Guidelines Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists by: Dr R McGready PhD Dip RANZCOG, Mae Sot, Thailand; Dr EA Ashley PhD, London; Professor FNosten MD PhD, Mae Sot, Thailand; Dr M Rijken MD PhD, Mae Sot, Thailand; A Dundorp MD PhD, Bangkok, Thailand.
This guideline was peer reviewed by: Dr A Diaf MRCOG, Birmingham; RCOG Consumers’ Forum; Mr SA Walkinshaw
MRCOG, Liverpool; Dr C Whitty FRCP , London; the Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention in UK Travellers: Dr BABannister FRCP , London; Dr D Lalloo FRCP , Liverpool; Professor P Chiodini FRCP , London.
The Guidelines Committee lead peer reviewers were: Dr ALM David MRCOG, London, and Professor F McAuliffe

The final version is the responsibility of the Guidelines Committee of the RCOG.
The guideline review process will commence in 2013

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical
practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, forconsideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgementregarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the lightof clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available within the appropriatehealth series.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. Onceadapted for local use, these guidelines no longer represent the views of the RCOG.
