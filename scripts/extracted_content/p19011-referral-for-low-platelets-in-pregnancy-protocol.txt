Referral for Low Platelets in Pregnancy Protocol 

1.0 Aim of this document 
 
To provide staff with a clear process for referral of women/people with a low platelet count 
during pregnancy. 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This guideline applies to all staff who care and make clinical judgements for pregnant women/people 
including: 
 
 Midwives 
 Obstetricians 
 Anaesthetists 
 Haematologists 
 
3.0 Introduction 
 
 Thrombocytopenia occurs in 8 –10% of all pregnancies. 
 In pregnancy it is usually mild and benign. 
 Rare causes can be associated with severe complications for mother and bab y. 
 
During pregnancy there is a general downward drift in platelet count, particularly during the 
last trimester. This results at term in a level that is approximately 10% less than the pre -
pregnancy level. The mechanisms for this are thought to be a combination of dilutional effects 
and acceleration of platelet destruction across the placenta. 
 
Most pregnant women /people still have platelet counts within the normal range; however, if the 
starting count is at the lower end of the normal range, or there is a more severe drop, 
thrombocytopenia occurs. Hence thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy. Most 
cases are mild and have no significance for mother or fetus but, in some instances, where 
thrombocytopenia is part of a complex clinical disorder, there can be profound and even life -
threatening results for both mother /birthing parent and baby. The effect of pregnancy on the 
disorder and, conversely, of the disorder on the pregnancy, mus t be taken into account. In 
some instances, the aetiology is unique to pregnancy and the puerperium. ( RCOG 2009 ) 
 
This protocol is to set out a clear referral pathway to manage new onset thrombocytopenia in 
pregnancy. Please see CG21008 Management of high risk mate rnal medicine conditions for 
management of pre-existing thrombocytopenia during pregnancy.
