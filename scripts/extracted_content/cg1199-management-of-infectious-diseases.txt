3.0 Responsibilities 
 
3.1 Midwives, Obstetricians and Microbiology staff: 
 
â€¢ To access, read, understand and follow this guidance. 
â€¢ To use their professional judgement in application of this guideline. 
â€¢ This guidance is for staff employed by Western Sussex Hospitals Trust. The 
guidance is flexible and should be tailored to the individual circumstances of the 
parents. If the guidance is not being followed, documentation of the reasoning 
and/or justification is essential, with clear documentation of alternative plans and 
discussions. 
 
3.2 Management: 
 
â€¢ To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations. 
â€¢ To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff. Page 6 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 4.0 HIV 
 
All pregnant women/people are offered screening for HIV each pregnancy as part of the 
antenatal screening process which occurs at booking. They can request additional screening 
at any time during the pregnancy. 
 
â€¢ If a pregnant woman/person declines screening, this must be entered on maternity 
Information system (MIS), noted on the risk form and the Screening Team notified. 
â€¢ A formal re -offer of screening must be made by 20 weeks and documented in the 
maternity notes and on MIS. This offer consists of a letter with written information 
about the benefits of screening and the offer of an appointment and contact details. 
â€¢ Cases of known HIV should be documented on both the booking blood form and the 
antenatal risk assessment by the booking midwife. 
â€¢ Antenatal HIV care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) who are 
responsible for following the current British HIV Association (BHIVA) guideline. 
 
4.1 Positive result 
 
â€¢ Consultant Microbiologist informs Antenatal Screening Co-ordinator (ASC) and 
Sexual Health Advisor via generic email. 
â€¢ Commence WSFHT Maternity HIV Pathway and Care Plan for Neonate of HIV 
Positive Woman. 
â€¢ The Screening team will liaise with the Health Advisor regarding the positive result 
â€¢ Pregnant women/people with positive screening test results should be contacted 
and advised about the result, at an appointment made for that purpose, within 10 
working days of the result being available to maternity services. 
â€¢ Screening team midwife will ensure patient has information using IDPS patient 
information leaflet. 
â€¢ ASC will liaise with the Consultants in Sexual health and HIV medicine. From this 
point the care and management of HIV is taken over by the Sexual Health Team. 
â€¢ The Screening Team will notify National Study of HIV in Pregnancy. 
â€¢ Management of the HIV, medication and communication with the Primary Care, 
Obstetric and Paediatric Teams are the responsibility of the Sexual Health Team. 
â€¢ Non-attendance at specialist appointments should be reviewed within a 
multidisciplinary framework and an action plan developed. 
â€¢ Maternal & neonatal alerts are created on the Maternity Information system. 
 
NB. If a pregnant woman/person subsequently miscarries it remains the responsibility of the 
ASC to co -ordinate ongoing care. 
 
4.2 HIV infected pregnant woman/person known to Sexual Health Team Page 7 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Sexual Health Team will inform Consultant Obstetrician, Antenatal Screening 
Coordinator and Consultant Microbiologist of pregnancy. 
â€¢ Pregnant women/people will be advised to access primary care team for routine 
pregnancy care. 
â€¢ Appointment with Consultant Obstetrician at 12-16 and 34-36 weeks. 
â€¢ Consultant Obstetrician will make formal referral to Consultant Paediatrician 
following first appointment. 
 
4.3. Pregnancy management 
 
4.3.1 Key points 
 
â€¢ ASC informs Consultant Obstetrician and arranges an Antenatal Clinic appointment 
with the pregnant woman/person for 12 -16 weeks to discuss diagnosis and 
management of pregnancy. A plan of care should be documented in Maternity 
hospital record; including an appointment at 34 -36 weeks to discuss and document 
the plan for birth which will be confirmed according to latest viral load result. 
â€¢ Consultant Obstetrician will make a referral to the Lead Consultant Paediatrician for 
HIV, who will arrange an appointment with the parents to discuss and document a 
neonatal care plan which will be held in the Maternity hospital record and copied into 
hand held records with patientâ€™s permission. 
â€¢ The pregnant woman/person must be assured that their confidentiality with regard to 
their diagnosis will be respected but should be encouraged to allow disclosure to 
health professionals such as Community Midwife, Health Visitor and GP. 
â€¢ They should also be encouraged and supported with disclosing their status to their 
sexual partner with counselling and support. 
â€¢ Permission should be asked of the pregnant woman/person to record HIV result in 
hand held notes. If permission not given to be left blank. 
â€¢ Sexual health screening is recommended for pregnant women/people newly 
diagnosed with HIV. 
â€¢ For HIV-positive pregnant women/people already engaged in HIV care who become 
pregnant sexual health screening is suggested. 
â€¢ In pregnant women/people who commence (combination) cART in pregnancy, an 
HIV viral load should be performed 2 â€“4 weeks after commencing cART, at least 
once every trimester, at 36 weeks and at birth. 
â€¢ For pregnant women/people on cART with a viral load of <50 copies/mL at 36 
weeks, and in the absence of obstetric contraindications, a planned vaginal birth is 
recommended. 
â€¢ For pregnant women/people with a viral load of 50 -399 copies/mL at 36 weeks, 
Caesarean Section (CS) should be considered, taking into account the actual viral 
load, the trajectory of the viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, 
obstetric factors and the pregnant woman/personâ€™s views. Page 8 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Where the viral load is > 400 copies/mL at 36 weeks regardless of ARV therapy, CS 
is recommended. 
â€¢ Where the indication for CS is the prevention of MTCT, LSCS should be undertaken 
at between 38 and 39 weeksâ€™ gestation. 
â€¢ HIV infected pregnant women/people requesting invasive prenatal diagnosis should 
be counselled by a fetal medicine specialist. This should be done in consultation 
with the HIV Consultant to optimise treatment to prevent HIV transmission 
associated with the procedure. 
â€¢ Intravenous (IV) AZT is recommended for pregnant women/people with a viral load 
of >1,000 HIV RNA copies/mL or for untreated pregnant women/people presenting 
in labour, with ruptured membranes or admitted for a planned LSCS. It may be 
considered in pregnant women/people on zidovudine monotherapy undergoing 
LSCS, but continued oral dosing is a reasonable alternative. 
 
4.3.2 34- 36 week antenatal appointment 
 
â€¢ Prior to this appointment the Sexual Health Consultant will write to the Consultant 
Obstetrician with a summary of current care, medication, CD4 count and viral load. 
â€¢ At the appointment, the Consultant Obstetrician will confirm mode of birth and 
discuss infant feeding. Birth plan may be amended based upon the final 36/40 viral 
load. The neonatal plan for recommended post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should 
also be discussed. 
â€¢ The birth plan will be documented in the Maternity HIV Pathway. 
â€¢ Following this appointment the Consultant Obstetrician will write to the Paediatric 
and Sexual Health Consultants to notify them of the birth plan. 
â€¢ If AZT is required, the Consultant for HIV will inform the specialist HIV pharmacist 
who will order and dispense to Labour Ward by 36 weeks. This will need to be 
prescribed on admission. A supply of AZT is available in the emergency drug 
cupboard (contact on - call pharmacist). 
 
4.3.3 HIV infected pregnant women/people refusing advice or treatment 
 
A pre-birth case conference involving social services should be held to plan post-natal 
interventions to reduce the risk of transmission (RCPCH 2006). 
 
4.4 Complications of Early Pregnancy 
 
4.4.1 Hyperemesis 
 
For HIV positive pregnant women/people, particularly those on cART, a diagnosis of 
hyperemesis should only be made once acidosis, hepatitis and pancreatitis have been 
excluded. Controlled interruption of cART may be the best option in severe cases of Page 9 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 hyperemesis. The HIV Consultant must be informed of all women with hyperemesis in order to 
advise on differentials and optimisation / cessation of cART. 
 
4.4.2 Bleeding 
 
Management of pregnant HIV positive women/people who experience vaginal bleeding is the 
same as that of pregnant women/people who are HIV negative. The possibility of drug toxicity 
should be considered in pregnant women/people with abdominal pain. 
 
4.5 Complications of later pregnancy 
 
Some of the medical conditions that may arise as a result of HIV infection can complicate 
pregnancy. Some of these are known to increase the risk of pregnant woman/peerson -to- 
child transmission. 
 
â€¢ HIV infection may increase the risk of thrombi. All HIV positive pregnant 
women/people undergoing surgical procedure must have TEDS and/or Fragmin 
prescribed. 
â€¢ Thrombophilias â€“ Treatment is the same as for HIV negative women/people, 
although there are no studies to confirm efficacy. 
â€¢ Nephropathies associated with HIV infection can occur. Commonest is 
immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy resulting in large amounts of proteinuria. 
Increases the risk of PET and hypertension and thromboembolism. 
â€¢ Consultation with sexual health clinic should be undertaken for management plan. 
 
4.6 Pre-term labour 
 
â€¢ Management is the same as for HIV negative pregnant women/people. 
â€¢ A vaginal swab for bacteriology must be taken. 
â€¢ Dexamethasone or Betamethasone and anti-tocolytics if advised. 
 
4.6.1 Pre-term Pre-labour Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) <34 weeks 
 
â€¢ Consider prolonging pregnancy taking into account maternal cART, viraemia and 
presence of other pregnancy or HIV related co morbidities. 
â€¢ Steroids should be administered. 
â€¢ Look for genital infections and start erythromycin. 
â€¢ Give prophylaxis for group B streptococcus in labour if Group B strep found on HVS 
or MSU during index pregnancy. IV benzylpenicillin is recommended even if they 
have already been started on erythromycin. 
â€¢ Contact HIV Consultant immediately about admission and optimise cART regime to 
reduce risk of pregnant woman/person -to-child transmission. Page 10 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Strongly consider maternal single -dose NVP / Double dose Tenofovir and 
Raltegravir if neonate will be unable to take oral PEP. 
â€¢ Consider IV AZT if viral load is detectable. 
â€¢ Continue maternal ART. 
â€¢ There should be multidisciplinary discussion about the timing and mode of birth. 
Consider transfer to tertiary referral unit if <32 weeks. 
â€¢ If viral load <50 induction of labour is recommended, if viral load > 50 caesarean 
section is recommended. 
 
4.6.2 PPROM >34 weeks 
 
â€¢ Birth should be expedited regardless of pregnant woman/personâ€™s viral load (VL) 
and therapy. 
â€¢ If viral load <50 induction of labour is recommended, if viral load >50 caesarean 
section is recommended. 
â€¢ Look for genital infections and start erythromycin. 
â€¢ Give prophylaxis for group B streptococcus in labour. 
 
4.7 Intrapartum care 
 
Please refer to the intrapartum care plan in the patientâ€™s HIV care pathway in the green 
hospital notes. If HIV consultant advice is needed out of hours please contact HIV Clinician on 
call via switchboard. 
 
4.7.1 Term Pre-labour Rupture of Membranes (PROM) 
 
â€¢ Broad spectrum IV antibiotics should be given where there is evidence of 
chorioamnionitis. 
â€¢ IOL is recommended for those with a non-detectable viral load and favourable 
cervix. The aim is birth within 24 hours. 
 
4.7.2 Induction of labour 
 
Pregnant women/person with a non-detectable viral load can be induced for the usual 
reasons. 
 
4.7.3 VBAC 
 
VBAC carries the same risks as for HIV negative women/people. This should be offered if the 
criteria are met for vaginal birth - see Birth after Caesarean (BAC) guideline . Page 11 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 4.7.4 Management of vaginal birth 
 
â€¢ Each pregnant woman/person will have an individual birth plan documented in the 
Maternity HIV Pathway, with details of medication and any medical instructions. 
â€¢ Labour must progress normally, with mother and fetus in good condition throughout. 
If viral load < 50 management of labour should follow same principles as uninfected 
population (including use of ARM, fetal blood sampling, FSE application and 
episiotomy). 
â€¢ Fetal Blood Sampling and FSE application are contra -indicated in pregnant 
women/people with detectable viral load. 
â€¢ Episiotomy if required should be performed immediately prior to birth to minimise the 
risk of transmission from mother to newborn. 
â€¢ Do not delay LSCS for those who have presented in labour and are not suitable for 
vaginal birth. 
â€¢ Low cavity traction forceps and ventouse are permissible in women with VL< 50 
â€¢ IV AZT is not indicated for pregnant women/people with an viral load 
<1000copies/mL. 
â€¢ If IV AZT/ZDV has been commenced, continue until cord is clamped. 
 
4.7.5 Un-booked woman in labour or undocumented HIV Result 
 
â€¢ If undocumented, check whether HIV result is on Semahelix before contacting the 
laboratory. 
â€¢ If booked elsewhere but un -booked here and admitted to our unit in labour, check 
her handheld medical notes and if not evident, contact the hospital she is booked at 
for the result. 
â€¢ If positive, HIV Consultant on-call should be notified immediately. 
 
Urgent HIV testing should be offered to women thought to be at high risk of infection, which 
might include: 
 
â€¢ Recent migrants from countries with high rates of HIV infection. 
â€¢ Women who misuse substances intravenously. 
â€¢ Suspected sexual abuse. 
 
If urgent HIV test indicated phone laboratory and request â€˜Urgent HIV Testâ€™ and notify 
Pathology laboratory reception. (For out -of-hours call switchboard and ask for On-Call 
Biomedical Scientist to come in to process sample.) Result is available approximately one 
hour after received in SRH laboratory - NICE NG121 2019 . 
 
(See section 8.0 CG1125 Management of non-attendance for maternity care guideline for 
management of un -booked pregnant women/people in labour.) Page 12 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 
4.8 Admission for elective caesarean section 
 
â€¢ If AZT infusion required, admit to Labour ward the evening before. 
â€¢ If AZT infusion not required admit as usual to Labour ward at 0800. 
â€¢ Weigh patient in kilograms. 
â€¢ Inform Consultant Obstetrician and Consultant Paediatrician of admission. 
â€¢ If required commence IV AZT 4 hours before operation (See Appendix 4 for 
preparation and dose). 
â€¢ During infusion continue oral doses of any anti-retroviral regime as boarded. 
â€¢ Continue infusion until cord clamped. 
â€¢ Check ARVs taken on time and no doses missed last 12 hours. If either of the 
aforementioned have occurred seek advice from the responsible HIV clinician or out 
of hours contact the HIV Clinician on call via switchboard. 
 
NB: No special procedures or changes in operating lists are required. Normal precautions and 
cleaning procedures should be followed. 
 
4.9 Postpartum 
 
â€¢ Inform HIV Consultant and antenatal screening team of birth. 
â€¢ Refer to postnatal care plan (within maternity HIV pathway) for regimen for either 
continuing or stopping cART. 
â€¢ If mother/newly birthed person is on cART for treatment of her HIV status, continue. 
 
4.9.1 Infant feeding 
 
â€¢ In the UK the recommendation is that the safest way to feed infants born to 
women/newly birthed people with HIV is with formula milk, as there is no on-going 
risk of HIV exposure after birth. 
â€¢ Abstaining from breastfeeding can have financial and psychological repercussions 
for women/newly birthed people; this may require support from the HIV MDT. 
 
4.9.2 Suppression of lactation 
 
â€¢ Women/newly birthed people not breastfeeding their infant by choice, or because of 
viral load >50 HIV RNA copies/mL, should be offered cabergoline to suppress 
lactation. 
 
4.9.3 Choosing to breastfeed 
 
â€¢ Women/newly birthed people who are virologically suppressed on cART with good 
adherence and who choose to breastfeed should be supported to do so, but should Page 13 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 be informed about the low risk of transmission of HIV through breastfeeding in this 
situation and the requirement for extra maternal and infant clinical monitoring. 
â€¢ When a woman/newly birthed person decides to breastfeed, they and their infant 
should be reviewed monthly in clinic for HIV RNA viral load testing during and for 2 
months after stopping breastfeeding. 
â€¢ Maternal cART (rather than infant pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) is advised to 
minimise HIV transmission through breastfeeding and safeguard the 
woman/personâ€™s health. 
â€¢ Women/newly birthed people should be provided with the BHIVA breastfeeding 
patient information leaflets to enable them to make an informed decision. 
 
4.10 Neonatal care plan - key points 
 
â€¢ Baby does not need to be transferred to neonatal unit unless clinically indicated. 
â€¢ Inform on-call Registrar / Consultant Paediatrician prior to birth. 
â€¢ Refer to Neonatal HIV Care Plan in Maternity notes and transfer this to baby notes 
following birth. 
 
4.10.1 Infant Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) 
Very low risk 
â€¢ Two weeks of zidovudine monotherapy is recommended if all the following criteria 
are met: 
o The woman/person has been on cART for longer than 10 weeks; 
o And two documented maternal HIV viral loads <50 HIV RNA copies/mL during 
pregnancy at least 4 weeks apart; 
o And Maternal HIV viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL at or after 36 weeks. 
 
Low risk 
 
â€¢ Extend to 4 weeks of zidovudine monotherapy: 
o If the criteria above are not all fulfilled but maternal HIV viral load is <50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL at or after 36 weeks; 
o If the infant is born prematurely (<34 weeks) but most recent maternal HIV viral 
load is <50 HIV RNA copies/mL. 
 
High risk 
 
â€¢ Use combination PEP: 
o If maternal birth HIV viral load is known to be or likely to be >50 HIV RNA 
copies/mL on day of birth. 
o If uncertainty about recent maternal adherence or if viral load is not known. Page 14 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 Neonatal PEP should be commenced as soon as possible after birth, and at least within 4 
hours. In the context of known maternal resistance to zidovudine with very low or low risk, 
zidovudine monotherapy is still recommended for infant PEP. 
 
If high risk (combination PEP indicated) and there is a history of documented maternal 
zidovudine and/or nevirapine resistance, seek expert advice. If advice is not immediately 
available, commence standard three -drug PEP (zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) until 
guidance is provided. 
 
Septrin should be considered for babies at high risk of HIV transmission or positive first PCR 
(see Neonatal Care Plan). 
 
A paired sample of the babies blood with the mothers blood should be taken and sent to the 
laboratory within 48 hours of birth (see care pathway). 
 
Arrange neonatal follow up as per Neonatal HIV Care Plan. 
 
5.0 Hepatitis B 
 
Public Health England (PHE) have produced new hep B guidance for antenatal screening and 
selective neonatal immunisation to start in April 2021. 
 
5.1 Overview 
 
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. 
The virus causes both acute and chronic infections. An estimated 257 million people or 3.5% 
of the global population are living with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. 
 
Clinical picture 
 
The incubation period of HBV infection ranges from 40 to 160 days, with an average of 60 to 
90 days. 
 
Acute infection 
 
This can be asymptomatic. If symptoms occur they may include fever, malaise and abdominal 
pain. Jaundice occurs in approximately 10% of younger children and in 30 to 50% of adults. 
Most adults (90%) with acute HBV infection recover completely but only 10% of infants will 
clear the virus. Acute infection may occasionally lead to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which is 
often fatal. Page 15 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 Chronic infection 
 
This develops in 5 to 10% of adults, 20 to 50% of children under the age of 6 years and over 
90% of newborns following infection. Individuals with chronic HBV infection may carry the virus 
for the rest of their lives. They have an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis (permanent 
scarring of the liver) over a period of years and sometimes cancer of the liver. Patients with 
chronic infection should be managed by a hepatologist or gastroenterologist. Antiviral 
treatment can help to reduce the progression of liver disease and complications. 
 
Transmission 
 
Globally, perinatal transmission vertically (from mother to baby) is the most common route 
of HBV acquisition and represents an important contribution to establishing chronic infections 
within populations. Hepatitis B is more infectious than other blood borne viruses like hepatitis 
C and HIV. 
 
Hepatitis B virus can be passed from person to person through unprotected sexual 
intercourse, direct contact with the blood of an infected person, including within the household 
(horizontal transmission), sharing contaminated needles and through perinatal transmission. 
 
Perinatal transmission rates, in the absence of immunisation of the newborn at birth, can be as 
high as 90% from higher infectivity mothers/people and approximately 10 to 40% from lower 
infectivity mothers/people. Of those babies who are infected at birth or during the first year of 
life, around 90% will go on to develop chronic infection. The disease will progress to liver 
cirrhosis and liver cancer in 15% to 40% of children with chronic infection. 
 
5.2.1 Screening 
 
All pregnant women/people are offered screening for Hepatitis B each pregnancy as part of 
the antenatal screening process which occurs at booking. Hep B surface antigen (HBsAg) is 
tested on all pregnant women/people. 
 
â€¢ If a pregnant woman/person declines screening, this must be entered on maternity 
Information system (MIS), noted on the risk form, and the ASC notified. The 
pregnant woman/person should be sent a letter outlining the reasons for infectious 
diseases screening, and offered an appointment with the screening team to discuss. 
â€¢ A formal re-offer of screening must be made by 20 weeks and documented in the 
maternity notes, and on MIS (Letter as described in HIV section 4.0 ) 
â€¢ Cases of known Hepatitis B should be documented on both the booking blood form 
and the antenatal risk assessment by the booking midwife. Page 16 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 5.3 Management of Hepatitis B positive women during pregnancy 
 
Following a confirmed positive result the ASC / antenatal screening midwife will: 
 
â€¢ Offer a face to face appointment to discuss the result within 10 working days of the 
confirmed result being made available to the maternity service. This appointment will 
include a blood test for Hep B viral load (HBC DNA), Hep C and LFTs. 
â€¢ From April 2021, PHE are increasing their surveillance of both pregnant 
women/people and infants with Hep B. In addition to the blood tests above, the 
screening midwife will also take an additional sample for PHE for all cases of Hep B. 
This sample should be collected in the provided ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA) blood tubes and sent to the PHE laboratory in Colindale with a completed 
request form in pre -paid return packaging. If the pregnant woman/person declines 
this additional sample, this should be recorded in their notes and on the completed 
request forms and returned to PHE Colindale. 
â€¢ Ensure patient has information IDPS patient information leaflet . 
â€¢ Notify The Community Child Health Information Service (CCHIS) and GP by email 
using the â€˜Notification of maternal positive hepatitis B antenatal result form . 
â€¢ Co-ordinate appointments with the maternal medicine consultant obstetrician who 
will ensure appropriate management of pregnancy. 
â€¢ Ensure the required vaccination schedule is documented in the intrapartum record, 
baby birth record and on Medway. 
â€¢ Commence PHE Hep B screening and immunisation maternal and paediatric 
checklist and place in hospital record. 
â€¢ Liaise with paediatric team regarding postnatal vaccination +/- hepatitis B 
immunoglobulin (HBIG). 
â€¢ Create maternal & neonatal alerts on the Maternity Information system. 
 
If the pregnant woman/person is deemed to be higher infectivity, then HBIG should be 
requested from PHE Colindaleâ€™s Hepatitis B Infant Coordinator using the current HBIG request 
form. Indications for HBIG in addition to hep B vaccine are detailed in the Green Book and in 
Appendix 6 . 
 
The antenatal screening midwife will refer pregnant women/people with a positive Hep B result 
to gastroenterology for an assessment. This will include a review within 6 weeks of the positive 
result where pregnant women/people are identified as newly positive or high infectivity (see 
Appendix 6 ). It must be clearly documented in the maternity notes whether pregnant 
woman/person is high or low infectivity. 
 
The gastroenterologist will update the screening team, Consultant Obstetrician, Consultant 
Paediatrician with a plan of care for the woman/person and the neonate. This will include the 
vaccination schedule +/ - HBIG. The GP should be notified. Page 17 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 The maternal medicine consultant obstetrician will review, ideally before 20 weeks, and 
consider repeat HBV DNA at 24 weeks if indicated. 
 
If invasive procedures such as amniocentesis are planned in early gestation, pregnant 
women/people may be counselled that the risk of transmission of hepatitis B is low even with a 
high viral load but that antiviral treatment could be considered to commence prior to the 
procedure if HBV DNA is >107IU/ml. 
 
Non -attendance at specialist appointments should be reviewed within a multidisciplinary 
framework and an action plan developed. 
 
Note: If a pregnant women/people subsequently miscarries it remains the responsibility of the 
ASC to ensure the gastroenterology department are notified. 
 
5.4 Gastroenterology review 
 
At the gastroenterology review, the pregnant woman/person will be assessed and counselled 
for possible antiviral treatment in the third trimester. Treatment with tenofovir should 
commence from 28 weeksâ€™ gestation. This may only be initiated by the gastroenterology team. 
 
Pregnant women/people on treatment are reviewed monthly in the gastroenterology clinic for 
side effects with monthly repeat HBV DNA tests (i.e. 32, 36, 40 weeks). They require U&Es, 
LFTs and phosphate weekly for first 2 weeks of treatment, then fortnightly for 4 weeks and 
monthly thereafter (gastroenterology to follow up results). 
 
Treatment needs to continue for 4 weeks postpartum to prevent a hepatitis flare. Newly birth 
women/people should be counselled that the safety of breastfeeding on tenofovir is uncertain. 
 
5.5 Intrapartum care 
Key points: 
â€¢ Inform on-call Neonatal Team on admission in labour or for caesarean section to 
ensure timely administration of Hep B vaccine / HBIG. 
â€¢ Avoid FBS and FSE. 
â€¢ Consider avoiding a difficult instrumental birth although there is no evidence that it 
increases transmission. 
â€¢ Antiviral treatment should continue for minimum 4 weeks postpartum and termination 
of treatment must be made by or in liaison with a consultant gastroenterologist 
because of risk of hepatitis flare after birth. Page 18 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 5.6 Babies born to Hepatitis B Positive mothers 
High Infectivity cases from April 2021 
Postnatal maternal surveillance sample 
 
The second maternal venous surveillance sample should be taken on birth suite from those 
women/people classified as being of higher infectivity after they have birthed their baby. 
 
EDTA blood tubes, request forms and pre-paid return envelopes will be available in the â€˜hep B 
birth suite boxâ€™ which, along with the HBIG, will be sent to maternity units approximately 7 
weeks prior to the estimated birth date . 
 
Newborn dried bloodspot (NBS) sample 
 
A DBS test should be taken on birth suite from babies born to mothers/people classified as 
being at higher infectivity before administration of the vaccine and HBIG. 
 
The DBS cards, instructions on collection and pre-paid return envelopes will be provided in the 
hep B birth suite box, which along with the HBIG, will be delivered to maternity units (ANC) 
approximately 7 weeks prior to the estimated birth date. This will be brought to labour ward by 
the screening team. 
 
This surveillance blood sample is different to the newborn blood spot sample taken on day 5 
after the babyâ€™s birth. The mother/person should be informed that the baby will still need to 
have the newborn blood spot screen sample on day 5. 
 
If the woman/person declines to have maternal serology and or neonatal DBS taken it should 
be recorded in their notes and on the completed request forms and returned to PHE Colindale. 
 
All babies will require Hep B (monovalent) vaccination course. The 1st dose must be given 
within 24 hours of birth (at the earliest opportunity) by the Health Professional. Further doses 
are required at 4 weeks and 12 months via the GP. This is in addition to the routine childhood 
vaccination programme which includes hexavalent combination vaccine. 
 
This highlights the importance of notifying CCHIS at the earliest opportunity (see below) to 
ensure timely vaccination. The baby should also be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAG) at 1 year of age. 
 
For mothers/people with high infectivity, the baby will require HBIG and vaccination course. 
HBIG must be prescribed and will be available from pharmacy and given to the baby as soon 
as possible after birth by the Health Professional. Page 19 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 Note: Premature babies of Hep B positive mothers weighing less than 1500 grams should be 
given HBIG and vaccinated regardless of infectivity (seek advice from Microbiology as this will 
have to be ordered from the duty doctor at Colindale). 
 
Breastfeeding is acceptable if hepatitis B positive and not on treatment. 
 
5.7 The midwife responsible for discharging the woman/person must ensure the 
following: 
 
â€¢ The Child Health Record (red book) insert â€˜Hepatitis vaccinationâ€™ is completed and 
given to the mother. 
â€¢ The â€˜Notification of birth: baby of mother with hepatitis B formâ€™ is emailed or sent to 
CCHIS and the GP. The address for CCHIS is: 2nd Floor, Southgate House, 
Chichester, PO19 8EG. Email address is: sc.tr.cchis@nhs.net. 
 
Note: This postnatal notification form and the red book insert should be placed in the hospital 
Maternity Record with a Baby Birth Record during the pregnancy by the Screening Team. Page 20 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 5.8 Screening team responsibilities following birth 
Actions required 
â€¢ Check maternal blood and newborn DBS samples have been taken. 
â€¢ Check laboratory request forms for maternal blood and newborn DBS samples 
& PHE notification form is fully completed. 
â€¢ Dispatch maternal samples and DBS to PHE BBVU in Virus Reference department, 
Colindale using prepaid supplied. 
â€¢ Ensure the CHIS, Health Visitor and GP or Practice nurse are notified of: 
o Vaccine administration at birth. 
o The requirement for the second vaccine at 4 weeks and completion of selective 
immunisation schedule. 
â€¢ Complete: 
o PHE hepatitis B in pregnancy maternal and paediatric checklist. 
o PHE IDPS Integrated screening outcomes surveillance service (ISOSS) hepatitis 
B database (from April 2021). 
 
6.0 Hepatitis C 
 
6.1 Antenatal screening 
 
Hepatitis C screening is not routinely offered to pregnant women/people. However, i f the 
woman/person discloses she has a history of intravenous drug use or is Hepatitis B positive, 
screening for Hepatitis C should be requested with consent and full clinical details given. 
 
Where risk factors are present a repeat screen should be considered in the third trimester. 
 
6.2 Management during pregnancy 
 
The Screening Team will make a referral to gastroenterology in a timely manner. 
 
Gastroenterology will email / write to the screening team midwives with the plan of care for the 
woman/person and neonate. The screening team will update the maternal medicine consultant 
obstetrician and the paediatric team. 
 
The plan, including referrals, should be documented on the Tracker form (Appendix 1) and 
neonatal alert created on Medway Maternity Information System. 
 
CCHIS will be notified via email by the screening team of Hep C status. 
 
6.3 Babies born to Hepatitis C positive mothers/people 
 
â€¢ Inform paediatrician prior to birth. Page 21 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ If there is no known positive Hep B source then the infant should be vaccinated 
according to the routine schedule and would not need to follow the neonatal 
hepatitis B pathway for babies born to hepatitis B positive mothers/people. 
â€¢ If, at birth, there is thought to be a clear or imminent risk of hepatitis B / risk factors 
in the infants household, such as lifestyle factors discussed or identified, father 
/partner hep B positive, then a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine would be 
recommended followed by the full hexavalent course. 
â€¢ Refer to Consultant Paediatrician for clinic review and PCR at 3 months. 
â€¢ If 3 month PCR is negative, repeat at 6 months. 
â€¢ If PCR is positive at any time, consider referral to Consultant Paediatrician for 
infectious diseases at St Georges (for Worthing) and Southampton (for SRH). 
 
7.0 Management of Partners who are HIV, Hep B and C Positive 
 
â€¢ Sexual health should be notified of women/people with positive partners for HIV, 
Hepatitis B or C. 
â€¢ If father/partner is hep B positive, a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine would be 
recommended followed by the full hexavalent course for these newborns. 
 
Key point 
 
â€¢ IV drug users or women/people with a positive partner should be re-tested for HIV, 
Syphilis, and Hepatitis B & Hep C in the third trimester. 
 
See Hep B vaccine PGD for inclusion criteria 
 
8.0 Syphilis 
 
Pregnant women/people are offered screening for syphilis at booking of each pregnancy. 
Cases of known or previous syphilis should be documented on both the booking blood form 
and the antenatal risk assessment by the booking midwife. 
 
â€¢ If a pregnant woman/person declines screening, this must be entered on maternity 
Information system (MIS), noted on the risk form and the ASC notified. 
â€¢ A formal re-offer of screening must be made by 20 weeks and documented in the 
maternity notes and on MIS (letter as in HIV section 4.0 ). 
â€¢ The aim of antenatal screening is to contribute to the reduction of congenital syphilis 
infection. 
 
The urgency to complete the assessment is because: 
 
â€¢ Not all positive screening test results will be confirmed as a syphilis diagnosis or as 
an infection requiring treatment. Page 22 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Treatment, when indicated, needs to be instituted as early as possible to avoid 
adverse outcomes of pregnancy. 
 
8.1 Management during pregnancy 
 
The Screening team will inform the Health Advisor of the positive result. 
 
Pregnant women/people with positive screening test results should be contacted and advised 
about the result, at an appointment made for that purpose, within 10 working days of the result 
being available to maternity services. For pregnant women/people treated adequately prior to 
the current pregnancy, no further action is required, but this will require clinical assessment by 
the Sexual health team. 
 
8.2 Assessment 
 
Assessment by the Sexual Health Team is needed to provide diagnostic evaluation of 
maternal infection; and to decide whether treatment and follow up are required. This also 
provides an opportunity to discuss arrangements for partner notification and management. 
The Sexual Health Team will write to Consultant Obstetrician, Consultant Paediatrician, GP 
and the antenatal screening team to confirm details of plan of care for mother/person and 
baby. 
 
They will also complete the Syphilis Birth Plan (Appendix 5), which should be filed in maternity 
hospital notes. 
 
â€¢ The antenatal screening team will co-ordinate the appointment with the Consultant 
Obstetrician. 
â€¢ The plan, including referrals, should be documented on the Tracker form 
(Appendix 1 ). 
â€¢ Screening team midwife will ensure patient has information using IDPS patient 
information leaflet . 
â€¢ Non-attendance at specialist appointments should be reviewed within a 
multidisciplinary framework and an action plan developed. 
 
NB. If a pregnant woman/person subsequently miscarries it remains the responsibility of the 
ASC to co -ordinate ongoing care. 
 
8.3 Signs and Symptoms of Congenital Syphilis 
 
Early: 
â€¢ IUGR 
â€¢ Maculopapular rash (30-60%) 
â€¢ Vesiculobullous lesions Page 23 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Perioral fissures 
â€¢ Condylomata lata 
â€¢ Rhinitis (which may be haemorrhagic) (10-50%) 
â€¢ Osteochondritis (90%), periostitis (40-80%), osteomyelitis 
â€¢ Hepatosplenomegaly 
â€¢ Persisting hypoglycaemia 
â€¢ Lymphadenopathy (50%) 
â€¢ Pseudoparalysis 
â€¢ Chorioretinitis, pathologic CSF (40%), meningitis 
â€¢ Haemolysis/thrombocytopenia 
â€¢ Hydrops

â€¢ Neurological or gummatous involvement 
 
8.4 Follow -Up 
 
â€¢ Neurodevelopmental, Audiological and ophthalmological follow -up. 
â€¢ Repeat reactive tests at 3, 6 and 12 months of age or until all tests become negative 
(usually by 6 months). Also repeat the IgM at 3 months in case the infantâ€™s response is 
delayed or suppressed, LP after 6 months (if CNS initially involved). 
â€¢ Repeat treatment, if symptoms persist or recur; if titre not < Â¼ of initial value or 
increases; if abnormal CSF control. 
 
9.0 Genital Herpes 
 
9.1 Incidence 
 
Neonatal herpes is rare in the UK (between 1986 and 1991 there was an incidence of 
1:60,000 live births annually). Page 24 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 9.2 Key points 
 
â€¢ Neonatal herpes is a viral infection with a high morbidity and mortality which is most 
commonly acquired at or near the time of birth. 
â€¢ Neonatal herpes may be caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV -1) or herpes 
simplex virus type 2 (HSV - 2), as either viral type can cause genital herpes. Almost 
all cases of neonatal herpes occur as a result of direct contact with infected 
maternal secretions, although cases of postnatal transmission have been found. 
â€¢ Factors influencing transmission include the type of maternal infection (primary or 
recurrent), the presence of transplacental maternal neutralising antibodies, the 
duration of rupture of membranes before birth, the use of fetal scalp electrodes and 
mode of birth. The risks are greatest when a woman acquires a new infection 
(primary genital herpes) in the third trimester, particularly within 6 weeks of birth. 
â€¢ Although recurrent genital herpes is associated with a very low risk of neonatal 
herpes (3%), recurrent herpes at the time of birth which is commonly asymptomatic 
or unrecognised, may cause localised forms of neonatal herpes. 
â€¢ Symptomatic genital herpes infections are diagnosed clinically and confirmed by 
direct detection of HSV. 
â€¢ A swab for HSV PCR should be used. 
 
9.3 Management of primary episode 
 
â€¢ Pregnant women/people should be referred to a genitourinary physician for 
management of the condition. Oral or intravenous acyclovir in standard doses 
should be offered (use with caution before 20 weeks). 
â€¢ Serological type specific HSV antibody testing, which can help to differentiate 
between primary and recurrent infections, should be considered if a woman 
presents with a first episode of genital herpes in the third trimester. 
â€¢ Following first or second trimester acquisition, daily suppressive acyclovir 400 mg 
three times daily from 36 weeks of gestation reduces HSV lesions at term and 
hence the need for birth by caesarean section. 
â€¢ Caesarean section should be the recommended mode of birth for all women 
developing first episode genital herpes in the third trimester, particularly those 
developing symptoms within 6 weeks of expected birth, as the risk of neonatal 
transmission of HSV is very high at 41%. 
 
9.4 Presentation at time of birth 
 
â€¢ Caesarean section should be strongly recommended to all pregnant women/people 
presenting with primary episode genital herpes lesions at the time of birth, or within 
6 weeks of the expected date of birth. 
â€¢ For these pregnant women/people who opt for a vaginal birth, rupture of membranes 
should be avoided and invasive procedures should not be used. (If ruptured Page 25 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 membranes are confirmed at term, birth should be expedited by the appropriate 
means.) 
â€¢ Intravenous acyclovir given intrapartum to the pregnant woman/person and 
subsequently to the baby may be considered. The neonatologist should be 
informed. 
â€¢ There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of daily suppressive acyclovir from 
36 weeks of gestation to reduce the likelihood of HSV lesions at term for pregnant 
women/people who experience a primary episode of genital herpes earlier in the 
current pregnancy. 
 
9.5 Recurrent episodes of genital herpes 
 
â€¢ Antiviral treatment is rarely indicated for treatment of recurrent episodes of genital 
herpes during pregnancy. (The majority of recurrent episodes of genital herpes are 
short lasting and resolve within 7â€“10 days without antiviral treatment. Saline bathing 
and analgesia can help relieve symptoms). 
â€¢ PCR during late gestation are not recommended. 
â€¢ A recurrent episode of genital herpes occurring during the antenatal period is not an 
indication for birth by caesarean section. 
â€¢ Vaginal birth should be anticipated in the absence of other obstetric indications for 
caesarean section. 
â€¢ For pregnant women/people with a history of recurrent genital herpes, who would 
opt for caesarean birth if HSV lesions were detected at the onset of labour, daily 
suppressive acyclovir given from 36 weeks of gestation until birth may be given to 
reduce the likelihood of HSV lesions at term. 
 
10.0 Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea testing 
 
Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK. It is 
most common in men and women under 25 years old. The bacteria that cause chlamydia are 
found in the semen, vaginal fluids and saliva of people who have the infection. Chlamydia is 
easily passed from one person to another through unprotected sex. 
 
If chlamydia is not treated it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and 
infertility. 
 
10.1 Symptoms 
 
Often chlamydia can be asymptomatic. Possible symptoms are: 
 
â€¢ Unusual vaginal discharge. 
â€¢ Pain when urinating or having sex. 
â€¢ Bleeding after sex or between periods. Page 26 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Pelvic pain or painful testicles. 
 
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by bacteria called Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae or gonococcus. The bacteria are mainly found in discharge from the penis and in 
vaginal fluid. 
 
Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through: 
 
â€¢ Unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex. 
â€¢ Sharing vibrators or other sex toys that have not been washed or covered with a 
new condom each time they're used. 
â€¢ The bacteria can infect the cervix, the urethra, the rectum and, less commonly, the 
throat or eyes. 
â€¢ The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman/person to her baby. 
â€¢ Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness in a newborn baby. 
 
Pregnant women/people 25 years old and younger are offered chlamydia and gonorrhoea 
testing at booking this should be documented within the handheld records and an information 
sheet will be provided. This is done by a self-taken low vaginal swab (specific for chlamydia / 
gonorrhoea testing) which is sent to the microbiology lab. The swabs are provided by the 
sexual health department. 
 
The result is dealt with by the Sexual Health Team and the woman is informed by text/phone 
call/email. All subsequent tests or treatment are managed by the Sexual Health Team. 
 
The sole responsibility of the maternity service is to offer the test at booking 
and deliver the swab to the laboratory. Page 27 of 36

 AZT should be administrated in 2 stages: 
 
â€¢ Firstly, a Loading Infusion of 2mg/kg IV over 1 hour. 
 
â€¢ Then, a Maintenance Infusion of 1mg/kg/hr IV until the umbilical cord is clamped. 
 
For ease of administration the infusion solution is made up to 2mg/ml of AZT in 5% glucose. 
See below for method of preparation. 
This information is not intended to supersede 
manufacturerâ€™s product information. Appendix 4: Preparation and Administration of Zidovudine (AZT) 

Preparation of Zidovudine infusion using aseptic technique 
 
â€¢ AZT injection comes in 20ml vial containing 200mg AZT, i.e. 10mg/ml. 
â€¢ All infusions are prepared with 5% glucose to a final concentration of 2mg/ml . 
 
â€¢ The infusion needs to be prepared immediately prior to use. 
â€¢ Remove 50ml of 5% glucose from a 250ml bag and discard. Add 50ml (500mg) of 
AZT injection (10mg/ml) to the remaining 200ml 5% glucose, to give a final 
concentration of 2mg/ml. Mix well. 
â€¢ Use this bag for the Loading Infusion (2mg/kg) in the first 60 minutes. Use the rest of 
the bag for the maintenance infusion (1mg/kg/hr) until the umbilical cord is clamped. 
Prepare fresh infusion bag if required. 
Example: patientâ€™s weight = W kg. 
âž¢ Loading Dose of 2mg/kg = (W x 2) mg. 
âž¢ Infusion fluid required = [(W x 2) mg ï‚¸ 2mg/ml] = W ml. 
Therefore run W ml AZT infusion fluid over 1 hr, then run maintenance infusion from the 
same bag. 
Maintenance Infusion at 1mg/kg/hr = W mg/hr. 
Infusion fluid required = ( W mg ï‚¸ 2 mg/ml) 
 
Therefore, run (W ï‚¸ 2) ml AZT infusion fluid per hr until the umbilical cord is clamped.

Genito - urinary management (GUM) advice for infant management: 
 
1. â–¡ Pregnant woman/person adequately treated prior to this pregnancy with no 
risk of congenital syphilis. 
 
â€¢ At birth: baby requires no additional physical examination or tests for syphilis. 
â€¢ Follow up: no syphilis follow up required for baby. 
 
2. â–¡ Pregnant women/people treated for syphilis during this pregnancy with low 
risk of congenital syphilis. 
 
â€¢ At birth: assess baby for signs of congenital syphilis. If no concerns perform 
routine syphilis screening on venous blood sample (not cord). 
â€¢ Request â€˜syphilis screen + RPR+ treponemal IgMâ€™. 
â€¢ Follow up: repeat â€˜syphilis screen + RPR+ treponemal IgMâ€™ every 3 months until 
RPR is negative (this usually occurs by 6 months). If clinical signs suggest 
congenital syphilis (see 2015 BASHH guideline). Manage according to â€˜option 3â€™ 
below. 
 
3. â–¡ There is significant risk of congenital syphilis. 
 
â€¢ At birth: assess baby for signs of congenital syphilis (see 2015 BASHH guideline).

Lumbar puncture (request WBC, protein, RPR & TPHA) and further tests as 
clinically indicated; long bones& chest X -ray, ophthalmology& audiology reviews 
and (if available) samples from lesions for dark ground microscopy and PCR for T. 
pallidum . Page 34 of 36 
CG1199 Management of Infectious Diseases during Pregnancy Guideline Version 5.3 April 2021 
 â€¢ Treatment for congenital syphilis: benzylpenicillin 25mg/kg 12 hourly IV for 7
