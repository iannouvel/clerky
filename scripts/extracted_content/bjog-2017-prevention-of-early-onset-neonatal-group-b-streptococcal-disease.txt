Executive summary
Information for women
What information should women be given about group B streptococcal (GBS) colonisation of the mother
and the risk of neonatal infection, during pregnancy and after delivery?
All pregnant women should be provided with an appropriate information lea ﬂet. [New 2016 ]P
Antenatal screening
Should all pregnant women be offered bacteriological screening for GBS?
Universal bacteriological screening is not recommended.D
What are the clinical risk factors that affect the risk of GBS disease?
Clinicians should be aware of the clinical risk factors that place women at increased risk of
having a baby with early-onset GBS (EOGBS) disease. [ New 2016 ]P
Should women be offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) if GBS was detected in a previous
pregnancy, irrespective of carrier status this pregnancy?
Explain to women that the likelihood of maternal GBS carriage in this pregnancy is 50%. Discuss
the options of IAP, or bacteriological testing in late pregnancy and then offer of IAP if stillpositive. [ New 2016 ]B
If performed, bacteriological testing should ideally be carried out at 35 –37 weeks of gestation
or 3–5 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, e.g. 32 –34 weeks of gestation for women
with twins. [ New 2016 ]C
Should women with a previous baby affected by GBS disease be offered IAP irrespective of carrier
status this pregnancy?
IAP should be offered to women with a previous baby with early- or late-onset GBS disease.D

What screening tests (if any) should be offered if a woman requests testing for carrier status?
A maternal request is not an indication for bacteriological screening. [ New 2016 ]D
Antenatal care
How should GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy be managed?
Clinicians should offer IAP to women with GBS bacteriuria identi ﬁed during the current
pregnancy.C
Women with GBS urinary tract infection (growth of greater than 105cfu/ml) during pregnancy
should receive appropriate treatment at the time of diagnosis as well as IAP. [ New 2016 ]C
Should women be treated before the onset of labour if GBS carriage is detected incidentally earlier in the
pregnancy?
Antenatal treatment is not recommended for GBS cultured from a vaginal or rectal swab.C
Should the management differ if the detection of GBS is incidental or following intentional testing, and if so, how?
Where GBS carriage is detected incidentally or by intentional testing, women should be offered
IAP. [ New 2016 ]
Should being a GBS carrier inﬂuence the method of induction?
Method of induction should not vary according to GBS carrier status. [ New 2016 ]P
Is being a GBS carrier a contraindication to membrane sweeping?
Membrane sweeping is not contraindicated in women who are carriers of GBS. [ New 2016 ]D
How should planned caesarean section in women with known GBS colonisation be managed?
Antibiotic prophylaxis speci ﬁc for GBS is not required for women undergoing planned caesarean
section in the absence of labour and with intact membranes.C
Management of term labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS disease
How should rupture of membranes in a woman at term (37+0weeks of gestation) with known or unknown GBS
carrier status be managed?
Women who are known GBS carriers should be offered immediate IAP and induction of labour
as soon as reasonably possible.CP

In women where the carrier status is negative or unknown, offer induction of labour
immediately or expectant management up to 24 hours. Beyond 24 hours, induction of labour isappropriate. [ New 2016 ]A
How should labour in a woman with a temperature of 38 °C or greater and without known GBS colonisation be
managed?
Women who are pyrexial (38 °C or greater) in labour should be offered a broad-spectrum
antibiotic regimen which should cover GBS in line with local microbiology sensitivities.C
How should preterm labour be managed in women without known GBS colonisation?
IAP is recommended for women in con ﬁrmed preterm labour. [ New 2016 ]D
IAP is not recommended for women not in labour and having a preterm planned caesarean
section with intact membranes. [ New 2016 ]D
Is there a role for polymerase chain reaction or other near-patient testing at the onset of labour?
Polymerase chain reaction or other near-patient testing at the onset of labour is not
recommended. [ New 2016 ]C
Can GBS-positive women have a water birth?
Birth in a pool is not contraindicated if the woman is a known GBS carrier provided she is
offered appropriate IAP. [ New 2016 ]D
Management of preterm labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS
disease
Women with preterm rupture of membranes
How should known or unknown GBS carrier status be managed in women with preterm prelabour rupture of
membranes?
Bacteriological testing for GBS carriage is not recommended for women with preterm rupture
of membranes. IAP should be given once labour is con ﬁrmed or induced irrespective of GBS
status. [ New 2016 ]D
For those with evidence of colonisation in the current pregnancy or in previous pregnancies,
the perinatal risks associated with preterm delivery at less than 34+0weeks of gestation
are likely to outweigh the risk of perinatal infection. For those at more than 34+0weeks of
gestation it may be bene ﬁcial to expedite delivery if a woman is a known GBS carrier.

Bacteriological considerations
What are the appropriate swabs if testing for carrier status is to be undertaken?
When testing for GBS carrier status, a swab should be taken from the lower vagina and the
anorectum. A single swab (vagina then anorectum) or two different swabs can be used.[New 2016 ]D
How quickly should the swabs be transported to the laboratory, in what medium and at what temperature?
After collection, swabs should be placed in a non-nutrient transport medium, such as Amies or
Stuart. Specimens should be transported and processed as soon as possible. If processing is
delayed, specimens should be refrigerated. [ New 2016 ]B
What culture medium should be used if testing for GBS carriage is to be undertaken?
Enriched culture medium tests are recommended. The clinician should indicate that the swab is
being taken for GBS. [ New 2016 ]B
Which antibiotic should be used for IAP?
For women who have agreed to IAP, benzylpenicillin should be administered. Once
commenced, treatment should be given regularly until delivery.B
Which antibiotic should be used in women with known or suspected penicillin allergy?
Provided a woman has not had severe allergy to penicillin, a cephalosporin should be used. Ifthere is any evidence of severe allergy to penicillin, vancomycin should be used. [ New 2016 ]P
How should known GBS colonisation in women who decline IAP be managed?
Women with known GBS colonisation who decline IAP should be advised that the baby should
be very closely monitored for 12 hours after birth, and discouraged from seeking very earlydischarge from the maternity hospital. [ New 2016 ]P
What are the adverse effects of IAP (maternal anaphylaxis, altered neonatal bowel ﬂora and abnormal child
development)?
Clinicians should be aware of the potential adverse effects of IAP. [ New 2016 ]C
Should vaginal cleansing be performed in labour and does this differ according to GBS carrier
status?
There is no evidence that intrapartum vaginal cleansing will reduce the risk of neonatal GBS
disease.C

How should a newborn baby be managed?
If there have been any concerns about early-onset neonatal infection, what signs should prompt parents and carers
to seek medical advice?
Parents and carers should seek urgent medical advice if they are concerned that the baby:D
/C15is showing abnormal behaviour (for example, inconsolable crying or listlessness), or
/C15is unusually ﬂoppy, or
/C15has developed dif ﬁculties with feeding or with tolerating feeds, or
/C15has an abnormal temperature unexplained by environmental factors (lower than 36 °C or higher
than 38 °C), or
/C15has rapid breathing, or
/C15has a change in skin colour. [ New 2016 ]
How should term babies whose mothers have received adequate IAP be managed?
Term babies who are clinically well at birth and whose mothers have received IAP for prevention
of EOGBS disease more than 4 hours before delivery do not require special observation.[New 2016 ]P
The babies of women who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics during labour for
indications other than GBS prophylaxis may require investigation and treatment as per the NICEclinical guideline on early-onset neonatal infection. [ New 2016 ]P
How should well babies at risk of EOGBS disease whose mothers have not received adequate IAP be monitored?
Well babies should be evaluated at birth for clinical indicators of neonatal infection and have
their vital signs checked at 0, 1 and 2 hours, and then 2 hourly until 12 hours. [ New 2016 ]P
Should postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis be given to low-risk term babies?
Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for asymptomatic term infants without
known antenatal risk factors.C
How should a baby with clinical signs of EOGBS disease be managed?
Babies with clinical signs of EOGBS disease should be treated with penicillin and gentamicinwithin an hour of the decision to treat. [ New 2016 ]P
How should the baby of a mother who has had a previous baby with GBS disease be managed?
Babies should be evaluated at birth for clinical indicators of neonatal infection and have their
vital signs checked at 0, 1 and 2 hours, and then 2 hourly until 12 hours. [ New 2016 ]P
What advice should be given to women regarding breastfeeding?
Breastfeeding should be encouraged irrespective of GBS status. [ New 2016 ]P

1. Purpose and scope
The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance for obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists on the prevention
of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease and the information to be provided to women, their
partners and family. Prevention of late-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease and treatment of established GBSdisease is not considered beyond initial antibiotic therapy.
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
The Lanceﬁeld group B beta-haemolytic streptococcus infection ( Streptococcus agalactiae ) is recognised as the most
frequent cause of severe early-onset (less than 7 days of age) infection in newborn infants.1The GBS carriage rate
varies among racial groups, with the highest rates in people of black African ancestry and the lowest in people ofSouth Asian ancestry.
GBS is present in the bowel ﬂora of 20 –40% of adults (this is called ‘colonisation’). People who are colonised are called
‘carriers’. This includes pregnant women (there is no evidence that its carriage rate is speciﬁcally affected by pregnancy).
There remains controversy about the best strategy to prevent EOGBS disease. Surveys in 2015 demonstrated that
there was a large variation in UK practice.
2The incidence of EOGBS disease in the UK and Ireland in 2015 was
0.57/1000 births (517 cases), a signiﬁcant increase in incidence since previous surveillance undertaken in 2000(0.48/1000).
3Of the cases, 22% had been born prematurely and overall, 35% had one or more of the following risk
factors: a previous baby affected by GBS disease; GBS bacteriuria; a vaginal swab positive for GBS; or a maternaltemperature of 38 °C or greater in labour. Of the cases with discharge status, 7.4% were reported as having disability. A
signiﬁcant decline in case fatality rate was shown between the two surveillance periods: 10.6% to 5.2%, respectively.
Since 2002, the US guidelines
4have advised that all pregnant women should be offered screening for GBS carriage at
35–37 weeks of gestation and those found to be colonised with GBS (or labouring before this time) should be
offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), usually in the form of intravenous benzylpenicillin or ampicillin.IAP has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of culture-positive early-onset but not late-onset disease(occurring 7 or more days after birth). There is also indirect evidence of an impact on neonatal deaths. Alongitudinal analysis of disease-related neonatal mortality in the USA showed a decline in mortality in the ﬁrst weekafter birth, coinciding with the introduction of IAP.
5A 2016 report from the USA shows a continuing fall in the
incidence of GBS infection without any increase in deaths from other causes of neonatal disease.6A Cochrane
review of three trials (all at high risk of bias) including 500 women concluded that IAP for colonised mothersreduced the incidence of EOGBS disease (relative risk 0.14; 95% CI 0.04 –0.74) although the numbers of deaths were
too small to assess the impact of the intervention on mortality.
7
There have been no randomised studies addressing whether routine screening has had any impact on all-causemortality. A positive antenatal screen will result in the recommendation of IAP which carries some risks for themother and baby. These include anaphylaxis,
8increased medicalisation of labour and the neonatal period, and
possibly, infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms when broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are usedfor prophylaxis.
9,10In the UK, most guidelines recommend that the ﬁrst-line drug for GBS-speciﬁc IAP should be
benzylpenicillin, also known as penicillin G. The UK National Screening Committee examined the issue of strategiesfor the prevention of EOGBS disease in 2016 –17 and in March 2017 recommended that routine screening using
bacteriological culture or near-patient testing techniques should not be introduced into UK practice.

2.1 Role of vaccination to prevent EOGBS disease
An effective vaccine given to pregnant women would be expected to induce high levels of GBS-speciﬁc immunoglobulin G
in the woman and, via transplacental transfer, in her baby, resulting in protection against neonatal GBS disease(both EOGBS and late-onset GBS). Phase II trials of a trivalent GBS conjugate vaccine in pregnant women in South Africaand Malawi have demonstrated safety as well as efﬁcient transplacental transfer of vaccine-speciﬁc antibodies.
11,12Vaccine
manufacturers are now developing pentavalent formulations (i.e. covering 5 of the 10 possible GBS serotypes) whichwould cover an estimated 96% of EOGBS cases in the UK. Another, or additional, potential mechanism of vaccineprotection may be through reduction of maternal GBS colonisation and transmission to the baby. However, no cleareffect of vaccination on colonisation was observed in the 2016 pregnancy trial with the trivalent conjugate vaccine.
11
Studies in the UK suggest that vaccination against GBS would be acceptable to pregnant women.13,14
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodology for developing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The
Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
Effects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE and Trip
were searched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all relevant articles published between January 2011and October 2016. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms,including all subheadings and synonyms, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included ‘groupB streptococcus’, ‘ Streptococcus agalactiae ’, ‘group B streptococcus and pregnancy’, ‘streptococcal infections’ and ‘GBS
bacteriuria’. The search was limited to studies on humans and papers in the English language. Relevant guidelineswere also searched for using the same criteria in the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute forHealth and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix I.
4. Information for women
4.1 What information should women be given about GBS colonisation of the mother and the
risk of neonatal infection, during pregnancy and after delivery?
All pregnant women should be provided with an appropriate information lea ﬂet.P
All pregnant women should be provided with an appropriate information leaﬂet, such as the RCOG
patient information leaﬂet Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in newborn babies.15Please see section 14
for more useful links and resources. Women should be offered information in a format that is accessibleto them.Evidence

5. Antenatal screening
5.1 Should all pregnant women be offered bacteriological screening for GBS?
Universal bacteriological screening is not recommended.D
The National Screening Committee16does not recommend universal bacteriological screening for GBS.
Their view is that there is no clear evidence to show that testing for GBS routinely would do moregood than harm. The reasons quoted are:
/C15Many women carry the bacteria and, in the majority of cases, their babies are born safely andwithout developing an infection.
/C15Screening women late in pregnancy cannot accurately predict which babies will develop GBS infection.
/C15No screening test is entirely accurate. Between 17% and 25% of women who have a positive swabat 35 –37 weeks of gestation will be GBS negative at delivery. Between 5% and 7% of women who
are GBS negative at 35 –37 weeks of gestation will be GBS positive at delivery.
/C15In addition, many of the babies who are severely affected from GBS infection are born prematurely,
before the suggested time for screening.
/C15Giving all carriers of GBS IAP would mean that a very large number of women would receive treatmentthey do not need; this may increase adverse outcomes to mother and baby (see sections below).
This is why screening all women in pregnancy for GBS is not routinely offered in the UK. Some women
choose to seek GBS testing outside the NHS. Providing the test is performed by an accredited laboratory,if the woman is found to be a carrier during the current pregnancy, IAP should be offered.
5.2 What are the clinical risk factors that affect the risk of GBS disease?
Clinicians should be aware of the clinical risk factors that place women at increased risk of
having a baby with EOGBS disease.P
There are a number of clinical risk factors that appear to place women at increased risk of having a baby with
EOGBS disease. These include:
/C15having a previous baby with GBS disease
/C15discovery of maternal GBS carriage through bacteriological investigation during pregnancy (for example, a urineinfection or a swab taken to investigate a vaginal discharge)
/C15preterm birth
/C15prolonged rupture of membranes
/C15suspected maternal intrapartum infection, including suspected chorioamnionitis
/C15pyrexia.Evidence

5.3 Should women be offered IAP if GBS was detected in a previous pregnancy, irrespective of
carrier status this pregnancy?
Explain to women that the likelihood of maternal GBS carriage in this pregnancy is 50%. Discuss
the options of IAP, or bacteriological testing in late pregnancy and the offer of IAP if still positive.B
If performed, bacteriological testing should ideally be carried out at 35 –37 weeks of gestation
or 3–5 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, e.g. 32 –34 weeks of gestation for women
with twins.C
Assuming that approximately 50% of women will be recurrent carriers, the risk of EOGBS disease should
be approximately 2 to 2.5 times that quoted for the total population.17–21The risk of EOGBS disease in
the baby in this circumstance is likely to be around 1 in 700 to 1 in 800.3At this risk level, some women
would choose IAP and others would not. Bacteriological testing in this circumstance would help to reﬁnethe risk. A positive bacteriological test in this circumstance would indicate a risk of 1 in 400, but the riskwould be 1 in 5000 if the mother is GBS negative. A signiﬁcant number of mothers may therefore chooseto avoid IAP if they test negative.Evidence
level 1 +
If bacteriological tests for GBS are to be performed in pregnancy they should ideally be performed at
35–37 weeks of gestation22in order to determine carriage status close to delivery. There is no evidence
to support the practice of varying the timing of screening. However, in women where preterm delivery isanticipated, earlier testing is justiﬁed.Evidence
level 2 +
5.4 Should women with a previous baby affected by GBS disease be offered IAP irrespective of
carrier status this pregnancy?
IAP should be offered to women with a previous baby with early- or late-onset GBS disease.D
The proportion of term pregnant women with a previous baby affected by EOGBS is assumed to be 0.08%,
based on a consensus estimate from a UK modelling study.23Mothers who have had a previous baby
affected by early- or late-onset GBS are at increased chance of another affected baby compared withwomen of similar carrier status who have not had an affected baby. The reasons for this increased risk arenot clear but may indicate persistence of carriage of a virulent strain of GBS or a deﬁcient immuneresponse.
24–26In view of this potentially increased risk, and the possibility of false-negative antenatal testing,
we recommend giving IAP in such cases and maternal bacteriological tests are not recommended.Evidence
level 3
5.5 What screening tests (if any) should be offered if a woman requests testing for carrier status?
A maternal request is not an indication for bacteriological screening.D
The National Screening Committee does not recommend universal bacteriological screening for GBS.Evidence

6. Antenatal care
6.1 How should GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy be managed?
Clinicians should offer IAP to women with GBS bacteriuria identi ﬁed during the current pregnancy.C
Women with GBS urinary tract infection (growth of greater than 105cfu/ml) during pregnancy
should receive appropriate treatment at the time of diagnosis as well as IAP.C
GBS bacteriuria is associated with a higher risk of chorioamnionitis and neonatal disease although it is not
possible to quantify these risks accurately. Women with GBS bacteriuria should be offered IAP. Womenwith GBS urinary tract infection (growth of greater than 10
5cfu/ml) during pregnancy should receive
appropriate treatment at the time of diagnosis as well as IAP.27Evidence
level 3
6.2 Should women be treated before the onset of labour if GBS carriage is detected incidentally
earlier in the pregnancy?
Antenatal treatment is not recommended for GBS cultured from a vaginal or rectal swab.C
Antenatal treatment for vaginal or rectal colonisation does not reduce the likelihood of GBS colonisation
at the time of delivery28and so is not indicated in this situation. Instead, IAP should be offered to
GBS-colonised women (see section 6.3).Evidence
level 2 +
6.3 Should the management differ if the detection of GBS is incidental or following intentional
testing, and if so, how?
Where GBS carriage is detected incidentally or by intentional testing, women should be offered
IAP.P
There is no evidence to support different management strategies based on how GBS carriage was detected.
6.4 Should being a GBS carrier inﬂuence the method of induction?
Method of induction should not vary according to GBS carrier status.P
There is no evidence to suggest that different induction methods increase the risk of EOGBS disease. If indicated,
intravenous IAP should be commenced once a diagnosis of established labour has been made following induction.
6.5 Is being a GBS carrier a contraindication to membrane sweeping?
Membrane sweeping is not contraindicated in women who are carriers of GBS.D
There is evidence that membrane sweeping does not increase the risk of EOGBS disease.29 Evidence

6.6 How should planned caesarean section in women with known GBS colonisation be
managed?
Antibiotic prophylaxis speci ﬁc for GBS is not required for women undergoing planned caesarean
section in the absence of labour and with intact membranes.C
All women having caesarean section should receive broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in line with the NICE
clinical guideline Caesarean section .30Women undergoing planned caesarean delivery in the absence of labour or
membrane rupture do not require additional penicillin antibiotic prophylaxis speciﬁcally for GBS, regardless of GBScolonisation status. The risk of neonatal EOGBS disease is extremely low in this circumstance.
Women who are known GBS carriers who are to be delivered by caesarean section after spontaneous
rupture of membranes should be offered IAP and delivered by category 2 or 3 caesarean depending onother clinical ﬁndings.

7. Management of term labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS
disease
7.1 How should rupture of membranes in a woman at term (37+0weeks of gestation) with
known or unknown GBS carrier status be managed?
Women who are known GBS carriers should be offered immediate IAP and induction of labour
as soon as reasonably possible.C
In women where the carrier status is negative or unknown, offer induction of labourimmediately or expectant management up to 24 hours. Beyond 24 hours, induction of labour isappropriate.A
If known to be colonised with GBS, women should be offered immediate IAP because of the increased
risk of EOGBS disease with prolonged rupture of membranes.32Evidence

As recommended in NICE clinical guideline 7033women should be offered induction of labour
immediately or up to 24 hours after spontaneous rupture of membranes with unknown carrier status.32Evidence

7.2 How should labour in a woman with a temperature of 38 °C or greater and without known
GBS colonisation be managed?
Women who are pyrexial (38 °C or greater) in labour should be offered a broad-spectrum
antibiotic regimen which should cover GBS in line with local microbiology sensitivities.C
Intrapartum pyrexia (38 °C or greater) is associated with a risk of EOGBS disease of 5.3 per 1000 (versus a
background risk of 0.6 per 1000).34

In view of this increased risk of EOGBS, IAP should be offered in the presence of maternal pyrexia. Since
a raised temperature can indicate chorioamnionitis, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, rather than penicillin G, is
recommended in this situation. The antibiotic regimen of choice will depend on local microbiology
guidance; intravenous amoxicillin 2 g every 6 hours (or intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 g every 6 hours inwomen with a nonanaphylactic reaction to penicillin) is acceptable in this context.

7.3 How should preterm labour be managed in women without known GBS colonisation?
IAP is recommended for women in con ﬁrmed preterm labour.D
IAP is not recommended for women not in labour and having a preterm planned caesarean
section with intact membranes.D
The proportion of women giving birth preterm in the UK is 8.2%.36More women present in threatened
preterm labour than deliver preterm. The risk of EOGBS disease in the infants of those women whodeliver preterm is estimated to be 2.3 per 1000.
23The risk of GBS infection is higher with preterm
delivery and the mortality rate from infection is increased (20 –30% versus 2 –3% at term).37,38In the 2015
British Paediatric Surveillance Unit national UK surveillance study, the mortality rate in preterm infants at33 weeks of gestation or less was 27% versus 2.7% at term.
39For this reason, IAP is recommended for
women in conﬁrmed preterm labour. However, IAP is not recommended for women having preterm
planned caesarean section with intact membranes.Evidence

7.4 Is there a role for polymerase chain reaction or other near-patient testing at the onset of
labour?
Polymerase chain reaction or other near-patient testing at the onset of labour is not
recommended.C
The evidence does not suggest that using polymerase chain reaction technology for near-patient testing is
feasible in UK maternity labour ward settings.40The technology for near-patient testing continues to
improve and it is possible that this may confer beneﬁts in the future. An ongoing cluster randomised trialis testing whether the use of near-patient testing in labour can reduce the use of IAP in women whopresent with clinical risk factors who would be eligible for IAP.Evidence

7.5 Can GBS-positive women have a water birth?
Birth in a pool is not contraindicated if the woman is a known GBS carrier provided she is
offered appropriate IAP.D

offered the appropriate IAP.41–43Evidence

8. Management of preterm labour (including rupture of membranes) to reduce the risk of EOGBS
disease
8.1 Women with preterm rupture of membranes
8.1.1 How should known or unknown GBS carrier status be managed in women with preterm prelabour rupture
of membranes?
Bacteriological testing for GBS carriage is not recommended for women with preterm rupture
of membranes. IAP should be given once labour is con ﬁrmed or induced irrespective of GBS
status.D
For those with evidence of colonisation in the current pregnancy or in previous pregnancies,the perinatal risks associated with preterm delivery at less than 34
+0weeks of gestation are
likely to outweigh the risk of perinatal infection. For those at more than 34+0weeks of
gestation it may be bene ﬁcial to expedite delivery if a woman is a known GBS carrier.D
There is no evidence that treating GBS colonisation before labour is beneﬁcial.44–46Therefore, a
prelabour-positive GBS culture does not change management in pregnancies with a gestation of less than
34+0weeks because the high morbidity associated with early preterm birth means that early delivery is
not indicated unless there are overt signs of infection. The risk of GBS infection is higher with pretermdelivery and the mortality rate from infection is increased (20 –30% versus 2 –3% at term)
37,38and this
therefore justiﬁes IAP in all cases of preterm labour.
The NICE guideline Preterm labour and birth47recommends that all women with preterm prelabour
rupture of the membranes should be offered oral erythromycin 250 mg, 4 times a day for a maximum of10 days or until the woman is in established labour (whichever is sooner). Oral penicillin should beconsidered for the same duration in women who cannot tolerate erythromycin or in whom erythromycinis contraindicated.
A large multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of elective delivery at 34 –36 weeks of gestation for
preterm spontaneous rupture of membranes versus conservative management
48has demonstrated no
signiﬁcant differences in neonatal disease, morbidity or mortality. As a result, there is no indication toprefer one form of management over the other at this gestational age although IAP should be given oncelabour starts. There may be disadvantages with conservative management beyond 34
+0weeks of gestation
in the presence of known GBS colonisation and in this group, early intervention may be preferable.49Evidence

9. Bacteriological considerations
Public Health England has published a standard for the detection of GBS carriage.50
9.1 What are the appropriate swabs if testing for carrier status is to be undertaken?
When testing for GBS carrier status, a swab should be taken from the lower vagina and the
anorectum. A single swab (vagina then anorectum) or two different swabs can be used.D
Public Health England has published a standard for the detection of GBS carriage.50The standard notes
that optimum yield will be achieved with swabs obtained from the lower vagina and the anorectum. Asingle swab for both sites of collection is rational but two different swabs can be used. The swabs may berayon or dacron, ﬁbre or ﬂocked, and may be collected by the physician or other qualiﬁed caregiver, orby the woman with appropriate instruction. These tests are described as enriched culture medium tests.Evidence
level 4
9.2 How quickly should the swabs be transported to the laboratory, in what medium and at
what temperature?
After collection, swabs should be placed in a non-nutrient transport medium, such as Amies or
Stuart. Specimens should be transported and processed as soon as possible. If processing isdelayed, specimens should be refrigerated.D
GBS isolates can remain viable in transport media for several days at room temperature. However, the
recovery of isolates declines over 1 –4 days, especially at elevated temperatures, which can lead to
false-negative results. When feasible, specimens should be refrigerated before processing.4Evidence
level 4
9.3 What culture medium should be used if testing for GBS carriage is to be undertaken?
Enriched culture medium tests are recommended. The clinician should indicate that the swab is
being taken for GBS.D
The most widely used enriched culture medium is Todd-Hewitt broth with nalidixic acid and colistin
(e.g. Lim broth), or nalidixic acid and gentamicin further subcultured on a blood agar plate. Several optionsare available for the subculture of an enriched culture medium for isolation of GBS, including selective andchromogenic agar.

9.4 Which antibiotic should be used for IAP?
For women who have agreed to IAP, benzylpenicillin should be administered. Once
commenced, treatment should be given regularly until delivery.B
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 36 e295 of e305 ª2017 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
It is recommended that 3 g intravenous benzylpenicillin be given as soon as possible after the onset of
labour and 1.5 g 4 hourly until delivery. To optimise the efﬁcacy of IAP, the ﬁrst dose should be given at
least 4 hours prior to delivery. There is evidence that benzylpenicillin levels in cord blood exceed the
minimum inhibitory concentration for GBS as early as 1 hour after maternal administration51but it is not
known how this relates to neonatal colonisation or disease. There is also evidence that giving penicillin for2 hours before delivery reduces neonatal colonisation
52,53but evidence from 201354suggests that 4 hours
of penicillin is more effective than 2 hours at reducing the risk of EOGBS disease. Amoxicillin is analternative but the Cochrane review
7found no difference between amoxicillin and benzylpenicillin and
thus, the narrower spectrum antibiotic is preferred.Evidence
level 2 +
9.5 Which antibiotic should be used in women with known or suspected penicillin allergy?
Provided a woman has not had severe allergy to penicillin, a cephalosporin should be used. If
there is any evidence of severe allergy to penicillin, vancomycin should be used.P
The antibiotic chosen will depend on the conﬁdence of the diagnosis of penicillin allergy and the severity of penicillin
allergy. If the history suggests that the reaction described is not likely to be allergic in nature (e.g. vomiting only)then penicillin should be given. If the history suggests an allergy to beta-lactams, but one that is not severe(i.e. no anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress or urticaria), then a cephalosporin can be administeredintravenously (e.g. cefuroxime, 1.5 g loading dose followed by 750 mg every 8 hours). If the allergy to beta-lactams issevere then intravenous vancomycin (1 g every 12 hours) is recommended.

Clindamycin can no longer be recommended as the current resistance rate in the UK is 16%.39 Evidence

9.6 How should known GBS colonisation in women who decline IAP be managed?
Women with known GBS colonisation who decline IAP should be advised that the baby should
be very closely monitored for 12 hours after birth, and discouraged from seeking very earlydischarge from the maternity hospital.P
Women should be made aware that the risk of the baby developing EOGBS infection is higher than if they
had received IAP. The overall risk remains low. The baby will require clinical evaluation at birth andmonitoring of vital signs for 12 hours.

9.7 What are the adverse effects of IAP (maternal anaphylaxis, altered neonatal bowel ﬂora and
abnormal child development)?
Clinicians should be aware of the potential adverse effects of IAP.C
A positive antenatal screen will result in the recommendation of IAP, which may carry some risks for
mother and baby. A UK Obstetric Surveillance System study (2012 –2015)56identiﬁed 37 cases of
maternal anaphylaxis over 3 years (1.6/100 000 maternities), around 50% of which were associated withthe administration of antibiotics (0.8/100 000 maternities) although it is not known whether any weregiven as IAP.Evidence

Changes in the neonatal bowel microbiome have been linked to a number of later effects in the child,

There are no studies showing that IAP adversely affects child development. The ORACLE I trial showed
that oral erythromycin or co-amoxiclav given to pregnant women with preterm prelabour rupture of themembranes for up to 10 days was not associated with any long-term adverse outcomes.
65However, the
ORACLE II trial showed that oral erythromycin given to pregnant women in spontaneous preterm labourwith intact membranes for up to 10 days was associated with long-term functional impairment in children(odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 –1.37), and both oral erythromycin (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.21 –3.09) and
co-amoxiclav (odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.07 –2.67) were associated with cerebral palsy at the age of
7 years.
66However, this was a different scenario to that of IAP. Moreover, at the age of 11 years, no
effect of these antibiotics given in either spontaneous preterm labour or prelabour rupture of membraneswas found on continuous outcome scores, contextual value added measure (a measure of educationprogress), or on criterion-referenced attainment or identiﬁed special needs.

The NICE clinical guideline Neonatal infection (early onset): antibiotics for prevention and treatment ,55outlines

11.2 How should term babies whose mothers have received adequate IAP be managed?
Term babies who are clinically well at birth and whose mothers have received IAP for
prevention of EOGBS disease more than 4 hours before delivery do not require specialobservation.P
The babies of women who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics during labour forindications other than GBS prophylaxis may require investigation and treatment as per the NICE
clinical guideline on early-onset neonatal infection.P
Given that adequate IAP reduces the risk of EOGBS disease to a level approaching that of the general
population it seems reasonable to manage these babies as low risk.7Evidence
level 4
11.3 How should well babies at risk of EOGBS disease whose mothers have not received
adequate IAP be monitored?
Well babies should be evaluated at birth for clinical indicators of neonatal infection and have
their vital signs checked at 0, 1 and 2 hours, and then 2 hourly until 12 hours.P

The incidence of EOGBS disease in asymptomatic term infants without known antenatal risk factors in the
UK is estimated at 0.2 cases/1000 births.70No RCT has investigated treatment in this group. If postnatal
antibiotic treatment was completely effective and there were no adverse effects, 5000 infants would needto be treated to prevent a single case and at least 80 000 infants would have to be treated to prevent asingle death from EOGBS disease. Routine postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended.Evidence

The NICE guideline on early-onset neonatal infection55contains a list of clinical indicators of neonatal
infection and is provided as an appendix in this guideline (see Appendix II). Clinicians caring for babies

Babies should be evaluated at birth for clinical indicators of neonatal infection and have their
vital signs checked at 0, 1 and 2 hours, and then 2 hourly until 12 hours.P
The baby of a mother who has had a previous baby with GBS disease is believed to be at increased risk of EOGBS
although it is not possible to estimate the size of this risk.
Mothers who have had a previous baby with GBS disease will be offered IAP. Following careful clinical
assessment the baby’s vital signs and clinical condition should be monitored closely for at least 12 hours(see NICE clinical guideline 149).

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
