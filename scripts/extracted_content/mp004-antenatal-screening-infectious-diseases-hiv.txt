Background to the screening programme is given in Appendix B . 
 
For Designated programme lead for maternity services and Link speciality staff please see 
Appendix A 
 
1.1 Aims 
 
The NHS infectious Disease in Pregnancy Screening Programme ensures that all 
pregnancy women are offered and recommended screening for HIV [public 
Health England (PHE) 2018b] 
 
1.2 Objectives 
1.2.1 To ensure that women with HIV are identified early in pregnancy to 
facilitate appropriate assessment and management for their health 
1.2.2 To reduce the risk of mother -to-child transmission of HIV 
1.2.3 To facilitate appropriate neonatal referral and management [PHE 
2018b] 
1.3 Expected Health Outcomes 
 
Our aim is to reduce the risk of a mother -to-child transmission of HIV and 
safeguard the woman own health [PHE 2018b . 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 7 of 31 2 Screening for HIV In Pregnancy 
2.1 Pre-Screening information: enabling informed choice 
2.1.1 At the first antenatal contact with the midwife, the woman should be 
given verbal and written information about HIV. This should include the 
benefits of screening for both the woman and unborn baby [National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2008, PHE 2018b] . 
2.1.2 Screening should be offered and recommended. 
2.1.3 Trust uses the NHS Screening Programmes information booklet: 
‘Screening tests for you and your baby’. This includes the section 
‘Infectious Diseases’ This leaflet may be sent to the woman by post 
prior to the first appointment or given out at the first appointment. The 
midwife must document in the hand held notes that the leaflet has 
been received by the woman. 
2.1.4 Copies of ‘Screening tests for you and your baby’ are available in some 
other languages and can be downloaded via the Public Health England 
website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening -
tests -for-you-and-your -baby -description -in-brief If the leaflet is not 
available in the language required from the national website, it is 
possible to ask for the leaflet to be translated via the trust’s Equality 
and Diversity Team. 
 
2.1.5 Interpreting services (including sign language) should be used for 
communicating with parents who are not fluent in English at all stages 
of the screening pathway. 
 
2.1.6 Where there are specific communication requirements (e.g. English is 
not the woman’s first language, visual/ hearing impairment ) 
appropriate interpretation services should be used at booking and all 
subsequent stages in the screening pathway. For further guidance see 
also the trusts Accessible Communications Guidelines via the Equality 
and Diversity team. 
 
2.1.7 If the midwife or doctor feels unable to answer all questions or the 
woman requests further advice/information about any aspect of HIV, 
then a direct referral can be made to the Specialist Midwife for 
Reproductive Health and Wellbeing (SMRHW) for specialist counselling 
[See contact list Appendix A . 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 8 of 31 3 Offering Screening in Pregnancy 
3.1 The Eligible Population 
All women and people should be offered screening for HIV early in each 
pregnancy regardless of the results of HIV screening in previous pregnancies 
[NICE 2008, PHE 2018b, PHE 2019] 
 
3.2 The midwife or doctor should discuss the reasons why screening for HIV is 
recommended, the results process and follow -up if diagnosed with HIV 
infection. 
 
3.3 Screening should be offered early in pregnancy, ideally by 10 weeks [NICE 
2008 ]. The aim is to offer and screen all women before 10 weeks, however, 
screening can be offered at any point during the pregnancy. 
 
3.4 Women booking late or who arrive unbooked in labour should still be offered 
screening at the first available opportunity (see sections 4.0 and 5.0). 
 
3.5 Testing should also be available on request at any stage of pregnancy should a 
woman consider herself to be at risk of infection [PHE 2018b] . However advice 
should be sought immediately from the GUM team if a woman thinks she have 
been in contact with HIV infection during pregnancy. 
 
3.6 Women who have booked elsewhere and transferred care to BSUH NHS TRUST 
should be offered repeat screening. This ensures a result is available in -house 
for all staff to access electronically if the hand held notes are not available and 
for completion of cohort data. If a woman or person declines repeat testing 
having been screened elsewhere, then a copy of the original result from the 
previous booking unit must be inserted in the hand held notes and a further 
copy sent to the Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator and SMRHW. A booking 
test declined form (Appendix C) should be completed and the declines process 
should be implemented) 
 
3.7 The midwife should document in the hand held notes that discussion has taken 
place and the woman’s decision to accept or decline screening. Screening 
should only be performed after documented informed consent; this does not 
require a signature from the woman. 
 
3.8 There is currently no national policy to offer repeat HIV screening later in 
pregnancy . However, in the following circumstances, the midwife should 
consider a repeat test at 28 weeks if: 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 9 of 31 • If a woman or person changes their sexual partner/s or continues to 
engage in at risk behaviour during the pregnancy including injecting 
recreational drugs, sex work, having a partner that is known to be 
bisexual, having a partner that is known to have HIV, or if either partner 
is diagnosed with an STI 
• If the woman is from a high risk group and/ or her partner is from a 
high risk group with HIV status is unknown. E.g. if they are from a sub -
Saharan country 
• If symptomatic for sero -conversion (rash, flu -like symptoms, sore 
throat, diarrhoea) at any stage 
• If the woman discloses that her partner is HIV positive [PHE 2018b] 
 
These cases should be considered on an individual basis. Advice can be sought from the 
SMRHW as necessary (see Appendix A ). 
4 Women Booking Late 
 
4.1 Women booking late must be offered screening at the first appointment with 
the midwife. Short interval between treatment for maternal infection and 
delivery are associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission. 
Therefore for women booking at 24 weeks gestation or later, the blood 
specimens should be marked urgent and positive results reported within 24 
hours (1 working day) of the sample being received in the laboratory [Royal 
College of Pathologists (RCP) 2013] 
 
4.2 In such cases it is the responsibility of the midwife booking the woman to 
follow up results within 5 working days of the sample being taken. The midwife 
must agree a plan with the woman to communicate the results to her. This 
plan must be documented in the maternal hand held notes [RCP 2013] . 
 
5 Women Who Arrive Un -booked or Without Screening Results in 
5.1 Labour 
5.1.1 Women who arrive unbooked or without screening results in labour 
must be offered screening on admission by the midwife responsible for 
her care. Consideration should be given to the stage of labour, woman’s 
condition and specific risk factors for HIV. The midwife should 
document all discussions that have taken place in the hand held notes 
[PHE 2018b] . 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 10 of 31 5.1.2 If the woman is considered to be at increased risk of HIV infection and 
delivery is imminent or maternal health compromised then it may be 
necessary to consider urgent or rapid screening. If in doubt as to 
whether urgent screening is necessary, discuss with the SMRHW or on-
call doctor for HIV. 
5.1.3 During normal working hours results can normally be obtained within 
an hour from the laboratory. These cases should be discussed with 
laboratory staff BEFORE the sample is taken, informing them that the 
result is urgent. Out of normal working hours, the case should be 
discussed with the on -call microbiologist and on -call doctor for HIV [PHE 
2016a, PHE 2018b] . 
5.1.4 Where a rapid test is required at the point of care (POCT – point of care 
test) in urgent cases (for example if delivery is imminent or baby has 
been born before maternal HIV testing), the case must be discussed 
with the on -call microbiology consultant and SMRHW or on call doctor 
for HIV. Where it is agreed that a POCT is appropriate, this will be 
carried out by either the on -call doctor for HIV, SMRHW or laboratory 
staff. 
5.1.5 Presumptive action should be taken on a preliminary positive result 
taken on a woman in labour until such time as the result is confirmed . 
5.1.6 If consent is withheld for screening during labour the midwife caring for 
the woman should re -offer screening after delivery and document 
discussions/ decisions in hand held maternity notes , and refer to the 
SMRHW for follow up [PHE 2018b] (DoH 2003). 
5.1.7 The midwife caring for the woman in labour should inform the on -call 
neonatal d octor when either: 
• consent to screening is withheld during labour 
• a woman has been screened but delivery is likely before 
the result is available 
In either of these situations, the midwife should alert the on -call 
neonatal consultant who, in conjunction with the on -call HIV doctor, 
will consider screening the infant. Breast feeding should be avoided 
until an HIV negative result is obtained. For further information refer 
to BSUH neonatal policy: HIV testing of babies of untested mothers. 
5.1.8 In all cases blood results must be obtained before discharge from the 
hospital / maternity services and documented in the hand held notes by 
the midwife responsible for the woman’s care [PHE2018b] 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 11 of 31 5.1.9 The Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator and SMRHW should both be 
informed of any woman or person screened on delivery suite/postnatal 
wards to ensure appropriate tracking and follow up [PHE 2018]. 
6 Women Known To Be Living with HIV Prior To Screening 
 
6.1 Where a positive diagnosis of HIV is documented and known to the health 
professional, they should refer the woman to the Specialist Midwife for 
Reproductive Health and Wellbeing (SMRHW) by phone immediately (see 
Appendix A ) to ensure appropriate management. Management for these 
women is the same as for women diagnosed via antenatal screening and 
detailed in section 10.0 
 
6.2 Known women living with HIV should still be re -screened for HIV as they may 
not be known to local GUM services and the positive result triggers the 
laboratory to inform the SMRHW which acts as an additional failsafe to ensure 
follow -up. When completing the request form write ‘HIV positive status 
known’ and include date of prior diagnosis and where it was performed. 
 
6.3 If the woman declines a re -screen for HIV then this should be recorded as ‘HIV 
screening test not required – positive status known’ rather than declined. All 
other antenatal screening tests should be offered as routine. 
 
7 7.0 Declining Screening 
 
7.1 Screening is optional. All women have the right to decline screening. In these 
cases the midwife should complete a booking blood test declined form (see 
Appendix C ) and return to the SMRHW. 
 
7.2 The decision to decline screening must be clearly documented by the midwife 
in the hand held notes. The ‘decline’ box must also be ticked on the booking 
blood request form. 
 
7.3 Where women decline screening, the midwife should ensure that the woman 
is aware she can opt for screening at any stage later in her pregnancy and is 
aware how to arrange this [PHE 2018b] . Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 12 of 31 7.1 The woman sho uld also be informed that as they have declined HIV screening, 
they will be contacted by the SMRHW to further discuss their choices. This 
contact will usually be within 10 working days of receipt of the decline form 
and ideally by 20 weeks. Ideally this discussion takes place in person. At this 
contact the SMRHW will: 
• discuss the woman or person ’s decision to decline and ensure that 
they are fully aware of the benefits of screening for both themselves 
and their baby 
• reoffer the screening test and where this is accepted arrange testing 
of all booking bloods and follow up of the result 
• offer and where accepted arrange needle prick point of care tests or 
oral swabs to women and people who are severely needlephobic 
[PHE 2018b] 
7.2 If the woman remains unscreened at 28 weeks the midwife should re -offer 
screening at the 28 week visit along with the other blood test routinely offered 
at this appointment. The midwife should document in the hand held notes any 
discussions that take place and the woman or person ’s decision to accept or 
decline screening after re -offer. 
 
7.3 The SMRHW will follow up at 32 weeks and if the woman remains unscreened, 
the SMRHW will inform the following staff by email: 
• Link Neonatal Consultant 
• Link GUM consultant 
• Link Obstetric Consultants 
• Consultant Virologist 
• Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator 
• Neonatal secretary 
• Consultant Neonatologist (who will co -ordinate a team meeting 
to formulate a postnatal management plan individual to the 
woman or person’s circumstances) [PHE 2018b] 
7.4 For further information refer to BSUH neonatal policy: HIV testing of babies of 
untested mothers. 
8 Taking the Sample 
 
8.1 The sample may be taken at booking by the midwife or practice nurse or 
phlebotomist according to local arrangements: 
• A 5 ml sample of blood is required in a gold topped (clotted) bottle. This 
same sample can be used for Syphilis and Hep atitis B screening. 
• The requestor (midwife or doctor) should complete all fields on the 
Antenatal Booking Blood Request Form. The request from is in 
triplicate, and the requestor must ensure that all hand writing has 
transferred through and is legible on all three sheets of the form. Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 13 of 31 Where adhesive patient labels are used, a label must be affixed onto 
each of the three sheets of the request form. The form includes tick 
boxes for ‘accept’ or ‘decline’ of HIV screening as well as boxes to 
indicate whether this is a ‘first booking’, ‘urgent’ or ‘repeat’ sample. 
 
8.2 The sample must be labelled according to laboratory guidelines. The minimum 
acceptable identifiers include forename, surname (no abbreviations), plus date 
of birth and NHS number or hospital ID number. The NHS number is the 
preferred number to use [PHE 2016a] . 
 
8.3 Additional information should be included on the request form if relevant: 
For example: family origins, recent immigration (if lived in an area of world 
where HIV is endemic), known prior positive result and first language (if not 
English) to assist the SMRHW in follow -up of positive results. 
 
8.4 Samples are sent to Brighton Pathology for processing and should arrive within 
one wor king day of sample collection. 
9 Unacceptable Samples 
9.1 Where the sample is deemed to be unacceptable by the laboratory because of 
insufficient blood, incomplete data on the request form, mislabelling of sample 
bottle or for any other reason, the laboratory will inform the sample requestor 
to request a repeat. In such cases, a repeat sample should ideally be taken 
within 10 working days of the request being received by the maternity unit 
[PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b] . 
9.2 Where repeat samples take longer than 10 working days to arrange (for 
example the woman is away or declines to attend for repeat sampling within 
10 days), the midwife should document reasons why there has been a delay. 
9.3 The midwife must always follow up the results of repeated samples and 
arrange a plan (documented in the hand held notes) being mindful that there 
has already been a delay in obtaining a result because of the need to repeat. 
 
10 Results Processes 
10.1 Accessing result 
(Including failsafes to ensure all women who accept screening receive a result) 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 14 of 31 10.1.1 Results will be available to staf f within 5 working days on ICE (the 
electronic results reporting programme) or by phoning the virology 
labo ratory at RSCH on 01273 696955 ext 4627 [PHE 2016a] . 
10.1.2 Failsafe - 10 day check: 
It is the responsibility of the sample requestor to follow up results 
within 10 working days of the sample being taken (see also 9.1.3 for 
situations where this is not possible). The sample requestor should 
ensure positive results have been acted upon (by contacting the 
SMRHW ) and follow up missing results or laboratory requests for a 
repeat sample. The sample requestor must document that results 
were followed up and acted on. An example proforma that can be 
used for recording that results were followed up is given in Appendix 
D 
10.1.3 It is recognised that some community clinics do not have facilities for 
venepuncture and therefore women attend hospital phlebotomy to 
have bloods taken. In such cases, the sample requestor will not know 
when the bloods were actually taken and so cannot follow up results at 
10 days. In such cases it is essential that the requestor follows up 
results as per 9.1.4. 
 
10.1.4 Failsafe - check at follow up antenatal appointment: 
It is the responsibility of the health professional (midwife or doctor) 
providing care at the next antenatal appointment (usually at the 16 
weeks of pregnancy appointment) to check the results . If the result is 
negative then , document results (with informed consent) in the hand 
held notes and inform the woman of the results during the 
appointment [PHE 2018b] .If the result is positive please liaise with 
the SMRHW to confirm the woman or person is already known to the 
SMRHW, and the woman or person has been informed of the result. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 15 of 31 10.1.5 Failsafe - Check at time of dating scan 
As an additional failsafe, the Antenatal Screening Support Worker 
(ASSW) will ensure a full set of booking blood results are available at 
the time women attend dating scan. This allows early identification 
of missing results that can be actioned after the scan. With consent, 
missing bloods will be repeated at this point of contact by the ASSW. 
The ASSW will then inform, via email, the Antenatal Screening Team 
and named community midwife. It is then the responsibility of the 
named community midwife to follow up results within 10 working 
days and inform the woman or person as per 9.1.2. all women and 
people should be notified of their results following testing and this 
includes women and people who terminate or miscarry following 
screening. This is especially important with screen positive results to 
ensure women and people are referred and seen for specialist follow 
up within the timeframe detailed in section 10.0 [PHE 2016a, PHE 
2018b] 
 
10.1.6 It is recognised that not all women will be attending for dating scan. 
This might include women booking late or transferring in from another 
trust or women who decline scans. Therefore this is will not capture all 
women which is why the failsafe checks as detailed in this section are 
mandatory. 
 
10.1.7 Women who terminate or miscarry : 
All women should be notified of their results following testing and 
this includes women who terminate or miscarry following screening. 
This is especially important with screen positive results to ensure 
women are referred and seen for specialist follow up as per section 
10.0 [PHE 2016a, PHE 2018b] . 
10.1.8 Missing Antenatal Screening Results : 
Results should be documented in all cases at the next antenatal 
appointment [PHE 2018 b]. In rare circumstances, a result may not be 
available at the next appointment. The midwife or doctor should 
phone the laboratory to try and ascertain how long results will take 
and agree with the woman or person, a plan to communicate the 
results to them. 
10.1.9 If having phoned the laboratory it is apparent that there is no result, 
then a repeat screening test should be recommended and where 
accepted, taken that day or within 10 working days maximum [PHE 
2016a, PHE 2018b]. 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 16 of 31 10.1.10 Where a repeat sample is taken, the midwife or doctor taking the 
sample must agree a plan with the woman for communicating the 
result to her within a specified time frame. 
 
10.1.11 Full documentation of the above should be made in the hand held 
notes by health professional offering the test. 
 
11 Negative Result 
Where a result is negative, the health professional (midwife or doctor) informing the 
woman of the result should explain the following: 
 
11.1 A negative result does not confer protection on the woman. If a woman (or her 
partner) engages in high risk behaviour there is a risk of acquiring HIV during 
pregnancy [PHE 2018a] Informing a woman of a negative test result should be 
used as an opportunity for general sexual health promotion and for the 
dangers of becoming infected during pregnancy or lactation [PHE 2016b, PHE 
2018b]. 
11.2 There is a ‘window period’ of 6-8 weeks between acquiring the infection and 
testing HIV antibody positive. Therefore there is a small possibility of infection 
going undetected . The option for a repeat test later in the pregnancy should be 
offered in cases where the woman is anxious about her status or if she is 
unaware of her partner’s HIV status and he is from a higher risk group (for 
example IV drug user / from HIV endemic area). 
 
11.3 Women can also request repeat screening at any stage of the pregnancy if she 
requests to do so or deems herself at risk or changes her sexual partner [PHE 
2016b, PHE 2018b] 
12 Follow Up For Women w ith a n HIV Positive Result 
 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 17 of 31 12.1 All confirmatory testing is performed in Brighton pathology laboratory. 
12.2 The virology laboratory staff will inform the Specialist Midwife for 
Reproductive Health and Wellbeing (SMRHW) and designated Health Advisors 
(HA - who provide cover if the SMRHW is absent) by email of a HIV positive or 
equivocal result. This email is sent to a dedicated email account 
(bsuh.womens.health.advisor@nhs.net ) which is checked daily by the 
designated specialist staff (SMRHW/HAs). This failsafe ensures results are 
communicated and actioned within the appropriate timeframe as per 10.6. 
12.3 The following members of staff are also informed about an HIV positive result 
• Manager of SMRHW 
• Nominated Health advisor 
• Consultant for HIV in pregnancy 
• Consultant obstetrician 
• Consultant neonatologist 
• Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator 
 
12.4 The laboratory also informs the Health Protection Agency’s Communicable 
Disease Surveillance Centre on line with national policy (DoH 2003). Note all 
HIV positive samples undergo confirmatory testing within BSUH pathology at 
the RSCH laboratory 
 
12.5 All positive results will be actioned within 48 working hours of the result being 
received by the Health Advisor team. 
12.6 The SMRHW (or HA in her absence) will first attempt to contact the woman by 
phone offering an appointment at the Claude Nicol Centre, RSCH, to discuss 
antenatal screening blood test results. Women will be offered an appointment 
within 10 working days of the result. If there is no response from the letter 
then attempts will be made to contact the woman by phone. 
12.7 At this first appointment, the SMRHW will inform the women of the results and 
meet her immediate support needs according to each individual case. This will 
vary according to whether this was a prior diagnosis or new diagnosis. In 
addition the following will take place (either at this appointment or subsequent 
appointments according to the individual circumstances): 
• Baseline CD4/Viral load test taken. Process agreed with the women for 
communicating results 
• The SMRHW asks patients for consent to inform all relevant parties

other staff involved in her care can only be informed and a result can only be 
documented in the hand held notes, with informed consent. Women who 
decline documentation of their HIV status should be encouraged to inform 
staff on admission in labour. Failure to do so could adversely affect care and 
interventions may take place that unwittingly increase the risk of vertical 
transmission. 
13.2 The SMRHW has responsibility to inform the following staff (once informed 
consent has been obtained): 
• Community midwife by email 
• Consultant for HIV in Pregnancy in person (arranges appointment for 
the woman to be seen)

 Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (RSCH PRH only ) 
 
Brighton and Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust Page 27 of 31 22 Appendix B - Background to Antenatal screening for HIV 
 
1.0 Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a blood borne virus. It is a retrovirus that 
infects and damages T -lymphocytes, resulting in immune suppression that may lead to 
Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Two forms of the virus have been 
identified, HIV -1 and HIV -2. The commonest and most virulent form is HIV -1 with HIV -
2 being relatively uncommon in western countries 
 
1.1 HIV is transmitted through: sexual contact, contact with contaminated blood products 
e.g. needle sharing, vertical transmission during pregnancy, birth or breast feeding 
[PHE 2016b] 
 
1.2 The risk of mother/parent -to-child HIV transmission in an untreated woman or person 
in pregnancy is around 25%. However, with early diagnosis, effective treatment and 
subsequent viral suppression, the risk of transmission is now very low (under 0.5%) 
[PHE 2016b]. 
 
1.3 Pregnant women are offered screening for HIV infection so that interventions can be 
offered to reduce the risk of mother to child transmission of the virus, as well as 
safeguard the mother’s own health [PHE 2018b]. Antenatal screening for infectious diseases: MP004
