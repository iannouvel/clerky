Suspected Preterm Labour: Guidance for Frontline Clinicians SPTLG/v0.1/A4/2020-10Page 1 of 2Over the last 25 years the prospects for babies who 
are born very premature, have congenital anomalies 
requiring surgery, or who develop illnesses after 
birth, have improved greatly. For example, in babies 
born at extremely low gestational ages (23-25 weeks of 
gestation) survival increased between 1995 and 2006 by 
15%, and since then has continued to improve year on 
year (https://fn.bmj.com/content/105/3/232).
Alongside this, services have been re-organised into a 
series of networks so that hospitals can work together 
to ensure that expert care can be delivered when it 
is needed. These centres are required to look after a 
minimum number of very small infants and infants 
requiring intensive care; in order to maintain expertise.
Improving outcomes should not mean we are compla-
cent. The evidence shows that there are further gains 
that can and should be achieved. We know that some 
of the variation in outcomes is due to babies being born in maternity units without intensive care services. Whilst 
every hospital with a labour ward has the capability to 
look after a sick or preterm baby who needs intensive 
care as an emergency; and can do so for a brief period 
of time – the expertise of an intensive care unit is 
demonstrated to improve outcomes for these infants. 
Additionally babies who are born in the wrong centre 
will then need to undergo a transfer ex-utero, which has 
also been associated with a worse outcome; as well as 
causing increased demand for neonatal transfer services.
Achieving more than 85% of extremely preterm births 
(<27 weeks) in the right place is a national standard 
(KLOE 20/21); and having in place a perinatal pathway to 
facilitate this is a NICE quality standard.
In an emergency, it is always the right decision to go 
to the nearest hospital (with a labour ward). If there 
is a choice, the aim of this flow chart is to aid decision 
making to support delivery in the right centre.NICU LNU SCUNeonatal Intensive Care Unit (level 3)
• In-patient care of mothers expected to deliver at less 
than 27 weeks gestation
• In-patient care of mothers at 27 weeks gestation and 
above who are considered to be at high risk (identified 
in clinical guidelines – for example, severe early onset 
pre-eclampsia; fibronectin positive; cervical length 
decrease at 24 – 27 weeks)
• Babies needing intensive care (excluding short-term 
intensive care in level 2 units)
• Babies needing intensive or high dependency care 
following surgery
• Babies needing high dependency and special care
