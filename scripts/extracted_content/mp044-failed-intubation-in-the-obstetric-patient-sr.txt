A protocol is a set of measurable, objective standards to determine a course of action. Professional 
judgement may be use d in the application of a protocol. 
 
Scope 
 
This protocol applies to: 
• All people requiring general anaesthesia the peri -partum period. 
 
Responsibilities 
 
Anaesthetists, Midwives & Obstetricians: 
• To access, read, understand and follow this guidance 
• To use their professional judgement in application of this protocol 
 
Management Team : 
• To ensure the protocol is reviewed as required in line with Trust and National 
recommendations 
• To ensure the protocol is accessible to all relevant staff 
 
Background 
 
Differences between pregnant patients and other patien t populations include pregnancy -related 
changes in maternal physiology (eg, rapid oxygen desaturation , increased risk of 
aspiration, increased risk of a difficult airway), the need to consider bot h the maternal and fetal 
status, and human factors which may influence practice, including the time critical nature of most 
obstetric general anaesthetics. 
 
Management of the difficult airway for anaesthesia for any patient requires an algorithmic 
approach, to allow focussed intervention. The Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association and Difficult 
Airway Society (OAA/DAS ) have created algorithms for the management of the unanticipated 
difficult airway for pregnant patients . They also include a decision making tool which may be useful 
for deciding whether to continue with c aesarean delivery after a failed intubation . The UHS Trust 
protocol support the use of the OAA /DAS Guidelines.
