Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics
Green-top Guideline No. 47 
May 2015
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists2 of 23Blood Transfusion in Obstetrics
This is the second edition of this guideline, which was previously published under the same title in 2007.
Executive summary of recommendations 
How can the risk of transfusion be reduced?
Optimisation of haemoglobin in the antenatal period
Diagnosis
Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as first trimester haemoglobin (Hb) less than 110 g/l, second/third 
trimester Hb less than 105 g/l, and postpartum Hb less than 100 g/l, in line with British Committee 
for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidance.
For normocytic or microcytic anaemia, a trial of oral iron should be considered as the first step and 
further tests should be undertaken if there is no demonstrable rise in Hb at 2 weeks and compliance 
has been checked.
Pregnant women should be offered screening for anaemia at booking and at 28 weeks. Women 
with multiple pregnancies should have an additional full blood count done at 20–24 weeks.
Treatment and management
Oral iron should be the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency.
Parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed or patient compliance is in 
doubt or if the woman is approaching term and there is insufficient time for oral supplementation 
to be effective.
Women should receive information on improvement of dietary iron intake and factors affecting 
absorption of dietary iron.
The role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for non-end-stage renal anaemia is still 
to be established and it should only be used in the context of a controlled clinical trial or on the 
expert advice of the haematologist.
Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to minimise blood loss.
Women at high risk of haemorrhage should be advised to deliver in hospital.
General principles of blood transfusion
Consent for blood transfusion
Valid consent should be obtained where possible prior to administering a blood transfusion.
In an emergency, where it is not feasible to get consent, information on blood transfusion should 
be provided retrospectively.
The reason for transfusion and a note of the consent discussion should be documented in the 
patient’s case notes.B

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists3 of 23Requirements for group and screen samples and cross-matching 
All women should have their blood group and antibody status checked at booking and at 28 weeks 
of gestation.
Group and screen samples used for provision of blood in pregnancy should be less than 3 days old.
In a woman at high risk of emergency transfusion, e.g. placenta praevia, and with no clinically 
significant alloantibodies, group and screen samples should be sent once a week to exclude or 
identify any new antibody formation and to keep blood available if necessary. Close liaison with 
the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential.
Women should have a group and screen sample taken in line with clear locally agreed protocols 
for provision of blood.
Blood product specification in pregnancy and the puerperium 
ABO-, rhesus D- (RhD-) and K- (Kell-) compatible red cell units should be transfused.
If clinically significant red cell antibodies are present, then blood negative for the relevant antigen 
should be cross-matched before transfusion; close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is 
essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.
Cytomegalovirus- (CMV-) seronegative red cell and platelet components should be provided for 
elective transfusions during pregnancy.
What are the strategies to minimise the use of banked blood?
Is there a role for preoperative/predelivery autologous blood deposit?
Predelivery autologous blood deposit is not recommended.
Is there a role for intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS)?
Cell salvage is recommended for patients where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to 
induce anaemia or expected to exceed 20% of estimated blood volume.
Consent should be obtained for IOCS where possible and its use in obstetric patients should be 
subject to audit and monitoring.
Cell salvage should only be performed by multidisciplinary teams who develop regular experience 
of IOCS.
Where IOCS is used during caesarean section in RhD-negative, previously nonsensitised women 
and where cord blood group is confirmed as RhD positive (or unknown), a minimum dose of 1500 iu 
anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered following the reinfusion of salvaged red cells.
A maternal blood sample should be taken for estimation of fetomaternal haemorrhage 30–40 
minutes after reinfusion in case more anti-D is indicated.

CRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists4 of 23The protocol should be updated annually and practised in ‘skills drills’ to inform and train relevant 
personnel.
Are there mechanical strategies that can be employed?
Clinicians should familiarise themselves with mechanical strategies that can be employed to 
reduce postpartum blood loss.
What blood components can be used for obstetric haemorrhage?
When should red cells be used?
There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion 
should be made on clinical and haematological grounds.
In an extreme situation and when the blood group is unknown, group O RhD-negative red cells 
should be given (although they may be incompatible for patients with irregular antibodies).
Staff working in obstetric units should be aware of the location of the satellite blood fridge (where 
available) and should ensure that access is possible for blood collection.
In what circumstances should fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate be used?
FFP at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg should be administered for every 6 units of red cells during major 
obstetric haemorrhage. Subsequent FFP transfusion should be guided by the results of clotting 
tests if they are available in a timely manner, aiming to maintain prothrombin time (PT) and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratios at less than 1.5 x normal.
It is essential that regular full blood counts and coagulation screens (PT, APTT and fibrinogen) are 
performed during the bleeding episode.
Cryoprecipitate at a standard dose of two 5-unit pools should be administered early in major 
obstetric haemorrhage. Subsequent cryoprecipitate transfusion should be guided by fibrinogen 
results, aiming to keep levels above 1.5 g/l.
The FFP and cryoprecipitate should ideally be of the same group as the recipient. If unavailable, 
FFP of a different ABO group is acceptable providing that it does not have a high titre of anti-A or 
anti-B activity.
No anti-D prophylaxis is required if a RhD-negative woman receives RhD-positive FFP or 
cryoprecipitate.
When should platelets be used? 
Aim to maintain the platelet count above 50 x 109/l in the acutely bleeding patient.
A platelet transfusion trigger of 75 x 109/l is recommended to provide a margin of safety.
The platelets should ideally be group compatible. RhD-negative women should also receive RhD-
negative platelets.
Is there a role for near patient testing of coagulation?
Centres that are using thromboelastography (TEG®, Haemonetics, Braintree, Massachusetts, USA) 
or rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, Tem, Munich, Germany) for guiding blood transfusion 
during major obstetric haemorrhage must ensure that their transfusion algorithm protocol has 
been validated and that quality assurance measures are followed.DP

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5 of 23Pharmacological strategies for management of major obstetric haemorrhage
Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy?
The use of rFVIIa may be considered as a treatment for life-threatening postpartum haemorrhage 
(PPH), but should not delay or be considered a substitute for a live-saving procedure such as 
embolisation or surgery, or transfer to a referral centre.
Is there a role for fibrinogen concentrate therapy?
Fibrinogen concentrate is not licensed in the UK for the management of acquired bleeding disorders. 
Thus, its use in PPH should be considered only in the context of clinical trials.
Is there a role for antifibrinolytics?
For those centres not participating in clinical trials, consideration should be given to using 
tranexamic acid during major obstetric haemorrhage.
How should intrapartum anaemia be managed?
In addition to major haemorrhage guidelines, obstetric units should have guidelines on criteria for 
red cell transfusion in anaemic women who are not actively bleeding. If the Hb is less than 70 g/l in 
labour or in the immediate postpartum period, the decision to transfuse should be made according 
to the individual’s medical history and symptoms.
How should women with postpartum anaemia be managed in the postnatal period? 
If the Hb is less than 70 g/l in the postnatal period, where there is no ongoing or threat of bleeding, 
the decision to transfuse should be made on an informed individual basis.
How should women who decline blood products be managed? 
Hb should be optimised prior to delivery to prevent avoidable anaemia.
Consent/refusal of blood and components or other transfusion-sparing techniques should be 
discussed and documented during the antenatal period.
Use of pharmacological, mechanical and surgical procedures to avert the use of banked blood and 
blood components should be considered early.
IOCS has a role in the management of patients who refuse allogeneic blood transfusion.
1. Purpose and scope
Obstetric conditions associated with the need for blood transfusion may lead to morbidity and mortality 
if not managed correctly. The increasingly important issues in blood transfusion are adverse events 
associated with transfusion, including potential infection and potential transmission of prions, rising 
costs and the possible future problems of availability. 
The aim of this guideline is to update the previous guidance about the appropriate use of blood products 
that neither compromises the affected woman nor exposes her to unnecessary risk. Strategies to 
maximise the haemoglobin (Hb) level at delivery as well as to minimise blood loss are also discussed.D

PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists6 of 232. Introduction and background epidemiology
Obstetric haemorrhage remains a major cause of maternal mortality in the UK and is now the third 
leading cause of direct maternal deaths, accounting for approximately 10% of direct deaths. This does not 
represent a significant increase in mortality as deaths have decreased overall. Substandard management 
continues to be a significant contributor to mortality from haemorrhage.1 It is estimated that there are 
more than 4000 cases of severe haemorrhage each year in the UK. The majority of these women will 
need blood transfusion.
Retrospective analyses of the clinical scenarios often criticise the employment of blood transfusion as 
‘too little, too late’. Women at high risk of losing greater than 1000 ml should be strongly advised to 
deliver in a setting where blood transfusion and intensive care facilities are available.2 
Blood transfusion may be a life-saving procedure but it is not without risk. Recipients may rarely develop 
transfusion-transmitted infections or suffer immunological sequelae such as red cell alloimmunisation. 
The major risk, however, of blood transfusion is of a patient receiving an ‘incorrect blood component’.3 
Strict adherence to correct sampling, cross-match and administration procedures is therefore of 
paramount importance, even in an emergency. 
3. Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-
top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the 
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]), EMBASE, Trip, MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic 
databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-
analyses. The search was restricted to articles published between 2003 and March 2013. The databases 
were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings, 
and this was combined with a keyword search. A top-up search was performed in December 2014.
Terms and keyword search words included ‘obstetrics and blood transfusion’, ‘tranexamic acid’, ‘factor 
VIIa’, ‘cell salvage’, ‘antifibrinolytics’, ‘fibrinogen concentrate’, ‘haematinics’, ‘autologous transfusion’, 
‘transfusion triggers’ and ‘platelet’. The search was limited to humans and the English language. The 
National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant 
guidelines and reviews. Guidelines and recommendations produced by organisations such as the British 
Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and various national bodies were considered. Where 
possible, recommendations are based on available evidence and the areas where evidence is lacking are 
annotated as ‘good practice points’.
4. How can the risk of transfusion be reduced?
4.1 Optimisation of haemoglobin in the antenatal period
4.1.1 Diagnosis
Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as first trimester haemoglobin (Hb) less than 110 g/l, second/third 
trimester Hb less than 105 g/l, and postpartum Hb less than 100 g/l, in line with BCSH guidance.
For normocytic or microcytic anaemia, a trial of oral iron should be considered as the first step and 
further tests should be undertaken if there is no demonstrable rise in Hb at 2 weeks and compliance 
has been checked.
Pregnant women should be offered screening for anaemia at booking and at 28 weeks. Women 
with multiple pregnancies should have an additional full blood count done at 20–24 weeks.PB
PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists7 of 23The BCSH has defined what it considers to be adequate Hb levels at different stages of 
pregnancy.4 The intrapartum and postpartum thresholds for Hb are derived from the World 
Health Organization with a modification suggested by the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention because of the plasma expansion seen in the second trimester.5–7
If the Hb is less than 110 g/l in the first trimester or less than 105 g/l in the second or third trimester, 
consider haematinic deficiency once haemoglobinopathies have been excluded. 
Iron deficiency can be difficult to diagnose. The signs and symptoms are generally nonspecific. 
Serum ferritin is the most useful test for diagnosing iron deficiency but it is an acute phase 
reactant.4 Other laboratory parameters also have their limitations.8
Anaemia not due to haematinic deficiency (for example, haemoglobinopathies and bone marrow failure 
syndromes) should be managed by blood transfusion where appropriate in close conjunction with a 
haematologist. 
In line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),9,10 screening for 
anaemia should be offered at booking and at 28 weeks, with an additional full blood count at 
20–24 weeks for women with multiple pregnancies.
4.1.2 Treatment and management
Oral iron should be the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency.
Parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed or patient compliance is in 
doubt or if the woman is approaching term and there is insufficient time for oral supplementation 
to be effective.
Women should receive information on improvement of dietary iron intake and factors affecting 
absorption of dietary iron.
The role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for non-end-stage renal anaemia is still 
to be established and it should only be used in the context of a controlled clinical trial or on the 
expert advice of the haematologist.
Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to minimise blood loss.
Women at high risk of haemorrhage should be advised to deliver in hospital.
A meta-analysis of randomised trials on the antenatal use of iron, with or without folic acid, 
showed a 50% reduction in the risk of anaemia in the third trimester or at delivery.11
A Cochrane review of studies comparing iron supplementation with no iron or placebo found 
that iron supplementation decreased the incidence of low birthweight babies and prevented 
maternal anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia.12 A second Cochrane review comparing 
intermittent versus daily iron supplementation showed that intermittent supplementation 
produced a similar risk of anaemia at term, prematurity and low birthweight babies, but was 
associated with fewer side effects.13
Parenteral therapy offers a shorter duration of treatment and a quicker response than oral 
therapy.14 It is, however, more invasive and expensive to administer. Severe allergic reactions 
are possible with all iron preparations. Intravenous iron products should only be administered 
when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions, as well as 
resuscitation facilities, are immediately available.A

DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists8 of 23Rich sources of dietary iron are red meat, fish and poultry. These provide haem iron that is 
more easily absorbed than non-haem iron but the latter forms the vast majority of iron taken 
through the diet.15 Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-haem iron whereas tea and 
coffee inhibit iron absorption from food.15
rHuEPO is mostly used in the anaemia of end-stage renal disease. rHuEPO has been used both 
antenatally and postpartum in patients without end-stage renal disease without any maternal, 
fetal or neonatal adverse effects.16,17 Its use in clinical practice for non-end-stage renal anaemia 
is still to be established and should only be used in the context of a controlled clinical trial 
and/or under haematological advice.
Clear evidence from randomised trials supports the active management of the third stage of 
labour as a method of decreasing postpartum blood loss.18–20
Maternal deaths from haemorrhage in the UK have fallen over the years and one contributor 
is considered to be the hospitalisation for delivery of women at higher risk of haemorrhage 
(older women, grand multiparae and those with pre-eclampsia). Analysis of such deaths has 
led to a recommendation that women at high risk of haemorrhage should not be delivered in 
units without immediate access to consultant-led care, blood products and intensive care.2
5. General principles of blood transfusion
5.1 Consent for blood transfusion
Valid consent should be obtained where possible prior to administering a blood transfusion.
In an emergency, where it is not feasible to get consent, information on blood transfusion should 
be provided retrospectively.
The reason for transfusion and a note of the consent discussion should be documented in the 
patient’s case notes.
The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), following 
a consultation exercise looking at consent for blood transfusion, recommended that valid 
consent for blood transfusion should be obtained wherever possible before administering a 
transfusion. While this does not entail specific written consent, valid consent does require the 
provision of information to patients on risks and benefits together with alternatives available 
with clear documentation in the clinical records.21
Where transfusion of all or specific blood components is refused, or an advance directive exists, this 
should be documented in the patient’s clinical records and communicated to all relevant healthcare 
professionals (see section 11).
Patients who require an emergency blood transfusion may not be able to give valid consent 
prior to the transfusion. Transfusion should not be delayed, but attempts should be made to 
provide information retrospectively.21 Patient information leaflets on blood transfusion are 
available from the UK blood transfusion services (see section 14).
The decision process leading to transfusion including indication for transfusion and obtaining 
valid consent should be documented in the patient’s clinical record.22,23 There is some limited 
evidence24 that when the decision or reason for transfusion is documented there is a lower rate 
of inappropriate transfusion.D

level 4RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists9 of 235.2 Requirements for group and screen samples and cross-matching 
All women should have their blood group and antibody status checked at booking and at 28 weeks 
of gestation.
Group and screen samples used for provision of blood in pregnancy should be less than 3 days old.
In a woman at high risk of emergency transfusion, e.g. placenta praevia, and with no clinically 
significant alloantibodies, group and screen samples should be sent once a week to exclude or 
identify any new antibody formation and to keep blood available if necessary. Close liaison with 
the hospital transfusion laboratory is essential.
Women should have a group and screen sample taken in line with clear locally agreed protocols 
for provision of blood.
Maternal red cell antibodies are relatively common.25 These can cause haemolytic disease of 
the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and will also have implications for the selection of blood for 
transfusion in the mother to avoid the risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions. Accordingly, 
the blood group and antibody status of the mother should be tested at booking and at 28 
weeks of gestation.26,27
When red cell antibodies are detected in the booking sample, further testing of maternal blood 
should be undertaken to determine the specificity and the level of antibody or antibodies 
and to assess the likelihood of HDFN,25 with early referral to a specialist fetal medicine unit 
depending on the nature of the antibody, level and previous history. Further details on the 
assessment and management of women with red cell antibodies during pregnancy are covered 
in the RCOG Green-top Guideline.25
Transfusion or pregnancy may stimulate the production of unexpected antibodies against 
red cell antigens through either a primary or secondary immune response.28 To ensure that 
the specimen used for compatibility testing is representative of a patient’s current immune 
status, serological studies should be performed using blood collected no more than 3 days in 
advance of the actual transfusion when the patient has been transfused or pregnant within 
the preceding 3 months.28
A formal deviation to the 3-day rule may be used in pregnant women with no clinically 
significant alloantibodies who require blood standing by for potential obstetric emergencies, 
e.g. placenta praevia,28 with samples sent once a week to the transfusion laboratory for testing. 
Fetomaternal haemorrhage constitutes a smaller stimulus than transfusion because the number 
of foreign antigens is limited and in many pregnancies the volume of red cells transferred from 
fetus to mother is too small to stimulate a primary response.29
The majority of laboratories in the UK now use automated testing for blood grouping and 
antibody testing with advanced information technology systems for documentation and 
reporting of results. The hospital transfusion laboratory can readily provide red cells that are 
ABO and rhesus D (RhD) compatible using electronic issue with no cross-matching needed, 
provided that the patient does not have any antibodies and there are robust automated systems 
in place for antibody testing and identification of the patient.28 In this setting, since blood can 
be readily issued, there is no need to reserve units for individual cases. Where electronic issue 
is not available, a locally agreed maximum surgical blood ordering schedule should be used to 
decide how many red cell units should be reserved and available for particular cases, based on 
the obstetric diagnosis. In patients with red cell antibodies, cross-match between the patient’s 
blood and the red cell units to be transfused is essential to ensure compatibility.PD

Evidence 
level 4DRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists10 of 23It should be borne in mind that many hospitals send antenatal serology off-site for economies of scale. If 
hospitals send antenatal serology samples for testing off-site, it is advised that the results of the grouping 
and antibody screen should be made readily available for the local unit. If laboratory provision is off-site, 
there should be robust systems in place for local arrangements for the provision of blood, and components 
if required, taking into account transport times and whether or not the woman has red cell antibodies.
Unless secure electronic patient identification systems are in place, a second sample should be 
requested for confirmation of the ABO group of a first-time patient prior to transfusion, where 
this does not impede the delivery of urgent red cells or other components.28
5.3 Blood product specification in pregnancy and the puerperium 
ABO-, RhD- and K- (Kell-) compatible red cell units should be transfused.
If clinically significant red cell antibodies are present, then blood negative for the relevant antigen 
should be cross-matched before transfusion; close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is 
essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.
Cytomegalovirus- (CMV-) seronegative red cell and platelet components should be provided for 
elective transfusions during pregnancy.
Pregnant women (and women of childbearing age) who are RhD negative must only receive 
RhD-negative blood to avoid the risk of RhD alloimmunisation.28 Previous blood transfusion is 
an important cause for alloimmunisation with antibodies other than anti-D, in particular anti-K, 
which can cause severe HDFN.25 Accordingly, unless a woman is known to be K positive, only 
K-negative blood should be used for transfusion in women of childbearing age.28 
Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with immediate issue 
of group O, RhD-negative and K-negative units, with a switch to group-specific blood as soon as feasible.
The aim of antibody screening is to determine the presence of atypical red cell antibodies 
of likely clinical significance. When the antibody screen is positive, further testing is 
required to identify the relevant antibody or antibodies and the laboratory should select 
red cell units negative for the relevant antigen for cross-matching.28 However, in a major 
obstetric haemorrhage there should be no delay in the provision of blood with the initial use 
of group O-negative units if needed, with subsequent transfusion of cross-matched antigen-
negative units when available.30 Close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential, with 
input if needed from the clinical haematology team and specialist advice from the national 
blood service.
In 2012, SaBTO stated that CMV-seronegative red cells and platelets should be provided, where 
possible, for pregnant women.31 The UK policy of universal leucocyte depletion substantially 
reduces the risk of CMV transmission.32 In an emergency, such as major haemorrhage, standard 
leucocyte-depleted components should be given to avoid delay and CMV-negative blood or 
platelets are not needed for transfusion during delivery or in the postpartum period.31
6. What are the strategies to minimise the use of banked blood?
6.1 Is there a role for preoperative/predelivery autologous blood deposit?
Predelivery autologous blood deposit is not recommended.

trials and concluded that the studies were of poor quality, with insufficient numbers of CEvidence

Preoperative/predelivery deposit of autologous blood is not a service that is available routinely 
in the UK.
6.2 Is there a role for intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS)?
Cell salvage is recommended for patients where the anticipated blood loss is great enough to 
induce anaemia or expected to exceed 20% of estimated blood volume.
Consent should be obtained for IOCS where possible and its use in obstetric patients should be 
subject to audit and monitoring.
Cell salvage should only be performed by multidisciplinary teams who develop regular experience 
of IOCS.
Where IOCS is used during caesarean section in RhD-negative, previously nonsensitised women 
and where cord blood group is confirmed as RhD positive (or unknown), a minimum dose of 1500 iu 
anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered following the reinfusion of salvaged red cells.
A maternal blood sample should be taken for estimation of fetomaternal haemorrhage 30–40 
minutes after reinfusion in case more anti-D is indicated.
In general, intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS) has been recommended for nonobstetric patients 
undergoing elective or emergency surgical procedures where the anticipated blood loss is 
great enough to induce anaemia or expected to exceed 20% of estimated blood volume.34–36 
Therefore, IOCS would not be required for most caesarean sections if a similar threshold 
were to be adopted.
IOCS has been used during caesarean section in a number of case reports and case series 
without any reported complications related to receiving salvaged blood.37 Although current 
evidence supports the use of IOCS in obstetrics,38,39 evidence from large randomised controlled 
trials are needed to support the routine practice of IOCS in obstetrics.
Preoperative discussions on blood transfusion should be undertaken according to SaBTO 
guidance,21 as outlined in the section above. These discussions should include oral and written 
information on cell salvage, if it is available in the facility where the woman is to give birth. 
More information for staff and patients is available from the UK Cell Salvage Action Group 
website (see section 14 for link details).
The NICE guideline on IOCS in obstetrics states that this procedure should only be performed 
by multidisciplinary teams who have regular experience of IOCS.37 UK centres with high 
levels of experience of IOCS in obstetrics have developed this experience by training staff to 
use cell salvage during elective routine low-risk caesarean sections.
Using disposables for low-risk cases to ensure that theatre staff are trained requires financial resource. 
If a hospital trust/maternity service provider cannot afford to purchase disposables to train staff in the 
elective, low-risk setting, then they cannot provide cell salvage in an emergency setting. 
IOCS, together with the use of modern leucocyte depletion filters, has been shown to be 
effective at removing the common markers of amniotic fluid contamination.40 However, it 
will not remove fetal blood cells and therefore adequate anti-D immunisation (as determined 
by Kleihauer test 30–40 minutes after the procedure) will be required to prevent rhesus 
immunisation in RhD-negative women.41Evidence

There should be a clear local protocol on how to manage major obstetric haemorrhage. 
The protocol should be updated annually and practised in ‘skills drills’ to inform and train relevant 
personnel.
In October 2010, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reported 94 incidents (23 obstetric 
cases) where there was a delay in accessing blood components for life-threatening bleeding 
patients, resulting in unacceptable morbidity and mortality.42 The report highlighted the 
need for local protocols that allow provision of emergency blood (including out of hours) in 
patients with major haemorrhage. These protocols should waive restrictions on special blood 
components, such as irradiated blood components or CMV, in order to avoid unnecessary 
delays of red blood cell (RBC) provision and to allow for rapid delivery of uncross-matched 
blood (i.e. group O RhD and K negative).42
A randomised controlled trial found that practical, multidisciplinary, obstetric emergency 
training increased midwives’ and doctors’ knowledge of obstetric emergency management, 
including postpartum haemorrhage (PPH);43 thus, the major haemorrhage protocol should be 
practised in ‘skills drills’ and updated annually so as to inform and train relevant personnel.
7.1 Are there mechanical strategies that can be employed?
Clinicians should familiarise themselves with mechanical strategies that can be employed to 
reduce postpartum blood loss.
The mechanical strategies that can be employed to minimise blood loss during PPH are outlined in 
RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 53, Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage .30
7.2 What blood components can be used for obstetric haemorrhage?
7.2.1 When should red cells be used?
There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion 
should be made on clinical and haematological grounds.
In an extreme situation and when the blood group is unknown, group O RhD-negative red cells 
should be given (although they may be incompatible for patients with irregular antibodies).
Staff working in obstetric units should be aware of the location of the satellite blood fridge (where 
available) and should ensure that access is possible for blood collection.
There are no firm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion.44 The decision to perform blood 
transfusion should be made on both clinical and haematological grounds. Blood transfusion is 
almost always required when the Hb is less than 60 g/l and it is rarely required when the Hb is 
greater than 100 g/l.44 It should also be remembered that patients with acute haemorrhage can have 
normal Hb; hence the clinical evaluation of the patient in this situation is extremely important. 
Between October 2006 and September 2010, the Rapid Response Report from the NPSA reported 
11 deaths and 83 incidents where the patient suffered harm as a result of delays in the provision 
of blood. One of the reasons for the delay in blood transfusion during life-threatening bleeding 
episodes was a lack of understanding concerning the term ‘cross-matched’, whereby clinicians 
frequently request ‘cross-matched blood’ without realising that this could take some time, which PEvidence

woman has RBC alloantibodies, the transfusion of group O RhD-negative red cells, or group-
specific red cells, must not be delayed.
In order to facilitate the immediate provision of uncross-matched group O red cell units for 
patients who suffer massive haemorrhage, some National Health Service (NHS) organisations 
have introduced satellite blood fridges in different clinical areas. Medical staff working in these 
organisations and who are involved in the management of major bleeding should be aware of 
the fridge location and should ensure that access is possible for blood collection.42
7.2.2 In what circumstances should fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate be used?
FFP at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg should be administered for every 6 units of red cells during major 
obstetric haemorrhage. Subsequent FFP transfusion should be guided by the results of clotting 
tests if they are available in a timely manner, aiming to maintain prothrombin time (PT) and 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratios at less than 1.5 x normal.
It is essential that regular full blood counts and coagulation screens (PT, APTT and fibrinogen) are 
performed during the bleeding episode.
Cryoprecipitate at a standard dose of two 5-unit pools should be administered early in major 
obstetric haemorrhage. Subsequent cryoprecipitate transfusion should be guided by fibrinogen 
results, aiming to keep levels above 1.5 g/l.
The FFP and cryoprecipitate should ideally be of the same group as the recipient. If unavailable, 
FFP of a different ABO group is acceptable providing that it does not have a high titre of anti-A or 
anti-B activity.
No anti-D prophylaxis is required if a RhD-negative woman receives RhD-positive FFP or 
cryoprecipitate.
Observational studies in military combat casualties have suggested that early administration of 
FFP in high ratios improves clinical outcomes of trauma bleeding patients.45–47 However, due 
to the lack of randomised controlled trials, the optimum FFP-to-RBC ratio for management of 
major bleeding remains unknown.48–51 Further, no studies have evaluated the optimum dose 
of FFP during major bleeding. Until further evidence becomes available, we recommend that 
FFP at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg should be administered for every 6 units of red cells during a 
major obstetric bleed.30
Subsequent FFP transfusion should be guided by the results of clotting tests (if they are available 
in a timely manner), aiming to maintain PT and APTT ratios at less than 1.5 x normal.52
Once the FFP has been ordered, it takes at least 30 minutes to thaw and issue.52 During this time, 
resuscitation should be continued with volume expanding fluids or red cells as appropriate. 
It should be borne in mind that, at present in the UK, most units of FFP (as is the case with red 
cells, platelets and cryoprecipitate) are not virally inactivated and that transfusion with these 
products offers a small risk of transfusion-transmitted infection.52
Full blood counts play an important role in guiding red cell and platelet transfusion during 
major haemorrhage, while PT/APTT and fibrinogen results should be used to guide FFP and 
cryoprecipitate transfusion respectively.53Evidence

Evidence 
level 4PRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists14 of 23Observational studies have indicated that a fibrinogen level of less than 2.9 g/l is associated 
with increased risk of PPH.54 One study showed that the decrease in fibrinogen levels was 
an early predictor of PPH and that the risk for severe PPH was 2.63-fold higher for each 1 g/l 
decrease in fibrinogen, with the positive predictive value being 100% if the fibrinogen level 
was 2 g/l or less.55 It is important to recognise that during pregnancy fibrinogen levels increase 
above normal ranges (varying between 3.5 and 6.5 g/l) and the above studies have indicated 
that during PPH a fibrinogen level of 2.0 g/l or less is abnormally low.
Although the above studies have indicated that fibrinogen levels reduce significantly during PPH, no 
clinical studies have looked into the timing of when to introduce fibrinogen replacement therapy 
during PPH and what the minimum fibrinogen level should be when managing PPH. Cryoprecipitate 
at a standard dose of two 5-unit pools should be administered early in major obstetric haemorrhage 
and subsequent cryoprecipitate transfusion should be guided by fibrinogen results, aiming to keep a 
fibrinogen level of more than 1.5 g/l. 
In order to avoid the low risk of ABO-associated haemolysis, FFP and cryoprecipitate should 
ideally be of the same blood group as the recipient. If this is not possible, FFP of a different 
group may be acceptable if it does not possess high-titre anti-A or anti-B activity.52
Sensitisation following the administration of RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate to RhD-
negative patients is most unlikely; hence no anti-D prophylaxis is required if a RhD-negative 
woman receives RhD-positive FFP or cryoprecipitate.52
7.2.3 When should platelets be used? 
Aim to maintain the platelet count above 50 x 109/l in the acutely bleeding patient.
A platelet transfusion trigger of 75 x 109/l is recommended to provide a margin of safety.
The platelets should ideally be group compatible. RhD-negative women should also receive RhD-
negative platelets.
The platelet count should not be allowed to fall below 50 x 109/l in the acutely bleeding 
patient as this represents the critical level for haemostasis. Such a low platelet count may be 
anticipated when approximately two blood volumes have been replaced by fluid or blood 
components.56 A platelet transfusion trigger of 75 x 109/l is recommended in a patient with 
ongoing bleeding, so as to provide a margin of safety.57
Platelets may not be on-site in many units; therefore their need should be anticipated and good 
communication with the transfusion laboratory maintained.
Platelet concentrates should ideally be of the same ABO group as the recipient. ABO-nonidentical 
platelet transfusions have been associated with poorer platelet count increments in some studies, 
but this is not usually clinically significant in terms of the haemostatic effectiveness of the 
platelet transfusion.58 Administration of ABO-nonidentical platelets is an acceptable transfusion 
practice, in particular, when platelet concentrates are in short supply or when human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA)-matched platelets are required and the best match is not ABO compatible.58
In order to avoid the development of anti-D antibodies, RhD-negative platelet concentrates 
should be given where possible to RhD-negative women of childbearing potential.58
If RhD-positive platelets are transfused to a RhD-negative woman of childbearing potential, anti-D 
immunoglobulin should be administered. A dose of 250 iu anti-D immunoglobulin is sufficient to Evidence

subcutaneously to minimise bruising and haematomas in thrombocytopenic women.58
Platelets may be given via an unused blood giving set, although a platelet giving set reduces 
wastage because it has less dead space. Transfusion of platelets through a giving set previously 
used for red cells is not recommended.59
7.2.4 Is there a role for near patient testing of coagulation?
Centres that are using thromboelastography (TEG®, Haemonetics, Braintree, Massachusetts, USA) 
or rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, Tem, Munich, Germany) for guiding blood transfusion 
during major obstetric haemorrhage must ensure that their transfusion algorithm protocol has 
been validated and that quality assurance measures are followed.
TEG® and ROTEM® are viscoelastic whole-blood assays that provide information on the 
coagulation process through the graphic display of clot initiation, propagation and lysis. 
Experiences in cardiac and liver surgery have suggested that TEG® or ROTEM® can be used 
to guide transfusion of blood components, although currently there is no validated transfusion 
algorithm for TEG®/ROTEM®. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (now known as Healthcare 
Improvement Scotland) has reviewed the evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of 
TEG®/ROTEM® in liver and cardiac surgery; the report concluded that this intervention is cost-
effective (assuming a usage of 200 tests annually) since it reduces inappropriate transfusions, 
thus improving transfusion management and patients’ clinical outcome.60
There are no randomised controlled trials on the use of TEG® or ROTEM® in major obstetric 
haemorrhage. At the current time, unless a centre has special expertise in the use of TEG®/ROTEM®, 
conventional testing should be performed regularly during major obstetric haemorrhage to guide 
transfusion of blood components. 
If hospitals are using TEG® or ROTEM® for guiding blood transfusion during major obstetric 
haemorrhage, it is important that the transfusion algorithm protocol has been validated and 
that quality assurance measures are followed.61
8. Pharmacological strategies for management of major obstetric haemorrhage
8.1 Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy?
The use of rFVIIa may be considered as a treatment for life-threatening PPH, but should not delay or 
be considered a substitute for a live-saving procedure such as embolisation or surgery, or transfer 
to a referral centre.
Factor VIIa has a pivotal role in initiating the process of blood coagulation. Recombinant 
factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is licensed for treatment of inherited bleeding disorders. Outside of these 
settings, a review of 35 randomised controlled trials that used rFVIIa on an off-licence basis 
demonstrated that rFVIIa significantly increased the risk of arterial thrombosis.62 
There have been no randomised controlled trials to assess the efficacy of rFVIIa in PPH. A 
number of case series and national registries have indicated that administration of rFVIIa during 
PPH might reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements. However, none of these reports were 
powered to assess the safety of rFVIIa. Moreover, these studies vary significantly with respect to 
the timing and dosing of rFVIIa administration.63–65 The incidence of thrombotic complications 
in a review of 272 women with PPH who had received rFVIIa was reported to be 2.5%.66D

Evidence 
level 3RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47 © Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists16 of 23There is no evidence to support the prophylactic use of rFVIIa to reduce blood loss for caesarean sections. 
In order to ensure the maximum effect of rFVIIa on clot formation, attempts should be made 
to correct thrombocytopenia, acidosis and hypofibrinogenaemia.67
In the event of intractable obstetric haemorrhage, the administration of rFVIIa may be an option to be 
discussed with the haematologists. It is important that each unit or hospital prepares local guidance on 
indications for rFVIIa in managing intractable obstetric haemorrhage. A protocol should be available for 
how to procure it urgently.
8.2 Is there a role for fibrinogen concentrate therapy?
Fibrinogen concentrate is not licensed in the UK for the management of acquired bleeding disorders. 
Thus, its use in PPH should be considered only in the context of clinical trials.
The main advantages of fibrinogen concentrate compared with cryoprecipitate are faster 
reconstitution, ease of use and not requiring thawing or ABO compatibility. No randomised 
controlled trials or prospective clinical studies have assessed the efficacy of fibrinogen concentrate 
in obstetric haemorrhage. One retrospective study compared the clinical outcomes of 20 and 14 
women with PPH who had received fibrinogen concentrate and cryoprecipitate respectively.68 
There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to estimated blood 
loss, RBC transfusion, FFP transfusion and high dependency unit or intensive therapy unit stay.
8.3 Is there a role for antifibrinolytics?
For those centres not participating in clinical trials, consideration should be given to using 
tranexamic acid during major obstetric haemorrhage.
The main antifibrinolytic agent used in the UK is tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic 
derivative of the amino acid lysine that reversibly binds to the lysine-binding sites of the 
plasminogen molecule. In doing so, it prevents activation of plasminogen to plasmin, leading to 
inhibition of fibrinolysis. The CRASH-2 study showed that tranexamic acid reduces mortality in 
bleeding trauma patients without an increase in the rate of venous thromboembolism.69
In obstetric settings, several small randomised trials have compared the use of tranexamic acid 
with placebo70–72 or no treatment.73–76 Apart from one study,75 all others were performed in women 
undergoing caesarean section. The overall conclusion was that tranexamic acid significantly 
reduces blood loss.77 However, none of these trials were statistically powered to assess mortality 
rates and the safety of tranexamic acid. Further, they were heterogenous in their definition of 
PPH, the dosing of tranexamic acid and the timing when blood loss was measured.
9. How should intrapartum anaemia be managed?
In addition to major haemorrhage guidelines, obstetric units should have guidelines on criteria for 
red cell transfusion in anaemic women who are not actively bleeding. If the Hb is less than 70 g/l in 
labour or in the immediate postpartum period, the decision to transfuse should be made according 
to the individual’s medical history and symptoms.
Concerns about the safety and availability of donor blood have promoted greater scrutiny 
of blood transfusion practice with a focus on restrictive transfusion triggers and avoidance 
strategies where available. Outside the context of major haemorrhage, there is little evidence 
of the benefit of blood transfusion in fit, healthy, asymptomatic patients. The decision to 
transfuse must be based on careful clinical assessment in conjunction with the Hb level. DEvidence

imminent cardiac compromise or significant symptoms requiring urgent correction.4
10. How should women with postpartum anaemia be managed in the postnatal period? 
If the Hb is less than 70 g/l in the postnatal period, where there is no ongoing or threat of bleeding, 
the decision to transfuse should be made on an informed individual basis.
Audits indicate that a high proportion of blood transfusions administered in the postpartum 
period may be inappropriate, with underutilisation of iron supplements.78,79 Prompt recognition 
of iron deficiency in the antenatal period followed by iron therapy may reduce the subsequent 
need for blood transfusion.4 If, after careful consideration, elective transfusion is required, 
women should be fully counselled about the potential risks. Written information should be 
provided and valid informed consent should be obtained before the transfusion is administered. 
11. How should women who decline blood products be managed? 
Hb should be optimised prior to delivery to prevent avoidable anaemia.
Consent/refusal of blood and components or other transfusion-sparing techniques should be 
discussed and documented during the antenatal period.
Use of pharmacological, mechanical and surgical procedures to avert the use of banked blood and 
blood components should be considered early.
IOCS has a role in the management of patients who refuse allogeneic blood transfusion.
There are additional challenges in the management of pregnancy in mothers refusing blood 
transfusion, including for religious reasons, i.e. Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW), with a higher risk 
of morbidity and mortality.80–82 Accordingly, all women declining blood transfusion require 
careful multidisciplinary planning with senior clinician input during pregnancy to minimise 
anaemia and to manage blood loss. Early use of iron replacement is indicated with, if needed, 
use of intravenous iron.83,84
Antenatal planning is essential and haematinic deficiencies should be corrected if the Hb is less than 
105 g/l for all women before delivery. 
The treating clinician will need to establish which blood components or blood-sparing techniques (e.g. 
clotting factor products) are acceptable. An example of a suggested care plan for managing women refusing 
blood transfusion is available at: http://www.transfusionguidelines.org.uk/transfusion-handbook/12-
management-of-patients-who-do-not-accept-transfusion/12-2-jehovah-s-witnesses-and-blood-transfusion. 
The woman should have an opportunity to discuss consent alone (witnessed) with an experienced 
clinician. Treating clinicians should ensure that the woman is fully informed of the risks of refusing 
transfusion and of maternal mortality data for JW compared with non-JW women.80 This needs to be 
handled sensitively to avoid any possibility of coercion. 
An advance directive should be completed and carried in the hand-held notes, although a woman should 
always be given the opportunity to change her mind about the use of blood products.
The woman may wish to wear a ‘no blood’ wristband to make it clear to all members of the treating team 
that blood transfusion is not to be used.D

(formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), the Australian National Blood Authority 
and the National Blood Transfusion Committee, which covers England and North Wales (see 
section 14). PBM involves an all-encompassing approach to avoid unnecessary transfusion by 
optimising preoperative/predelivery Hb, avoiding overtransfusion, using cell salvage where 
appropriate, accepting evidence-based lower transfusion triggers and using intravenous or oral 
iron supplements in women who are not actively bleeding and are cardiovascularly stable.85
The Code of Practice for the Surgical Management of Jehovah’s Witnesses by the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England and Management of Anaesthesia for Jehovah’s Witnesses by the Association of 
Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland provide useful information.86,87
Evidence from orthopaedic and cardiac surgery supports the premise that use of autologous 
blood from IOCS decreases the requirement for allogeneic transfusion. In one study with 68 
patients included in the review by NICE, the mean postoperative Hb level was significantly 
greater in the group that had blood cell salvage compared with the control group (104 [SD 
15] versus 81 [SD 14] g/l). Also, 2.9% (1/34) of patients who received cell salvage required 
an allogeneic blood transfusion compared with 23.5% (8/34) of the control group.88 Current 
evidence supports the use of IOCS in obstetrics, which has been endorsed by several bodies 
and is likely to become increasingly commonplace.37 
12. Recommendations for future research
l Define the coagulation abnormalities during major obstetric haemorrhage and investigate the 
role of point of care testing (i.e. TEG® or ROTEM®) in the diagnosis and management of 
obstetric haemorrhage.
l Determine the optimal dose and timing of cryoprecipitate and FFP transfusion during major 
obstetric haemorrhage.
l Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the role of fibrinogen concentrate during 
major haemorrhage. The WOMAN study (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT00872469), a large, international, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, will be addressing the role of tranexamic acid in 
women with a clinical diagnosis of PPH and data collection is due to finish in 2016.

Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in 
making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions’. Each guideline is systematically 
developed using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical 
Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website 
at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate 
an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual 
patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. 
It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine 
practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated. 
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations 
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
At least one meta-analysis, systematic review or 
randomised controlled trial rated as 1++, and 
directly applicable to the target population; or 
A systematic review of randomised controlled 
trials or a body of evidence consisting 
principally of studies rated as 1+, directly 
applicable to the target population and 
demonstrating overall consistency of results
A body of evidence including studies rated 
as 2++ directly applicable to the target 
population, and demonstrating overall 
consistency of results; or 
Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 
1++ or 1+

DISCLAIMER 
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical 
practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for 
consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement 
regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light 
of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to 
be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols 
or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
