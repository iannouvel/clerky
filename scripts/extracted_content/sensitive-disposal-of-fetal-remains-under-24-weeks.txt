Guidance 
 
1.0 Aim: 
 
To provide evidence based guidance for staff on the sensitive disposal of fetal 
remains. 
 
In the context of this guidance, fetal remains refers to all fetal tissue obtained 
following surgical pro cedures for miscarriage and termination, spontaneous 
miscarriage, medical treatment of miscarriage or termination and any fetus born dead 
before 24 weeks gestation. Guidance including documents are available on Staffnet 
under ‘Pregnancy Loss’ 
 
This documen t gives guidance for the two agreed pathways as described below. 
i. The loss of a non -recognisable fetus . This is a loss through Surgical 
Management of Miscarriage (SMoM), Ectopic pregnancy, surgical termination 
of pregnancy and spontaneous miscarr iage with n o recognisable fetus (refer 
to section 6) 
ii. The loss of a recognisable fetus (of any gestation). This is a loss through 
medical termination of pregnancy for either fetal abnormality or maternal 
medical indications, spontaneous miscarriage (with a recognisabl e fetus) and 
intra-uterine deaths under 24 weeks (refer to section 7) 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This guidance applies to: 
o Midwives and health care assistants 
o Obstetricians & Gynaecologists 
o Surgical Ward Nursing & Health Care Assistant staff 
o A & E staff 
o Gynae Day Unit & Earl y Pregnancy Unit staff 
o Mortuary staff 
o Theatre staff 
o Hospital chaplains 
o Histopathology staff 
 
3.0 Responsibilities 
 
3.1 It is the responsibility of above staff members to: 
 To access, read, understand and follow this guidance 
 
3.2 It is the responsibili ty of the division to: 
o To ensure the guideline is reviewed as required in line with Trust and 
National recommendations 
o To ensure the guideline is accessible to all relevant staff 
 
4.0 Introduction 
 
Discussion about sensitive disposal of fetal material bega n in 1989 with the 
Polkinghorn report. This acknowledged the special status of the fetus as having the 
potential to develop into a human being , entitling a fetus to respect, with a status 
broadly comparable to that of a living person. 

Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Rem ains. Version 1 Page 5 of 24 27th February 2015 This was followed by Department of Health (1991) guidelines on the disposal of all 
fetuses and fetal material. These guidelines stated that disposal should be sensitive 
and respectful, irrespective of how the pregnancy was lost. The guidance also makes 
it clear that staff sho uld consider any personal wishes expressed by the family. 
 
In 1995, the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (SANDS) emphasises the 
importance of information for parents, about the choices they can make and about 
arrangements that will be made if they cho ose not to be involved. 
 
Parents should be given the same choice on the disposal of fetal remains as for a 
stillborn child. Whilst sometimes parents don’t always recognise their loss at the time, 
we need to be aware that they may return months or even year s later to enquire 
about disposal arrangements. Therefore we need to ensure that sensitive and 
dignified disposal is carried out whether or not the parents wish to be involved. 
 
Fetus Papyraceous - in cases of multiple pregnancy where one baby dies under 2 4 
weeks; parents should be informed of the available options prior to the birth of the 
surviving baby (guidance below) . 
 
Public awareness of sensitive disposal is increasing which has led to more women 
wishing to know about or be involved in what happens to the remains of their 
pregnancy 
 
The Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management (ICCM) policy document 
states that the hospital should obtain consent from the parent, preferably in writing, 
authorising the means of disposal following pregnancy loss . 
 
5.0 Options Available 
 
5.1 Cremation arranged by hospital 
 
In cases where the fetus is non –recognisable, and the family choose not to be 
involved, this will be a communal cremation. Parents should be made aware that 
there will be a number pregnancy losses cremated in one service, therefore 
individual ashes will not be available. Any ashes will be scattered in the children's 
garden at the crematorium. However if this option is not acceptable there are other 
options are available. 
 
If the family choose to a ttend, this would be an individual cremation. Parents should 
be given contact details of the Chaplaincy Office for help with arrangements . 
 
The Chaplaincy Office will liaise with the parents and the contracted funeral directors 
with regards to the arrange ments. 
 
There is no cost implication for parents as WSHFT will assume this responsibility. 
 
5.2 Private burial or cremation 
 
The parents should be informed they can make arrangements themselves with 
funeral directors other than the directors contracted by WSHFT. 
 
There are usually no charges; however parents may incur cost s if they opt for a 
burial , as there is a charge for burial plots . 

Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Rem ains. Version 1 Page 6 of 24 27th February 2015 5.3 Burial outside a cemetery / Home burial 
 
Sands (1995) state that there is no legal prohibition to parents taking fe tal remains 
home to bury themselves, provided the following requirements are met: 
 Must not cause danger to others 
 Must not interfere with any rights other people may have on the land 
 There must be no dangers to water supplies or watercourses 
 No chance of b odily fluids leaking in/on to adjoining land 
 Must be buried at a depth of at least 18 inches (45 cm) 
 Obtain permission from landowner 
 If burying in a garden consider what might happen with a house move 
or land used for different purposes in the future 
 
For women choosing to take the remains home with them, please ensure they are 
given the ‘Letter to take Baby Home ’ (Appendix 1). This is to cover them in the event 
of being stopped by the police etc. 
 
6.0 Loss of a N on – Recognisable Fetus 
 
6.1 Information giving 
 
Cremation is the Trusts chosen method of sensitive disposal for an unrecognisable 
fetus. However the options in section 5 should be explained to the parents prior to 
written cons ent being taken . The pa tient information leaflet ‘Sensitive Dispo sal o f 
Your Pregnancy explained ’ (Appendix 2 ) should be given at the earliest opportunity. 
 
The hospital chaplaincy department are available to ensure that any religious needs 
can be met. Parents should be given the option of meeting the hospital chaplain if 
they wish , or they can involve their own religious leaders if they prefer. 
 
Where a comm unal hospital cremation is chosen, the service will include awareness 
of differing spiritual and cultural aspects, so that it is acceptable to all faith 
communities. 
 
In the case of a miscarriage at home, wo men can be advised to bring any tissue 
passed to the hospital (to EPAC , GDU or L abour Ward) to facilitate sensitive 
disposal. 
 
6.2 Consent for sensitive disposal 
 
For all women experiencing the loss of an non-recognisab le fetus including: surgical 
management of miscarriage , ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous miscarriage and 
surgical termination of a pregnancy , complete Form C (Appendix 3). This consent 
form can be completed by a doctor, midwife or nurse . If the patient is go ing to 
theatre, consent must be obtained prior to leaving the ward and accompany the 
patients notes. 
 
Cremation is the Trusts chosen method of sensitive disposal. However if this option 
is not acceptable, complete section 2 on Form C , provide the leaflet: ‘’Sensitive 
disposal of you r Pregnancy E xplained ’’ (Appendix 2) and inform the woman that she 
will need to contact the Chaplaincy to make alternative arrangements. 
 
Note : All cases must have Section 3 signed and either 1 or 2 depending on patient 
choice re garding disposal. 
 
Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Rem ains. Version 1 Page 7 of 24 27th February 2015 The Chaplaincy will then complete Form B with the woman to arrange burial or 
making private arrangements. (Appendix 4) 
 
Consent Form C must accompany the remains in a specimen bag attached to the 
outside of the box (see 6.3). A copy is pl aced within the hospital notes. This will 
ensure that the crematoria / burial grounds are informed that the pregnancy ended 
‘naturally’ or ‘legally’. This is a legal requirement. 
 
In the event where Consent Form C (Appendix 3) does not accompany the specim en 
the laboratory / mortuary must contact the appropriate clinical area immediately to 
request it. Failure for the department will result in the completion of Form D 
(Appendix 11 ). Form D will be completed to provide authorisation for cremation by 
the Desi gnated Individual for the Human Tissue Authority . 
 
6.3 Process to follow when sending fetal remains to the mortuary. 
 
 Following any surgical procedure , fetal remains are collected in an individual 
sealed conta iner and then placed in a transport box. This is sent to 
Histopathology at Worthing Hospital (WH) and the Mortuary at St Richards 
Hospital (SRH). 
 In theatre, a closed suction system with individual tissue traps is used to 
ensure that the products are handled sensitively. These tissue traps must 
meet Federation of British Cremation Authorities (FBCA) regulations on 
materials that can be safely cremated. 
 Following a spontaneous loss fetal remains are placed in a dry specimen pot 
and then placed in a transport box. This is sent to Histopathology at Wor thing 
Hospital (WH) and the Mortuary at St Richards Hospital (SRH). 
 Each container will have a maternal addressograph label clearly visible and 
be accompanied by Form C. Th is ensures the histopathology/mortuary staff 
will communicate with the Chaplaincy r e sensitive disposal. 
 When attaching the addressograph label to the outer box , use a third of the 
sticky part of the label with the name on and fold the remaining label back on 
itself. This allows easy removal of the label before the box goes for cremation 
to maintain confidentiality. 
 If histology is requested (in cases of possible molar pregnancy or to confirm 
an ectopic pregnancy) the tissue is sent to the Histopathology department (in 
formalin) with a request form and Form C before be ing sent to the Mort uary at 
SRH. When cytogenetic testing is required specimens must be kept dry (see 
8.0). 
 WH - fetal remains are sent to histopathology, then on to the Mortuary at SRH 
with Form C. 
 SRH - fetal remains are sent directly to the Mortuary at SRH with Form C. 
 SRH Mortuary creates an anonymised unique number for any future audit trail 
(Appendix 5). This will be stored on the Mortuary database for 50 years. 
 The pregnancy tissue will be transported from the Mortuary at SRH by the 
contracted Funeral Directors to the C rematorium at Worthing with the 
‘Application for the Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Remains’ (Appendix 6). 

Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Rem ains. Version 1 Page 8 of 24 27th February 2015 7.0 Loss of a recognisable fetus 
 
7.1 Information Giving 
 
The Trust leaflet ‘ Funeral Arrangements Following the Loss of your Baby ’ explains 
funeral options available and contains useful sources of support (Appendix 7). This 
must be given at the earliest opportunity. 
 
Provide the appropriate information from the Miscarriage Association: 
 ‘Your miscarriage’ provided at any gestation. 
 ‘Late miscarriag e’ from 13 – 24 weeks. 
If the pregnancy loss occurs on labour ward, follow the Bereavement Care Checklist 
for under 24 weeks. 
 
For all other areas , the hospital chaplaincy should be involved to discuss funeral 
arrangements during working hours. Support an d advice can be obtained by liaising 
with the Labour Ward Coordinator to commence the Bereavement Care Checklist for 
under 24 weeks . 
 
7.2 Consent for funeral arrangements. 
 
To gain consent with regard to funeral arrangements, c omplete the ‘Funeral 
Arrange ments ’ Form (A ppendix 8 ). 2 copies of this form must go with the baby to the 
mortuary, 2 copies sent to the chaplaincy and 1 copy placed in hospital notes. 
 
The Certificate of non-viable Fetus (A ppendix 9 ) also needs completing . This should 
go with the bab y to the mortuary for hospital funerals, or given to the parents if they 
are using their own funeral director. 
 
Both these forms can be completed by the midwife / nurse 
 
7.3 Process to follow when sending baby to the mortuary 
 
 When the baby is ready to be transferred to the mortuary, the body is placed 
on the plastic side of a waterproof pad (inco), wrapped and placed in a zipped 
Slik-Pak or waterproof EVO box (avai lable from labour ward). This can then 
be placed in an appropriately sized container to t ransfer to the mortuary. 
 Appendix 8 must accompany all babies and Appendix 9 if hospital funeral 
(see 7.2) 
 On arrival to the mortuary, the baby is booked onto an electronic register 
using the maternal surname and given a unique mortuary serial number as 
descr ibed in the Mortuary Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). 
 
7.4 Post Mortem (PM) Consent 
 
7.4.1 For pregnancy losses on labour ward, the Obstetric Consultant (or 
appropriately trained clinician) must explain the PM options and sign the SANDS PM 
consent form with the parent(s). The PM request form and Consultant request for PM 
letter must be signed by the Consultant (see 7.4.3). 
 
7.4.2 For areas other than labour ward, if PM is required, c ontact the Labour W ard 
Co-ordinator as PM consent must be completed by t he obstetric Consultant (or 
appropriately trained clinician) and the Perinatal PM (PPM) request form and 
authorising letter must be completed by a Consultant Obstetrician . 
 
Sensitive Disposal of Fetal Rem ains. Version 1 Page 9 of 24 27th February 2015 7.4.3 Key points for correct completion for PM forms: 
 SANDS PM Consent form must be signed by Consultant (or Trained 
Registrar) and Parent(s) 
 Both the PPM and Consultant request for PM letter must be completed by the 
Consultant Obstetrician 
 Midwife / Nurse to complete the release of body form (refer to links above) 
 Original forms must be sent with the baby and placenta to the mortuary and 
copies of each placed in the medical records. 
8.0 Recurrent Miscarriage Fetal Remains sent for cytogenetic 
investigations (karyotyping) 
 
8.1 All tissue for cytogenetic investigations is sent to G uy’s and St Thomas’ NHS 
Foundation Trust accompanied by the Genetics Specimen Form (found at www. 
viapath.co.uk/departments -and-laboratories/genetics) 
 Following a surgical procedure send remains in dry sealed co ntainer from 
theatre. 
 Following spontaneous m iscarriage of a non -recognisable fetu s send remains 
in a dry sealed container. 
 The container must be firmly sealed and placed in a specimen bag with the 
accompanying paper work in a separate specimen bag, both bags are then 
placed a box for transfer. 
 The criteria and referral pathway for cytogenetic testing at Guys & St Thomas’ 
can be found in Appendix 12. This includes the details of the Trusts 
contracted courier service. 
 
8.2 With regard to sensitive disposal Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust ’s 
policy following completion of investigation comprises of a recorded witnessed 
sensitive incineration. If parents agree complete Form C and send with remains. 
 
If parents request return of the remains, this must be clearly indicated on the 
Genetics Specimen Form and Form C with Section 2 completed (Appendix 3) . This 
will need to accompany this tissue to Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust . 
The Genetics department will then contact the referring department to make them 
aware that the tissue is ready for collection. The referring department will then need 
to arrange for collection of the tissue b y courier for sensitive disposal to be arranged 
following WSHFT policy. 
 
9.0 Access to forms and information leaflets 
 
Patient information leaflets should be ord ered from the print centre – do not print 
from the guideline. If no supply available Appendices 1, 3 & 9 can be printed fro m 
staffnet. Form C is a 2 page carbonated form which is available in your clinical area. 
Further supplies are available from EPAC at SRH & WH . 
 
10.0 Audit 
 
Monitoring of this guidance will be undertaken annually by auditing 10 medical 
records from each site . Patients will be identified using the mortuary register. 
Monitoring wi ll encompass ensuring there is evidence of the patient infor mation being 
given and the correct completion of Form C . The Early Pregnancy Clinical Nurse 
Leads at SRH & WH will be responsible for ensuring this is performed and presented 
annually at the W&C Clinical Governance Review Q4.
