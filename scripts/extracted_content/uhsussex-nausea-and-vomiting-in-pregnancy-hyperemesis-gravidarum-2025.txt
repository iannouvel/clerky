1. INTRODUCTION 
This guideline is based on The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) 
guidance, The Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum , 
where additional information can be found if necessary. 
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is defined as nausea and/or vomiting during pregnancy, 
when onset is prior to 16 weeks gestation and there are no other causes. NVP affects up to 90% of 
people during pregnancy and is one of the most common reasons for a hospital admission during 
pregnancy. 
NVP is often referred to as morning sickness, which is inaccurate given symptoms do not only occur 
in the morning. It also trivialises the condition and should therefore be avoided. 
Most pregnant people experiencing NVP can be successfully managed in General Practice. It is 
common for people with NVP to present to their GP because symptoms often occur prior to their 
pregnancy being booked by a midwife. 
In many cases, people would have tried non -medical options to manage symptoms of NVP prior to 
presenting to a healthcare setting, therefore they may be experiencing severe symptoms at the point 
of first being seen by a GP. 
Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of NVP, which affects up to 3.6% of pregnant 
people, significantly interfering with quality of life and the ability to eat and drink normally. HG can 
often be managed by GPs, but in some cases referral for speci alist support, e.g., to Secondary Care 
or via the Maternal Medicine Centre, is necessary. The PUQE score [A ppendix 2.] is used to 
differentiate NVP from HG. 
NVP and HG are associated with serious health consequences for both mother and baby, especially 
if the mother is unable to take regular medication for a chronic health condition as a result. Prompt 
effective management of NVP and HG improves quality of life and pregn ancy outcomes.

2. MEDICATION TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS OF NVP AND HG 
• All the antiemetic medications included in this guideline can be taken in all trimesters of 
pregnancy. Information regarding risk of medication use in pregnancy can be found in section 
5. 
• When managing pregnant people who experienced NVP or HG in a previous pregnancy, offer 
the medication that previously optimally managed their symptoms. 
• When someone who is pregnant for the first time presents with NVP or HG, start treatment 
with either pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate (Xonvea ), which is licensed for use 
in pregnancy, or cyclizine. 
• Many people respond to pyridoxine hydrochloride/doxylamine succinate (Xonvea) when 
cyclizine has been ineffective. 
• Combinations of antiemetics should be used in pregnant people who do not respond to a 
single agent, with some people requiring more than two medications to effectively manage 
their symptoms. 
• Encourage use of antenatal vitamins at night to reduce possible influence on symptoms. 
• Consider offering thiamine 100mg three times a day to patients with ≥13 PUQE score. 

Pregnancy -Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) : a validated scoring system that may be used to 
assess the severity of symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. 
PUQE -24 scoring system 
In the last 24 hours, for how long have you felt nauseated or sick to your stomach? 
Not at all (1) 1 hour or less (2) 2–3 hours (3) 4–6 hours (4) >6 hours (5) 
In the last 24 hours have you vomited? 
Did not throw up 
(1) 1-2 times (2) 3–4 times (3) 5-6 times (4) 7 or more times (5) 
In the last 24 hours how many times have you had retching or dry heaves without bringing anything 
up? 
No time s (1) 1–2 times (2) 3–4 times (3) 5–6 times (4) 7 or more times (5) 
 
Total score indicating severity of symptoms is the sum of replies to each of the three questions: 
mild <= 6; moderate 7 –12; severe 13 –15. A score of 13 or greater has been used as a criterion for 
admission to hospital in women with severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

3. PRACTICE POINTS FOR GENERAL PRACTITIONERS 
See Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 
It is unusual for NVP or HG to start after 16 weeks of pregnancy, therefore alternative causes of 
symptoms should be considered, e.g. UTI, cholecystitis, infective gastroenteritis. 
Assessment and monitoring 
• Use the PUQE score to assess NVP or HG severity [A ppendix 3]. Ketonuria is not an indicator 
of dehydration and should not be used to assess the severity of NVP or HG. 
• Assess and regularly (e.g., weekly) monitor renal function, weight, and hydration. It is likely 
that vitamin deficiencies will occur if food intake is severely limited for a protracted period; 
assess FBC, iron, B12, and folate. 
• Risk assess in line with national guidance for venous thromboembolism (VTE), given 
dehydration increases VTE risk , and initiate prophylactic low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH ) if necessar y (ambulatory care centre may need to be contacted ; see section 7). 
- RCOG: Reducing the Risk of Thrombosis and Embolism during Pregnancy and the 
Puerperium . 
• Undertake an assessment of mental health, given the negative effect s of nausea and vomiting 
on wellbeing and the experience of pregnancy is often underestimated . Some people with 
poorly controlled NVP or HG become so depressed, with psychosis experienced in extreme 
cases, that a termination of pregnancy is sought to escape their overwhelming symptoms. 
o Specialist perinatal mental health services information 
o 24/7 mental health crisis line information 
o NICE guidance: Antenatal and postnatal mental health checklist 
• Regularly follow -up to reassess symptoms and modify treatment if necessary. Consider 
admission for rehydration if symptoms worsen or not improve with oral antiemetics / red flags 
are present; contact on -call obstetrics and gynaecology team (see section 7). 
 
Counselling 
• Validate the person’s experience of symptoms and do not minimise or undermine the 
perceived severity (Appendix 2). 
• Do not falsely reassure someone with moderate to severe NVP or HG that their symptoms 
will dissipate by the second trimester of pregnancy; a significant number of people experience 
symptoms throughout the pregnancy. 
• Advise that they may benefit from rest and time off work. Consider writing a sick note . 
• Provide the RCOG pregnancy sickness patient information leaflet . 
• Share details of Pregnancy Sickness Support , an organisation providing support to people 
experiencing NVP and HG that accepts self -referrals.

Prescribing 
• Do not depend solely on non -drug management. 
• The risk of inadequate nutrition and inability to take regular medications outweigh the small 
risks presented by antiemetic medications, all of which are considered safe in pregnancy. 
• People taking critical medications, e.g., antiepileptics, biologic agents, and 
immunosuppressants, should be referred to the maternal medicine hub for advice / review 
and/or site maternal medicine clinics at the point of presentation, given the impact of missing 
medications can be life threatening. 
• People with severe symptoms will require prescribing of multiple antiemetics concurrently. 
• Optimise management of associated gastro -oesophageal reflux disease, oesophagitis, or 
gastritis symptoms. 
• Consider avoiding medications that may contribute to NVP or HG symptoms, e.g., iron -
containing preparations, utilising clinical judgement. 
• Refer for ambulatory care (See section 7) in the instance of clinical dehydration, as IV fluids 
IV thiamine and IV antiemetics should be administered. 
• Pregnant people who are taking three antiemetic medications or have persistent or recurrent 
symptoms despite adequate ambulatory day care treatment should be cared for as inpatients 
because of associated complications such as electrolyte imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, 
and VTE (see section 7). 
• It may be possible to stop antiemetic medication at around 12 –16 weeks of pregnancy, when 
symptoms have usually improved. However, some people continue to experience NVP or HG 
beyond this gestation. 
• Gradually tapering the combination of antiemetics, or dose if only one agent is being used, 
may reduce the risk of symptoms recurring. 
• NVP or HG are likely to recur in subsequent pregnancies; pre -emptive use of medication 
before vomiting starts can reduce the severity of disease in this instance. 
• A non -medical prescriber, e.g., potentially a practice pharmacist or nurse, who are competent 
in the management of NVP and HG can follow people up. 
4. PRACTICE POINTS FOR SECONDARY CARE (INPATIENT MANAGEMENT) 
• Review risks and consider prescribing LMWH as per local guideline. 
• Refer to the flowchart for an overview of inpatient management. 
o Appendix 3. Summary for ambulatory care 
o Appendix 4. Summary for emergency department staff 
o Appendix 5. Summary for inpatient care 
• Refer to section 2 for antiemetic medication guidance , and section 5 for information regarding 
risk of medication in pregnancy.

 SHCP APC 03/25 Review 03/27 Expires 03/28 • Levels of ketones should not be used to inform clinical decision 
making about treatments or hydration status. 
• Dextrose -containing solutions can precipitate Wernicke ’s encephalopathy in thiamine -
deficient states ; hence they should be avoided . High doses of thiamine should be given to 
prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy, e.g. thiamine 250mg IV once daily for 3 days or 
Pabrinex given in line with local guidance. Dextrose containing fluids are appropriate for 
nausea and vomiting in the third trimester to prevent and treat starvation ketosis . 
• Ensure suitable parental potassium supplementation occurs [see Appendix 6 ]. 
• Refer to dieticians for input in severe cases or in the context of significant weight loss (5% of 
pre-pregnancy body weight) . The nutrition team maybe required for advice regarding the 
need for nasogastric or nasojejunal administration of feeds / parental nutrition in extreme 
cases of HG . Please discuss plan with input from maternal medicine team. 
• Corticosteroids should be reserved for cases where standard therapies have failed; when 
initiated they should be prescribed in addition to previously started effective antiemetics . 
Decision to be made by senior obstetrician or maternal medicine team. 
o Consider hydrocortisone 100 mg twice daily IV, converted to prednisolone 40 –50 mg 
orally daily once clinical improvement occurs, with the dose gradually tapered by 5 -10 
mg per week until the lowest maintenance dose that controls the symptoms is reached. 
o Pregnant person taking corticosteroids should have their blood pressure regularly 
monitored and be screened for gestational diabetes mellitus with glucose tolerance 
test (refer to NICE guidance: Diabetes in pregnancy ). 
o If no improvement occurs with corticosteroids within one week of commencing 
treatment then discuss with maternal medicine team . 
• Discharge should only occur once 
o appropriate antiemetic therapy has been tolerated , 
o adequate oral nutrition and hydration has been tolerated , 
o management of concurrent conditions is complete . 
• At the time of discharge, it is essential that advice is given to continue with antiemetics where 
appropriate and that how to access further care if described . 
• People with severe NVP or HG who have continued symptoms into the late second or third 
trimester should be offered serial scans to monitor fetal growth. 
• Practitioners should carry out a full assessment of both physical and mental health status 
during the pregnancy and refer for psychological support if necessary. 
• Information about support groups should be provided to a nyone admitted with NVP or HG. 
• People with previous HG should be advised that there is a risk of recurrence in future 
pregnancies. Early use of lifestyle/dietary modifications and antiemetics that were useful in 
the index pregnancy is advisable to reduce the risk of NVP and HG in any other pregnanc ies.

5. MEDICATION RISK IN PREGNANCY 
Refer to the UK Teratology Information Service , for evidence -based safety information about 
medication, vaccine, chemical and radiological exposures in pregnancy. 
It is important to complete an individual risk assessment for pregnant people you are considering 
prescribing for, and to apply the principles of prescribing during pregnancy when considering 
available information and making treatment decisions. Check to see if a risk assessment has already 
been completed. 
When balancing risks, note that untreated or inadequately treated severe or chronic nausea and 
vomiting can have adverse effects on the mother and baby. 
Ondansetron 
Despite concerns about orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, there is 
evidence that ondansetron use is linked to only a very small increase in absolute risk (Figure 1. and 
Figure 2.). 
The use of ondansetron should not be discouraged if first line antiemetics are ineffective, and the 
pregnant person can be reassured (potentially utilising the visual risk summary ) that the increased 
risk of orofacial clefting associated with ondansetron use is very small. This very small increase in 
risk of orofacial clefting should be balanced against the risks of poorly managed NVP or HG.

6. CONSIDERATION OF TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY 
All treatment options, including antiemetics, corticosteroids, enteral tube and parenteral feeding, 
and correction of electrolyte or metabolic disturbances should be considered before deciding that 
the only option is termination of pregnancy. 
A decision to terminate a pregnancy needs to be multidisciplinary. Psychiatric opinion should be 
sought if there are concerns regarding mental health. In the instance NVP or HG treatment failure 
is the reason for termination of pregnancy, this should be cl early documented. 
Any pregnant person consideration termination of pregnancy because of NVP or HG should be 
offered counselling before and after a decision of pregnancy termination is made.
