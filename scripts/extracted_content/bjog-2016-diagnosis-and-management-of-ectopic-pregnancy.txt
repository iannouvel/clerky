Diagnosis and Management of Ectopic Pregnancy
This guideline replaces The Management of Tubal Pregnancy , which was published in 2004.
Executive summary of recommendations
Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy
How is a tubal pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
Transvaginal ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice for tubal ectopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]B
Tubal ectopic pregnancies should be positively identi ﬁed, if possible, by visualising an adnexal
mass that moves separate to the ovary. [ New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A serum progesterone level is not useful in predicting ectopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]B
A serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin ( b-hCG) level is useful for planning the
management of an ultrasound visualised ectopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]C
How is a cervical pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cervical ectopic pregnancy:
an empty uterus, a barrel-shaped cervix, a gestational sac present below the level of theinternal cervical os, the absence of the ‘sliding sign ’and blood ﬂow around the gestational sac
using colour Doppler. [ New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis. [ New 2016 ]D

How is a caesarean scar pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
Clinicians should be aware that ultrasound is the primary diagnostic modality, using a
transvaginal approach supplemented by transabdominal imaging if required. [ New 2016 ]D
Deﬁned criteria for diagnosing caesarean scar pregnancy on transvaginal scan have been
described. [ New 2016 ]D
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as a second-line investigation if the diagnosis
is equivocal and there is local expertise in the MRI diagnosis of caesarean scar pregnancies.[New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
No biochemical investigations are needed routinely. [ New 2016 ]/check
How is an interstitial pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy:
empty uterine cavity, products of conception/gestational sac located laterally in the interstitial(intramural) part of the tube and surrounded by less than 5 mm of myometrium in all imagingplanes, and presence of the ‘interstitial line sign ’.[New 2016 ]D
Sonographic ﬁndings in two-dimension can be further con ﬁrmed using three-dimensional
ultrasound, where available, to avoid misdiagnosis with early intrauterine or angular(implantation in the lateral angles of the uterine cavity) pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Supplementation with MRI can also be helpful in the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy.
[New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some
cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management.

How is a cornual pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy:
visualisation of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body,gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus andcompletely surrounded by myometrium, and a vascular pedicle adjoining the gestational sac tothe unicornuate uterus. [ New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some
cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management.

There are no speci ﬁc agreed criteria for the ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian ectopic pregnancy.
[New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis to help with management. In some
cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management.
[New 2016 ]/check
How is an abdominal pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
Deﬁned ultrasound criteria can be used to diagnose an abdominal pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
MRI can be a useful diagnostic adjunct in advanced abdominal pregnancy and can help to plan
the surgical approach. [ New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A high index of suspicion is based upon an elevated serum b-hCG level in combination with
ultrasound ﬁndings. [ New 2016 ]D

How is heterotopic pregnancy diagnosed?
What are the ultrasound criteria?
A heterotopic pregnancy is diagnosed when the ultrasound ﬁndings demonstrate an
intrauterine pregnancy and a coexisting ectopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A serum b-hCG level is of limited value in diagnosing heterotopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Management options
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for tubal pregnancy?
A laparoscopic surgical approach is preferable to an open approach.A
In the presence of a healthy contralateral tube, salpingectomy should be performed in
preference to salpingotomy. [ New 2016 ]B
In women with a history of fertility-reducing factors (previous ectopic pregnancy, contralateral
tubal damage, previous abdominal surgery, previous pelvic in ﬂammatory disease), salpingotomy
should be considered. [ New 2016 ]C
If a salpingotomy is performed, women should be informed about the risk of persistent
trophoblast with the need for serum b-hCG level follow-up. They should also be counselled that
there is a small risk that they may need further treatment in the form of systemicmethotrexate or salpingectomy./check
Systemic methotrexate may be offered to suitable women with a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Itshould never be given at the ﬁrst visit, unless the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is absolutely
clear and a viable intrauterine pregnancy has been excluded. [ New 2016 ]B
Expectant management is an option for clinically stable women with an ultrasound diagnosis of
ectopic pregnancy and a decreasing b-hCG level initially less than 1500 iu/l.B
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for cervical pregnancy?
Medical management with methotrexate can be considered for cervical pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Surgical methods of management are associated with a high failure rate and should be
reserved for those women suffering life-threatening bleeding. [ New 2016 ]D

What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for caesarean scar pregnancy?
Women diagnosed with caesarean section scar pregnancies should be counselled that such
pregnancies are associated with severe maternal morbidity and mortality. [ New 2016 ]D
Medical and surgical interventions with or without additional haemostatic measures should be
considered in women with ﬁrst trimester caesarean scar pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend any one speci ﬁc intervention over another for
caesarean scar pregnancy, but the current literature supports a surgical rather than medicalapproach as the most effective. [ New 2016 ]D
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for interstitial pregnancy?
Nonsurgical management is an acceptable option for stable interstitial pregnancies. [ New 2016 ]D
Expectant management is only suitable for women with low or signi ﬁcantly falling b-hCG levels
in whom the addition of methotrexate may not improve the outcome. [ New 2016 ]D
A pharmacological approach using methotrexate has been shown to be effective, although,
there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend local or systemic approach. [ New 2016 ]D
Surgical management by laparoscopic cornual resection or salpingotomy is an effective option.
[New 2016 ]D
Alternative surgical techniques could include hysteroscopic resection under laparoscopic or
ultrasound guidance. [ New 2016 ]D
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence on safety and complications in future pregnancies to recommend
other nonsurgical methods. [ New 2016 ]D
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for cornual pregnancy?
Cornual pregnancies should be managed by excision of the rudimentary horn via laparoscopy or
laparotomy. [ New 2016 ]D
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for ovarian pregnancy?
Deﬁnitive surgical treatment is preferred if laparoscopy is required to make the diagnosis of
ovarian ectopic pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Systemic methotrexate can be used to treat ovarian ectopic pregnancy when the risk of surgery
is high, or postoperatively in the presence of persistent residual trophoblast or persistentlyraised b-hCG levels. [ New 2016 ]D

What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for abdominal pregnancy?
Laparoscopic removal is an option for treatment of early abdominal pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Possible alternative treatment methods would be systemic methotrexate with ultrasound-
guided fetocide. [ New 2016 ]D
Advanced abdominal pregnancy should be managed by laparotomy. [ New 2016 ]D
What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for heterotopic pregnancy?
The intrauterine pregnancy must be considered in the management plan. [ New 2016 ]B
Methotrexate should only be considered if the intrauterine pregnancy is nonviable or if the
woman does not wish to continue with the pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Local injection of potassium chloride or hyperosmolar glucose with aspiration of the sac
contents is an option for clinically stable women. [ New 2016 ]D
Surgical removal of the ectopic pregnancy is the method of choice for haemodynamically
unstable women and is also an option for haemodynamically stable women. [ New 2016 ]D
Expectant management is an option in heterotopic pregnancies where the ultrasound ﬁndings
are of a nonviable pregnancy. [ New 2016 ]D
Do rhesus D (RhD)-negative women with an ectopic pregnancy require anti-D immunoglobulin?
Offer anti-D prophylaxis as per national protocol to all RhD-negative women who have surgical
removal of an ectopic pregnancy, or where bleeding is repeated, heavy or associated withabdominal pain. [ New 2016 ]D
What are the long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy?
In the absence of a history of subfertility or tubal pathology, women should be advised that
there is no difference in the rate of fertility, the risk of future tubal ectopic pregnancy or tubalpatency rates between the different management methods. [ New 2016 ]D
Women with a previous history of subfertility should be advised that treatment of their tubal
ectopic pregnancy with expectant or medical management is associated with improvedreproductive outcomes compared with radical surgery. [ New 2016 ]C
Women receiving methotrexate for the management of tubal ectopic pregnancy can be advised
that there is no effect on ovarian reserve. [ New 2016 ]D

Women undergoing treatment with uterine artery embolisation and systemic methotrexate for
nontubal ectopic pregnancies can be advised that live births have been reported in subsequentpregnancies. [ New 2016 ]D
Women undergoing laparoscopic management of ovarian pregnancies can be advised that their
future fertility prospects are good. [ New 2016 ]D
What support and counselling should be offered to women undergoing treatment for ectopic
pregnancy?
Women should be advised, whenever possible, of the advantages and disadvantages associated
with each approach used for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, and should participate fully inthe selection of the most appropriate treatment.D
Women should be made aware of how to access support via patient support groups, such asthe Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, or local bereavement counselling services. [ New 2016 ]D
Muscle relaxation training may be of use to women undergoing treatment for ectopic
pregnancy with methotrexate. [ New 2016 ]C
It is recommended that women treated with methotrexate wait at least 3 months before trying
to conceive again. [ New 2016 ]D
Service and training
What is the most appropriate setting for management of women with an ectopic pregnancy?
Providers of early pregnancy care should provide a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service
with direct access for women referred by general practitioners and accident and emergencydepartments, i.e. along current NHS recommendations. Available facilities for the managementof suspected ectopic pregnancy should include diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms,transvaginal ultrasound and serum b-hCG estimations./check
Women should have access to all appropriate management options for their ectopic pregnancy.
If local facilities do not provide all options, then clear referral pathways should exist to allowthem to access appropriate care. [ New 2016 ]/check
What are the training implications for those managing women with ectopic pregnancy?
Clinicians undertaking the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy must have received
appropriate training. Laparoscopic surgery requires appropriate equipment and trained theatrestaff./check
Clinicians undertaking ultrasound for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy must have receivedappropriate training. [ New 2016 ]/check

1. Purpose and scope
The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis and management of ectopic
pregnancies. This guideline will cover the following ectopic pregnancies: tubal, cervical, caesarean scar, interstitial,cornual, ovarian, abdominal and heterotopic. The diagnosis and management of pregnancy of unknown location (PUL)will not be covered.
The management of PUL is discussed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline.
1
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
An ectopic pregnancy is any pregnancy implanted outside of the endometrial cavity. In the UK, the incidence is
approximately 11/1000 pregnancies, with an estimated 11 000 ectopic pregnancies diagnosed each year.2The
incidence of ectopic pregnancy in women attending early pregnancy units is 2 –3%.3,4Unfortunately, women still die
from ectopic pregnancy, with six maternal deaths reported between 2006 and 2008. However, the case fatality ratehas decreased over recent years, suggesting that earlier diagnosis and treatment may have made an impact.
2
Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include tubal damage following surgery or infection, smoking and in vitrofertilisation.
5–9However, the majority of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no identiﬁable risk factor.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched.The search was restricted to articles published between 1995 and July 2015 and limited to humans and the Englishlanguage. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and this wascombined with a keyword search. Search terms included ‘ectopic pregnancy’, ‘tubal pregnancy’, ‘interstitialpregnancy’, ‘cornual pregnancy’, ‘cervical pregnancy’, ‘caesarean scar pregnancy’, ‘ovarian pregnancy’, ‘abdominalpregnancy’, ‘heterotopic pregnancy’, ‘pregnancy of unknown location’ and ‘extrauterine pregnancy’. The NationalGuideline Clearinghouse, NICE Evidence Search and Trip were also searched for relevant guidelines. Where possible,recommendations are based on available evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and annotated as ‘goodpractice points’ (GPP).
Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of recommendations may be found in

4. Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy
4.1 How is a tubal pregnancy diagnosed?
4.1.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
Transvaginal ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice for tubal ectopic pregnancy.B
Tubal ectopic pregnancies should be positively identi ﬁed, if possible, by visualising an adnexal
mass that moves separate to the ovary.D
The majority of tubal ectopic pregnancies should be visualised on transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal
ultrasound has reported sensitivities of 87.0 –99.0% and speciﬁcities of 94.0 –99.9% for the diagnosis of
ectopic pregnancy.3,10–13The majority of ectopic pregnancies will be visualised on the initial ultrasound
examination.14–18The remainder will initially be classiﬁed as a PUL. Not all ectopic pregnancies initially
classiﬁed as a PUL are ‘missed’ on the initial scan. Some of these ectopic pregnancies are just too smalland too early in the disease process to be visualised on the initial ultrasound examination.
19Laparoscopy is
no longer the gold standard for diagnosis. False-negative laparoscopies (3.0 –4.5%) have been reported
when the procedure is performed too early in the development of an ongoing ectopic pregnancy.20,21Evidence
level 2++
An inhomogeneous or noncystic adnexal mass is the most common ﬁnding in around 50 –60% of
cases.4,10,12,13,19An empty extrauterine gestational sac will be present in around 20 –40% of cases.4,10,19
While an extrauterine gestational sac containing a yolk sac and/or embryonic pole that may or may not
have cardiac activity will be present in around 15 –20% of cases.4,10,19
There is no speciﬁc endometrial appearance or thickness to support a diagnosis of tubal ectopic
pregnancy. In up to 20% of cases, a collection of ﬂuid may be seen within the uterine cavity, classicallyreferred to as a ‘pseudosac’.
22–24The key is to distinguish this from an early intrauterine gestational sac.
The intradecidual and double decidual signs can be used to diagnose an early intrauterine pregnancy. Theintradecidual sign is described as a ﬂuid collection with an echogenic rim located ‘within a markedlythickened decidua on one side of the uterine cavity’.
25The double decidual sign is described as an
intrauterine ﬂuid collection surrounded by ‘two concentric echogenic rings’.26However, in practice, it can
be very difﬁcult to distinguish a ‘pseudosac’ which is just a collection of ﬂuid in the endometrial cavityfrom an early intrauterine sac. The presence of a ‘pseudosac’ alone cannot be used to diagnose an ectopicpregnancy and in fact, a small anechoic cystic structure is more likely to be an early sac rather than a‘pseudosac’. A study
27has shown that a woman with a positive pregnancy test, an intrauterine smooth-
walled anechoic cystic structure and no adnexal mass has a 0.02% probability of ectopic pregnancy, whilethe probability of intrauterine pregnancy in such a patient is 99.98%.
Free ﬂuid is often seen on ultrasound, but is not diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. A small amount of
anechoic ﬂuid in the pouch of Douglas may be found in both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies.Echogenic ﬂuid has been reported in 28 –56% of ectopic pregnancies.
28,29It may signify tubal rupture, but
most commonly is due to blood leaking from the ﬁmbrial end of the fallopian tube.Evidence

4.1.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A serum progesterone level is not useful in predicting ectopic pregnancy.B
A serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin ( b-hCG) level is useful for planning the
management of an ultrasound visualised ectopic pregnancy.C
A meta-analysis30has conﬁrmed that a single b-hCG level cannot be used in isolation to predict an ectopic
pregnancy.Evidence
level 1 –
There is a common misconception that a single low serum b-hCG level (e.g. less than 1000 iu/l) means
that an ectopic pregnancy is unlikely. However, this is a false assumption and in modern practice manyectopic pregnancies have a b-hCG value below this level.
31Evidence
level 2+
The initial serum b-hCG level is a key prognostic indicator for the success of conservative management
(expectant and medical) in cases of ultrasound visualised tubal ectopic pregnancies.32Evidence
level 2 –
4.2 How is a cervical pregnancy diagnosed?
4.2.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cervical ectopic pregnancy:
an empty uterus, a barrel-shaped cervix, a gestational sac present below the level of theinternal cervical os, the absence of the ‘sliding sign ’and blood ﬂow around the gestational sac
using colour Doppler.D
Cervical pregnancies are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all ectopic gestations.33Deﬁned criteria have
been described for diagnosing cervical ectopic pregnancies.34,35
The following ultrasound criteria have been described in the diagnosis of cervical ectopic pregnancy:
1. Empty uterine cavity.
2. A barrel-shaped cervix.3. A gestational sac present below the level of the internal cervical os.4. The absence of the ‘sliding sign’.5. Blood ﬂow around the gestational sac using colour Doppler.
The ‘sliding sign’ enables cervical ectopic pregnancies to be distinguished from miscarriages that are within
the cervical canal. When pressure is applied to the cervix using the probe, in a miscarriage, the gestationalsac slides against the endocervical canal, but it does not in an implanted cervical pregnancy.

4.2.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A single serum b-hCG should be carried out at diagnosis.D
A single serum b-hCG carried out at the time of ultrasound diagnosis is useful in deciding management
options. A serum b-hCG level greater than 10 000 iu/l is associated with a decreased chance of successful
methotrexate treatment.36Evidence

4.3 How is a caesarean scar pregnancy diagnosed?
4.3.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
Clinicians should be aware that ultrasound is the primary diagnostic modality, using a
transvaginal approach supplemented by transabdominal imaging if required.D
Deﬁned criteria for diagnosing caesarean scar pregnancy on transvaginal scan have been
described.D
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as a second-line investigation if the diagnosis isequivocal and there is local expertise in the MRI diagnosis of caesarean scar pregnancies.D
Caesarean scar pregnancy is deﬁned as implantation into the myometrial defect occurring at the site of the
previous uterine incision. The prevalence of caesarean scar pregnancy is estimated to be approximately1 in 2000 pregnancies and these pregnancies may be ongoing potentially viable pregnancies or miscarriageswithin the scar.
37
The diagnostic criteria described for diagnosing caesarean scar implantation on transvaginal ultrasoundinclude:
1. Empty uterine cavity.
38
2. Gestational sac or solid mass of trophoblast located anteriorly at the level of the internal os
embedded at the site of the previous lower uterine segment caesarean section scar.39
3. Thin or absent layer of myometrium between the gestational sac and the bladder.38,40
4. Evidence of prominent trophoblastic/placental circulation on Doppler examination.41
5. Empty endocervical canal.38
Thirteen percent of reported cases of caesarean scar pregnancy were misdiagnosed as intrauterine orcervical pregnancies at presentation.
42The true prevalence of caesarean scar pregnancies is likely to be
somewhat higher than estimated in the literature as some cases will end in the ﬁrst trimester,
either by miscarriage or termination, and go unreported and undiagnosed. There is a spectrum of severityEvidence

associated with pregnancies implanted into caesarean section scars and the natural history is uncertain.
Vial et al.43proposed that there are two different types of pregnancies implanted in a caesarean scar: the
ﬁrst type progressing into the uterine cavity as the gestational sac grows and develops, so with thepotential to reach a viable gestational age, but with the risk of massive bleeding from the implantationsite; and the second with progression deeper towards the serosal surface of the uterus with the risk ofﬁrst trimester rupture and haemorrhage. Given that there are also varying appearances of caesareansection scars on the uterus and that placental development evolves over time as the pregnancyprogresses, all of these factors can cause difﬁculty in the diagnosis of caesarean scar pregnancy. Thediagnostic criteria have not been subject to validation and are derived from descriptive case series,
38–44
so to minimise the risk of false-positive diagnosis, we recommend that all nonemergency cases of
suspected scar pregnancy are referred to a regional centre to conﬁrm the diagnosis.
The MRI features of caesarean scar pregnancy are essentially the same as those described on ultrasound,
but ultrasound is more readily available and cheaper.44,45Evidence
level 3
4.3.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
No biochemical investigations are needed routinely./check
A serum b-hCG level may be useful as a baseline prior to monitoring if conservative treatment is contemplated, but
it does not have a role in the diagnosis of caesarean scar pregnancy.
4.4 How is an interstitial pregnancy diagnosed?
4.4.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy:
empty uterine cavity, products of conception/gestational sac located laterally in the interstitial(intramural) part of the tube and surrounded by less than 5 mm of myometrium in all imagingplanes, and presence of the ‘interstitial line sign ’.D
Sonographic ﬁndings in two-dimension can be further con ﬁrmed using three-dimensional
ultrasound, where available, to avoid misdiagnosis with early intrauterine or angular(implantation in the lateral angles of the uterine cavity) pregnancy.D
Supplementation with MRI can also be helpful in the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy.D
Interstitial pregnancy occurs when the ectopic pregnancy implants in the interstitial part of the fallopian
tube. The reported incidence varies between 1.0% and 6.3% of ectopic pregnancies.46–48The interstitial
part of the fallopian tube is about 1 –2 cm in length and traverses the muscular myometrium of the uterine
wall, opening via the tubal ostium into the uterine cavity.49Evidence

Ultrasound criteria have been described for the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy.50These include:
1. Empty uterine cavity.
2. Products of conception/gestational sac located laterally in the interstitial (intramural) part of the tube
and surrounded by less than 5 mm of myometrium in all imaging planes.
3. The ‘interstitial line sign’, which is a thin echogenic line extending from the central uterine cavity echo
to the periphery of the interstitial sac. The ‘interstitial line sign’ has been shown to have a sensitivity
of 80% and a speciﬁcity of 98% for the diagnosis of interstitial ectopic pregnancy.51
In the three-dimensional coronal view of the uterus, a connection between the endometrial cavity and
interstitial part of the tube can be visualised.52,53
On MRI examination, a gestational sac-like structure is seen lateral to the cornua surrounded by themyometrium. The presence of the intact junctional zone (endomyometrial junction) between the uterinecavity and the gestational sac-like structure also supports the diagnosis.

4.4.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?

cases, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may be useful in deciding further management. /check
At presentation, based on clinical symptoms and ultrasound scan, if there is suspicion of interstitial pregnancy, a
single serum b-hCG should be carried out. This does not contribute to the diagnosis, but can be useful in deciding
management options, such as surgical, medical or expectant treatment. The overall decision regarding managementoptions depends upon clinical presentation, size of the interstitial pregnancy, presence of fetal cardiac activity and theserum b-hCG level. In some cases with a small interstitial pregnancy identiﬁed on an ultrasound scan, a repeat serum
b-hCG in 48 hours may be helpful in deciding management options.
4.5 How is a cornual pregnancy diagnosed?
4.5.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
The following ultrasound scan criteria may be used for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy:
visualisation of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body,gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus andcompletely surrounded by myometrium, and a vascular pedicle adjoining the gestational sac tothe unicornuate uterus.D
One of the initial reports56deﬁned cornual pregnancy as being ‘in one horn of a bicornuate uterus, or, by
extension of meaning, in one lateral half of a uterus of biﬁd tendency’. Subsequently, the two terms‘interstitial’ and ‘cornual’ pregnancy have been used synonymously by some authors,
57,58while others have
advocated the original deﬁnition of implantation in the congenitally abnormal uterus.59–61Evidence

Deﬁned in this way, cornual pregnancy is the rarest form of ectopic pregnancy with a reported incidence
of 1 in 76 000 pregnancies.61The following ultrasound scan criteria described in the literature can be used
for the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy:62
1. Visualisation of a single interstitial portion of fallopian tube in the main uterine body.2. Gestational sac/products of conception seen mobile and separate from the uterus and completely
surrounded by myometrium.

useful for planning management. The overall decision regarding management options (surgical, medical or expectant
treatment) depends upon the clinical presentation, size of the cornual pregnancy and the serum b-hCG level. In
some cases with a small cornual pregnancy identiﬁed on an ultrasound scan, a repeat serum b-hCG in 48 hours may

4.6 How is an ovarian pregnancy diagnosed?
4.6.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
There are no speci ﬁc agreed criteria for the ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian ectopic pregnancy.D
Findings suggestive of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound with an empty uterus are a
wide echogenic ring with an internal anechoic area on the ovary. A yolk sac or embryo is seen lesscommonly.
63,64It is not possible to separate the cystic structure or gestational sac from the ovary on
gentle palpation (negative sliding organ sign). The corpus luteum should be identiﬁed separate from thesuspected ovarian pregnancy. Colour Doppler may aid detection of a fetal heart pulsation within the ovary.A complex echogenic adnexal mass with free ﬂuid in the pouch of Douglas can represent a rupturedovarian ectopic pregnancy.Evidence
level 3
As it can be difﬁcult to distinguish ovarian ectopic pregnancies from corpus luteal cysts, tubal ectopic pregnancy
stuck to the ovary, a second corpus luteum, ovarian germ cell tumours and other ovarian pathologies, diagnosis isusually conﬁrmed surgically and histologically.Evidence

4.7 How is an abdominal pregnancy diagnosed?
4.7.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
Deﬁned ultrasound criteria can be used to diagnose an abdominal pregnancy.D
MRI can be a useful diagnostic adjunct in advanced abdominal pregnancy and can help to plan
the surgical approach.D
The following ultrasound criteria have been suggested by Gerli et al.67as being diagnostic of an early
abdominal pregnancy:
1. Absence of an intrauterine gestational sac.
2. Absence of both an evident dilated tube and a complex adnexal mass.
3. A gestational cavity surrounded by loops of bowel and separated from them by peritoneum.
4. A wide mobility similar to ﬂuctuation of the sac, particularly evident with pressure of the transvaginal
probe toward the posterior cul-de-sac.
In a clinically stable patient where abdominal pregnancy is identiﬁed or strongly suspected on ultrasound,
MRI can help to conﬁrm the diagnosis and to identify placental implantation over vital structures, such asmajor blood vessels or bowel.
68This can help to guide perioperative considerations, such as the surgical
team, blood products, preoperative angiographic embolisation, bowel preparation and insertion of ureteral
catheters. Ultrasound and/or MRI can be used to precisely map the location of the placenta prior tolaparotomy so as to avoid incising the placenta and the associated risk of uncontrollable haemorrhage.

4.7.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A high index of suspicion is based upon an elevated serum b-hCG level in combination with
ultrasound ﬁndings.D

4.8 How is heterotopic pregnancy diagnosed?
4.8.1 What are the ultrasound criteria?
A heterotopic pregnancy is diagnosed when the ultrasound ﬁndings demonstrate an
intrauterine pregnancy and a coexisting ectopic pregnancy.D
Heterotopic pregnancy should be considered in all women presenting after assisted reproductive
technologies, in women with an intrauterine pregnancy complaining of persistent pelvic pain and in thosewomen with a persistently raised b-hCG level following miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.

4.8.2 What biochemical investigations should be carried out?
A serum b-hCG level is of limited value in diagnosing heterotopic pregnancy.D

heterotopic gestations, although, the presence of a complete or partial mole must also be considered.However, in a case series

mean b-hCG level at the time of pregnancy test was no higher than in nonheterotopic pregnancies.Evidence

5.1 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for tubal pregnancy?
A laparoscopic surgical approach is preferable to an open approach.A

preference to salpingotomy.B
In women with a history of fertility-reducing factors (previous ectopic pregnancy, contralateraltubal damage, previous abdominal surgery, previous pelvic in ﬂammatory disease), salpingotomy
should be considered.C
If a salpingotomy is performed, women should be informed about the risk of persistenttrophoblast with the need for serum b-hCG level follow-up. They should also be counselled that
there is a small risk that they may need further treatment in the form of systemicmethotrexate or salpingectomy./check
Systemic methotrexate may be offered to suitable women with a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Itshould never be given at the ﬁrst visit, unless the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is absolutely
clear and a viable intrauterine pregnancy has been excluded.B
Expectant management is an option for clinically stable women with an ultrasound diagnosis ofectopic pregnancy and a decreasing b-hCG level initially less than 1500 iu/l.B

5.1.1 Surgical management
The majority of tubal ectopic pregnancies are managed surgically. Laparoscopy is preferable to laparotomy
due to its many advantages, such as shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, shorter hospitalstay, lower cost, lower analgesic requirements and less adhesion formation.
73–75Evidence, however,
suggests that there is no difference in terms of health beneﬁts between laparoscopy and laparotomy,including the key outcome of subsequent successful pregnancy.
1
A multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 446 women with a laparoscopically conﬁrmedtubal ectopic pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube
76has found that the cumulative ongoing
pregnancy rate was 60.7% after salpingotomy and 56.2% after salpingectomy. Persistent trophoblastoccurred more frequently in the salpingotomy group (14 [7%] versus 1 [less than 1%]; relative risk[RR] 15.0, 95% CI 2.0 –113.4). Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurred in 18 women (8%) in the
salpingotomy group and 12 (5%) in the salpingectomy group (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 –3.3). It was
concluded that in women with a tubal ectopic pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube, salpingotomydoes not signiﬁcantly improve fertility prospects compared with salpingectomy.Evidence
level 1+
Higher rates of subsequent intrauterine pregnancy have been found if salpingotomy is performed rather
than salpingectomy in women with a history of fertility-reducing factors (previous ectopic pregnancy,contralateral tubal damage, previous abdominal surgery, previous pelvic inﬂammatory disease). One study
77
found subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rates of 75% with salpingotomy and 40% with salpingectomy insuch women. However, subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rates were greater than 90% in both groups inwomen without fertility-reducing factors.Evidence
level 2 –
Persistent trophoblast is detected by the failure of serum b-hCG levels to fall as expected after initial
treatment. It is primarily a problem occurring after salpingotomy rather than following salpingectomy.Although, even in the presence of persistent trophoblast, b-hCG levels may return uneventfully to
normal,
78this provides the rationale for following women with serial b-hCG measurements after
treatment and administering methotrexate if levels plateau or start to rise. NICE1recommends that
women undergoing salpingotomy have a serum b-hCG level taken 7 days after surgery and then weekly
until a negative result is obtained.
Studies have reported persistent trophoblast rates of 3.9 –11.0% after salpingotomy.79–82Factors that have
been suggested as increasing the risk of developing persistent trophoblast include higher preoperativeserum b-hCG levels, a rapid preoperative rise in serum b-hCG and larger tubal masses. However, there is
no convincing evidence for this and, at present, no deﬁnitive risk factors have been identiﬁed for predictingit after salpingotomy.

5.1.2 Pharmacological management
Methotrexate at a dose of 50 mg/m2has been widely used as a single dose instead of a repeat surgical
procedure, although, no formal comparative studies have been performed. The use of prophylacticmethotrexate at the time of laparoscopic salpingotomy has also been reported and in one randomisedtrial,
83when compared with simple salpingotomy alone, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the rate of
persistent trophoblast (1.9% versus 14.5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 –0.97).Evidence

Systemic methotrexate is the most commonly used drug for the pharmacological treatment of tubal
ectopic pregnancy. RCTs comparing methotrexate with laparoscopic surgery84,85have shown
methotrexate to be equally successful to surgery in certain cases of tubal ectopic pregnancy.Evidence
level 1 –
While it can be given in a multiple dose regimen, methotrexate is most commonly given as a single
intramuscular dose of 50 mg/m2(see Appendix II).86Serum b-hCG levels are measured on days 4 and 7
post methotrexate. If the b-hCG level decreases by more than 15% between days 4 and 7, b-hCG levels
are then measured weekly until less than 15 iu/l. If the level does not decrease by 15%, a repeattransvaginal ultrasound should be considered to exclude ectopic fetal cardiac activity and the presence ofsigniﬁcant haemoperitoneum. Consideration may then be given to administration of a second dose ofmethotrexate .
86
Overall, success rates of single-dose methotrexate for tubal ectopic pregnancy range from 65 –95%, with
3–27% of women requiring a second dose.87Success rates vary considerably due to different inclusion
criteria. In the review by Kirk et al.,87some studies included PULs and presumed, but did not sonically
visualise, ectopic pregnancies. Other studies87have included cases with already decreasing serum b-hCG
levels that would have certainly resolved without any intervention. The largest single study to date88has been
on 559 cases of ectopic pregnancy, where the success of methotrexate was found to be 90.7% (507/559).
There are a number of predictors of success:
/C15Initial serum b-hCG level
Success rates are higher with lower b-hCG levels. Success rates of 81 –98% have been reported if
serum b-hCG levels are less than 1000 iu/l, compared with only 38% if b-hCG levels are greater than
5000 iu/l.32,89,90
/C15Ultrasound appearance of the ectopic pregnancy
The presence of a yolk sac, fetal pole and/or fetal cardiac activity are signiﬁcant predictors offailure.
32,88,91 –93Success rates are higher when no gestational sac is visualised.
/C15Pretreatment changes in serum b-hCG levels
The smaller the increase in b-hCG level prior to administration of methotrexate, the higher the chance
of successful medical management. A b-hCG increase of up to 11 –20% over 48 hours prior to the
administration of methotrexate has been associated with higher rates of success.89,94
/C15Decrease in b-hCG levels from day 1 to day 4 after methotrexate
Success rates of 88 –100% have been reported if the serum b-hCG level decreases from day 1 to day 4
post administration of methotrexate, compared with only 42 –62% if the serum b-hCG level increases.95,96Evidence

During treatment with methotrexate women should be advised to avoid alcohol and folate-containing
vitamins.86
There are adverse effects, which include marrow suppression, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, nonspeciﬁc pneumonitis,liver cirrhosis, renal failure and gastric ulceration. The most common adverse effects are excessiveﬂatulence and bloating due to intestinal gas formation, a transient mild elevation in liver enzymes andstomatitis.
97The contraindications to methotrexate are listed in Appendix III.
A good candidate for methotrexate has the following characteristics:
/C15haemodynamic stability
/C15low serum b-hCG, ideally less than 1500 iu/l but can be up to 5000 iu/l
/C15no fetal cardiac activity seen on ultrasound scan
/C15certainty that there is no intrauterine pregnancy
/C15willingness to attend for follow-up
/C15no known sensitivity to methotrexate.
NICE1recommends that methotrexate should be the ﬁrst-line management for women who are able to
return for follow-up and who have:
/C15no signiﬁcant pain
/C15an unruptured ectopic pregnancy with a mass smaller than 35 mm with no visible heartbeat
/C15a serum b-hCG between 1500 and 5000 iu/l
/C15no intrauterine pregnancy (as conﬁrmed on ultrasound scan).
However, before administering methotrexate, it is essential that the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is
correct. As the majority of ectopic pregnancies are visualised as inhomogeneous masses, it is prudent torepeat the serum b-hCG in such cases in 48 hours. In the event of the serum b-hCG dropping, then
expectant management may be appropriate. Should the serum b-hCG be rising at a rate that may be
consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy, then a repeat scan to check the diagnosis beforeadministering methotrexate is advisable. There are many well-documented cases of women withintrauterine pregnancies treated for suspected ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate.
98Methotrexate
should, therefore, never be given at the ﬁrst visit, unless the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is absolutelyclear and a viable intrauterine pregnancy has been excluded.
99
5.1.3 Expectant management
Expectant management is a reasonable option for appropriately selected and counselled women. They
must be willing and able to attend for follow-up, have minimal pain, and have low or declining serumb-hCG levels. Reported success rates range from 57 –100% and are very dependent on case selection.

Success rates are inversely proportional to serum b-hCG levels, with lower success rates associated with
higher initial serum b-hCG levels. One study101reported success rates of 96% with serum b-hCG levels of
less than 175 iu/l and 66% if serum b-hCG levels were 175 –1500 iu/l. Other studies102,103have reported
success rates of 80 –90% if the serum b-hCG levels are less than 1000 iu/l and 60 –67% if b-hCG levels are
less than 2000 iu/l.
A prospective observational study4on women with tubal ectopic pregnancies found that over 30% of them
could be successfully managed expectantly: 146/333 ectopic pregnancies were managed expectantly with asuccess rate of 71.2% (104/146). Selection criteria for expectant management were clinical stability with noabdominal pain, no evidence of signiﬁcant haemoperitoneum on ultrasound scan, an ectopic pregnancymeasuring less than 30 mm in mean diameter with no evidence of embryonic cardiac activity, a serumb-hCG level of less than 1500 iu/l and the woman’s consent. All women were followed up until the serum
b-hCG level was less than 20 iu/l. The protocol was individualised in each case, so that the interval of
repeat b-hCG tests varied between 2 and 7 days. Expectant management was discontinued if the woman
opted out, had signiﬁcant pain, or if the serum b-hCG level showed a sustained increase or increased to
greater than 2000 iu/l during follow-up.
A decreasing serum b-hCG level is also a good predictor of success. One study
89proposed that the
pretreatment b-hCG ratio (serum b-hCG at 48 hours/serum b-hCG at 0 hours) could be used to
predict the likely success of expectant and medical management. It was found that if the b-hCG ratio is
less than 0.8, expectant management is likely to succeed. The overall success rate of expectantmanagement in this study was 72%.Evidence
level 2+
One question that is often raised is whether there is a beneﬁt in giving methotrexate rather than managing
expectantly. A multicentre RCT104was performed to assess the treatment success rate of systemic
methotrexate compared with expectant management in women with an ectopic pregnancy or a PUL withlow or plateauing serum b-hCG levels (less than 1500 iu/l and less than 2000 iu/l for ectopic pregnancy
and PUL, respectively). They found that there was no difference in the primary treatment success rate ofsingle-dose methotrexate versus expectant management, with success rates of 31/41 (76%) and 19/32 (59%),respectively. However, the majority of the cases were PULs with only 15 (15/73; 21%) visualised ectopicpregnancies included.Evidence

chloride or methotrexate).107A retrospective review108of 62 cases of cervical ectopic pregnancy
estimated the efﬁcacy of systemic methotrexate administration in the treatment of cervical ectopicpregnancy to be approximately 91%. There was, however, no standard protocol of methotrexate used andsuccessful cases required surgical debulking or local injection with methotrexate in addition to systemictherapy. Gestational age more than 9

greater than 10 mm and fetal cardiac activity were shown to be associated with a higher risk of primaryfailure of the treatment of cervical ectopic pregnancy with systemic methotrexate. In addition, combinationtherapy with intra-amniotic injection seemed to increase the chance of successful treatment in thisretrospective study.Evidence

A number of adjunctive methods to control haemorrhage in the treatment of cervical ectopic pregnancy
have been described; these include uterine artery ligation and uterine artery embolisation (UAE).109
Case series110report success with these methods in combination with intracervical or systemic
methotrexate, but the number of cases reported are small and associated complications include infection,uterine infarction, sciatic nerve injury, and necrosis of the bladder or rectum.
Traditionally, cervical ectopic pregnancies were managed with dilatation and curettage with additional
measures designed to reduce the amount of haemorrhage.
107However, rates of excessive bleeding
necessitating hysterectomy were high and therefore, its use should be restricted to those women forwhom alternative measures are unsuitable.

More recently, a small case series111of ﬁve women with cervical ectopic pregnancies treated with

due to haemorrhage and morbidly adherent placentas. There have also been numerous small case series
and case reports42of intra-abdominal rupture and severe vaginal haemorrhage at the point of diagnosis or
following intervention. There were six maternal deaths due to haemorrhage in women with a history ofcaesarean section in the 2006 –08 Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries report,
116although, the site of
implantation was not always identiﬁed.
There have been very few small randomised studies of the treatment of caesarean scar pregnancy.117As
expected for an uncommon condition, the body of evidence otherwise consists of case series and reviewsthereof.
37,39,40,118 –120There has been one systematic review of studies reporting outcomes on ﬁve or
more patients.121
Primary medical treatment consists of using methotrexate, which may be administered by local injectioninto the gestational sac under ultrasound guidance or systemically by intramuscular injection. Localinjection seems to be a more effective means of terminating the pregnancy.
40The disadvantage of using
medical treatment is that the trophoblast remains in situ; there is a risk of haemorrhage as the retained,often very vascular, placental tissue degenerates, so some authors have advocated using suction evacuationin addition to methotrexate to hasten resolution and reduce the risk of unpredictable haemorrhage in thefollow-up period.
122Surgical treatment consists of either evacuation of the pregnancy (using suction or
hysteroscopic resection)123or excision of the pregnancy as an open,124laparoscopic125or transvaginal
procedure.126,127Suction evacuation is probably the most frequently described procedure and has been
combined with cervical cerclage, Foley catheter insertion or UAE as additional haemostaticmeasures.
39,117,128 –130Excisional techniques have the advantage of incorporating a repair of the scar, but
these procedures are technically more difﬁcult and invasive, and it is not known whether scar repairreduces the risk of recurrent caesarean scar pregnancy or scar rupture in future pregnancies.
Expectant management may be suitable for women with small, nonviable scar pregnancies and may be
considered if the pregnancy is partially implanted into the scar and grows into the uterine cavity, providedthat the woman is counselled regarding the associated potential risks, haemorrhage and morbidly adherentplacentation, and she declines termination of the pregnancy.

level 3
The management of ongoing second trimester scar pregnancies is challenging with a high risk of maternal morbidity
and hysterectomy whichever approach is taken. In these cases, the risk of surgical intervention must be balancedwith the risks of allowing the pregnancy to continue with the aim of reaching a potentially viable gestational age.Women with such pregnancies should have a care package put in place for morbidly adherent placenta, with a planfor emergency intervention should haemorrhage or rupture occur.

5.4 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for interstitial
pregnancy?
Nonsurgical management is an acceptable option for stable interstitial pregnancies.D
Expectant management is only suitable for women with low or signi ﬁcantly falling b-hCG levels
in whom the addition of methotrexate may not improve the outcome.D

A pharmacological approach using methotrexate has been shown to be effective, although,
there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend local or systemic approach.D
Surgical management by laparoscopic cornual resection or salpingotomy is an effective option.D
Alternative surgical techniques could include hysteroscopic resection under laparoscopic or
ultrasound guidance.D
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence on safety and complications in future pregnancies to recommend
other nonsurgical methods.D
The likely success of conservative management is determined by the initial level of serum b-hCG.133The
options for conservative management include expectant management or a pharmacological approach usinglocal or systemic methotrexate.
In a case series of 42 women with interstitial pregnancy,
133women with a successful outcome following
expectant and medical management134were found to have lower levels of initial b-hCG than those that
were unsuccessful (3216 iu/l versus 15 900 iu/l; P< 0.05). A success rate of 89.5% was found in another
case series of 19 women managed expectantly.134
No complications were reported in an observational study135of 17 women diagnosed with interstitial
pregnancy and treated with systemic methotrexate 50 mg/m2, while another study133reported adverse
effects in 40% of women who received systemic methotrexate. In an Australian case series136of
13 interstitial pregnancies, a single-dose intravenous methotrexate and oral folinic acid rescue regimen wasshown to be successful (91% success rate). Other described methods include transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of the exocoelomic ﬂuid from the gestational sac, followed by intrasaccular injection of25 mg of methotrexate with/without 0.2 –0.4 mEq of potassium chloride.
137This is reported to have a 91%
success rate, with the advantages of fewer adverse effects and the ability to perform embryocide at thesame time if required. The disadvantage is that it is a technically more challenging procedure. Embryocide
has been shown to improve the success rate of the procedure.
36,92,137
Various endoscopic approaches have been reported, such as electrocauterisation, endoloop application or
the encircling suture before evacuation of the conceptus.138Moon et al.139described a technique of using
highly diluted vasopressin for haemostasis during laparoscopic surgery (1 ampoule [20 U] of vasopressindiluted in 1000 ml of normal saline [1000-fold] and 150 –250 ml [0.02 U/ml] of diluted vasopressin injected
in the uterus below the interstitial pregnancy). Others have reported laparoscopic haemostatic suturingtechniques
140and laparoscopic resection using the ‘purse-string’ technique.141
Successful hysteroscopic resection of interstitial pregnancies under laparoscopic vision and ultrasoundguidance has also been reported.
142In a small case series143(n=3) the technique of ultrasound-guided
dilatation and evacuation using polypectomy forceps, followed by single-dose systemic methotrexate, wasdescribed.Evidence

Other reported nonsurgical techniques include selective UAE used in conjunction with methotrexate to
reduce haemorrhage.144–146The disadvantages with this technique are uncertainty about the safety and
complications in future pregnancies. In a case of a 12-week interstitial pregnancy with failed systemicmethotrexate,
147successful treatment was reported with use of intra-amniotic injection of etoposide, a
topoisomerase II inhibitor used in the treatment of gestational trophoblastic disease.Evidence

5.5 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for cornual
pregnancy?
Cornual pregnancies should be managed by excision of the rudimentary horn via laparoscopy or
laparotomy.D
Conservative, laparoscopic and open surgical methods of management have all been described. There are
several reported cases of methotrexate and potassium chloride injection prior to later laparoscopicrudimentary horn excision.
148However, to avoid recurrence, excision of the rudimentary horn seems to
be the best approach. The laparoscopic technique is safe, but attention needs to be paid to the possibilityof urinary tract anomalies, which can be associated with unicornuate uteri. The technique involves excisionof the ﬁbrous band that attaches the rudimentary horn to the unicornuate uterus with removal of therudimentary horn through the secondary port.
149Evidence
level 3
5.6 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for ovarian
pregnancy?
Deﬁnitive surgical treatment is preferred if laparoscopy is required to make the diagnosis of
ovarian ectopic pregnancy.D
Systemic methotrexate can be used to treat ovarian ectopic pregnancy when the risk of surgeryis high, or postoperatively in the presence of persistent residual trophoblast or persistentlyraised b-hCG levels.D
Minimal access surgery is now the treatment of choice for ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Removal of the
gestational products by enucleation or wedge resection (in the presence of a large ectopic mass) ispreferred.
150Enucleating the products of conception bluntly from the ovary minimises damage to the
surrounding ovarian tissue. Haemostasis can be achieved by electrocautery or suturing. Oophorectomyis occasionally required when there is coexisting ipsilateral ovarian pathology or excessive bleeding.
150
A number of successful and unsuccessful attempts have been made to treat ovarian ectopic pregnancywith systemic methotrexate. In one series,
151there was a failure rate of 40% using methotrexate
alone. However, all the cases successfully treated with methotrexate were diagnosed laparoscopically.There are no deﬁned selection criteria, or treatment or follow-up regimens.Evidence

5.7 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for abdominal
pregnancy?
Laparoscopic removal is an option for treatment of early abdominal pregnancy.D
Possible alternative treatment methods would be systemic methotrexate with ultrasound-
guided fetocide.D
Advanced abdominal pregnancy should be managed by laparotomy.D
Laparoscopic treatment is a safe and effective option for the management of abdominal pregnancy when
the diagnosis is made early and the site of implantation does not involve a vascular area. Laparoscopicmanagement has been associated with reduced operative time, blood loss and length of hospital stay whencompared with laparotomy.
152
Very few cases of nonsurgical management of early abdominal pregnancy have been reported. Theseinclude cases managed with intramuscular methotrexate alone and in combination with intrasaccularinjection with methotrexate.
137,153
Methotrexate has also been used as an adjunctive treatment to surgery.70
Advanced abdominal pregnancy is associated with signiﬁcant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality,154
and once diagnosed, a laparotomy should be undertaken promptly.68,152The surgical approach should be
planned to avoid incision of the placenta. The placenta may be left in situ if the vascular attachmentinvolves major vessels or vital structures, and spontaneous resorption awaited.
155Preserving the placenta
(or ‘its retention’) is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity (ileus, bowel obstruction, ﬁstula formation,haemorrhage, peritonitis), but the mortality is lower than with its removal.
156Adjuvant treatments with
methotrexate157and selective arterial embolisation152have been described.Evidence
level 3
5.8 What are the surgical, pharmacological or conservative treatment options for heterotopic
pregnancy?
The intrauterine pregnancy must be considered in the management plan.B
Methotrexate should only be considered if the intrauterine pregnancy is nonviable or if the
woman does not wish to continue with the pregnancy.D
Local injection of potassium chloride or hyperosmolar glucose with aspiration of the saccontents is an option for clinically stable women.D
Surgical removal of the ectopic pregnancy is the method of choice for haemodynamicallyunstable women and is also an option for haemodynamically stable women.D

Expectant management is an option in heterotopic pregnancies where the ultrasound ﬁndings
are of a nonviable pregnancy.D
The management approach adopted for heterotopic pregnancy should incorporate the prognosis of the
intrauterine pregnancy and the wishes of the woman regarding its ﬁnal outcome.158Evidence
level 2++
Methotrexate is not an option for the treatment of women with a heterotopic pregnancy who have a
viable intrauterine pregnancy or wish to continue with the pregnancy. Methotrexate, therefore, needs tobe given only with very careful consideration, as even local injection will affect the intrauterinepregnancy.
159In women with a viable pregnancy who do not wish to continue with the pregnancy, the
Abortion Act regulations will apply.Evidence
level 4
Medical management using local injection of hyperosmolar glucose into the extrauterine sac, or potassium
chloride into either the fetal pole if possible or the sac if not, alongside aspiration of the sac contents,
minimises the risks posed to the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy by surgical approaches. Ultrasound
follow-up is necessary in these women to ensure resolution of the ectopic pregnancy as b-hCG levels
cannot be used. This approach has been described for interstitial, caesarean scar and cervical heterotopicpregnancies.
160,161
In those women presenting with heterotopic pregnancy who are haemodynamically unstable, surgicalmanagement should be carried out.
162In those haemodynamically stable women with an easily accessible
ectopic pregnancy, such as a tubal, cervical or interstitial heterotopic pregnancy, surgical removal is also anoption.
163,164Care should be taken at the time of laparoscopy to avoid cannulation or manipulation of the
uterus.165,166

Women who undergo surgical management of ectopic pregnancy may be at higher risk of sensitisation due
to mixing of fetal and maternal blood.1
There is a paucity of evidence regarding the risk of alloimmunisation associated with medical and expectantmanagement of ectopic pregnancy. However, the risk of mixing of fetal and maternal blood followingconservative or medical management is thought to be low.
1NICE1recommend only offering anti-D
prophylaxis to those undergoing surgical management, but this is contrary to the British Committee forStandards in Haematology guidance.

7. What are the long-term fertility prospects following an ectopic pregnancy?
In the absence of a history of subfertility or tubal pathology, women should be advised that
there is no difference in the rate of fertility, the risk of future tubal ectopic pregnancy or tubalpatency rates between the different management methods.D
Women with a previous history of subfertility should be advised that treatment of their tubal
ectopic pregnancy with expectant or medical management is associated with improvedreproductive outcomes compared with radical surgery.C
Women receiving methotrexate for the management of tubal ectopic pregnancy can be advisedthat there is no effect on ovarian reserve.D
Women undergoing treatment with UAE and systemic methotrexate for nontubal ectopicpregnancies can be advised that live births have been reported in subsequent pregnancies.D
Women undergoing laparoscopic management of ovarian pregnancies can be advised that theirfuture fertility prospects are good.D
Several studies comparing surgical methods, medical and surgical management, and surgical and expectant
management have conﬁrmed that there are no statistical differences in the rate of recurrent ectopicpregnancy, with most long-term follow-up studies quoting a rate of around 18.5%.

Several studies176–178have examined various measures of ovarian reserve following medical management of
tubal ectopic pregnancy and concluded that there is no effect on antim €ullerian hormone, antral follicle
counts or ovarian responsiveness. There is some evidence that if fertility treatment is recommenced within180 days of methotrexate, the oocyte yield is lower, but the study size was small.
179
A small case series180looking at the future fertility of women undergoing treatment with UAE and
systemic methotrexate for nontubal ectopics found that in the 12 women who tried to conceive followingtreatment, 83% conceived and 58% had a live birth.

8. What support and counselling should be offered to women undergoing treatment for ectopic
pregnancy?
Women should be advised, whenever possible, of the advantages and disadvantages associated
with each approach used for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, and should participate fully inthe selection of the most appropriate treatment.D
Women should be made aware of how to access support via patient support groups, such asthe Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, or local bereavement counselling services.D
Muscle relaxation training may be of use to women undergoing treatment for ectopicpregnancy with methotrexate.C
It is recommended that women treated with methotrexate wait at least 3 months before tryingto conceive again.D
The psychological impact of early pregnancy loss may seriously affect a signiﬁcant proportion of women,
their partners and families.182,183
Plans for follow-up should be clearly recorded in the discharge letter from the early pregnancy clinic.Women should be provided with written information concerning their treatment options, follow-up, andthe availability of local and national support services.

The manufacturers of methotrexate recommend a 3-month window after use before conception due to
the length of time that it may remain present in some organs and because of concern for subsequent
pregnancy and fetal development. A small cohort study189which examined the malformation rate in those
women who conceived within 3 months of methotrexate exposure showed a higher than expected majormalformation rate. However, conception within 3 months of methotrexate should not be considered anindication for a termination.

9. Service and training
9.1 What is the most appropriate setting for management of women with an ectopic pregnancy?
Providers of early pregnancy care should provide a 7-day early pregnancy assessment service
with direct access for women referred by general practitioners and accident and emergencydepartments, i.e. along current NHS recommendations. Available facilities for the managementof suspected ectopic pregnancy should include diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms,transvaginal ultrasound and serum b-hCG estimations./check
Women should have access to all appropriate management options for their ectopic pregnancy.
If local facilities do not provide all options, then clear referral pathways should exist to allowthem to access appropriate care./check
In line with NICE recommendations from guidelines on the management of early pregnancy complications
and RCOG study groups,1,182women with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be managed in dedicated
early pregnancy clinics.
Ideally, these clinics should be sited in a dedicated area with appropriate stafﬁng and should be available on
a daily basis, 7 days a week. If the facility to refer women for attendance within 24 hours is not available,then there should be the facility to refer women to attend elsewhere for specialist clinical assessment andscanning, that is the gynaecology ward or accident and emergency with specialist gynaecology support.
1,191
Laparoscopic salpingotomy is not part of the core training of gynaecologists and a survey suggested that51% of trainees did not possess the skills necessary to perform salpingotomy if needed.
192Services must
be designed so that appropriate support is available from senior staff trained in all surgical techniques.Evidence
level 4
Given that caesarean scar pregnancy is uncommon, potentially difﬁcult to diagnose and has many different treatment
options, clinically stable women should be managed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in this area.

9.2 What are the training implications for those managing women with ectopic pregnancy?
Clinicians undertaking the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy must have received
appropriate training. Laparoscopic surgery requires appropriate equipment and trained theatrestaff./check
Clinicians undertaking ultrasound for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy must have receivedappropriate training./check
Clinicians undertaking medical management via ultrasound-guided needle techniques must havereceived appropriate training./check
If clinicians undertaking surgical management of ectopic pregnancy cannot carry out the fullrange of surgical procedures, appropriately experienced support must be available if necessary./check
Virtual reality simulators can be used as a training tool for salpingectomy.D
Clinical staff should be trained as required by the RCOG curriculum or equivalent to undertake both the
open and laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancy.193This should include the safe use of monopolar
and bipolar diathermy. They should also be supported with suitable efﬁcient modern equipment tofacilitate safe surgery.Evidence
level 4
Staff using ultrasound for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy should have completed the RCOG ultrasound module in
intermediate ultrasound of early pregnancy complications or be able to show equivalent training.
Completion of the RCOG Advanced Training Skills Module in acute gynaecology and early pregnancy does not cover
independent competency in ultrasound-guided needle techniques. Clinicians undertaking such techniques should beable to provide evidence of training and a log of ongoing cases and complications thereof.
Ideally, the operating clinician should have the skills to carry out the appropriate surgical treatment, i.e.
salpingectomy and salpingotomy. If they do not, then there should be on-call support available should otherprocedures be necessary and to provide on-the-job training.
Studies have shown that virtual reality simulators offer realistic training for surgical procedures, such as
salpingectomy.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
