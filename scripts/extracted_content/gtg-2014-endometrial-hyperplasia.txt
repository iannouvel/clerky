Management of Endometrial 
Hyperplasia
Green-top Guideline No. 67
RCOG/BSGE Joint Guideline | February 2016
Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia
This is the first edition of this guideline.This is a joint guideline between the Royal College of Obs tetricians
and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (BSGE).
Executive summary of recommendations
What are the risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia?
Endometrial hyperplasia is often associated with mu ltiple identifiable risk factors and assessment
should aim to identify and monitor these factors.
How should endometrial hyperplasia be classified?
The revised 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) cl assification is recommended. This separates
endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based upon the presence of cytological atypia: i.e. (i)
hyperplasia without atypia and (ii) atypical hyperp lasia.
What diagnostic and surveillance methods are available for endometrial hyperplasia?
Diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia requires histo logical examination of the endometrial tissue.
Endometrial surveillance should include endometrial sampling by outpatient endometrial biopsy.
Diagnostic hysteroscopy should be considered to fac ilitate or obtain an endometrial sample, especially
where outpatient sampling fails or is nondiagnostic . 
Transvaginal ultrasound may have a role in diagnosi ng endometrial hyperplasia in pre- and
postmenopausal women. 
Direct visualisation and biopsy of the uterine cavi ty using hysteroscopy should be undertaken where
endometrial hyperplasia has been diagnosed within a polyp or other discrete focal lesion.
There is insufficient evidence evaluating computeri sed tomography (CT), diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or biomarkers as aids in th e management of endometrial hyperplasia and
their use is not routinely recommended.
How should endometrial hyperplasia without atypia be managed? 
What should the initial management of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Women should be informed that the risk of endometri al hyperplasia without atypia progressing to
endometrial cancer is less than 5% over 20 years an d that the majority of cases of endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia will regress spontaneous ly during follow-up.
Reversible risk factors such as obesity and the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be
identified and addressed if possible.
Observation alone with follow-up endometrial biopsi es to ensure disease regression can be considered,
especially when identifiable risk factors can be re versed. However, women should be informed that
treatment with progestogens has a higher disease re gression rate compared with observation alone.
Progestogen treatment is indicated in women who fai l to regress following observation alone and in
symptomatic women with abnormal uterine bleeding.

PWhat should the first-line medical treatment of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Both continuous oral and local intrauterine (levono rgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS])
progestogens are effective in achieving regression of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.
The LNG-IUS should be the first-line medical treatm ent because compared with oral progestogens it
has a higher disease regression rate with a more fa vourable bleeding profile and it is associated with
fewer adverse effects.
Continuous progestogens should be used (medroxyprog esterone 10–20 mg/day or norethisterone 
10–15 mg/day) for women who decline the LNG-IUS.
Cyclical progestogens should not be used because th ey are less effective in inducing regression of
endometrial hyperplasia without atypia compared wit h continuous oral progestogens or the LNG-IUS.
What should the duration of treatment and follow-up of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Treatment with oral progestogens or the LNG-IUS sho uld be for a minimum of 6 months in order to
induce histological regression of endometrial hyper plasia without atypia.
If adverse effects are tolerable and fertility is n ot desired, women should be encouraged to retain th e
LNG-IUS for up to 5 years as this reduces the risk of relapse, especially if it alleviates abnormal ut erine
bleeding symptoms. 
Endometrial surveillance incorporating outpatient e ndometrial biopsy is recommended after a
diagnosis of hyperplasia without atypia.
Endometrial surveillance should be arranged at a mi nimum of 6-monthly intervals, although review
schedules should be individualised and responsive t o changes in a woman’s clinical condition. 
At least two consecutive 6-monthly negative biopsie s should be obtained prior to discharge.
Women should be advised to seek a further referral if abnormal vaginal bleeding recurs after
completion of treatment because this may indicate d isease relapse.
In women at higher risk of relapse, such as women w ith a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater or
those treated with oral progestogens, 6-monthly end ometrial biopsies are recommended. Once two
consecutive negative endometrial biopsies have been obtained then long-term follow-up should be
considered with annual endometrial biopsies.
When is surgical management appropriate for women with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia?
Hysterectomy should not be considered as a first-li ne treatment for hyperplasia without atypia because
progestogen therapy induces histological and sympto matic remission in the majority of women and
avoids the morbidity associated with major surgery.
Hysterectomy is indicated in women not wanting to p reserve their fertility when (i) progression to
atypical hyperplasia occurs during follow-up, or (i i) there is no histological regression of hyperplas ia
despite 12 months of treatment, or (iii) there is r elapse of endometrial hyperplasia after completing
progestogen treatment, or (iv) there is persistence of bleeding symptoms, or (v) the woman declines
to undergo endometrial surveillance or comply with medical treatment.

PPostmenopausal women requiring surgical management for endometrial hyperplasia without atypia
should be offered a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy together with the total hysterectomy.
For premenopausal women, the decision to remove the ovaries should be individualised; however,
bilateral salpingectomy should be considered as thi s may reduce the risk of a future ovarian
malignancy.
A laparoscopic approach to total hysterectomy is pr eferable to an abdominal approach as it is
associated with a shorter hospital stay, less posto perative pain and quicker recovery. 
Endometrial ablation is not recommended for the tre atment of endometrial hyperplasia because
complete and persistent endometrial destruction can not be ensured and intrauterine adhesion
formation may preclude future endometrial histologi cal surveillance.
How should atypical hyperplasia be managed?
What should the initial management of atypical hyperplasia be? 
Women with atypical hyperplasia should undergo a to tal hysterectomy because of the risk of
underlying malignancy or progression to cancer. 
A laparoscopic approach to total hysterectomy is pr eferable to an abdominal approach as it is
associated with a shorter hospital stay, less posto perative pain and quicker recovery.
There is no benefit from intraoperative frozen sect ion analysis of the endometrium or routine
lymphadenectomy. 
Postmenopausal women with atypical hyperplasia shou ld be offered bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
together with the total hysterectomy.
For premenopausal women, the decision to remove the ovaries should be individualised; however,
bilateral salpingectomy should be considered as thi s may reduce the risk of a future ovarian
malignancy.
Endometrial ablation is not recommended because com plete and persistent endometrial destruction
cannot be ensured and intrauterine adhesion formati on may preclude endometrial histological
surveillance.
How should women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to preserve their fertility or who are not
suitable for surgery be managed?
Women wishing to retain their fertility should be c ounselled about the risks of underlying malignancy
and subsequent progression to endometrial cancer.
Pretreatment investigations should aim to rule out invasive endometrial cancer or co-existing ovarian
cancer.
Histology, imaging and tumour marker results should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary meeting and
a plan for management and ongoing endometrial surve illance formulated.
First-line treatment with the LNG-IUS should be rec ommended, with oral progestogens as a 
second-best alternative (see section 7.2).

POnce fertility is no longer required, hysterectomy should be offered in view of the high risk of disea se
relapse.
How should women with atypical hyperplasia not undergoing hysterectomy be followed up?
Routine endometrial surveillance should include end ometrial biopsy. Review schedules should be
individualised and be responsive to changes in a wo man’s clinical condition. Review intervals should
be every 3 months until two consecutive negative bi opsies are obtained.
In asymptomatic women with a uterus and evidence of histological disease regression, based upon a
minimum of two consecutive negative endometrial bio psies, long-term follow-up with endometrial
biopsy every 6–12 months is recommended until a hys terectomy is performed.
How should endometrial hyperplasia be managed in women wishing to conceive?
Disease regression should be achieved on at least o ne endometrial sample before women attempt to
conceive.
Women with endometrial hyperplasia who wish to conc eive should be referred to a fertility specialist
to discuss the options for attempting conception, f urther assessment and appropriate treatment.
Assisted reproduction may be considered as the live birth rate is higher and it may prevent relapse
compared with women who attempt natural conception.
Prior to assisted reproduction, regression of endom etrial hyperplasia should be achieved as this is
associated with higher implantation and clinical pr egnancy rates. 
HRT and endometrial hyperplasia 
Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in wo men with a uterus.
All women taking HRT should be encouraged to report any unscheduled vaginal bleeding promptly. 
Women with endometrial hyperplasia taking a sequent ial HRT preparation who wish to continue HRT
should be advised to change to continuous progestog en intake using the LNG-IUS or a continuous
combined HRT preparation. Subsequent management sho uld be as described in the preceding sections
of the guideline.
Women with endometrial hyperplasia taking a continu ous combined preparation who wish to continue
HRT should have their need to continue HRT reviewed . Discuss the limitations of the available evidence
regarding the optimal progestogen regimen in this c ontext. Consider using the LNG-IUS as a source of
progestogen replacement. Subsequent management shou ld be as described in the preceding sections
of the guideline.
How should endometrial hyperplasia be managed in wo men on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer? 
What is the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer?
Women taking tamoxifen should be informed about the increased risks of developing endometrial
hyperplasia and cancer. They should be encouraged t o report any abnormal vaginal bleeding or
discharge promptly.

PWomen taking aromatase inhibitors (such as anastroz ole, exemestane and letrozole) should be
informed that these medications are not known to in crease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and
cancer. 
Should women on tamoxifen be treated with prophylactic progestogen therapy?
There is evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents polyp f ormation and that it reduces the incidence of
endometrial hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen. The effect of the LNG-IUS on breast cancer recurrence
risk remains uncertain so its routine use cannot be recommended.
How should women who develop endometrial hyperplasia while on tamoxifen treatment for breast
cancer be managed?
The need for tamoxifen should be reassessed and man agement should be according to the histological
classification of endometrial hyperplasia and in co njunction with the woman’s oncologist.
How should endometrial hyperplasia confined to an endometrial polyp be managed?
Complete removal of the uterine polyp(s) is recomme nded and an endometrial biopsy should be
obtained to sample the background endometrium.
Subsequent management should be according to the hi stological classification of endometrial
hyperplasia.
1. Purpose and scope
The aim of this guideline is to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence-based information regardin g
the management of endometrial hyperplasia. 
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
Endometrial hyperplasia is defined as irregular pro liferation of the endometrial glands with an increa se
in the gland to stroma ratio when compared with proliferative endometrium.1
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecologica l malignancy in the Western world and
endometrial hyperplasia is its precursor.2In the UK, 8617 new cases of endometrial cancer wer e
registered in 2012.3The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is estimated to be at least three times
higher than endometrial cancer and if left untreated it can progress to cancer.2,4
The most common presentation of endometrial hyperpl asia is abnormal uterine bleeding. This
includes heavy menstrual bleeding, intermenstrual b leeding, irregular bleeding, unscheduled bleeding
on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and postmenopausal bleeding.2
3. Identification and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodo logy for developing RCOG Green-top
Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Coc hrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant papers. The search was
inclusive of all relevant articles published until June 2015. The databases were searched using the
relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings and synonyms, and this
was combined with a keyword search. The search incl uded the following terms: (endometr*

guidelines were also searched for using the same criteria in the National Guideline Clearinghouse,
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search and the Canadian Medical
Association (CMA) Infobase.
Where possible, recommendations are based on availa ble evidence. Areas lacking evidence are
highlighted and annotated as ‘good practice points’ . Further information about the assessment of
evidence and the grading of recommendations may be found in Appendix I.
4. What are the risk factors for endometrial hyperpl asia?
Endometrial hyperplasia is often associated with mu ltiple identifiable risk factors and assessment
should aim to identify and monitor these factors.
Endometrial hyperplasia develops when estrogen, unopposed by progesterone, stimulates
endometrial cell growth by binding to estrogen rece ptors in the nuclei of endometrial cells.
Known risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia reflect this aetiology: increased body mass
index (BMI) with excessive peripheral conversion of androgens in adipose tissue to
estrogen; anovulation associated with the perimenop ause or polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS); estrogen-secreting ovarian tumours, e.g. granulosa cell tumours (with up to 40%
prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia); and drug-in duced endometrial stimulation, e.g. the
use of systemic estrogen replacement therapy or long-term tamoxifen.5–10
A Cochrane meta-analysis found that unopposed estro gen replacement therapy is associated
with an increased incidence of hyperplasia at all doses and is not recommended for use in
women with a uterus.9
While estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium is believed to be the main aetiological
risk factor for developing the condition, other elements such as immunosuppression and
infection may also be involved.10A retrospective analysis of 45 renal graft recipients with
abnormal bleeding found a two-fold increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia (69%
versus 33%) compared with nontransplanted controls.10
5. How should endometrial hyperplasia be classified?
The revised 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) cl assification is recommended. This separates
endometrial hyperplasia into two groups based upon the presence of cytological atypia: i.e. (i)
hyperplasia without atypia and (ii) atypical hyperp lasia. 
Classification systems for endometrial hyperplasia were developed based upon histological 
characteristics and oncogenic potential. 
The widely adopted 1994 WHO classification of endometrial hyperplasia was based upon
both the complexity of the glandular architecture a nd the presence of nuclear atypia.1It
com prised four categories: (i) simple hyperplasia, (ii) complex hyperplasia, (iii) simple
hyperplasia with atypia and (iv) complex hyperplasi a with atypia. The association of 
cyto logical atypia with an increased risk of endom etrial cancer has been known since 1985.2

level 4PThe endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) cla ssification is an alternative system of
nomenclature proposed in 2003,11the purpose of which was to improve prediction of
clinical outcomes, improve inter-observer reproduci bility and reduce subjective bias
inherent to the 1994 WHO classification. The EIN di agnostic schema comprises three
categories – benign (endometrial hyperplasia), prem alignant (a diagnosis of EIN based upon
five subjective histological criteria) and malignan t (endometrial cancer) – but this 
classification is not extensively used in the UK. 
The 2014 revised WHO classification1simply separates endometrial hyperplasia into two
groups based upon the presence or absence of cytolo gical atypia, i.e. (i) hyperplasia without
atypia and (ii) atypical hyperplasia; the complexity of architecture is no longer part of the
classification. The diagnosis of EIN in the new WHO classification is considered 
interchange able with atypical hyperplasia. This guideline has adopted the new 2014 WHO
classification of endometrial hyperplasia, although much of the supporting evidence
identified has used the 1994 WHO nomenclature categorising hyperplasia morphologically
as simple or complex. 
6. What diagnostic and surveillance methods are avai lable for endometrial hyperplasia?
Diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia requires histo logical examination of the endometrial tissue.
Endometrial surveillance should include endometrial sampling by outpatient endometrial biopsy. 
Diagnostic hysteroscopy should be considered to fac ilitate or obtain an endometrial sample, especially
where outpatient sampling fails or is nondiagnostic .
Transvaginal ultrasound may have a role in diagnosi ng endometrial hyperplasia in pre- and 
post menopausal women.
Direct visualisation and biopsy of the uterine cavi ty using hysteroscopy should be undertaken where
endometrial hyperplasia has been diagnosed within a polyp or other discrete focal lesion.
There is insufficient evidence evaluating computeri sed tomography (CT), diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or biomarkers as aids in th e management of endometrial hyperplasia and
their use is not routinely recommended.
Endometrial hyperplasia is often suspected in women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding.
However, confirmation of diagnosis requires histolo gical analysis of endometrial tissue specimens
obtained either by using miniature outpatient sucti on devices designed to blindly abrade and/or
aspirate endometrial tissue from the uterine cavity or by inpatient endometrial sampling, such as
dilatation and curettage performed under general an aesthesia. Endometrial sampling is also
fundamental in monitoring regression, persistence or progression.
Outpatient endometrial biopsy is convenient and has high overall accuracy for diagnosing
endometrial cancer.12The accuracy for hyperplasia is more modest, with a systematic review
reporting a pooled likelihood ratio (LR) of 12.0 (9 5% CI 7.8–18.6) for a positive test and 0.2
(95% CI 0.1–0.3) for a negative test result.13Despite a negative biopsy result, 2% of women
will still have endometrial hyperplasia.13
A transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) that detects an irregularity of the endometrial profile
or an abnormal double layer endometrial thickness m easurement would give further reason
to perform an endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding.14,15Systematic
reviews have suggested a cut-off of 3 mm or 4 mm for ruling out endometrial cancer and

level 2++Phave shown that the probability of cancer is reduced to less than 1% when the endometrial
thickness is less than the cut-off.14,16–18However, a larger cut-off value has been suggested for
women taking HRT or tamoxifen, whether presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding or
asymptomatic.15,19
The role of ultrasound in premenopausal women is re stricted to identifying structural
abnormalities, as there seems to be an overlap between normal endometrial thickness and
that caused by endometrial disease.20However, for women with PCOS and absent
withdrawal bleeds or abnormal uterine bleeding, a T VS should be considered, as advised by
RCOG guidance.21A prospective study of 56 women with PCOS found that no woman with
an endometrial thickness of less than 7 mm had endometrial hyperplasia.22As a result, the
RCOG guidance supports the conclusion that below this cut-off endometrial hyperplasia is
unlikely.21
Hysteroscopy with additional endometrial assessment may be necessary if abnormal
bleeding persists or if intrauterine structural abn ormalities such as polyps are suspected on
TVS or endometrial biopsy. A small cohort study has shown that up to 10% of endometrial
pathology can be missed even with inpatient endomet rial sampling.23However, in
premenopausal women who wish to preserve their fertility, repeated curettage should be
minimised to reduce the incidence of Asherman’s syndrome.
Hysteroscopy can detect focal lesions such as polyp s that may be missed by blind sampling.24
A population-based cross-sectional study diagnosed focal endometrial pathology in
 approximately 10% (64/684) of women who volunteere d to undergo a saline contrast 
sono hysterography as part of the research; two of these were found to have hyperplasia
without atypia.25
In addition, hysteroscopy can be used to facilitate or complement the endometrial biopsy,
especially where sampling is not possible or is non diagnostic. Directed biopsies can be
taken through the operating channel of a continuous flow operating hysteroscope24,26or
blindly through the outer sheath after removing the telescope.27
Diagnostic hysteroscopy can be conducted in the out patient setting using miniature
 hysteroscopes and without the need for anaesthesia or vaginal instrumentation.28The
accuracy of hysteroscopy in diagnosing cancer and h yperplasia in women with abnormal
bleeding has been evaluated in a systematic quantit ative review of data from 26 346 women.29
A positive hysteroscopy result (positive LR 60.9) i ncreased the probability of cancer to 71.8%
from a pretest probability of 3.9%, whereas a negat ive hysteroscopy result (negative LR 0.15)
reduced the probability of cancer to 0.6%.29A hysteroscopy suggestive of endometrial disease
(i.e. cancer or endometrial hyperplasia of any type ) increased the probability of disease from
a pretest probability of 10.6% to 55.2% (positive L R 10.4). A negative or normal hysteroscopy
reduced the probability of endometrial disease from 10.6% to 2.8% (negative LR 0.24).29
Hence, hysteroscopy is more accurate in detecting t han excluding endometrial disease and
has a higher accuracy for endometrial cancer than e ndometrial hyperplasia.29
CT or MRI to aid the diagnosis of hyperplasia is not commonly used. It is reported that a
preoperative CT scan of women who have atypical end ometrial hyperplasia or grade 1
endometrial cancer could alter management in 4.3% o f cases.30However, there are no
studies evaluating its use for following up women w ith endometrial hyperplasia when
treated conservatively. It is an expensive test and because of the radiation associated with
its application it should not be routinely recommended. Diffusion-weighted MRI may help
in identifying women with invasive cancer and it ha s the future potential to diagnose

technology in women undergoing surveillance for aty pical endometrial hyperplasia as a
predictor for malignant change, but more evidence is needed.
Several biomarkers associated with endometrial hyperplasia have been investigated, but as
of yet none of them predicts disease or prognosis accurately enough to be clinically useful.
A systematic review evaluated 123 observational immunohistochemical studies and found
that the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), per haps in combination with B-cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and BCL-2-like protein 4 (BAX), could be potentially useful, but more
research is needed before use.32
7. How should endometrial hyperplasia without atypia be managed? 
7.1 What should the initial management of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Women should be informed that the risk of endometri al hyperplasia without atypia progressing to
endometrial cancer is less than 5% over 20 years an d that the majority of cases of endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia will regress spontaneous ly during follow-up. 
Reversible risk factors such as obesity and the use of HRT should be identified and addressed if
possible. 
Observation alone with follow-up endometrial biopsi es to ensure disease regression can be considered,
especially when identifiable risk factors can be re versed. However, women should be informed that
treatment with progestogens has a higher disease re gression rate compared with observation alone. 
Progestogen treatment is indicated in women who fai l to regress following observation alone and in
symptomatic women with abnormal uterine bleeding.
There are two cohort studies and a case–control stu dy describing the natural history of
hyperplasia without atypia and its risk for progression to cancer.2,33,34A 20-year follow-up
study found that, among women with hyperplasia with out atypia, previously known as
women with simple or complex hyperplasia, the cumulative long-term risk for progression
to cancer is less than 5%.33An earlier study with a mean follow-up duration of 13.4 years
found that progression to cancer occurred in 1/93 ( 1%) women with simple hyperplasia
compared with 1/29 (3%) women with complex hyperplasia.2A nested case–control study
of endometrial hyperplasia found a significant incr ease in risk of progression to endometrial
cancer for women with complex hyperplasia compared with matched controls with
disordered proliferative endometrium (rate ratio 2. 8, 95% CI 1–7.9), although not for simple
hyperplasia (rate ratio 2.0, 95% CI 0.9–4.5).34
Spontaneous regression often occurs in women with h yperplasia without atypia. Two cohort
studies have followed up women diagnosed with endom etrial hyperplasia who had no
treatment. The first study was a multicentre prospe ctive study where 35 women with simple
hyperplasia and four women with complex hyperplasia were followed up for 24 weeks
without any treatment. They underwent endometrial sampling at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks of
follow-up.35For women with simple hyperplasia, regression to no rmal endometrium
occurred in 74% of women (26/35), while 17% (6/35) had persistent hyperplasia and 9%
(3/35) progressed to atypical hyperplasia after 24 weeks of follow-up.35For women with
complex hyperplasia, regression to normal endometrium was observed in 75% of women
(3/4) and one woman had persistent complex hyperplasia after 24 weeks.35

level 2++The second study was a retrospective cohort study, which followed up 93 women with
simple hyperplasia and 24 women with complex hyperplasia who were not treated for 12
years. Regression to normal endometrium occurred in 81% of women (74/93) with simple
hyperplasia, while 18% (17/93) had persistent disea se and 1% (1/93) progressed to
endometrial cancer.2For women with complex hyperplasia, 79% (19/24) reg ressed to
normal endometrium and the remaining 21% (5/24) had persistent complex hyperplasia.2
There are several reversible risk factors for endom etrial hyperplasia. The slow progression of
endometrial hyperplasia without atypia to cancer of fers a window of opportunity to address these
factors. Obesity is a major risk factor and advising obese women to lose weight is recommended, but
there is no evidence on weight loss strategies and their impact on progression or relapse outcomes
during follow-up. 
Observational studies have demonstrated that up to 10% of severely obese women could
harbour asymptomatic endometrial hyperplasia and ba riatric surgery may reduce this 
risk.36–38Another observational study described the acceptability of bariatric referrals when
offered by gynaecological oncologists to 106 women and found that more than 90% would
be happy to discuss weight loss and approximately h alf accepted a medical referral to a
bariatric specialist with or without surgical referral.39
Clinicians should take a detailed history of any use of exogenous hormones that includes
both prescribed HRT preparations and over-the-count er preparations that may contain high
potency estrogens. Clinicians should be aware that nonprescribed estrogen intake may take
various forms.40
The indication and type of combined HRT regimen sho uld be reviewed, especially as regards the
relative dosages of estrogen and progestogen as wel l as the mode of administration of these hormones.
A manipulation of the combined HRT regimen alone is often sufficient in inducing regression of
endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. This is particularly important for postmenopausal women as
they have a higher risk of developing endometrial h yperplasia and cancer because of unopposed
extraovarian estrogenic stimulation.
Ongoing tamoxifen treatment should be reviewed in conjunction with the woman’s oncologist. 
Anovulatory cycles are often causal of endometrial hyperplasia in women who have PCOS
or who are perimenopausal and they are likely to re gress to normal once women with PCOS
resume ovulation or perimenopausal women reach the menopause.41For further guidance
on PCOS, please see RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 33.21
Many women with endometrial hyperplasia without aty pia will present through 
postmeno pausal bleeding pathways and it is likely that they will have undergone a baseline
pelvic ultrasound. If not, this should be arranged to exclude the possibility of an estrogen-
secreting granulosa cell tumour of the ovary. If an ovarian cyst is detected on pelvic
ultrasound, then blood for ovarian tumour markers should be obtained as recommended
by the RCOG.42,43In the absence of other identifiable risk factors f or endometrial hyperplasia,
a serum inhibin level together with an estradiol level may be considered if a granulosa cell
tumour is suspected.44,45
Progestogen treatment appears to have higher regression rates (89–96%)46compared with
observation only (74.2–81%)2,35and it may reduce the risk of progression to cancer4and
the need for hysterectomy.47However, these estimates are derived from small observational
studies with varying completeness and lengths of follow-up.2,35,46

level 2+No comparative studies were identified that compared medical treatment with observation only for
women with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. In view of a high spontaneous regression rate
and uncommon progression to more severe disease, it is uncertain whether medical management is
appropriate for all women. 
Many women are diagnosed with endometrial hyperplas ia while undergoing investigation of abnormal
uterine bleeding. Thus, treatment may be required on symptomatic grounds. Because of the risk of
progression to cancer, women who fail to regress wi th observation alone should be treated and
followed up to ensure regression. Observation alone is expected to fail where there is no identifiable
reversible risk factor causing the endometrial hyperplasia, but there is limited evidence. 
7.2 What should the first-line medical treatment of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Both continuous oral and local intrauterine (levono rgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS])
progestogens are effective in achieving regression of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.
The LNG-IUS should be the first-line medical treatm ent because compared with oral progestogens it
has a higher disease regression rate with a more fa vourable bleeding profile and it is associated with
fewer adverse effects.
Continuous progestogens should be used (medroxyprog esterone 10–20 mg/day or norethisterone 
10–15 mg/day) for women who decline the LNG-IUS.
Cyclical progestogens should not be used because th ey are less effective in inducing regression of
endometrial hyperplasia without atypia compared wit h continuous oral progestogens or the LNG-IUS. 
Progestogens have been advocated to treat endometri al hyperplasia because they modify the
proliferative effects of estrogen on the endometriu m. Treatment with progestogens was originally
limited to oral progestogens such as norethisterone , medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol
acetate. 
Oral progestogens can have significant adverse effe cts and norethisterone at a high dose
has similar contraindications to combined contraceptive pills.48More recently, intrauterine
delivery of progestogens via the LNG-IUS has been s uccessfully used for this purpose.46
The intrauterine release of the levonorgestrel mini mises the systemic absorption of the
hormone and aids compliance by reducing adverse effects. The LNG-IUS achieves a higher
concentration of levonorgestrel at the level of the endometrium compared with oral
progestogens.49
In women of reproductive age the LNG-IUS can also provide effective contraception and it
is recommended as first-line treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.50
Evidence comparing use of the LNG-IUS and oral prog estogens was identified from seven
randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 766 women, with a moderate risk of bias.51–57
The available randomised controlled trials are summ arised in a meta-analysis that found that
the LNG-IUS achieved a higher regression rate compa red with oral progestogens after 3
months (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.39–3.82), 6 months (OR 3. 16, 95% CI 1.84–5.45), 12 months
(OR 5.73, 95% CI 2.67–12.33) and 24 months of treat ment (OR 7.46, 95% CI 2.55–21.78).
Women treated with a LNG-IUS compared with oral pro gestogens were less likely to need
hysterectomy during follow-up (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 –0.45). No difference was found in the
frequency of irregular vaginal bleeding in the two groups (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54–2.32).58

level 1+Only one randomised controlled trial was identified that compared different types, doses
and regimens for oral progestogens. This trial comp ared the efficacies of three different 
10-day cyclical progestogens when used for 3 months for the treatment of simple hyperplasia
without atypia. The observed disease regression rat es were similar for all drugs: 60% (18/30)
for medroxyprogesterone (10 mg/day), 44% (11/25) for lynestrenol (15 mg/day) and 59%
(16/27) for norethisterone (15 mg/day).55
Meta-analyses of seven randomised controlled trials and 24 uncontrolled observational
studies found that the most commonly used progestog ens were medroxyprogesterone 
(dose range 10–20 mg/day) and norethisterone (dose range 10–15 mg/day).46,57
7.3 What should the duration of treatment and follow-up of hyperplasia without atypia be?
Treatment with oral progestogens or the LNG-IUS sho uld be for a minimum of 6 months in order to
induce histological regression of endometrial hyper plasia without atypia.
If adverse effects are tolerable and fertility is n ot desired, women should be encouraged to retain th e
LNG-IUS for up to 5 years as this reduces the risk of relapse, especially if it alleviates abnormal ut erine
bleeding symptoms.
Endometrial surveillance incorporating outpatient e ndometrial biopsy is recommended after a
diagnosis of hyperplasia without atypia.
Endometrial surveillance should be arranged at a mi nimum of 6-monthly intervals, although review
schedules should be individualised and responsive t o changes in a woman’s clinical condition. 
At least two consecutive 6-monthly negative biopsie s should be obtained prior to discharge. 
Women should be advised to seek a further referral if abnormal vaginal bleeding recurs after
completion of treatment because this may indicate d isease relapse.
In women at higher risk of relapse, such as women w ith a BMI of 35 or greater or those treated with or al
progestogens, 6-monthly endometrial biopsies are re commended. Once two consecutive negative
endometrial biopsies have been obtained then long-t erm follow-up should be considered with annual
endometrial biopsies. 
Higher regression rates have been shown from increa sing the duration of medical treatment
from 3 to 6 months. One trial randomised women betw een the LNG-IUS and oral
contin uous medroxyprogesterone and reported histol ogical regression rates for endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia according to the duration of therapy. Between 3 and 6 months
the regression rates improved for the LNG-IUS from 84% to 100% and for oral
medroxyprogesterone from 50% to 64%.53
In one trial women were randomised to LNG-IUS or two regimens of oral progestogens for
6 months. The LNG-IUS was removed after 6 months. The authors found that relapse was
common (33%) and did not differ among the three groups.56
A meta-analysis of 11 observational uncontrolled st udies found that oral progestogens were
generally given for 3–6 months, whereas the LNG-IUS was usually used beyond this time and
for up to 5 years.46

level 2++Two long-term prospective cohort studies provide in formation about the duration of
follow-up and relapse rates following successful regression of endometrial hyperplasia.59,60
In the largest cohort, relapse of complex endometri al hyperplasia following initial regression
occurred in 12.7% (18/142) of women treated with th e LNG-IUS compared with 28.3%
(17/60) of women treated with oral progestogens (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.18–0.73).59
Women from the same cohort were stratified accordin g to their BMI. For those women
treated with the LNG-IUS, only 3% of women with a B MI under 35 relapsed during follow-up
compared with 33% of women with a BMI of 35 or grea ter over a median follow-up of 
67 months (hazard ratio 5.51, 95% CI 1.05–28.87). In contrast, in women treated with oral
progestogens, a woman’s BMI was not found to be predictive of relapse. 
Another observational study of women treated with the LNG-IUS found that 26% (9/34) of
women underwent hysterectomy after evidence of regr ession of the hyperplastic process
and in more than half (5/9) of these women there wa s evidence of relapse of hyperplasia on
the final hysterectomy specimen. The authors recomm ended periodic endometrial sampling
for at least 2 years after stopping treatment.60The optimal schedule for clinical follow-up is
uncertain because of the limited availability of pu blished data, but the observational studies
available support endometrial biopsies every 6 mont hs and at least two consecutive negative
biopsies to confirm disease regression to normality.59,60In women at higher risk of disease
relapse, persistence or progression, such as those with a BMI of 35 or greater or treated
with short courses of oral progestogens, biopsies at 6-monthly intervals for at least 2 years
should be considered and long-term follow-up on an annual basis thereafter.
In view of the risk of relapse of endometrial hyperplasia, it is reasonable to continue with
LNG-IUS treatment despite a regression of the hyper plasia. In the absence of adverse effects,
the final decision to persist with treatment or rem ove the device should be made in
 consult ation with the woman and according to her preferences. If adverse effects are
tolerable and fertility is not desired, women should be encouraged to retain the LNG-IUS
for the 5-year duration, especially if it alleviates abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms. For
oral progest ogens, there is evidence from randomis ed trials that 6 months of therapy is
more efficacious than 3 months, but there are no co mparative data for longer therapy
durations.53Data reporting longer term courses of continuous oral progestogens beyond 
6 months to maintain disease remission are unavaila ble. Cessation of oral progestogens
after 3–6 months of therapy appears to be commonly practised46,59and this may relate to
fears over potential adverse effects arising from c hronic administration of high-dose
continuous oral progestogens and compliance issues. In the absence of safety and efficacy
data, the routine use of longer term oral regimens cannot be supported. Women
experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding after the en d of treatment should be advised to
seek a further referral as this may signify relapse.
In summary, there is evidence from randomised trial s that treatment with progestogens should last for
at least 6 months. If endometrial hyperplasia persi sts for 12 months despite treatment, the risk of
underlying cancer is high and the chances of diseas e regression are low, such that hysterectomy is
advised. Observational evidence shows that a BMI of 35 or greater or treatment of endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia by oral progestogens carries a higher risk of relapse and long-term follow-
up may be warranted. Annual endometrial biopsies can be considered for these high-risk women, but
follow-up schedules should be individualised. They should take into account the baseline cancer risk,
medical comorbidities, presence of abnormal bleedin g and treatment factors such as response,
tolerance and compliance, as well as the wishes of the patient.

level 2++7.4 When is surgical management appropriate for women with endometrial hyperplasia
without atypia?
Hysterectomy should not be considered as a first-li ne treatment for hyperplasia without atypia because
progestogen therapy induces histological and sympto matic remission in the majority of women and
avoids the morbidity associated with major surgery.
Hysterectomy is indicated in women not wanting to p reserve their fertility when (i) progression to
atypical hyperplasia occurs during follow-up, or (i i) there is no histological regression of hyperplas ia
despite 12 months of treatment, or (iii) there is r elapse of endometrial hyperplasia after completing
progestogen treatment, or (iv) there is persistence of bleeding symptoms, or (v) the woman declines
to undergo endometrial surveillance or comply with medical treatment.
Postmenopausal women requiring surgical management for endometrial hyperplasia without atypia
should be offered a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy together with the total hysterectomy.
For premenopausal women, the decision to remove the ovaries should be individualised; however,
bilateral salpingectomy should be considered as thi s may reduce the risk of a future ovarian
malignancy.
A laparoscopic approach to total hysterectomy is pr eferable to an abdominal approach as it is
associated with a shorter hospital stay, less posto perative pain and quicker recovery. 
Endometrial ablation is not recommended for the tre atment of endometrial hyperplasia because
complete and persistent endometrial destruction can not be ensured and intrauterine adhesion
formation may preclude future endometrial histologi cal surveillance.
The majority of women will experience regression of their endometrial hyperplasia without
atypia following progestogen treatment.46However, some cases will persist or may relapse
during follow-up. There is limited research on the best approach for those women. A
prospective cohort study followed up women treated with the LNG-IUS for complex
hyperplasia.47The 16 women with complex hyperplasia who did not achieve regression in
this study were offered hysterectomy. This was performed in 13 of them and a diagnosis of
cancer was made in 23.1% of these women (3/13).47Thus, the data from this cohort suggest
that after 12 months of progestogen treatment, if t here is no evidence of regression of
endometrial hyperplasia then the risk of cancer is high and hysterectomy is warranted.61
The small increase in overall regression rates of endometrial hyperplasia observed in the
above cohort beyond 12 months of treatment has to b e balanced against the risks of
histological undercall and thus endometrial cancer. While 39 of 68 (57%) refractory women
subsequently regressed between 12 and 24 months in the above study, a decision to persist
with the LNG-IUS beyond 12 months should only be taken after careful consideration and
thorough discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefits of prolonged medical
treatment compared with hysterectomy.47It is advisable to obtain a multidisciplinary opini on
in such cases.
In the same cohort study of 219 women with mainly c omplex endometrial hyperplasia
(202/219) treated with either the LNG-IUS or oral p rogestogens, 19% (41/219) relapsed after
initial disease regression. Relapse occurred more o ften with the oral progestogens than with
the LNG-IUS (30% versus 14%; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17–0.7, P= 0.005). Of the 41 relapsed
women, only 17 underwent hysterectomy and two were diagnosed with cancer (11.7%).61
One woman initially diagnosed with complex endometrial hyperplasia and treated with the
LNG-IUS progressed to endometrioid cancer with a concomitant granulosa cell tumour of

level 2+the ovary, while the second woman who progressed to cancer was initially diagnosed with
atypical endometrial hyperplasia.61These data further highlight the significant risk o f
underlying endometrial cancer in persisting or relapsing endometrial hyperplasia without
atypia and a total hysterectomy should be recommended in these circumstances.
A first-line hysterectomy should also be considered in women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia
without atypia who have abnormal bleeding or who ar e not prepared to undergo endometrial
surveillance. Furthermore, a hysterectomy may be indicated in women not wishing or not suitable to
receive hormonal therapy where there are concerns o ver treatment or surveillance compliance.
However, these indications should be considered in the context of baseline cancer risk, co-existing
medical morbidities and patient preferences. In wom en in whom endometrial hyperplasia without
atypia fails to regress with progestogen treatment, a hysterectomy should be carried out. 
The current surgical standard for endometrial hyper plasia without atypia is to perform a
total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for postmenopausal women. For
premenopausal women, the decision to remove the ovaries depends on patient wishes and
malignancy risk factors. However, a bilateral salpi ngectomy while preserving the ovaries can
be considered as this may reduce the woman’s risk o f a future ovarian malignancy.62
Supra cervical hysterectomy should be avoided to en sure that all premalignant disease is
eliminated.63
We did not identify any specific evidence evaluatin g the different routes of hysterectomy for
hyperplasia without atypia. However, there is evide nce that a laparoscopic approach may be
preferable to the abdominal approach for women with atypical hyperplasia or stage I
endometrial cancer (see section 8.1) as it is assoc iated with a shorter hospital stay, less
postoperative pain and quicker recovery.64
Endometrial ablation has been used as an alternativ e surgical approach to treat endometrial
hyperplasia without atypia and is also effective in reducing heavy menstrual loss.64–66In one
randomised controlled trial, women with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (n = 34)
were randomised to either thermal balloon ablation or progestogen therapy. In the thermal
balloon ablation group, 24% (4/17) failed to regress compared with 35% (6/17) in the oral
progestogen group.67However, complete endometrial destruction cannot be guaranteed
and regeneration of ablated endometrial tissue may occur.68Subsequent endometrial
assessment with hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy may be compromised because of
intrauterine adhesions. Hence, this method cannot be recommended routinely.
8. How should atypical hyperplasia be managed?
8.1 What should the initial management of atypical hyperplasia be? 
Women with atypical hyperplasia should undergo a to tal hysterectomy because of the risk of
underlying malignancy or progression to cancer.
A laparoscopic approach to total hysterectomy is pr eferable to an abdominal approach as it is
associated with a shorter hospital stay, less posto perative pain and quicker recovery.
There is no benefit from intraoperative frozen sect ion analysis of the endometrium or routine 
lymph adenectomy.
Postmenopausal women with atypical hyperplasia shou ld be offered bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
together with the total hysterectomy.

CFor premenopausal women, the decision to remove the ovaries should be individualised; however,
bilateral salpingectomy should be considered as thi s may reduce the risk of a future ovarian
malignancy. 
Endometrial ablation is not recommended because com plete and persistent endometrial destruction
cannot be ensured and intrauterine adhesion formati on may preclude endometrial histological
surveillance.
The risk of developing endometrial cancer is highest in atypical hyperplasia. A case–control
study nested in a cohort of 7947 women diagnosed wi th atypical hyperplasia found that the
cumulative risk of cancer in 4 years was 8% (95% CI 1.31–14.6), which increased to 12.4%
(95% CI 3.0–20.8) after 9 years and to 27.5% (95% C I 8.6–42.5) after 19 years.33Atypical
hyperplasia has also been associated with a rate of concomitant carcinoma of up to 43% in
women undergoing hysterectomy.69
No comparative studies were identified that compare d surgical with fertility-sparing
manage ment for women with atypical hyperplasia. Du e to the risk of underlying malignancy
or progression to cancer, a total hysterectomy is a dvised. The method chosen for
hysterectomy should allow assessment for further di sease if necessary. Minimal access
techniques do allow staging and there is some evidence to suggest that they are beneficial
when done by appro priately trained surgeons. A ran domised trial comparing total
laparoscopic hysterectomy with total abdominal hyst erectomy via a midline incision was
conducted in the Netherlands with 283 women with either stage I endometrial cancer or
atypical hyperplasia.64There was no difference in major complications betw een laparoscopic
and abdominal approaches. However, laparoscopic hysterectomy was superior in terms of
a shorter hospital stay, less pain and quicker resumption of daily activities.64
Due to the risks of disseminating malignancy, morce llation of the uterus should be avoided.
Supracervical hysterectomy should not be performed.63
Intraoperative frozen analysis of the endometrium i s not a reliable indicator of final
pathology in women with a preoperative diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia. Indermaur et al.
performed a retrospective review of frozen and fina l pathology in women with a
preoperative diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia. In 61% (15/23) of the cases, the frozen and
final pathology reports disagreed.70Eight of 14 women (57%) initially diagnosed with
atypical hyperplasia by frozen section were diagnos ed with endometrial cancer on final
pathology.70
Lymphadenectomy should not be routinely performed in atypical hyperplasia because this
would result in unnecessary surgical risk for the majority of women. Although endometrial
cancer has been reported in 43% of cases during hysterectomy, the cancer was usually early
stage with low risk of lymphovascular disease.69
Furthermore, two randomised trials showed no benefi t of routine lymphadenectomy in
early endometrial cancers.71,72
Due to the risk of underlying malignancy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed in all
peri- and postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for atypical hyperplasia. 
However, the evidence is less clear about premenopausal women diagnosed with atypical
hyperplasia and the risks of surgical menopause hav e to be balanced against the risk of
underlying cancer and the need for further surgery to remove the ovaries. The Nurses’

mortality in women aged less than 50 years who had hysterectomy for benign disease.73
Premenopausal women who undergo hysterectomy and bi lateral salpingo-oophorectomy
for endometrial hyperplasia should consider the use of estrogen replacement, in the absence
of contraindications to its use, until the age of the natural menopause to minimise the risks
of surgical menopause. These considerations should be discussed with the woman.
As an alternative to hysterectomy, endometrial abla tion and resection has also 
been reported, although complete endometrial destru ction cannot be guaranteed and
regen eration of ablated endometrial tissue may occur.68,74As with hysterectomy, this is not
a fertility-sparing procedure and intrauterine adhe sion formation can render future
endo metrial surveillance with hysteroscopy and/or endometrial biopsy problematic. 
8.2 How should women with atypical hyperplasia who wish to preserve their fertility or who
are not suitable for surgery be managed?
Women wishing to retain their fertility should be c ounselled about the risks of underlying malignancy
and subsequent progression to endometrial cancer. 
Pretreatment investigations should aim to rule out invasive endometrial cancer or co-existing ovarian
cancer.
Histology, imaging and tumour marker results should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary meeting and
a plan for management and ongoing endometrial surve illance formulated.
First-line treatment with the LNG-IUS should be rec ommended, with oral progestogens as a 
second-best alternative (see section 7.2).
Once fertility is no longer required, hysterectomy should be offered in view of the high risk of disea se
relapse.
Fertility-sparing therapy has been advocated for wo men who desire future fertility or who have medical
comorbidities precluding surgical management. Howev er, women need careful counselling of the
risks involved with this option: co-existent or progression to endometrial cancer, co-existent ovarian
cancer, metastatic disease and death. 
In a systematic review of uncontrolled observationa l studies of women with atypical
hyper plasia, the risk of co-existing ovarian cancer was up to 4%, the risk of progression to
higher than stage I endometrial cancer was about 2% and the risk of metastatic disease and
death was about 0.5%.75Pretreatment investigations were proposed for identifying women
with undiagnosed advanced endometrial or ovarian ca ncer.75The review authors separately
examined women who underwent pretreatment investiga tions (MRI, CT, TVS and serum
CA125) and those who did not.75No significant difference was found in ovarian cancer or
advanced endometrial cancer diagnosis or prevalence of metastasis and death.75
However, in the absence of robust comparative evide nce, investigations prior to fertility-sparing
treatment should be undertaken and these include tumour markers such as CA125 and imaging with
TVS and/or MRI scan to rule out co-existing ovarian cancer and invasive endometrial cancer. 
Several hormonal therapies have been used to treat this group of women and these include oral
progestogens, the LNG-IUS, aromatase inhibitors and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists.

level 2++In a large retrospective cohort study following up 242 women with atypical endometrial
hyperplasia, the risk of progression to cancer was reduced five-fold, from 101.4 to 20.5 per
1000 woman-years, with the use of progestogens.76Interestingly, in this study there were 
22 diagnoses of endometrial cancer and 21 were stag e I (endometrioid grade 1 = 8, 
grade 2 = 6, grade 3 = 1, unknown grade = 4; papillary serous = 2) and one woman was
diagnosed with stage II grade 1 endometrioid cancer.76
To date, there have been no randomised trials comparing different regimens of hormonal treatments.
Several observational studies have reported rates of regression, relapse and progression to
endometrial cancer together with reproductive outco mes following the use of hormonal
therapy. A meta-analysis of observational studies o f fertility-sparing treatment for women
with atypical hyperplasia reported summary rates for disease regression of 85.6%, a relapse
rate of 26% and a live birth rate of 26.3%.75Due to the high relapse rate and because the
primary studies did not engage in long-term follow-up, the authors warn that true relapse
rates may be even higher and advise that once ferti lity is no longer required, a hysterectomy
should be performed. However, the review only repor ted on 151 women from 14 small
noncomparative studies of limited quality with diverse populations and interventions. As a
result, no comparison between treatments was possib le, but oral progestogens and the
LNG-IUS were the most commonly used therapies.75
In summary, fertility-sparing management of atypica l hyperplasia is possible, with one-quarter of
women achieving a live birth, but the evidence is weak and based almost exclusively on small studies.
The safety is uncertain as estimates of cancer diagnosis and stage during follow-up are imprecise. It is
essential that initial diagnosis is confirmed on formal hysteroscopy to minimise the chance of missing
cancer. The optimal treatment regimen is also ill-defined. In addition, the length of follow-up after
fertility-sparing treatment has been short, such that the risk of relapse in the longer term is uncertain.
Careful counselling about the risks of fertility-sp aring treatment is of paramount importance, togethe r
with pretreatment work-up to rule out advanced endometrial or ovarian cancer. Because of the rarity
and complexity of this clinical scenario, gynaecolo gists should seek gynaecological oncology
multidisciplinary advice, where the available histo logy, imaging and tumour markers are examined. The
advice should include a plan for endometrial biopsi es and follow-up, together with a maximum
recom mended duration of fertility-sparing treatment before a hysterectomy is performed. 
8.3 How should women with atypical hyperplasia not und ergoing hysterectomy be followed up?
Routine endometrial surveillance should include end ometrial biopsy. Review schedules should be
individualised and be responsive to changes in a wo man’s clinical condition. Review intervals should
be every 3 months until two consecutive negative bi opsies are obtained.
In asymptomatic women with a uterus and evidence of histological disease regression, based upon a
minimum of two consecutive negative endometrial bio psies, long-term follow-up with endometrial
biopsy every 6–12 months is recommended until a hys terectomy is performed.
The follow-up should be customised to each woman, t aking into account baseline risk
factors, associated symptoms and response to treatm ent. Obesity is associated with a 
higher risk of failure to regress and relapse and should be taken into consideration when
arranging follow-up.59,77This is best decided in the context of a gynaecolog ical oncology
multidisciplinary meeting and women who decline or are unfit to undergo a hysterectomy
can be considered for discussion.

level 2+The minimum investigations required to monitor the endometrium during follow-up include a
detailed history for the presence of symptoms and s igns suggestive of progressive disease, pelvic
examination and an endometrial biopsy. Hysteroscopy should be considered where an endometrial
biopsy cannot be satisfactorily obtained or where sampling is nondiagnostic. TVS has a role in ruling
out ovarian disease if this has not already been pe rformed, although assessment of endometrial
thickness is unlikely to be useful in view of the a bsence of validated reference ranges and the diffic ulty
in obtaining accurate measurements with the LNG-IUS in place. There are no data to support the
routine use of MRI or CT during follow-up.
The optimal follow-up schedule is unknown, but in v iew of the risk of progression to
endometrial cancer and in the absence of research data, most clinicians would recommend
endometrial evaluation every 3 months initially,78until two consecutive negative biopsies are
obtained.47
Failure of atypical endometrial hyperplasia to regr ess is a worrying sign for underlying
endometrial cancer. If fertility-sparing therapy fa ils to induce regression of atypical
hyperplasia by 12 months or there is evidence of progression to cancer, women should be
strongly recommended to undergo hysterectomy.75The risk of relapse is especially high in
the first 2 years from diagnosis. If relapse occurs during follow-up, women should also be
advised to undergo hysterectomy as it is often asso ciated with endometrial cancer at the
final hysterectomy specimen.75
If this is not possible or declined, a further cycl e of progestogen treatment can be attempted.
In a study of 33 women with relapsed atypical hyper plasia, 85% (28/33) regressed following
retreatment with oral medroxyprogesterone given for 6 months.79Beyond 2 years, in
asymptomatic women with a uterus and histologically regressed disease, recourse to annual
follow-up with endometrial biopsy was advised.79
9. How should endometrial hyperplasia be managed in women wishing to conceive?
Disease regression should be achieved on at least o ne endometrial sample before women attempt to
conceive.
Women with endometrial hyperplasia who wish to conc eive should be referred to a fertility specialist
to discuss the options for attempting conception, f urther assessment and appropriate treatment.
Assisted reproduction may be considered as the live birth rate is higher and it may prevent relapse
compared with women who attempt natural conception.
Prior to assisted reproduction, regression of endom etrial hyperplasia should be achieved as this is
associated with higher implantation and clinical pr egnancy rates. 
Women with endometrial hyperplasia who wish to conc eive should be followed up to
ensure disease regression. Once regression of the e ndometrial hyperplasia is achieved,
women can be advised to attempt natural conception. However, as a hyperplastic
endometrium may predispose women to infertility, an early referral for fertility specialist
consultation can be offered as per national recomme ndations.80Obese women should aim
for a BMI of less than 30.80
A meta-analysis of observational studies has report ed the live birth rates of 126 women who
had fertility-sparing treatment for atypical hyperplasia. The study found that the live birth
rate was 26.3% (31/126).75The live birth rate for women appeared to be higher with assisted

level 2++reproductive technology compared with natural conce ption following regression of atypical
hyperplasia or well-differentiated endometrial cancer.75However, it was often not reported
in the primary studies exactly how many women were actively trying to conceive naturally.
Indirect comparison showed this difference between assisted reproduction and natural
conception to be statistically significant ( P= 0.001).75Immediate assisted reproductive
technology avoids a prolonged interval of time with out progestogen treatment, which could
cause women to relapse. A decision to initiate assisted reproduction immediately following
cessation of progestogen treatment should be made within a multidisciplinary team setting
taking into account risks of disease progression and fertility prospects.
Relevant to women with endometrial hyperplasia with out atypia, a small randomised
controlled trial was performed in women with simple hyperplasia and PCOS undergoing 
in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The trial compared LN G-IUS treatment with observation alone
and found that women treated with the LNG-IUS were more likely to achieve regression
(88% versus 15%) and also had higher implantation ( 29% versus 17%, P <0.05) and clinical
pregnancy rates (46% versus 28%, P <0.05) following IVF treatment. None of the women
in the LNG-IUS group progressed to worsening hyperp lasia but three women progressed in
the observation-alone group.81
A hysterectomy should be recommended to women with atypical endometrial hyperplasia
once fertility is no longer required because of the high relapse rate of disease and the
potential for disease progression (see section 8.2).75
10. HRT and endometrial hyperplasia 
Systemic estrogen-only HRT should not be used in wo men with a uterus.
All women taking HRT should be encouraged to report any unscheduled vaginal bleeding promptly. 
Women with endometrial hyperplasia taking a sequent ial HRT preparation who wish to continue HRT
should be advised to change to continuous progestog en intake using the LNG-IUS or a continuous
combined HRT preparation. Subsequent management sho uld be as described in the preceding sections
of the guideline. 
Women with endometrial hyperplasia taking a continu ous combined preparation who wish to continue
HRT should have their need to continue HRT reviewed . Discuss the limitations of the available evidence
regarding the optimal progestogen regimen in this c ontext. Consider using the LNG-IUS as a source of
progestogen replacement. Subsequent management shou ld be as described in the preceding sections
of the guideline.
A Cochrane review of randomised trials has shown a significantly increased risk of
hyperplasia with unopposed estrogen replacement therapy for 2 to 3 years, with evidence
of a dose–response relationship.9The addition of a progestogen (a minimum of 1 mg/day
norethisterone or 1.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone) t o the unopposed estrogen
replace ment therapy resulted in fewer cases of end ometrial hyperplasia when either
sequential or continuous combined HRT regimens were adopted.9
The Cochrane review pointed towards a reduced cumul ative endometrial hyperplasia
prevalence at 3 years of follow-up with continuous combined HRT compared with sequential
regimens, but this difference did not reach statist ical significance (Peto OR 0.23, 95% CI
0.05–1.02).9

level 1++All women taking HRT should report any unscheduled vaginal bleeding promptly and be referred for
further investigation.
In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventi ons (PEPI) trial, 45 women were
diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia on sequentia l HRT. The HRT was stopped and most
women were treated with oral progestogens, from whi ch 94% (34/36) achieved regression.82
In a large observational study, there were no cases of endometrial hyperplasia in 526 women
on continuous combined HRT. However, there were 21 cases of hyperplasia without atypia
among 360 women who had been taking sequential comb ined HRT. The hyperplasia
regressed to normal endometrium when women were cha nged to continuous combined
HRT preparations.83An observational study included 2028 women who at entry point were
either taking sequential HRT or were not on HRT. Al l women were given or switched to
continuous combined HRT and endometrial response wa s assessed 9 months later. The
study showed no increase in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with continuous combined
HRT and showed conversion of the endometrium back t o normal in women who had
hyperplasia on sequential HRT at entry to the study .84A further study showed similar findings
and included 22 women with hyperplasia with or without atypia at entry. All cases reverted
back to normal histology within 6 months of continuous combined HRT treatment.85
Stopping sequential combined HRT may be sufficient to induce regression of endometrial hyperplasia.
Subsequent management should be as described in the preceding sections of this guideline, in
accordance with the particular histological classification of hyperplasia. Further research is needed to
evaluate the effect on the hyperplastic process of changing or supplementing a combined HRT regimen
with local progestogens delivered via the LNG-IUS or whether combined HRT can be safely restarted
once hyperplasia has regressed. 
11. How should endometrial hyperplasia be managed in women on adjuvant treatment for
breast cancer? 
11.1 What is the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia on adjuvant treatment for breast
cancer?
Women taking tamoxifen should be informed about the increased risks of developing endometrial
hyperplasia and cancer. They should be encouraged t o report any abnormal vaginal bleeding or
discharge promptly.
Women taking aromatase inhibitors (such as anastroz ole, exemestane and letrozole) should be
informed that these medications are not known to in crease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and
cancer. 
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulato r that inhibits proliferation of breast
cancer by competitive antagonism at estrogen receptors. However, it has a partial agonist
action on other tissues, including the vagina and t he uterus. This estrogenic effect may
promote the development of fibroids, endometrial polyps and hyperplasia86,87and increase
the risk of endometrial cancer.88,89The risk increases with both dose and duration of
treatment.88,89Women taking tamoxifen should be informed of these risks and advised to
contact their doctor promptly if they experience abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge.90
The ability of tamoxifen to induce endometrial canc er and other pathologies varies between
pre- and postmenopausal women. The National Surgica l Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1), which compared tamoxifen with placebo in women at
high risk of breast cancer, reported that the risk of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users

level 1+was not statistically significant in women aged 49 years or younger (risk ratio 1.42, 95% CI
0.55–3.81), but that there was a statistically significant increase in risk in women aged 50
years or older (risk ratio 5.33, 95% CI 2.47–13.17).89
Aromatase inhibitors inhibit estrogen synthesis in the peripheral tissues and have a similar
tumour-regressing effect to tamoxifen. A Cochrane review has included randomised trials
comparing aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, used for
adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer with other endocrine therapies and found that they
do not increase the risk of endometrial pathology or vaginal bleeding.91
Aromatase inhibitors have also been explored as a t reatment option for endometrial
hyperplasia in small observational studies with varied success.92,93
11.2 Should women on tamoxifen be treated with prophylactic progestogen therapy?
There is evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents polyp f ormation and that it reduces the incidence of
endometrial hyperplasia in women on tamoxifen. The effect of the LNG-IUS on breast cancer recurrence
risk remains uncertain so its routine use cannot be recommended.
A 2009 Cochrane review found that the LNG-IUS reduc ed the incidence of new endometrial
polyps in women on tamoxifen for breast cancer over a 1-year period (Peto OR 0.14, 95%
CI 0.03–0.61).94There was no clear evidence that the LNG-IUS preven ted endometrial
hyperplasia or cancer in these women.94An updated subgroup analysis has confirmed that
endometrial hyperplasia is reduced as well as endometrial polyp formation.95
A randomised controlled trial has compared the prop hylactic use of the LNG-IUS to prevent
endometrial pathology with a control group in women prior to starting tamoxifen therapy
for breast cancer. Although use of the LNG-IUS significantly reduced de novo endometrial
polyp formation over a 5-year follow-up period, its impact on preventing endometrial
hyperplasia remained unclear because no cases were diagnosed in either group. There was
no statistically significant increase in breast cancer recurrence rate for those treated with a
LNG-IUS compared with untreated controls (17.2% versus 10.0%) or cancer-related deaths
(10.3% versus 8.3%), but the study was underpowered.96
A small observational study did not find an increas ed risk of breast cancer recurrence
associated with use of the LNG-IUS.97
11.3 How should women who develop endometrial hyperplasia while on tamoxifen treatment
for breast cancer be managed?
The need for tamoxifen should be reassessed and man agement should be according to the histological
classification of endometrial hyperplasia and in co njunction with the woman’s oncologist.
The partial agonist action of tamoxifen in the geni tal tract is associated with an increased risk
of endometrial cancer.88,89
In the presence of hyperplasia, it is presumed that this risk is even higher, although we found no
studies addressing this issue. Therefore, the use o f tamoxifen should be reassessed in conjunction
with the woman’s oncologist and an alternative trea tment sought if appropriate. In the absence of
evidence specific to this group of women, it is reasonable to treat them according to their histological
classification of hyperplasia.

Complete removal of the uterine polyp(s) is recomme nded and an endometrial biopsy should be
obtained to sample the background endometrium.
Subsequent management should be according to the hi stological classification of endometrial
hyperplasia. 
Endometrial polyps are discrete overgrowths of endometrium and atypia may be restricted
to foci within the polyp. In the absence of background endometrial hyperplasia, it seems
reasonable to assume that removal of the polyp may be curative. However, there is very little
evidence to help guide the management of these wome n. There has been only a small quasi-
randomised trial of 21 women, which compared use of the LNG-IUS with no treatment after
removal of polyps with focal atypical hyperplasia.98They found that after 5 years’ follow-up
there was no recurrence of atypia in either group.98
It is also important to ensure that histological analysis of the background endometrium is
performed even if the endometrium looks healthy on hysteroscopy. In a small observational
study, 52% (14/27) of women had endometrial hyperplasia concurrently in a polyp and the
background endometrium.99Women with atypical hyperplasia in a polyp were sli ghtly more
likely to have hyperplasia in the surrounding endom etrium than those with hyperplasia
without atypia.99Evidence level 3
Following removal of the polyp, management should be according to the histological classification of
endometrial hyperplasia.
13. Recommendations for future research
●The role of clinical factors and biomarkers in the diagnosis and follow-up of endometrial
hyper plasia.
●The effect of weight loss, community-based obesity services, lifestyle programmes and bariatric
surgery on regression of endometrial hyperplasia.
●The optimal duration of oral and local progestogen treatment for endometrial hyperplasia to
induce and maintain disease regression.
●Evaluation of endometrial surveillance regimens.
●Prospective long-term follow-up of women observed o r treated for endometrial hyperplasia to
provide more precise estimates of the natural history of endometrial disease and to delineate risk
factors predictive of disease persistence, progression and relapse.
●The role of the LNG-IUS in HRT-associated endometri al hyperplasia and whether it is safe to restart
HRT once hyperplasia has been successfully treated.
14. Auditable topics
●100% of women with endometrial hyperplasia with a BMI greater than 30 should be advised to 
lose weight.
●100% of women with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia should have at least two negative
endometrial biopsies prior to discharge.
●100% of postmenopausal women with atypical hyperplasia should undergo a total hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy if not medically contraindicated.

DBAAppendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in
making decisions about appropriate treatment for sp ecific conditions’. Each guideline is systematical ly
developed using a standardised methodology. Exact d etails of this process can be found in Clinical
Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website
at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These recommendations are not intended to dictat e
an exclusive course of management or treatment. The y must be evaluated with reference to individual
patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations .
It is hoped that this process of local ownership wi ll help to incorporate these guidelines into routin e
practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical u ncertainty where further research may be indicated. 
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations
formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.Appendix II: Algorithm for the management of endometrial hyperpl asia

a. Risk factors include obesity, HRT regimens, tamoxifen therapy and anovulation.
b. Consider ovarian conservation according to age, me nopausal status and patient
preferences. In addition to nonregression of EH or persistence of AUB symptoms
following nonsurgical treatments, a total hysterect omy may be indicated where there are
(i) adverse effects associated with medical treatment, (ii) concerns over compliance with
treatment or follow-up, or (iii) patient preferences e.g. high levels of anxiety. 
c. The follow-up interval should be customised to eac h woman, taking into account baseline
risk factors, associated symptoms and response to treatment.
d. Regression – nonhyperplastic or nonmalignant endom etrial sample or nondiagnostic
endometrial sample from an appropriately placed end ometrial sampling device;
persistence – no regression or progression of initial EH subtype after 3 or more months;
progression – development of AH or EC; relapse – recurrence of EH or AH after one or
more negative EB result(s). 
e. In general, advise continuation of the LNG-IUS for the duration of its 5-year use,
especially if EH associated with AUB or other basel ine risk factorsaand no adverse effects.
f. Start medical management if EH not treated initia lly. The decision to persist with medical
management should be taken after careful consideration and thorough discussion with
the woman regarding the risks and benefits of prolonged medical treatment compared
with total hysterectomy with or without BSO. Persis tence beyond 12 months is associated
with a significant risk of underlying malignancy and a high risk of failure to regress such
that a total hysterectomy with or without BSO should be recommended.
g. At discharge, inform the woman of her estimated in dividual risk of recurrence, of the
need to continue any risk-reducing strategies and to present for an urgent review if any
further episodes of AUB.
h. Review the appropriateness of ongoing endometrial surveillance, continuation of medical
management or total hysterectomy with or without BS O based on factors such as baseline
risk factors including BMI, AUB symptoms, fertility requirements, compliance with
treatment and follow-up, medical comorbidities and risk–benefit ratio for total
hysterectomy with or without BSO. Abbreviations:

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical
practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for
consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate
judgement regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other
attendant in the light of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not
intended to be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local
prescriptive protocols or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the
relevant decision is taken.This guideline was produced on behalf of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the
