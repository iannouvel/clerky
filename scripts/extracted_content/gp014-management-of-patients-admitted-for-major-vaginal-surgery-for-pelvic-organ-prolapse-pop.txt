OBJECTIVE STANDARDS 
 
1.0 PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE 
 
1.0.1 Vaginal wall prolapse or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the herniation 
of the bladder, rectum or uterus due to a failure of ligamentous & 
fascial support of these organs. 
 
1.0.2 It is a common problem. In the women’s health initiative (WHI) trial in 
the USA 40% of the participants had some degree of prolapse, 14 % of 
them had uterine prolapse. In UK, it accounts for 20% of women 
waiting for gynaecology surgery. 
 
1.0.3 Major vaginal surgery for POP includes vaginal hysterectomy (VH) +/ - 
anterior or posterior vaginal wall repair or both. It also includes surgical 
treatment for vault prolapse in the form of vaginal sacrospinous fixation 
(VSSF) or vaginal mesh. 
 
1.0.4 This gui deline should be read in conjunction with other guidelines 
relating to the management of patients admitted for operative 
procedures, such as thromboprophylaxis and consent guidelines.

1.1 PRE-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT 
 
1.1.1 Not all cases admitted for major vaginal surgery (VH, V SSF, vaginal 
mesh) will require rectal enema or perineal shaving. 
 
1.1.2 These patients need to be fasted for 6 hours before the operation. 
 
1.1.3 The patient will ha ve the routine observations, routine checks and the 
routine enhanced recovery programme (ERP). 
 
1.1.4 Enhanced Recovery Programme . http://nww.bsuh.nhs.uk/the -
trust/safety -and-quality/safety/initiatives/enhanced -recovery -
programme/ 
 
1.1.5 The patient will be seen by the consultant gynaecologist and 
anaesthetist for preoperative counselling and consenting. Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust 6

1.2 POST -OPERATIVE BLADDER CARE 
 
1.2.1 Some of the major vaginal surgery (VH, VSSF or vaginal mesh) will 
have Foley’s catheter and vaginal pack inserted unless it is stated 
clearly in the post-operative care plan. 
 
1.2.2 The vaginal pack and Foley’s catheter are to be removed the early 
morning after the operation according to the ERP, unless otherwise is 
stated clearly in the post-operative care plan. 
 
1.2.3 Ensure that the patient passes urine 6 hours after catheter removal of 
the catheter. If the patient is comfortable but is no t able to pass urine 
then give her another 2 hours and try again. 
 
1.2.4 If this is not successful then insert a F oley’s catheter with a flip flow 
valve and leave it in for 48 hours then try without a cathet er (TWC). 
 
1.2.5 If the patient is still unable to pass urine she could go home with the 
catheter in and should be reassured that this is a rare complication and 
is self-limiting in most cases and TCI to try without catheter (TWC) a 
week later. 
 
1.2.6 No need for bladder scan, especially if the patient passes more than 
200- 250mls of urine. 
 
1.2.7 If there is still voiding difficulty after a week, then leave the catheter 
with valve for another week or teach the patient intermittent clean self-
catheterisation (ICSC) under the care community continence nurses or 
urology nurse specialist at BSUH and review the nurse weekly until the 
problem resolves. 
 
1.2.8 Please keep the surgeon informed. 

1.3 POST -OPERATIVE PRESCRIPTION AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
1.3.1 The patient can have sips of flu id once she is fully conscious and has 
been assessed by the nursing staff. 
 
1.3.2 Ensure that the patient gets adequate thromboprophylaxis (usually 
below knee elastic stocking and Tinzaparin according to the local 
protocol) and adequate analgesia 
 
1.3.3 Routine post-operative observations. 
 
1.3.4 The intravenous fluids and patient controlled analgesia pump may be 
removed the following day once the patient has been reviewed in the Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust 7
