Guideline 
 
1.0 Aim 
 
To provide clear guidance for all staff caring for women with suspected or proven pelvic 
inflammatory disease (PID). 
 
2.0 Scope 
 
This guideline applies to: 
• A&E staff 
• Gynaecology Staff 
• Women’s Health doctors 
• Sexual Health staff 
 
3.0 Responsibilities 
• Medical and Nursing Staff are responsible to acces s, read, understand and follow 
this guidance and to use their own professional jud gement in the application of this 
guidance. 
• Management have a responsibility to ensure the gui deline is accessible to all 
relevant staff. 
 
4.0 Introduction 
 
Pelvic inflammatory disease is a result of endocerv ical infection causing endometritis, 
salpingitis, parametritis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess or pelvic peritonitis. Causative 
agents can be Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycop lasma genitalium or 
anaerobes. Delays in receiving appropriate treatmen t can lead to sequelae such as 
infertility, chronic pain and ectopic pregnancy. 
 
5.0 Risk Factors 
• Age – peak between 15 to 24 years old 
• Untreated partner 
• Recent change in partner 
• Sexual activity 
• Past history of PID/STD 
• Recent IUCD insertion 
• Recent termination of pregnancy 
• Recent instrumentation of the uterus 
 
6.0 Clinical features of PID 
 
• Bilateral lower abdominal tenderness with possible radiation to the legs 
• Abnormal vaginal discharge 
• Pyrexia >38C 
• Abnormal vaginal bleeding - inter-menstrual or pos t-coital bleeding or breakthrough 
bleeding whilst on oral contraceptive pill (OCP) 
• Deep dyspareunia 
• Cervical and/or adnexal excitation 
• Palpable mass 
 
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Guideline. Version 1 1 st November 2013 
Page 5 of 9 7.0 Differential Diagnoses 
 
• Ectopic pregnancy 
• Appendicitis 
• Endometriosis 
• Irritable bowel syndrome or gastro-intestinal comp laints 
• Ovarian accident such as cyst torsion or rupture 
• Urinary tract infection 
• Chronic cyclical pelvic pain syndrome 
 
8.0 Investigations 
 
• FBC looking for leukocytosis 
• Raised CRP or ESR 
• Trans-vaginal ultrasound may aid diagnosis, especi ally when supported by power 
Doppler identifying inflamed and dilated tubes and tubo-ovarian masses. 
• High vaginal, endocervical & Chlamydia swabs. It i s not a prerequisite to swab prior to 
the initiation of treatment; however a positive res ult would necessitate treatment of 
sexual partners. Absence of confirmed cultures does not exclude PID. 
 
There is limited evidence for CT and MRI 
 
9.0 Management 
 
9.1 Outpatient 
 
Delaying treatment will likely increase the severit y of the condition and increase the risk of 
long term sequelae. Therefore a low threshold for e mpiric treatment of PID is 
recommended. 
 
Outpatient antibiotic therapy 
Stat dose IM Ceftriaxone 500mg, 
po Doxycycline 100mg bd for 14 days & 
po Metronidazole 400mg bd for 14 days 
OR po Ofloxacin 400mg BD & 
po Metronidazole 400mg bd for 14 days 
 
Women should be counselled on the side effects of t reatment, the risks to future fertility 
and the need of use of barrier contraception. She w ill need to be counselled that sexual 
partners will need screening to reduce risk of re-i nfection. 
 
9.2 Inpatient 
 
Hospital admission may be required if 
• there is a lack of response to oral therapy, 
• surgical intervention may be required eg drainage of tubo-ovarian abscess, 
• there is clinical evidence of severe disease or th e presence of a tubo-ovarian 
abscess, 
• intolerance to oral therapy and 
• pregnancy 
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Guideline. Version 1 1 st November 2013 
Page 6 of 9 
Inpatient antibiotic therapy 
IV Ceftriaxone 2g OD & 
po Doxycycline 100mg BD & 
po Metronidazole 400mg bd 
Converted to outpatient therapy for 14 days total 
OR IV Clindamycin 900mg TDS & 
IV Gentamicin (2mg/kg loading dose) followed by 1.5mg/kg 3 times daily – 
converted to PO Clindamycin 450mg QDS for 14 days t otal OR 
po Doxycycline 100mg bd and po Metronidazole 400mg bd for 14 days 
 
IV antibiotic therapy should be continued until 24 hours after clinical improvement. 
Appropriate analgesia should be provided. 
 
Laparoscopy maybe required for adhesiolysis or the drainage of a pelvic abscess. 
 
Patients should be advised to avoid unprotected int ercourse until both them, and their 
partner(s), have completed treatment and follow-up. 
A detailed explanation of their condition with part icular emphasis on the long term 
implications for the health of themselves and their partner(s) should be provided, 
reinforced with clear and accurate written informat ion 
(http://www.bashh.org/documents/4238.pdf ) 
 
10.0 PID in pregnancy 
 
A pregnancy test should be performed on all women w ho have suspected PID to exclude 
an ectopic pregnancy. PID is associated with signif icant maternal and fetal morbidity 
therefore initial parental therapy is advised. 
 
The risk of giving the recommended antibiotic regim en in very early pregnancy is low and 
likely results in failed implantation [UK National Teratology Information Service]. 
 
PID is rare in pregnancy. Drugs toxic in pregnancy, such as Tetracycline should be 
avoided. There are insufficient data from clinical trials to recommend a specific regimen 
and empirical therapy with agents effective against Gonorrhoea, Chlamydia and anaerobic 
infections should be considered taking into account local antibiotic sensitivity patterns (e.g. 
Ceftriaxone plus oral or IV Erythromycin with the p ossible addition of oral or IV 
Metronidazole 500mg tds in clinically severe diseas e). 
 
11.0 Complications 
 
Women with HIV may develop more severe symptoms ass ociated with PID but respond 
well to standard antibiotic therapy. No change in t reatment recommendations compared to 
HIV uninfected patients is required. 
 
Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome comprises of abdominal pa in with peri-hepatitis, peri-
appendicitis or peri-sigmoiditis, in women with PID . 
 
Women with PID and an IUCD, without symptomatic imp rovement after 72 hours may 
require the IUCD to be removed. The decision to rem ove the IUCD needs to be balanced 
against the risk of pregnancy in those who have had otherwise unprotected intercourse in 
the preceding 7 days. Hormonal emergency contracept ion may be appropriate for some 
women in this situation. 
 
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Guideline. Version 1 1 st November 2013 
Page 7 of 9 12.0 Sexual Partners 
 
Partners should be contacted and advised to attend their nearest Sexual Health Clinic for 
appropriate investigation and treatment. A complete d referral form (Appendix A) should be 
faxed to the nearest sexual health clinic. 
 
Partners should avoid sexual intercourse until the course of treatment has been 
completed. 

13.0 Follow up 
 
A review at 72 hours is recommended if a woman pres ents with a moderate to severe 
presentation of PID, to evaluate for clinical impro vement. 
 
Further review at the Fletcher Unit, Chichester or Worthing Sexual Health or Central Clinic 
may be necessary to ensure antibiotic compliance, a dequate clinical response, screening 
and treatment of sexual contacts and exclude pregna ncy (Appendix 1). 
 
Persisting infections may require repeat testing fo r Chlamydia or gonorrhoea.
