External Cephalic Version and Reducing the Incidence of Term Breech
Presentation
This is the second edition of this guideline originally published in 2006.
Executive summary of recommendations
External cephalic version (ECV)
How effective is ECV in preventing noncephalic birth?
Women should be informed that the success rate of ECV is approximately 50%.A
Women should be informed that after an unsuccessful ECV attempt at 36+0weeks of gestation
or later, only a few babies presenting by the breech will spontaneously turn to cephalicpresentation. [ New 2017 ]B
Women should be informed that few babies revert to breech after successful ECV. [ New 2017 ]B
Women should be informed that a successful ECV reduces the chance of caesarean section.A
Does ECV affect the outcome of labour?
Women should be informed that labour after ECV is associated with a slightly increased rate of
caesarean section and instrumental delivery when compared with spontaneous cephalicpresentation.B
Can the success of an ECV attempt be predicted?
ECV success can be predicted to some extent, but the use of models to predict success shouldnot be used routinely to determine whether ECV can be attempted. [ New 2017 ]B
What methods can be used to improve the success rate of ECV?
Use of tocolysis with betamimetics improves the success rates of ECV.A
Routine use of regional analgesia or neuraxial blockade is not recommended, but may be
considered for a repeat attempt or for women unable to tolerate ECV without analgesia.[New 2017 ]B

1. Purpose and scope
External cephalic version (ECV) is the manipulation of the fetus, through the maternal abdomen, to a cephalic
presentation. The purpose of this guideline is to describe and summarise the best evidence concerning methods toprevent noncephalic presentation at delivery and therefore, caesarean section and its sequelae. The evidenceconcerning mode and technique of the delivery of breech presentation is summarised in the Royal College ofObstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guideline No. 20b Management of Breech Presentation .
1
2. Introduction and background epidemiology
Breech presentation complicates 3 –4% of term deliveries and is more common in nulliparous women and in preterm
deliveries. Following the publication of the Term Breech Trial,2there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of
women undergoing vaginal breech birth.3In many countries, including the UK, planned vaginal breech birth remains
rare and attempts to prevent breech presentation at delivery remain important.
3. Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence
This guideline was developed using standard methodology for developing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The
Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews ofEffects [DARE] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), EMBASE, MEDLINE and Tripwere searched for relevant papers. The search was inclusive of all relevant articles published between August 2005and April 2016. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including allsubheadings and synonyms, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included ‘breech’, ‘breechnear presentation’, ‘breech presentation’, ‘breech near delivery’, ‘breech delivery’, ‘breech presentation and delivery’,‘breech near extraction’, ‘breech extraction’, ‘Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit’, ‘Burns-Marshall’, ‘after-coming head’ and‘external cephalic version’. The search was limited to studies on humans and papers in the English language. Relevantguidelines were also searched for using the same criteria in the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the NationalInstitute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Evidence Search.
Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence. Areas lacking evidence are highlighted and
annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix I.

4. External cephalic version (ECV)
4.1 How effective is ECV in preventing noncephalic birth?
Women should be informed that the success rate of ECV is approximately 50%.A
Women should be informed that after an unsuccessful ECV attempt at 36+0weeks of gestation
or later, only a few babies presenting by the breech will spontaneously turn to cephalicpresentation.B
Women should be informed that few babies revert to breech after successful ECV.B
Women should be informed that a successful ECV reduces the chance of caesarean section.A
A systematic review of eight trials including 1308 women demonstrated that ECV at term reduces
noncephalic presentation at delivery (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 –0.61).4Evidence
level 1 ++
Success rates of ECV vary, but in a large series, 47% of women following an ECV attempt had a cephalic
presentation at birth.5Overall success levels are greater for multiparous women (60%) than for nulliparous
women (40%).6
Spontaneous version from breech to cephalic is unusual at term7and occurs in only 8% of primigravid
women after 36 weeks of gestation.8Where ECV at term has been unsuccessful, two large series9,10
demonstrated that only 3 –7% of babies will spontaneously turn to cephalic presentation. Spontaneous
reversion to breech after a successful ECV is rare, occurring in only 3% in the largest of the series thatassessed this.
10Evidence
level 2 +
A systematic review demonstrated that attempting ECV at term reduces the chance of caesarean section
(RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 –0.82).4Evidence
level 1 ++
4.2 Does ECV affect the outcome of labour?
Women should be informed that labour after ECV is associated with a slightly increased rate of
caesarean section and instrumental delivery when compared with spontaneous cephalicpresentation.B
In a systematic review of three cohort and eight case –control studies, de Hundt et al.11concluded that even after
successful ECV, women remained at increased risk of caesarean delivery (when compared with babies that havebeen cephalic) for both obstructed labour (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6 –3.0) and fetal distress (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6 –2.9).
There is also an increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 –1.7). The risk of caesarean
delivery may be greater with a shorter ECV to labour interval.

4.3 Can the success of an ECV attempt be predicted?
ECV success can be predicted to some extent, but the use of models to predict success should
not be used routinely to determine whether ECV can be attempted.B
Success rates depend on multiple variables. It is likely that case selection considerably affects success rates.
In a meta-analysis, Kok et al.13showed that multiparity (OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.3 –2.8), nonengagement of the
breech (OR 9.4, 95% CI 6.3 –14), use of tocolysis (OR 18, 95% CI 12 –29), a palpable fetal head
(OR 6.3, 95% CI 4.3 –9.2) and a maternal weight of less than 65 kg (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 –2.6) were
predictors for successful ECV. Other factors, such as posterior placental location (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 –2.4),
complete breech position (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9 –2.8) and an amniotic ﬂuid index greater than 10
(OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 –2.1), are also predictors for successful ECV.14There are limited data to suggest that
estimated fetal weight affects success rates.Evidence
level 2 ++
Models have been developed15,16to predict ECV success; different strategies are summarised by Leung and
Lau.17These models are of insufﬁcient predictive value to alter practice and, given the beneﬁts and safety
of ECV, a low probability of success should not prevent an attempt.Evidence
level 2 +
4.4 What methods can be used to improve the success rate of ECV?
Use of tocolysis with betamimetics improves the success rates of ECV.A
Routine use of regional analgesia or neuraxial blockade is not recommended, but may be
considered for a repeat attempt or for women unable to tolerate ECV without analgesia.B
A 2015 Cochrane review18concluded that betamimetics are the best evaluated of all tocolytics, and
increased cephalic presentation in labour (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14 –2.48) and reduced the number of
caesarean sections (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 –0.88). The effect applied to both multiparous and nulliparous
women.
There is inadequate information comparing different betamimetic drugs on the success rates of ECV.
Wilcox et al.,19in a systematic review of three studies (n =176), found no evidence to support the use of
nifedipine as a tocolytic. There are insufﬁcient data to support the use of nifedipine or atosiban comparedwith betamimetics.
18In a randomised controlled trial of 59 women, intravenous glyceryl trinitrate was
inferior to subcutaneous terbutaline for tocolysis.20Evidence
level 1 /C0
Betamimetic drugs may be administered routinely, reserved for where the uterus is tense or for where a
previous attempt without tocolysis has been unsuccessful. A signiﬁcant reduction in the incidence ofcaesarean (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 –0.80) has been demonstrated with the administration of betamimetic
drugs where a previous attempt without tocolysis has been unsuccessful.
21Evidence
level 1 +
A pragmatic regimen consists of 250 micrograms of salbutamol in 25 ml of normal saline (10 micrograms/ml) by slow
intravenous injection, or 250 micrograms of terbutaline subcutaneously.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Betamimetics should not be used in women with signiﬁcant cardiac disease or hypertension, and will not
be effective in those taking beta-blockers. Maternal palpitations,20tachycardia, ﬂushing, tremor and
occasional nausea may be experienced.Evidence
level 3
Regional anaesthesia requires less force22and may reduce failure rates,23–25particularly in conjunction with
tocolysis (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 –0.86).18The effect of regional anaesthesia on caesarean section rates,
however, is less clear.26Nevertheless, previous studies of neuraxial block report wide variations in
technique and sensory block targets;27anaesthetic doses might be more effective than analgesic doses.
There is no evidence that complication rates of ECV are higher when regional anaesthesia has been used.25
Regional blockade for ECV should not be used routinely, but may be considered for women unable totolerate the procedure. Some women might be helped by the use of clinical hypnosis prior to ECV.
28Evidence
level 2 +
4.5 When should ECV be offered?
ECV should be offered at term from 37+0weeks of gestation.B
In nulliparous women, ECV may be offered from 36+0weeks of gestation./check
Gestation (at term) does not appear to affect success rates.13There is no upper gestation limit for when
ECV can be offered, but contraindications may be more common.Evidence
level 2 +
Hutton et al.,29using ECV at 34 –35+6weeks of gestation compared with 37 weeks of gestation or after,
found a reduced rate of noncephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 –0.90), but no signiﬁcant
effect on caesarean section rates (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 –1.00). A systematic review, however, conﬁrmed a
signiﬁcant increase in preterm births (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 –2.21).30There is no clear beneﬁt to ECV prior
to 36 weeks of gestation.Evidence
level 1 +
In nulliparous women who have a low chance of spontaneous version, ECV from 36+0weeks of gestation
seems pragmatic; spontaneous version in multiparous women is more common.7Evidence
level 2 +
There is a paucity of data on intrapartum ECV, but success has been reported.31,32Intrapartum ECV may
be considered if informed consent is possible, providing the membranes are intact and no contraindicationsexist (see section 4.6).Evidence
level 3
With an unstable lie, ECV is reasonable in the course of a stabilising induction. There are limited data on this
procedure, but potential risks include cord prolapse, transverse lie in labour and fetal heart rate abnormalities. ECVshould only be performed if there is a valid indication for induction.
4.6 What are the contraindications to ECV?
There is no general consensus on the eligibility for, or contraindications to, ECV.C
Women should be informed that ECV after one caesarean delivery appears to have no greater
risk than with an unscarred uterus.C

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
There is limited evidence concerning contraindications for ECV. Only placental abruption, severe pre-
eclampsia, and abnormal fetal Doppler or cardiotocography (CTG) are supported by any evidence.33
ECV is contraindicated where an absolute reason for caesarean section already exists (e.g. placenta praeviamajor). It is generally considered to be contraindicated in a multiple pregnancy (except after delivery of aﬁrst twin), where there is rhesus isoimmunisation, current or recent (less than 1 week) vaginal bleeding,abnormal electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), rupture of the membranes, or where the mother declines oris unable to give informed consent. ECV should be performed with additional caution where there isoligohydramnios or hypertension.
33Evidence
level 4
The role of ECV with a previous caesarean section has been controversial. The largest analysis compared
70 ECVs performed in women with previous caesarean section with 387 ECVs performed in othermultiparous women
34and concluded that ECV is safe and successful in women with one previous
caesarean delivery as with other multiparous women. In this series, and in another prospective series, nocomplications and no cases of uterine rupture were reported in the previous caesarean section cohort.
10
There are insufﬁcient numbers to determine the low risk of uterine rupture.Evidence
level 2 +
4.7 What are the risks of ECV?
Women should be counselled that with appropriate precautions, ECV has a very low
complication rate.B
Although case reports of placental abruption and large fetomaternal haemorrhage exist, complications
associated with ECV are very rare. In a 2015 Cochrane systematic review, Hofmeyr et al.4reported no
signiﬁcant differences in Apgar scores of less than 7 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, or in low umbilical vein pHlevels, neonatal admission or perinatal death according to whether ECV had been performed. A number oflarge consecutive series
5,6,9,10,35have reported no fetal deaths attributable to the procedure. Meta-analyses
and systematic reviews36–38although subject to reporting bias, also show complications to be rare.
The reported risk of emergency caesarean section within 24 hours is approximately 0.5%, with the
indication in over 90% being vaginal bleeding or an abnormal CTG following the procedure.6,10Evidence
level 2 ++
However, a population-based cohort study39comparing breech births where there had been unsuccessful
ECV with those where ECV had not been attempted showed a small increase in short-term adverseoutcomes (adjusted OR for neonatal unit admission 1.48, 95% CI 1.20 –1.82) after an unsuccessful attempt
at ECV. This was irrespective of whether labour was attempted. Longer term outcomes were not analysedand comparison with successful ECVs was not performed.
Boucher et al.
40performed Kleihauer testing shortly after an ECV attempt. In 1244 women with a negative
Kleihauer test prior to ECV, fetomaternal haemorrhage was detected in 2.4% of women, a third of whichhad more than 1 ml. In one woman, the estimated fetomaternal haemorrhage was more than 30 ml.Evidence

4.8 What measures are appropriate to ensure fetal safety?
ECV should be performed where facilities for monitoring and surgical delivery are available./check
The standard preoperative preparations for caesarean section are not recommended for
women undergoing ECV. /check
Following ECV, EFM is recommended./check
Women undergoing ECV who are D negative should undergo testing for fetomaternalhaemorrhage and be offered anti-D.D
There is limited evidence to guide practice. No more than four attempts are advised, for a suggested
maximum of 10 minutes overall.10EFM prior to the attempt is advised. ECV should be performed where
facilities for ultrasound, EFM and surgical delivery are available. However, fasting, administration ofanaesthetic premedication or insertion of intravenous access (unless for tocolysis) are not recommendedas the need for caesarean delivery is less likely
10than for women in normal labour.
Ultrasound should be used during and after the ECV to conﬁrm a normal fetal heart rate. A transient (less
than 3 minutes) fetal bradycardia after ECV is common,10but should instigate continuous monitoring in a
left lateral position, and if persistent and not improving after 6 minutes, should prompt preparation forcategory I caesarean section.Evidence
level 3
Urgent delivery should also be advised following the procedure if there is vaginal bleeding or unexplained abdominal
pain, or if an abnormal CTG persists.
Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended for women undergoing ECV who are D negative unless the baby
is known to be D negative also. A minimum of 500 iu is recommended within 72 hours. Routine screeningfor fetomaternal haemorrhage is recommended by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology
41
to assess which D-negative women might beneﬁt from additional anti-D. A strongly positive (e.g. morethan 30 ml) Kleihauer should prompt immediate fetal review.Evidence
level 4
4.9 Who should perform ECV?
ECV should only be performed by a trained practitioner or by a trainee working under direct
supervision. /check
Beuckens et al.5trained midwives in the theory and practice of ECV and reported low complication rates
among 2546 attempts. The RCOG Advanced Training Skills Module in Advanced Labour Ward PracticeCurriculum requires ECV competence among trainees. Training models may help
42but are not widely available.Evidence
level 4
4.10 How acceptable is ECV to women?
Although most women tolerate ECV, they should be informed that ECV can be a painful
procedure.C

 14710528, 2017, 7, Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14466 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [28/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
ECV is not universally acceptable to women. Hemelaar et al.43reported that 9% of women declined ECV.
Barriers include fear of pain and vaginal birth, and accounts of others’ experiences.44,45
Maternal experience of ECV varies enormously. Rijnders et al.46reported that one-third of women
experienced signiﬁcant pain, while Bogner et al.47reported general satisfaction if the ECV was successful.
Fok et al.48reported median pain scores of 5.7. In one trial,21three-quarters of women described the
procedure as uncomfortable or worse, and 5% of women reported high pain scores.Evidence
level 2 /C0
4.11 How could the uptake of ECV be increased?
The uptake of ECV is best increased by timely identi ﬁcation of the baby presenting by the
breech and provision of evidence-based information.C
ECV is not practised in many parts of the world.49In the UK, the views of obstetricians on ECV are
generally positive, but there are some negative perceptions among women.44Patient acceptance could
improve if accurate information on the beneﬁts and risks are given.43
The greatest impediment to the use of ECV is the nonidentiﬁcation of breech presentation. Theproportion of undetected breech presentation at term has been reported in as high as 20.0 –32.5% of all
breech presentations
43,50and these have worse outcomes.51The possibility of breech presentation should
always be considered at clinical examination although abdominal palpation has a sensitivity of only 70%.52In
the absence of routine third trimester ultrasound, particular care should be taken with high-risk groups,e.g. where a previous baby has been breech. Recurrence rate after one breech presentation is 9.9%(RR adjusted 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 –3.6).
53Access to a presentation scan after 36+0weeks of gestation is
essential.Evidence
level 2 +
4.12 How can an ECV service be developed and audited?
There is no evidence to support any particular service model although larger institutions may
consider a dedicated ECV clinic. /check
There is minimal evidence concerning how an ECV service is best delivered. This service should be staffed by
appropriately trained practitioners. Comprehensive local data collection, including success rates and outcomes,should be gathered in order for women to make an informed choice.
4.13 What is the role of non-ECV methods?
Women may wish to consider the use of moxibustion for breech presentation at 33 –35 weeks
of gestation, under the guidance of a trained practitioner.C
Women should be advised that there is no evidence that postural management alone promotesspontaneous version to cephalic presentation.B

Moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medicine therapy using moxa made from dried mugwort, has been used
from 32 weeks of gestation to promote spontaneous version. It is unclear how moxibustion might promoteversion, but it is thought to promote fetal activity. The quality of data is poor and the effectiveness ofmoxibustion should be considered in light of the number of breech presentations that exist at 32 weeks ofgestation, reported as 43% by Westgren et al.
8Coyle et al.,54in a systematic review, concluded that although
moxibustion did not reduce the number of noncephalic births when compared with no treatment, it may doso when combined with postural management techniques. In addition, moxibustion, when combined withacupuncture, may result in fewer births by caesarean section.
Subsequently, Vas et al.
55randomised 406 women with a proven breech presentation at 33 –35 weeks of
gestation to 2 weeks of daily moxibustion, ‘sham’ moxibustion or usual care. A signiﬁcant increase in cephalicpresentation at delivery was noted in the moxibustion group when compared with the sham or usual care(moxibustion versus usual care; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 –1.64) groups, with no signiﬁcant change in caesarean
delivery rates (moxibustion versus usual care; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67 –1.07). No data on ECV rates in the
groups were presented.
There is insufﬁcient evidence to support the use of postural management for breech presentation.

Appendix I: Explanation of guidelines and evidence levels
Clinical guidelines are: ‘systematically developed statements which assist clinicians and patients in making decisions
about appropriate treatment for speciﬁc conditions’. Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised
methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No.1 Development of RCOG
Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at http://www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These
recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated.
The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a
similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.
Classiﬁcation of evidence levels Grades of recommendations

DISCLAIMER
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice.
They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration byobstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular
clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented
by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available.
This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be
prescriptive directions deﬁning a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols orguidelines should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken.
