Antenatal Screening for Syphilis 
 
Background to the screening program is given in Appendix B . 
 
For Designated programme lead for maternity services and Link speciality staff please 
see Appendix A 

Aims 
 
The NHS Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Screening Programme ensures that all 
pregnant women are offered and recommended screening for syphilis [Public Health 
England (PHE) 2018b] 
 
Objectives 
 
• To ensure that women with syphilis are identified early in pregnancy to 
facilitate appropriate assessment and management for their health 
• To reduce the risk of mother -to-child transmission of syphilis 
• To facilitate appropriate neonatal referral and management 
 
Ref: Public Health England 2018 

Expected Health Outcomes 
 
The expectation of the antenatal screening programme is to safeguard the woman’s own 
health and reduce the risk of mother -to-child transmission of syphilis infection [Public 
Health England 2018 ]. 

1 Screening for Syphilis in Pregnancy 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 7 of 31 
 1.1 Pre-Screening Information enabling informed choice 
 
1.1.1 At the first antenatal contact with the midwife, the woman should be 
given verbal and written information about syphilis. This should include 
the benefits of screening for both the woman and her unborn baby [NICE 
2008, PHE 2018b; UK NSC 2013] 
 
1.1.2 The trust uses the NHS Screening Programmes information booklet: 
‘Screening tests for you and your baby’. This includes the section 
‘Infectious Diseases’. This leaflet may be sent to the woman by post prior 
to the first appointment or given out at the first appointment. The midwife 
must document in the hand held notes that the leaflet has been received 
by the woman. 
1.1.3 Copies of ‘Screening tests for you and your baby’ are available in some 
other languages and can be downloaded via the Public Health England 
website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening -
tests -for-you-and-your -baby -description -in-brief. If the leaflet is not 
available in the language required from the national website, it is 
possible to ask for the leaflet to be translated via the trust’s Equality 
and Diversity Team . 
1.1.4 Interpreting services [including sig n language] should be used for 
communicating with parents who are not fluent in English at all stages 
of the screening pathway. 
 
1.1.5 If the midwife or doctor feels unable to answer all questions or the 
woman requests further advice/information about any aspect of 
syphilis, then a direct referral can be made to the Specialist Midwife for 
Reproductive Health and Wellbeing (SMRHW) for specialist counselling 
[see contact list Appendix A ]. 

1.2 Offering Screening in Pregnancy 
 
1.2.1 The Eligible Population 
 
All women should be offered screening for syphilis early in each 
pregnancy regardless of the results of syphilis screening in previous 
pregnancies [NICE 2018, PHE 2016b, PHE 2018b] 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 8 of 31 
 1.2.2 The midwife or doctor should discuss the reasons why screening for 
syphilis is recommended, the results process and follow -up if the 
screening result is positive. 
 
1.2.3 Screening should be offered early in pregnancy, ideally by 10 weeks 
[NICE 2008]. The aim is to screen all women by 10 weeks, however 
screening can be offered at any point during the pregnancy. 
1.2.4 Testing should also be available on request at any stage of pregnancy 
should a woman consider herself to be at risk of infection [Public Health 
England 2018 ] 
1.2.5 Women booking late or who arrive unbooked in labour should be 
offered screening at t he first available opportunity 
 
1.2.6 Women who have booked elsewhere and transferred care to BSUH NHS 
TRUST should be offered repeat screening. This ensures a result is 
available in -house for all staff to access electronically if the hand held 
notes are not available and for completion of cohort data. If a woman 
declines repeat testing having been screened elsewhere, then a copy of 
the original result from the previous booking unit must be inserted in 
the hand held notes and a further copy sent to the Ant enatal Screening 
Co-ordinator and SMRHW . A booking test declined for (appendix C) 
should be completed and the declines process should be implemented) 
 
1.2.7 The midwife should document in the hand held notes that discussion 
has taken place and the woman’s decision to accept [consent to screen] 
or decline screening. Screening should only be performed after 
documented informed consent; this does not require a signature from 
the woman. 
 
2 Women Booking Late 
 
2.1 Women booking late must be offered screening at the first appointment with 
the midwife. Where women book at 24 weeks gestation or later, the blood 
specimens should be marked urgent and positive results reported [as per 
positive results pathway section 5] within 24 hours [1 working day] of the 
sample being received in the laboratory [The Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) 
2013]. 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 9 of 31 
 2.2 In such cases it is the responsibility of the midwife booking the woman to follow 
up results within 5 working days of the sample being taken. The midwife must 
agree a plan with the woman to communicate the results to her. This plan must 
be documented in the hand held notes [RCP 2013]. 
 
3 Women who arrive un -booked or without screening results in labour 
 
3.1 Women who arrive un -booked or without screening results in labour must be 
offered screening on admission by the midwife responsible for care. 
Consideration should be given to the stage of labour, woman’s condition and 
specific risk factors for syphilis. The midwife should document all discussions 
that have taken place in the hand held notes. PHE 2018 
3.2 If the woman is considered to be at increased risk of syphilis infection and 
delivery is imminent it may be necessary to consider urgent screening. Results 
can normally be obtained within an hour from the laboratory during normal 
working hours. In these cases the midwife should liaise with staff in the virology 
laboratory regarding timely processing of the sample and results turnaround 
time [PHE 2016a, PHE2018b ]. 
3.3 If consent is withheld for screening during labour, the midwife caring for the 
woman should re -offer screening after delivery and document discussions/ 
decisions in handheld notes [PHE 2018 ]. In these cases the midwife must alert 
the on -call neon atal doctor prior to the birth. 
3.4 
In all cases, blood results must be obtained prior to discharge from the hospital / 
maternity services and documented in the hand held notes by the midwife responsible 
for the woman or person ’s care. Positive results will be actioned accordingly [PHE 
2016a; PHE 2018b]. 
3.5 If the baby is born before the results are available, the midwife should alert the 
neonatal team that results are outstanding.

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 10 of 31 
 4 Declining Screening 
4.1 Screening is optional. All women have the right to decline screening. In these 
cases the midwife should complete a booking test declined form [see Appendix 
C] and return to the Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing 
(SMRHW). 
4.2 The decision to decline screening must be clearly documented by the midwife in 
the l hand held notes. The ‘decline’ box must also be ticked on the booking 
blood request form. 
4.3 The woman should also be informed that as she has declined syphilis screening, 
she will be contacted by the SMRHW to further discuss their choices. This 
contact will usually be within 10 working days of receipt of the decline form and 
ideally by 20 weeks. Ideally this discussion takes place in person. At this contact 
the SMRHW will: 
• discuss the woman’s decision to decline and ensure that they are 
fully aware of the benefits of screening for both themselves and 
their baby 
• reoffer the screening test and where this is accepted arrange 
testing and follow up of the result [PHE 2018b] 
 
4.4 If the woman remains unscreened at 28 weeks the midwife should re -offer 
screening at the 28 week visit along with the other blood test routinely offered 
at this appointment. The midwife should document in the hand held notes any 
discussions that take place and the woman’s decision to accept or decline 
screening after re -offer. 
 
4.5 The SMRHW will follow up at 32 weeks and if the woman remains unscreened, 
the SMRHW will inform the following staff by email: 
• Link Neonatal Consultant 
• Link GUM consultant 
• Link Obstetric Consultants 
• Consultant Virologist 
• Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator 
• Neonatal secretary 
• Consultant Neonatologist (who will co -ordinate a team meeting to 
formulate a postnatal management plan individual to the woman’s 
circumstances) [PHE 2018b] 
 
4.6 Where women decline screening, the midwife should ensure the woman is 
aware she can opt for screening later in her pregnancy and is aware how to 
arrange this. PHE 2018

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 11 of 31 
 5 Taking the Sample 
5.1 The sample may be taking at booking by th e midwife or practice nurse or 
phlebotomist according to local arrangements: 
 
• A 5 ml sample of blood is required in a gold topped [clotted] bottle. 
This same sample can be used for HIV, Hep B and syphilis screening. 
• The requestor [midwife or doctor] should complete all fields on the 
Antenatal Booking Blood Request Form. The request from is in 
triplicate, and the requestor must ensure that all hand writing has 
transferred through and is legible on all three sheets of the form. 
Where adhesive patient labels are used, a label must be affixed onto 
each of the three sheets of the request form. The form includes tick 
boxes for ‘accept’ or ‘decline’ of syphilis screening as well as boxes to 
indicate whether this is a ‘first booking’, ‘urgent’ or ‘repeat’ sample. 
5.2 The sample must be labelled according to laboratory guidelines. The minimum 
acceptable identifiers include forename, surname [no abbreviations], plus date 
of birth and NHS number or hospital ID number. The NHS number is the 
preferred number to use [PHE 2016a]. 
5.3 If a woman discloses previous syphilis infection and treatment, include details 
on the request form. In these cases the woman should be made aware that the 
result will show ‘syphilis positive’ even if she has received appropriate treatment 
in the past, and that the SMRHW will contact her to discuss 
5.4 Additional information should be included on the request for m if relevant: 
Including family origins, recent immigration (if lived in an area of world where 
syphilis is endemic) and first language (if not English) to assist the SMRHW in 
follow -up of positive results 
5.5 Samples are sent to Brighton Pathology for processing and should arrive within 
one working day of sample collection. 
6 Unacceptable samples 
6.1.1 Where the sample is deemed to be unacceptable by the laboratory 
because of insufficient blood, incomplete data on the request form or 
for any other reason, the laboratory will inform the sample requestor 
to request a repeat. In such cases, a repeat sample should ideally be 
taken within 10 working days of the request being received by the 
maternity unit [PHE 2016a; PHE 2018b] 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 12 of 31 
 6.1.2 Where repeat samples take longer than 10 working days to arrange [for 
example the woman is away or declines to attend for repeat sampling 
within 10 days], the midwife should document reasons why there has 
been a delay. 
6.1.3 The midwife must always follow up the results of repeated samples and 
arrange a plan [documented in the hand held notes] being mindful that 
there has already been a delay in obtaining a result because of the need 
to repeat. 
7 Results Processes 
Accessing results [including fail -safes to ensure all women who accept screening 
receive a result] 
7.1 Results will be available to staff within 5 working days on ICE [the electronic 
results reporting programme] or by phoning the virology laboratory at RSCH on 
01273 696955 x4627 [PHE 2016a] 
7.2 It is the responsibility of the sample requestor to follow up results within 10 
working days of the sample being taken [see also 8.1.3 for situations where this 
is not possible] [PHE 2016a; PHE 2018b]. The sample requestor should ensure 
positive results have been acted upon and follow up missing results or 
laboratory requests for a repeat sample. The sample requestor must document 
that results were followed up and acted on. An example proforma that can be 
used for recording that results were followed up is given in appendix F. 
7.3 It is recognised that some community clinics do not have facilities for 
venepuncture and therefore women attend hospital phlebotomy to have bloods 
taken. In such cases, the sample requestor will not know when the bloods were 
actually taken and so cannot follow up results at 10 days. In such cases it is 
essential that the requestor follows up results as per 8.1.4. 
7.4 It is the responsibility of the health professional (midwife or doctor) providing 
care at the next antenatal appointment (usually at the 16 weeks of pregnancy 
appointment) to check the results, document results [with informed maternal 
consent] in the maternal hand held notes and inform the woman of the results 
during the appointment [PHE 2018b]. 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 13 of 31 
 7.5 As an additional failsafe, the Screening Maternity Support Worker (MSW) will 
ensure a full set of booking blood results are available at the time women attend 
dating scan. This allows early identification of missing results. With consent, 
missing bloods will be repeated at this point of contact by the MSW. The MSW 
will then inform, via email, the Antenatal Screening Team and named 
community midwife. It is then the responsibility of the named Community 
Midwife to follow up results within 10 working days and inform the woman as 
per 8.1.2. All women should be notified of their results following testing and this 
includes women who terminate or miscarry following screening. This is 
especially important with screen positive results to ensure women are referred 
and seen for specialist follow up within the timeframe detailed in section 9.0 
[PHE 2016a; PHE 2018b] 
 
8 Missing results 
 
8.1 Results should be documented in all cases at the next antenatal appointment 
[PHE 2018b] . In rare circumstances, a result may not be available at the next 
appointment. The midwife or doctor should phone the laboratory to try and 
ascertain how long results will take and agree with the woman, a plan to 
communicate the results to her. 
8.2 If having phoned the laboratory it is apparent that there is no result, then a 
repeat screening test should be recommended and where accepted, taken that 
day or within 10 working days maximum [PHE 2016a; PHE 2018b]. 
 
8.3 Where a repeat sample is taken, a plan must be agreed with the woman as to 
relaying the result to her within a specified time frame. 
 
8.4 Full documentation of the above should be made in the hand held notes by the 
midwife or doctor. 
 
9 Negative result 
 
Where a syphilis result is negative, the health professional (midwife or doctor) informing 
the woman of the result should explain the following: 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 14 of 31 
 9.1 A negative test does not confer protection on the woman. If a woman (or her 
partner) engages in high risk behaviour there is a risk of acquiring syphilis during 
pregnancy [PHE 2018a]. 
9.2 Women can request repeat screening at any stage of the pregnancy if she 
deems herself at risk or changes her sexual partner [PHE 2018b] 
 
10 Positive Result 
10.1 All confirmatory testing is performed in Brighton pathology laboratory. 
10.2 The virology laboratory staff will inform the SMRHW and designated Health 
Advisors [HA - who provide cover if the SMRHW is absent] by email of a syphilis 
positive or equivocal result. This email is sent to a dedicated email account 
(bsuh.womens.health.advisor@nhs.net ) which is checked daily by the 
designated specialist staff ( SMRHW /HAs). This failsafe ensures results are 
communicated and actioned within the appropriate timeframe as per 9.6. 
10.3 All positive results will be actioned within 2 working days of the result being 
received by the Health Advisor team. 
10.4 The SMRHW/HA will first check to see if the woman is known to local GUM 
services [to confirm previous testing /treatment] and check the EDD to see if 
birth is imminent. 
10.5 The SMRHW/HA attempt to contact the woman by phone. If contact is not made 
by phone then a letter will be sent to the woman that same working day. 
10.6 Once contact is made with the woman, an appointment is offered within 5 
working days to inform the woman of the result and ascertain previous history 
of syphilis infection and previous treatment. Initial discussion with the woman 
would i deally take place in person but may take place over the phone according 
to the woman’s preference [PHE 2018b]. Discussion should take into account 
the following: 
10.7 A positive result does not necessarily mean that a woman has syphilis [PHE 
2016a, PHE 2 016c, NICE 2008]. A significant number of non -syphilis reactive 
tests may be found in certain populations because serology cannot distinguish 
between different treponematoses [e.g syphilis, yaws, pinta and bejel] [PHE 
2016c]. A positive result will therefore be interpreted in relation to clinical signs 
and patient history. 
 Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 15 of 31 
 10.8 Women who have previously been treated for syphilis infection will test positive 
on subsequent tests. Even if the woman reports that treatment was completed 
it will be necessary to determine whether this treatment was adequate [PHE 
2016c]. 
10.9 Once the woman’s history has been obtained, the SMRHW/HA will liaise with 
the link GUM consultant for antenatal syphilis screening [please see Appendix A 
for contact details] for specialist assessment and possible treatment. The 
SMRHW documents all discussions with the woman and outcome of assessment 
in the GUM notes on MILL care system at the Claude Nicol Centre. 
10.10 Syphilis positive results are available on ICE - the laboratory results reporting 
system. The result will include the following message to alert GPs and other staff 
that the result has been actioned and no further action on their part is 
necessary: 
 
Please note that any positive patient’s result for Syphilis will be actioned by the Specialist 
Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing at Claude Nicol Clinic who will be 
contacting the patient. 
 
11 If treatment is required: 
11.1 The woman will be offered an appointment with a senior doctor in the GUM 
clinic by the SMRHW within 5 working days to commence treatment. If there is 
any doubt about the woman’s previous history or treatment then retreatment 
will be recommended. 
11.2 Women who are greater than 20 weeks gestation and require antibiotic 
treatment are at risk of experiencing a J -H reaction to the first injection. This 
could cause premature labour and so requires close monitoring. These women 
will require admission to the Maternity Day Assessment Unit for first injection to 
observe for signs of premature labour for a minimum 6 hours. Follow -up doses 
can be administered at the Claude Nicol Centre. See Appendix D for copy of 
GUM team policy. 
11.3 The SMRHW will also arrange, where indicated, contact tracing and screening of 
partners and older children according to GUM policy. Children are referred to 
the Paediatric Consultant for testing and follow up treatment. 
11.4 Once maternal assessment and treatment is completed, the following health 
professionals are informed: 
• The GUM consultant responsible for the woman’s care informs the link 
paediatric consultant for syphilis in writing to initiate paediatric review 
after birth with a copy to the woman’s GP 
• The SMRHW contacts the woman’s community midwife by phone. Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 16 of 31 
 • The SMRHW informs the Antenatal Screening Co -ordinator by email 
which the ASC files in the hospital handheld notes. 
11.5 Confirmatory testing, treatment and follow -up is organised by GUM 
 consultant/Health Advisor according to local GUM guidelines. 
11.6 Babies born to any woman with a syphilis positive result require paediatric 
follow -up after birth according to local protocol. The midwife caring for the 
woman in labour should inform the paediatricians on admission. For further 
information please refer to the BSUH neonatal department policy: Management 
of Infants Born to Mothers [Parents] with Positive Screening for Syphilis in 
Pregnancy [Department of Neonatology 2018] 
11.7 In most cases, women with a syphilis positive resu lt will have been assessed by 
the GUM team by the time of the next antenatal visit [usually 16 weeks]. It is the 
health professional’s [doctor or midwife] responsibility at this visit to ensure 
that the woman has received her result and that this has been documented in 
the hand held notes with the woman’s consent [as per section 8.1.4]. If the 
woman declines documentation of a screen positive result in her hand -held 
notes, the result should be documented in th e hospital notes. In such cases the 
woman should be advised of the importance of informing staff on admission in 
labour of the diagnoses and treatment so that her baby can be followed up 
appropriately after birth. 
11.8 The SMRHW /HA will document all consultations, care and treatment decision in 
the GUM notes also.

 12.2 Antenatal Screening for Infectious Diseases: Syphilis – Positive Results Pathway 

EIA [enzyme immunoassay] positive: laboratory performs VDRL and TPHA 
testing 
Lab informs Specialist Midwife for Reproductive Health and Wellbeing by phone AND 
email of all EIA screen positive results with 5 working days of sample being taken. 
The SMRHW contacts the woman to inform her of the result and ascertain past history 
of syphilis infection and previous treatment. The SMRHW then discusses with the GUM 
consultant who will arrange treatment as necessary. 
 
Assessment and treatment completed: GUM consultant sends treatment summary 
letter to Neonatology link consultant to initiate paediatric review after birth with copy to 
GP.

 Appendix B - Background Information: Antenatal Screening for 
syphilis. 
 
Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is typically passed through sexual contact. 
However, it can be passed on by intravenous drug use (injecting drugs directly into the vein), 
blood transfusions and from an infected mother or birthing parent to unbor n child. The latter 
is known as 
congenital syphilis [PHE 2016c]. 
 
Syphilis infection is staged according to the duration of infection – the time from acquisition of 
primary infection. The risk of transmission from mother to bab y declines as maternal syphilis 
infection progresses. Risk ranges from 70 -100% in primary syphili s, 40% in early latent syphilis 
and 10% in late latent syphilis [PHE 2016c]. 
 
Maternal syphilis infection can result in a range of adverse p regnancy and neonatal outcomes. 
These include miscarriage, pre -term labour, stillbirth, and congenital syphilis [PHE 2016c] ]. 
Untreated syphilis will also lead to serious long term sequela e for the mother and her sexual 
partners. 
 
Treatment for syphilis is beneficial for mother and baby [NICE 20 08]. Screening for syphilis in 
pregnancy identifies women who are infected so that trea tment can be offered which will 
reduce the risks of the baby developing congenital syphilis.

 Appendix D - Syphilis in Pregnancy 
 
• Pregnant women with documented adequate treatment do not necessarily need re -
treatment for the current pregnancy or future pregnancies. If there is no clinical 
evidence of syphilis and the VDRL is negative o r low serofast do not re -treat. 
• Re-treatment for all new cases and subsequent pregnancies should be discussed 
jointly with the patient and a consultant - see below. 
• All pregnant women should be re -treated when the treatment history is uncertain or 
the treatment schedule is in doubt. 
• A CXR is only indicated where there is clinical suspicion of aortic regurgitation. 
• All pregnant women with positive syphilis serology should be discussed with a GUM 
consultant. 
• All pregnant women with positive syphilis serology (even with a clear history of 
treatment) should be referred to Dr Rob Bomont Consultant Neonatologist so the 
babies can be reviewed. 
• Any older siblings who may have been affected by congenital syphilis should be 
referred to Dr Katie Fiddler, Paediatric Infectious Diseases consultant. N.B some 
features of congenital syphilis may not be apparent for 2 years or more. All cases of 
suspected congenital syphilis diagnosed in childhood should be managed jointly with 
the paediatric team. 
• Treatment of sexual partners should be considered discussed with a GUM consultant. 
Respect confidentiality of patient.

• Azithromycin 500mg PO daily for 10 days: ('Caution re: macrolide therapy for syphilis') 
Late syphilis in pregnancy 
Late latent, cardiovascular and gummatous syphilis (all three trimesters): 
If cardiovascular involvement, inpatient management is advisable. 
• Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 MU IM weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 (three doses): 
 
Steroids should be given with all anti -treponemal antibiotics for cardiovascular syphilis; 40 –
60mg prednisolone OD for three days starting 24h before the antibiotics. 
Alternative regimens 
• Procaine penicillin G 600,000 units IM OD for 14 days: 
• Amoxycillin 2g PO t.d.s. plus probenecid 500mg q.d.s for 28 days: 
Neurosyphilis in pregnancy 
If neurological involvement including optic neuritis, inpatient management is advisable. Antenatal Screening MP007 
Infectious Diseases: Syphilis (RSCH PRH only ) 

Brighton & Hove University Hospital Page 28 of 31 
 • Procaine penicillin G 1.8 –2.4 MU IM o.d. plus pro -benecid 500mg PO q.d.s. for 14 
days:. 
• Benzylpenicillin 10.8 –14.4g daily, given as 1.8 –2.4g IV every 4h for 14 days: 
Alternative regimens 
• Amoxycillin 2g PO t.d.s. plus probenecid 500mg PO q.d.s. for 28 days:. 
• Ceftriaxone 2g IM (with lidocaine as diluent) or IV (with water for injections as diluent, 
NOT Lidocaine) for 10 –14 days 
Steroids should be given with all anti -treponemal antibiotics for neurosyphilis; 40 –60mg 
prednisolone OD for three days starting 24h before the antibiotics. 
Penicillin allergy: 
 
• Many people reporting penicillin allergy will not display hypersensitivity on re -
exposure to penicillin either because the hypersensitivity has resolved or they were 
never allergic to penicillin. A careful history may help to identify the latter group. All 
patients with penicillin allergy should be discussed with the wider team 
• Consider penicillin desensitisation. Skin testing to confirm allergy should precede 
desensitisation. Skin testing and desensitisation do carry risks of =anaphylaxis and 
should be carried out with immediate access to resuscitation equipment and expertise 
• Non -penicillin therapies should be used only in conjunction with close serologic and 
clinical follow -up. 
 
Possible regimens 
• Ceftriaxone based treatment 
• Erythromycin 500mg q.d.s PO x 14/7 ('Caution re: macrolide therapy for syphilis') 
• Azithromycin 500mg o.d PO x 10/7 ('Caution re: macrolide therapy for syphilis' 
Congenital syphilis 
Should be discussed with Link Neonatal Consultant 
• All cases of suspected congenital syphilis diagnosed in childhood should be managed 
jointly with the paediatric team 
• Benzyl penicillin sodium 60 –90 mg/kg daily IV (in divided doses given as – 30 mg/kg 12 
hourly) in the first seven days of life and 8 hourly thereafter for a further 3 days for a 
total of 10 days: 1C
