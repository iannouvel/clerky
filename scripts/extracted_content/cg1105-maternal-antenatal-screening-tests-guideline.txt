documented in the woman and person ’s MIS once the woman and person has been counselled 
and the IDPS data ba se will be updated.

The ANST will liaise with the HA and an appointment will be made to discuss the result within 3 
working days of ANST being notified . The result can be given in person at this app ointment or over 
the phone . Following this, subsequent care will be arranged.

7.0 Screening for: 
 
1. Down’s , Edward’s and Patau’s syndrome - See separate g uideline 
2. Fetal Anomalies 

7.1 Anomaly Scan 
 
All pregnant women and people will be offered fetal anomaly ultrasound screening at booking, 
which will ideally be performed between 18 and 20 weeks and 6 days. 
Information about the anomaly scan is contained within the national patient information leaflet 
STFYAB . 
 
7.2 Failsafe 
 
The eligible population (i.e. anomaly screening requested by woman and person ) will be i dentified 
using the MIS. The ANST will undertake a weekly check to identify women and people within this 
eligible grou p who appear not to have had an anomaly scan. These cases will be checked in depth 
and women and people who have not been scanned will be offered an urgent anomaly scan. If the 
ANST are unable to contact a woman and person after they have missed a scan appointment, they 
will arrange and send a repeat appointment to the woman and person either by email, post, call or 
text. CMW and SG teams will be notified accordingly. 
 
This will be used to provide denominator and numerator data for the quarterly and annual KPI data 
reports. 
 
7.3 Normal scan result 
 
This will be reported to the woman and person at time of scan and documented on a report . A copy 
of the report will be given to the woman and person. A PDF of the report will be interfaced to MIS. 
 
7.4 Incomplete Scan 
 
If the first anomaly scan is incomplete due to increased BMI or persistent fetal lie, one more scan 
will be off ered by 23 weeks gestation . If this second attempt is also unsuccessful but a problem 
hasn’t been detected, no further scans will be offered in line with the FASP standards . These 
women and people should be referred to the ANST who will discuss and upload further supporting 
information outlining the standard. 
 
7.5 Abnormal scan 
 
Women and people must be informed of an abnormal scan before they leave the ultrasound room 
(11 physical conditions (20-week scan) Gov.UK 2022). 
 
The Sonographer will inform the ANST . At this point, findings should be discussed and explained 
to woman and person and their partner .
