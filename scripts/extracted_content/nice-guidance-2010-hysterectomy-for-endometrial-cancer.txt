1 Guidanc e 
1.1 Current e vidence on t he saf ety and efficacy of lapar oscopic 
hysterectomy (including lapar oscopic t otal h ysterectomy and 
lapar oscopically assist ed vaginal h ysterectomy) for endometrial cancer is 
adequat e to suppor t the use of t his pr ocedur e provided t hat normal 
arrangement s are in place f or clinical go vernance, consent and audit. 
1.2 Patient selection f or lapar oscopic h ysterectomy for endometrial cancer

of 7should be carried out b y a multidisciplinar y gynaecological oncology 
team. 
1.3 Advanced lapar oscopic skills ar e requir ed for this pr ocedur e and 
clinicians should under go special training and ment orship. The R oyal 
College of Obst etricians and Gynaecologist s has de veloped an Advanced 
Training Skills Module . This needs t o be supplement ed by fur ther training 
to achie ve the skills r equir ed for lapar oscopic h ysterectomy for 
endometrial cancer . 
1.4 Long-t erm f ollow-up data on r ecurr ence and sur vival following 
lapar oscopic h ysterectomy for endometrial cancer w ould assist an y 
futur e review of t he pr ocedur e by NICE. 
2 The pr ocedure 
2.1 Indic ations and curr ent treatmen ts 
2.1.1 The ut erus is t he fourth most common sit e of malignancy among w omen 
in the UK, and endometrial cancer is t he most common type of ut erine 
cancer . The pr edominant sympt om of endometrial cancer is abnormal 
vaginal bleeding, especially in postmenopausal w omen. 
2.1.2 The Int ernational F ederation of Gynecology and Obst etrics (FIGO) 
system is used t o stage endometrial cancer fr om stage I ( cancer 
confined t o the ut erus) t o stage IV ( cancer t hat has spr ead t o anot her 
body or gan). 
2.1.3 Endometrial cancer is usually tr eated by total h ysterectomy wit h bilat eral 
salpingo-oophor ectomy. Radiot herap y, hormone t herap y and 
chemot herap y ma y also be used. 
2.2 Outline o f the pr ocedure 
2.2.1 The aim of a lapar oscopic appr oach t o hysterectomy is t o provide a 
treatment option wit h smaller incisions and scars, shor ter hospital sta y Lapar oscopic h ysterectomy (including lapar oscopic t otal h ysterectomy and
lapar oscopically assist ed vaginal h ysterectomy) for endometrial cancer (IPG356)

conditions#notice-of -right s).Page 2
of 7and shor ter recovery period t han f or open sur gery. 
2.2.2 Lapar oscopic h ysterectomy is usually carried out wit h the patient under 
general anaest hesia. Se veral small incisions pr ovide access f or the 
lapar oscope and sur gical instrument s. The abdomen is insufflat ed wit h 
carbon dio xide. The ut erus, suppor ting ligament s and t he upper v agina 
are removed. Sometimes, t he pelvic and para-aor tic lymph nodes ar e 
also r emoved. The ut erus is r emoved vaginally . The ot her tissues can be 
removed vaginally or t hrough t he abdominal incisions. 
Sections 2. 3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and saf ety out comes fr om t he 
published lit eratur e that t he Committ ee consider ed as par t of t he evidence 
about t his pr ocedur e. For mor e detailed inf ormation on t he evidence, see t he 
overview . 
2.3 Efficacy 
2.3.1 In a meta-analysis, 3 randomised-contr olled trials (RCT s) including a t otal 
of 359 patient s treated by lapar oscopic h ysterectomy or b y abdominal 
hysterectomy repor ted overall sur vival rat es of 92% (169/184) and 88% 
(154/17 5) respectiv ely (p = 0 .976) and disease-fr ee sur vival rat es of 88% 
(161/184) and 88% (154/17 5) respectiv ely (p = 0 .986) at f ollow-up of a 
maximum of 36 mont hs. 
2.3.2 A non-randomised comparativ e study of 309 patient s repor ted 5-y ear 
overall sur vival rat es of 98% bot h for patient s treated by lapar oscopic (n 
= 165) and abdominal (n = 144) h ysterectomy. The 5-y ear pr ogression-
free sur vival rat e was 96% f or patient s after lapar oscopic h ysterectomy 
and 9 7% for patient s after abdominal h ysterectomy (p = 0 .74). 
2.3.3 Hospital sta y aft er lapar oscopic h ysterectomy was significant ly shor ter 
than aft er abdominal h ysterectomy in t he RCT s of 159 and 122 patient s 
(2 da ys vs 5 da ys, p < 0 .01; 8 da ys vs 11 da ys, p = 0 .001 r espectiv ely). 
The pr opor tion of patient s sta ying in hospital f or mor e than 2 da ys was 
significant ly higher aft er abdominal h ysterectomy compar ed wit h 
lapar oscopic h ysterectomy (94% vs 52%, p < 0 .0001) in t he RCT of 2616 
patient s. Lapar oscopic h ysterectomy (including lapar oscopic t otal h ysterectomy and

recurr ence rat e, quality of lif e, operativ e time and lengt h of hospital sta y. 
2.4 Safety 
2.4.1 Rates of con version t o lapar otomy were repor ted as 26% (434/1682), 0% 
(0/81), 8% (5/63), 5% (10/188), 5% (11/226) and 5% (4/7 3) among 
patient s treated by lapar oscopic h ysterectomy in RCT s of 2616 ,159 and 
122 patient s, and non-randomised comparativ e studies of 309 , 510 and 
169 patient s respectiv ely. 
2.4.2 The RCT of 2616 patient s treated by lapar oscopic or abdominal 
hysterectomy repor ted no significant diff erence in t he rat e of 
intraoperativ e complications (10% [160/1682] vs 8% [69/909], p = 0 .106) 
but significant ly fewer post operativ e complications aft er lapar oscopic 
compar ed wit h abdominal h ysterectomy (14% [2 40/1682] vs 21% [191/
909], p < 0 .001). 
2.4.3 The meta-analysis including a t otal of 498 patient s repor ted no 
significant diff erence in t he rat e of intraoperativ e complications f or 
patient s treated by lapar oscopic compar ed wit h abdominal h ysterectomy 
(8% [14/169] vs 12% [19/162], p = 0 .39). Significant ly fewer post operativ e 
complications w ere repor ted associat ed wit h lapar oscopic compar ed 
with abdominal h ysterectomy in t he same study (17% [27/158] vs 32% 
[50/155], p = 0 .007). 
2.4.4 The RCT of 2616 patient s and t he non-randomised comparativ e study of 
309 patient s repor ted intraoperativ e complications of bo wel injur y (2% 
[37/1682] and less t han 1% [1/165]), v ascular injur y (4% [7 5/1682] and 1% 
[2/165]), bladder injur y (1% [21/1682 and 2/165]) and ur eter injur y (less 
than 1% [14/1682 and 1/165]) among patient s treated by lapar oscopic 
hysterectomy. 
2.4.5 In the non-randomised comparativ e study of 309 patient s treated by 
lapar oscopic or abdominal h ysterectomy, intra-abdominal abscess was 
repor ted in 2% (4/165) and 6% (8/144) of patient s respectiv ely. 
2.4.6 The RCT of 84 patient s repor ted por t-site recurr ence in 1 of 40 patient s Lapar oscopic h ysterectomy (including lapar oscopic t otal h ysterectomy and

up. 
2.4.7 The non-randomised comparativ e study of 309 patient s treated by 
lapar oscopic or abdominal h ysterectomy repor ted bladder dysfunction in 
1 patient in each gr oup (1/165 and 1/144 r espectiv ely). 
2.4.8 The Specialist Advisers list ed adv erse e vents repor ted in t he lit eratur e as 
conversion t o open sur gery, damage t o abdominal or pelvic structur es, 
respirat ory difficulties, por t-site herniation and por t-site metastasis. 
They repor ted dehiscence of t he vaginal v ault aft er lapar oscopic suturing 
as an anecdotal adv erse e vent.
