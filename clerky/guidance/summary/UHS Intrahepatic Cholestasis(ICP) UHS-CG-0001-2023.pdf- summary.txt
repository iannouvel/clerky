The clinical guideline for Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy aims to provide evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and management of ICP for obstetricians and midwives. Responsibilities include accessing, understanding, and following the guideline, with management ensuring accessibility and review as needed. Diagnosis of ICP involves itching and elevated bile acids, with confirmation through symptom resolution post-birth. Monitoring and management of maternal and perinatal risks are crucial, with management including antenatal care, drug treatment, and timing of birth based on bile acid concentration and co-morbidities. Postnatal care involves informing women of symptom resolution and monitoring for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Audit questions and additional resources are provided for healthcare professionals and individuals affected by ICP.
