    <h1>Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP)</h1>
    <p>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare complication occurring in the third trimester, characterized by microvesicular fatty infiltration of the liver, leading to symptoms such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and hypoglycemia.</p>
    
    <h2>Management Summary</h2>
    <p>Management involves immediate supportive care and often prompt delivery to mitigate risks. Post-delivery, liver function typically normalizes within 7 to 10 days. Both the mother and the newborn should be tested for LCHAD deficiency as a predisposing factor.</p>
    
    <p>For detailed guidelines and studies, refer to medical literature and ongoing research linked below.</p>
