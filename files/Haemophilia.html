Written informed consent should be obtained in advance of any genetic testing. Carriers of severe haemophilia should be offered preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

All carriers of severe haemophilia should be offered fetal sex determination by free fetal DNA analysis from 9 weeks of gestation. Pregnant carriers of severe haemophilia with a male fetus at risk of haemophilia should be offered the option of PND with chorionic villus sampling at 11–14 weeks of gestation.

Maternal factor VIII/IX should be checked at booking, before any antenatal procedure and in the third trimester; factor VIII levels rise in pregnancy, but factor IX tends to remain stable. Aim for factor VIII/IX levels of at least 0.5 iu/ml to cover surgical or invasive procedures, or spontaneous miscarriage. If treatment is required, factor levels of 1.0 iu/ml should be aimed for and not allowed to fall below 0.5 iu/ml until haemostasis is secure. Tranexamic acid should be considered in combination with treatment for all those with levels of less than 0.5 iu/ml or as sole therapy for those with levels above 0.5 iu/ml if clinically indicated. Following miscarriage, it should be continued until the bleeding settles. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used antenatally to raise factor VIII levels. Due to the antidiuretic effect, fluids should be restricted to 1 litre for 24 hours after use or, if not possible, electrolytes should be monitored. Recombinant factor VIII should be used if levels obtained with DDAVP are insufficient or in a known nonresponder. Recombinant factor IX is required to cover invasive or surgical procedures in women with factor levels less than 0.5 iu/ml. When giving treatment to raise clotting factor levels, it is important to monitor the response to treatment by measuring the plasma clotting factor concentration before and after infusion, and 4–6 hours following treatment to facilitate dosing. Following any invasive or surgical procedure, a plan for ongoing treatment is required to maintain the coagulation factor in the normal range for a suitable duration, determined by the nature of the procedure. A clear plan for the intrapartum care of a carrier and the baby should be available in advance of 37 weeks of gestation. The woman should be seen in the anaesthetic clinic and the neonatologists should be informed of the intended delivery of a baby with haemophilia. If antenatal diagnosis has not been performed in a male fetus, then he should be managed as if he is affected.

The option of a planned lower segment caesarean section should be discussed for the delivery of affected male babies, especially those with severe haemophilia and/or if the fetal status is unknown. However, there needs to be a full assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of this mode of delivery and consideration of obstetric factors, maternal bleeding risk, patient preference and reproductive expectations. If elective caesarean section is intended, this should be at 39+0 completed weeks with a clear plan for the event of spontaneous labour occurring beforehand. For intended vaginal delivery, spontaneous labour is preferred, if no other obstetric concerns, to minimise the risk of intervention. Measures should be taken to ensure expertise and necessary resources are available at all times. Planned induction of labour may be necessary in cases where there are concerns about distance of travel to the specialist centre or if there are other obstetric concerns. The use of ventouse and midcavity forceps should be avoided for male babies at risk of haemophilia. Fetal blood sampling (FBS) and fetal scalp electrode (FSE) should be avoided in babies expected to have severe or moderate haemophilia. In babies potentially affected with mild haemophilia, judicious use of FBS and FSE can be considered, in order to facilitate vaginal delivery and avoid morbidity associated with caesarean section in labour. This decision should be made by a senior obstetrician. Where FBS is used, sustained pressure under direct vision should be used to ensure haemostasis. The plan for intrapartum management and the second stage of labour, involving a senior obstetrician, should be documented.

Coagulation results in neonates should be interpreted against age-adjusted reference ranges. Cord blood sampling and diagnostic testing is recommended for all male babies born to mothers who are carriers of haemophilia A/B although some mild cases may require retesting at 3–6 months of age. Cord blood sampling and diagnostic testing of female babies born to mothers who are carriers of haemophilia is not recommended. Parents of neonates diagnosed with haemophilia should be informed of the diagnosis in a timely manner and arrangements should be made for neonatal follow-up at a haemophilia centre. In a neonate with low factor levels, vitamin K should be administered by an oral regimen and following neonate bloodspot screening, pressure should be sustained to avoid excess bleeding.

Women with type 1 VWD who achieve normal VWF levels can be safely managed in standard obstetric units in collaboration with haemophilia centre staff. Women with types 2 and 3, or severe type 1 VWD should be referred for prenatal care and delivery to a centre where there are specialists in high-risk obstetrics, as well as a haemophilia centre. Facilities for laboratory monitoring of VWF and factor VIII levels are essential. Clinicians should aim for factor VIII and VWF ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) activity levels of 0.5 iu/ml or above to cover surgical procedures or spontaneous miscarriage. Where invasive procedures are required, if VWF activity or factor VIII levels are less than 0.50 iu/ml, women should receive haemostatic support in the form of DDAVP, where responsive, or VWF-containing concentrates. Treatment should be with DDAVP in preference to blood-derived factor concentrates where possible. This is safe for use in pregnancy and at delivery, but should be avoided in pre-eclampsia. Fluid intake should be restricted to 1 litre for 24 hours following DDAVP administration to prevent maternal hyponatraemia. If additional fluid is required, electrolytes should be monitored. Clinicians should be aware that patients with type 2B VWD may develop thrombocytopenia following DDAVP treatment. If VWF replacement therapy is required, a concentrate containing factor VIII and VWF, manufactured from a safe plasma source with adequate viral testing and inactivation procedures should be used. Target peak VWF activity levels should be 1.0 iu/ml and levels maintained above 0.5 iu/ml until haemostasis is secured.

Treatment plans may need to be modified according to the nature of individual bleeds or procedures, and to the background bleeding phenotype of each case. Factor replacement therapy is usually advised for delivery in women with severe coagulation factor deficiency and/or a bleeding history. Tranexamic acid at a dose of 15–20 mg/kg or 1 g four times daily alone can be used for minor bleeds and in combination with factor replacement. If the baby is at risk of severe deficiency, the delivery plan should include avoidance of ventouse, midcavity forceps, FBS and FSE. Central neuraxial anaesthesia, postpartum pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and NSAIDs should usually be avoided in women with severe deficiencies as it may be difficult to guarantee consistent normalisation of haemostasis even after treatment.
