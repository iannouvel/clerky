Women should be made aware that the greatest risk of adverse outcome occurs in a trial of VBAC resulting in emergency caesarean delivery. Women should be informed that planned VBAC is associated with an approximately 1 in 200 (0.5%) risk of uterine rupture. Women should be informed that the absolute risk of birth-related perinatal death associated with VBAC is extremely low and comparable to the risk for nulliparous women in labour. Women should be informed that ERCS is associated with a small increased risk of placenta praevia and/or accreta in future pregnancies and of pelvic adhesions complicating any future abdominopelvic surgery. The risk of perinatal death with ERCS is extremely low, but there is a small increase in neonatal respiratory morbidity when ERCS is performed before 39+0 weeks of gestation. The risk of respiratory morbidity can be reduced with a preoperative course of antenatal corticosteroids.</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Risks: successful VBAC lowest complications, unsuccessful VBAC highest, approx 1:100 risk rupture, risk SB akin to primip, successful VBAC leads to increased chance of uncomplicated pregnancies in the future and lower chance of requiring a blood transfusion and quicker recovery<br>Risks ERCS - future pregnancies / labours / surgeries, risks ERCS &lt;39/40 higher neonatal resp issues</td><td class="s0">Risks: successful VBAC lowest complications, unsuccessful VBAC highest, approx 1:100 risk rupture, risk SB akin to primip, successful VBAC leads to increased chance of uncomplicated pregnancies in the future and lower chance of requiring a blood transfusion and quicker recovery<br>Risks ERCS - future pregnancies / labours / surgeries, risks ERCS &lt;39/40 higher neonatal resp issues<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="607834307R13" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">14</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Success rate: Women should be informed that the success rate of planned VBAC is 72–75%.</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Appro 72-75% success</td><td class="s0">Appro 72-75% success<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="607834307R14" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">15</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Previous vaginal delivery: Women with one or more previous vaginal births should be informed that previous vaginal delivery, particularly previous VBAC, is the single best predictor of successful VBAC and is associated with a planned VBAC success rate of 85–90%.
