    <h1>Abortion Care</h1>
    <p>Abortion care involves providing safe, legal, and compassionate options for terminating a pregnancy. Healthcare providers should ensure informed consent, support, and follow-up care.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Abortion</h2>
    <p>There are two main types of abortion: medical and surgical. The choice depends on the gestational age and the woman's preference.</p>
    
    <h2>Medical Abortion</h2>
    <p>Medical abortion involves taking medications to end a pregnancy. It is typically used up to 10 weeks of gestation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mifepristone followed by Misoprostol is the most common regimen.</li>
        <li>Follow-up is necessary to ensure the abortion is complete.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Surgical Abortion</h2>
    <p>Surgical abortion involves a procedure to remove the pregnancy from the uterus. It can be performed at various stages of pregnancy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) is used up to 12 weeks.</li>
        <li>Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) is used after 12 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Post-Abortion Care</h2>
