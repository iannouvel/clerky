    <h1 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Appendicitis in Pregnancy</h1>
    <p><strong>Source:</strong> TOG</p>
    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Appendicitis is common in pregnancy</li>
        <li>The most common cause of an acute surgical abdomen in pregnancy</li>
        <li>Most commonly presents in the second trimester</li>
        <li>Classic presentation is of central abdominal pain that localises to the right iliac fossa. Frequently associated with fever, nausea, diarrhoea, and urinary symptoms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Imaging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the diagnosis is clear and/or the patient has abdominal pain and is haemodynamically compromised requiring laparoscopy/laparotomy, the clinician should proceed to take the patient to theatre. If the diagnosis is unclear, imaging may be helpful.</li>
        <li>Ultrasound sensitivity for diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy is 67-100% with specificity of 83-96%.</li>
        <li>CT sensitivity for diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy is 86% with specificity of 97%</li>
        <li>MRI in pregnant women with suspected appendicitis confers a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 98%. The American College of Radiology dictates that MRI should be used in cases where ultrasound is inconclusive for appendicitis in pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Management and Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Treatment is surgery</li>
        <li>Morbidity of surgery is the same as for the non-pregnant population</li>
        <li>Fetal loss in simple appendicitis is 1.5%</li>
        <li>Fetal loss in appendicitis with peritonitis is 6%</li>
        <li>Fetal loss with perforated appendix is 36%</li>
    </ul>
