    <h1>Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH)</h1>
    <p>Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) refers to bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of pregnancy and before the birth of the baby.</p>
    
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spotting:</b> Staining, streaking, or blood spotting noted on underwear or sanitary protection.</li>
        <li><b>Minor Hemorrhage:</b> Blood loss less than 50 ml that has settled.</li>
        <li><b>Major Hemorrhage:</b> Blood loss of 50â€“1000 ml, with no signs of clinical shock.</li>
        <li><b>Massive Hemorrhage:</b> Blood loss greater than 1000 ml and/or signs of clinical shock.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>APH cannot be predicted. Women should be advised, encouraged, and helped to change modifiable risk factors (such as smoking and drug misuse).</p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>It is recommended that women be advised to report all vaginal bleeding to their antenatal care provider.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Women with APH presenting to a midwifery-led maternity unit, a general practitioner, or an accident and emergency department should be assessed, stabilized if necessary, and transferred to a hospital maternity unit with facilities for resuscitation and performing emergency operative delivery.</li>
        <li>A multidisciplinary team including midwifery and obstetric staff, with immediate access to laboratory, theatre, neonatal, and anaesthetic services, should provide clinical assessment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Admission</h2>
    <p>Women presenting with spotting who are no longer bleeding and where placenta previa has been excluded can go home after a reassuring initial clinical assessment. All other cases should be admitted for further evaluation and management.</p>
