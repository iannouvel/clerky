        <h2>What tests will I have during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>At your first antenatal appointment, known as the booking appointment, your midwife will explain about the different tests and checks on offer, including the reasons they give them. This will include ultrasound scans and other screening and diagnostic tests to check your baby’s development.</p>
        <p>The same tests are offered to all pregnant women and it's your decision whether you have them.</p>
        <p>Everything the midwife offers is there to help you and your baby but you have the right to refuse any tests that you are offered. If anything worries you about any of the tests, talk to your midwife.</p>
        <h2>Routine tests in pregnancy</h2>
