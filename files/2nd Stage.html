    <h1>Second Stage of Labor</h1>
    <p>The second stage of labor begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby. This stage can be passive, where the cervix dilates without strong contractions, or active, marked by visible pushing efforts by the mother.</p>
    
    <h2>Observations During the Second Stage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mother's heart rate monitored every 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Frequency of contractions assessed half-hourly.</li>
        <li>Blood pressure measured hourly.</li>
        <li>Temperature checked every four hours.</li>
        <li>Vaginal examinations performed hourly, or more frequently if requested.</li>
        <li>Continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate, especially after contractions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Management and Support</h2>
    <p>During the active second stage, efforts should focus on encouraging the mother to follow her natural pushing instincts. Positions that facilitate easier birth, such as avoiding lying flat, should be encouraged. Perineal support and protection should be provided as per standard medical guidelines. If progress is delayed, a medical review is advised, potentially leading to an instrumental birth if necessary.</p>
    
    <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
    <p>In cases of previous severe perineal trauma, the risk of recurrence is comparable to those having their first vaginal birth. Effective pain management should be a priority, with options like regional analgesia being available. Instrumental delivery should be considered if there are signs of fetal distress or prolonged labor.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The management of the second stage of labor requires careful monitoring and appropriate interventions to ensure the safety and well-being of both the mother and the baby. Adhering to established protocols and being responsive to the laboring woman's needs are paramount.</p>
