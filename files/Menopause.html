The decision whether to take HRT, the dose and duration of its use should be made on an individualised basis after discussing the benefits and risks with each patient. This should be considered in the context of the overall benefits obtained from using HRT including symptom control and improving quality of life as well as considering the bone and cardiovascular benefits associated with HRT use. Discussions with women should also cover aspects such as when to consider stopping HRT and how this can be done (by gradually reducing the dose of HRT).

In addition, HRT has been shown to have an effective role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are considered as first-line options for most patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis due to their broad spectrum of anti-fracture efficacy. HRT may be considered as an additional alternative option, particularly in younger postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms who are at increased risk of fractures. HRT is considered as first-line intervention for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and early menopause (40–45 years old). Evidence from Cochrane database analysis suggests that HRT started before the age of 60 or within 10 years of the menopause may result in reduction in atherosclerosis progression, coronary heart disease and may lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.</td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:97px;left:-1px">Good evidence basis for improved QoL, bone and cardiovascular health</div></td><td class="s3 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:498px;left:-1px">Good evidence basis for improved QoL, bone and cardiovascular health<br></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="924863053R11" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">12</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Current evidence suggests that oestrogen alone HRT is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer than combined HRT. Breast cancer risk is duration dependent and may vary with the type of progestogen used. The risk of breast cancer should be considered in the context of the overall benefits and risks associated with HRT intake. Women with POI and early menopause (40–45 years old) should be advised that HRT is unlikely to increase risk of breast cancer in younger menopausal women under the age of 50. The meta-analysis by the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer in 2019 reported that the use of HRT in postmenopausal women younger than 50 increases the risk of breast cancer diagnosis which contradicts previous evidence and advice to date. However, the control group, of agematched postmenopausal women was inappropriate as an early menopause reduces breast cancer risk. Current recommendations are that the risk of breast cancer in relation to the years of HRT exposure in women with POI/early menopause should be counted from the average age of natural menopause (from the age 50 years).</td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:97px;left:-1px">Small increased breast Ca risk with HRT (lower with oestrogen-only)</div></td><td class="s3 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:498px;left:-1px">Small increased breast Ca risk with HRT (lower with oestrogen-only)<br></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="924863053R12" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">13</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">A history of breast cancer should be considered a contraindication to systemic HRT. The risk of breast cancer recurrence with HRT is higher in women with oestrogen receptor positive cancer, but women with oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer are also considered to have an increased risk of recurrence with HRT. HRT may, in exceptional cases, be offered to women with breast cancer with severe menopausal symptoms if lifestyle modifications and non-hormonal treatment options are not effective. This should be done after discussion with the woman, her menopause specialist and her breast/oncology team.</td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:97px;left:-1px">Hx of breast Ca = contraindication to systemic HRT even if oestrogen receptor negative (but lower)</div></td><td class="s3 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px">Hx of breast Ca = contraindication to systemic HRT even if oestrogen receptor negative (but lower)<br></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="924863053R13" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">14</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Women should be reassured that HRT is unlikely to increase the risk of dementia or to have a detrimental effect on cognitive function in women initiating HRT before the age of 65. However, HRT should not be initiated for the purpose of reducing the risk of dementia in women experiencing the menopause. National as well as international recommendations do not support the use of HRT for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. Transdermal administration of estradiol is unlikely to increase the risk of venous thrombosis or stroke above that in non-users and is associated with a lower risk compared with oral administration of estradiol. The transdermal route should therefore be considered as the first choice route of estradiol administration in women with related risk factors.</td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:97px;left:-1px">HRT not appropriate for cognition / dementia<br>Transdermal HRT shouldn&#39;t have VTE risk</div></td><td class="s3 softmerge"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:298px;left:-1px">HRT not appropriate for cognition / dementia<br>Transdermal HRT shouldn&#39;t have VTE risk<br></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="924863053R14" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">15</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">For most women, initiating HRT has a favourable benefit/risk profile.
